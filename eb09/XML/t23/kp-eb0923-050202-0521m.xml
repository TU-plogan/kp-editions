                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.). Marcus Ulpius Traianus,</hi> the fourteenth Roman
                    emperor, was a native of Italica, in Spain. The family to which he belonged was
                    probably Italian and not Iberian by blood. His father began life as a common
                    legionary soldier, and fought his way up to the consulship and the governorship
                    of Asia. He was one of the hardest fighters in Judaea under Vespasian and Titus;
                    he served too against the Parthians, and won the highest military distinction
                    open to a subject, the grant of the triumphal insignia. Thus he acquired a
                    prominent place among the brand new patricians created by the Flavians as
                    substitutes for the nobles of old descent who had succumbed to the cruelty and
                    rapacity of the emperors from Tiberius to Nero. The younger Trajan was
                    rigorously trained by his father, and deeply imbued with the same principles and
                    tastes. He was a soldier born and bred. No better representative of the true old
                    hardy Roman type, little softened either by luxury or education, had come to the
                    head of affairs since the days of Marius. The date of his birth was probably 53
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> His training was almost exclusively military, but
                    his experience as an officer gave him an acquaintance with almost every
                    important province of the empire which was of priceless value to him when he
                    came to the throne. For ten years he held a commission as military tribune,
                    which took him to many lands far asunder; then he filled important posts in
                    Syria and Spain. How much actual warfare Trajan saw in those days we can hardly
                    tell; he certainly went through some severe service under his father’s command
                    against the Parthians. By the year 89 he had achieved a considerable reputation.
                    At that time L. Antonius Saturninus headed a rebellion in Germany, which
                    threatened seriously to bring Domitian’s rule to an end. Trajan was ordered in
                    hot haste from Further Spain to the Rhine. Although he carried his troops over
                    that long and arduous march with almost unexampled rapidity, he only arrived
                    after the insurrection had been put down. But his promptitude raised him higher
                    in the favour of Domitian, and he was advanced to the consulship in 91. Of the
                    next five years of his life we know nothing positively. It is not unlikely that
                    they were spent at Rome or in Italy in the fulfilment of some official duties.
                    When the revolution of 96 came, and Nerva replaced the murdered Domitian, Trajan
                    had conferred upon him one of the most important posts in the empire, that of
                    consular legate of Upper Germany. An officer whose nature, as the event showed,
                    was interpenetrated with the spirit of legality was a fitting servant of a
                    revolution whose aim it was to substitute legality for personal caprice as the
                    dominant principle of affairs. The short reign of Nerva really did start the
                    empire on a new career, which lasted more than three quarters of a century. But
                    it also demonstrated how impossible it was for any one to govern at all who had
                    no claim, either personal or inherited, to the respect of the legions. Nerva saw
                    that if he could not find an Augustus to control the army, the army would find
                    another Domitian to trample the senate under foot. In his difficulties he took
                    counsel with L. Licinius Sura, a lifelong friend of Trajan, and in October 97 he
                    ascended the Capitol, and with all due solemnity proclaimed that he adopted
                    Trajan as his son. The senate confirmed the choice, and acknowledged the
                    emperor’s adopted son as his successor. In a letter which Nerva sent at once to
                    Trajan he quoted most significantly a line from the beginning of the Iliad,
                    where Chryses, insulted by Achilles, prays to Apollo: “May thy shafts afford me
                    vengeance on the Greeks for my tears.” After a little hesitation Trajan accepted
                    the position, which was marked by the titles of imperator, Caesar, and
                    Germanicus, and by the tribunician authority. He immediately proceeded to Lower
                    Germany, to assure himself of the fidelity of the troops in that province, and
                    while at Cologne he received news of Nerva’s death (January 98). The authority
                    of the new emperor was recognized at once all the empire over. The novel fact
                    that a master of the Romans should have been born on Spanish soil seems to have
                    passed with little remark, and this very absence of notice is significant.
                    Trajan’s first care as emperor was to write to the senate an assurance like that
                    which had been given by Nerva, that he would neither kill nor degrade any
                    senator. He ordered the establishment of a temple and cult in honour of his
                    adoptive father, but he did not present himself at Rome for nearly two years
                    after his accession. Possibly he had taken measures before Nerva’s death to
                    secure the revenge which Nerva craved, but probably did not live to see. In his
                    dealings with the mutinous praetorians the strength of the new emperor’s hand
                    was shown at once. He ordered a portion of the force to Germany. They did not
                    venture to disobey, and were distributed among the legions there. Those who
                    remained at Rome were easily overawed and reformed. It is still more surprising
                    that the soldiers should have quietly submitted to a reduction in the amount of
                    the donative or gift which it was customary for them to receive from a new
                    emperor, though the civil population of the capital were paid their largess <hi
                    rend="italic">(congi-arium)</hi> in full. By politic management Trajan was able
                    to represent the diminution as a sort of discount for immediate payment, while
                    the civilians had to wait a considerable time before their full due was handed
                    to them.</p>

                <p>The secret of Trajan’s power lay in his close personal relations with the
                    officers and men of the army and in the soldierly qualities which commanded
                    their esteem. He possessed courage, justice, and frankness to a high degree.
                    Having a good title to military distinction himself, he could afford, as the
                    unwarlike emperors could not, to be generous to his officers. The common
                    soldiers, on the other hand, were fascinated by his personal prowess and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n522/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0522-0503"/> his somewhat ostentatious camaraderie. His
                    features were firm and clearly cut; his figure was tall and soldierly, and
                    exhibited the sinewy hard health of a veteran campaigner. His hair was already
                    grey before he came to the throne, though he was not more than forty-four years
                    old. The stoutness of the emperor’s arm had been proved in the face of his men
                    in many a hard fight. When on service he used the mean fare of the common
                    private, dining on salt pork, cheese, and sour wine. Nothing pleased him better
                    than to take part with the centurion or the soldier in fencing or other military
                    exercise, and he would applaud any shrewd blow which fell upon his own helmet.
                    He loved to display his acquaintance with the career of distinguished veterans,
                    and to talk with them of their battles and their wounds. Probably he lost
                    nothing of his popularity with the army by occasional free indulgence in sensual
                    pleasures, with which, as Bacon remarks, the soldier is apt to pay himself for
                    the perils he encounters. Yet every man felt and knew that no detail of military
                    duty, however minute, escaped the emperor’s eye, and that any relaxation of
                    discipline would be rigidly punished, yet with unwavering justice. Trajan
                    emphasized at once his personal control and the constitutionality of his sway by
                    bearing on his campaigns the actual title of “proconsul,” which no other emperor
                    had done. All things considered, it is not surprising that he was able, without
                    serious opposition from the army, to remodel the whole military institutions of
                    the empire, and to bring them into a shape from which there was comparatively
                    little departure so long as the army lasted. In disciplinary matters no emperor
                    since Augustus had been able to keep so strong a control over the troops. Pliny
                    rightly praises Trajan as the lawgiver and the founder of discipline, and
                    Vegetius classes Augustus, Trajan, and Hadrian together as restorers of the
                    morale of the army. The confidence which existed between Trajan and his army
                    finds expression in some of the coins of his reign.</p>
                <p>For nearly two years after his election Trajan did not appear in Rome. He had
                    decided already what the great task of his reign should be—the establishment of
                    security upon the dangerous north-eastern frontier. Before visiting the capital
                    he determined to put affairs in train for the attainment of this great object.
                    He made a thorough inspection of the great lines of defence between the Danube
                    and the Rhine, and framed and partly carried out a vast scheme for strengthening
                    and securing them. The policy of opposing uncivilized tribes by the construction
                    of the <hi rend="italic">limes,</hi> a raised embankment of earth or other
                    material, intersected here and there by fortifications, was not his invention,
                    but it owed in great measure its development to him. It is probable that the
                    northernmost part of the great <hi rend="italic">limes Germanide,</hi> from the
                    Rhine at Rheinbrohl, nearly midway between Coblenz and Bonn, to a point on the
                    Main east of Frankfort, where that river suddenly changes its course from north
                    to west, was begun by Domitian. The extension of this great barrier southwards
                    was undertaken by Trajan, though we cannot say how far he carried the work,
                    which was not entirely completed till long after his time. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >limes</hi> leaves the Main at Miltenberg, a point at which the north and south
                    course of the river is broken by a great angle, and then follows a line
                    generally parallel to the stream of the Neckar, till it reaches Lorch, a place
                    between Stuttgart and Aalen. Here it meets the so-called <hi rend="italic">limes
                    Raetiae,</hi> which trends eastward till it cuts the Danube at Kelheim, a place
                    some distance short of Ratisbon, the ancient <hi rend="italic">Castra
                    Regina.</hi> This grand work, which would have excited the envy of Augustus, is
                    traceable in its main extent at the present day. We may without hesitation
                    follow the opinion of Mommsen, who maintains that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >limes</hi> was not intended, like Hadrian’s wall between the Tyne and the
                    Solway, and like the great wall of China, to oppose an absolute barrier against
                    incursions from the outside. It was useful as marking definitely the boundary of
                    the Roman sway, and as assuring the Romans that no inroad could be made without
                    intelligence being had of it beforehand, while the <hi rend="italic">limes</hi>
                    itself and the system of roads behind it enabled troops to be directed rapidly
                    to any threatened point, and the fortified positions could be held against large
                    numbers till reinforcements arrived. Great importance was no doubt attached to
                    the perfection of the lines of communication bearing on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >limes.</hi> Among a people of roadmakers, Trajan was one of the greatest, and
                    we have definite evidence from inscriptions that some of the military roads in
                    this region were constructed by him. The more secure control which the Romans
                    now maintained over the territory within the <hi rend="italic">limes</hi> tended
                    to its rapid civilization, and the Roman influence, if not the Roman arms, soon
                    began to affect powerfully the regions beyond.</p>
                <p>After his careful survey of the Rhine end of the great defensive barrier, Trajan
                    proceeded to consider it and plan it from the Danube. From the age of Tiberius
                    onwards the Romans possessed the whole southern bank of the river from its
                    source to the Euxine. But the precarious tenure of their possession had been
                    deeply impressed on them by the disasters and humiliations they had undergone in
                    these districts during the reign of Domitian. A prince had arisen among the
                    Dacians, Decebalus by name, worthy to be placed at the head of all the great
                    barbarian antagonists of Rome. Like Maroboduus, he was able to combine the
                    forces of tribes commonly hostile to each other, and his military ability almost
                    went the length of genius. After he had swept the province of Moesia bare, he
                    was defeated by one of Domitian’s lieutenants, but the position of affairs on
                    the Danubio-Rhenish border was still so threatening that the emperor was glad to
                    conclude a treaty which conferred extraordinary advantages on his foe. Not only
                    did the Romans stipulate to pay to Decebalus an annual subsidy, which he must
                    have regarded as a tribute, but they agreed to supply him with engineers and
                    craftsmen skilled in all kinds of construction, but particularly in the erection
                    of fortifications and defensive works. During the nine or ten years which had
                    elapsed since the conclusion of this remarkable treaty, the Dacian prince had
                    immensely strengthened the approaches to his kingdom from the Roman side. He had
                    also equipped and drilled his formidable army after the Roman fashion. It was
                    impossible for a soldier like Trajan to endure the conditions laid down by
                    Domitian; but the conquest of Dacia had become one of the most formidable tasks
                    that had ever confronted the empire. Trajan no doubt planned a war before he
                    left the Danube for Rome late in 99.</p>
                <p>The arrival of the emperor had been awaited in the capital with an impatience
                    which is expressed by Pliny and by Martial.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It has been conjectured, not improbably, that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Germania</hi> of Tacitus, written at this period, had for one of
                    its aims the enlightenment of the Romans concerning the formidable character of
                    the Germans, so that they might at once bear more readily with the emperor’s
                    prolonged absence and be prepared for the necessity of decisive action on the
                    frontier.</p></note> All that had happened since Trajan’s elevation to the
                    throne had raised high at Rome the hope of a prosperous and glorious reign. As
                    he entered the city and went on foot to the Capitol, the plaudits of the people
                    were unmistakably genuine. During his stay in the city he riveted more firmly
                    still the affections both of the senate and of the people. The reconciliation of
                    the empire with liberty, inaugurated, as Tacitus says, by Nerva, seemed now to
                    be securely achieved. Trajan was absolutely open and simple, and lived with men
                    at Rome as he had lived with his soldiers while on service. He <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n523/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0523-0504"/> realized the senate’s ideal of the citizen ruler.
                    The assurance that no senator should suffer was renewed by oath. All the old
                    republican formalities were most punctiliously observed—even those attendant on
                    the emperor’s election to the consulate, so far as they did not involve a
                    restoration of the old order of voting at the comitia. The veneration for
                    republican tradition is curiously attested by the reproduction of many
                    republican types of coin struck by senatorial officers. Trajan seized every
                    opportunity for emphasizing his view that the <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi>
                    was merely the greatest of the magistrates, and so was not above but under the
                    laws. He was determined, he said, to be to his subjects such a ruler as he had
                    desired for himself when a subject. There is a pretty story to the effect that
                    he handed the commander of the praetorians his sword, and said, “Use it for me
                    if I do well, but against me if I do ill.” Martial, who had called Domitian his
                    lord and his god, now cried, “In him we have no lord, but an imperator!” Real
                    power and influence were accorded to the senate, which had now, by the
                    incorporation of members whose origin was provincial, become in a manner
                    representative of the whole empire. Trajan associated with the senators on equal
                    terms, and enjoyed in their company every kind of recreation. All pomp was
                    distasteful to him, and discarded by him. There was practically no court, and no
                    intrigues of any kind were possible. The approach to his house was free, and he
                    loved to pass through the city unattended, and to pay unexpected visits to his
                    friends. He thirsted for no senator’s blood, and used severity against the <hi
                    rend="italic">delatores</hi> alone. There was but one insignificant conspiracy
                    against him during his whole reign. Though not literary himself, Trajan
                    conciliated the literary men, who at all times had close relations with the
                    senate. His intimate, M. Licinius, played an excellent Maecenas to his Augustus.
                    In his efforts to win the affections of Roman society, Trajan was excellently
                    aided by his wife Plotina, who was as simple as her husband, benevolent, pure in
                    character, and entirely unambitious. The hold which Trajan acquired over the
                    people was no less firm than that which he maintained upon the army and the
                    senate. His largesses, his distributions of food, his public works, and his
                    spectacles were all on a generous scale. The exhibitions in the arena were
                    perhaps at their zenith during his tenure of power. Though, for some unexplained
                    reason, he abolished the mimes, so beloved of the populace, at the outset of his
                    reign, he availed himself of the occasion of his first triumph to restore them
                    again. The people were delighted by the removal of the imperial <hi
                    rend="italic">exedra</hi> in the circus, whereby five thousand additional places
                    were provided. Taxation was in many directions reduced, and the financial
                    exactions of the imperial officers controlled by the erection of a special
                    court. Elaborate precautions were taken to save Italy from famine; it is said
                    that corn for seven years’ consumption at the capital was retained in the
                    granaries. Special encouragement was given to merchants to import articles of
                    food. The corporation of bakers was organized, and made more effective for the
                    service of the public. The internal trade of Italy was powerfully stimulated by
                    the careful maintenance and extension of the different lines of road. But the
                    most striking evidence of Trajan’s solicitude for his people’s welfare is found
                    in his institution of the <hi rend="italic">alimenta,</hi> whereby means were
                    provided for the rearing of poor and orphan children in Italy. The method had
                    been sketched out by Nerva, but its great development was due to Trajan. The
                    moneys allotted by the emperor were in many cases supplemented by private
                    benevolence. As a soldier, Trajan realized the need of men for the maintenance
                    of the empire against the outer barbarians, and he preferred that these men
                    should be of Italian birth. He was only carrying a step farther the policy of
                    Augustus, who by a system of rewards and penalties had tried to encourage
                    marriage and the nurture of children. The actual effect of Trajan’s regulations
                    is hard to measure; they were probably more effectual for their object than
                    those of Augustus. The foundations were confiscated by Pertinax,. after they had
                    existed less than a century.</p>
                <p>During the year 100, when Trajan was consul for the third time, Pliny, who had
                    been designated consul for a part of it, was appointed to deliver the
                    “Panegyric” which has come down to us, and which forms the most important source
                    of our knowledge concerning this emperor. Pliny’s eulogy of Trajan and his
                    denunciation of Domitian are alike couched in extravagant phrases, but the
                    former perhaps rests more uniformly on a basis of truth and justice than the
                    latter. The tone of the “Panegyric” certainly lends itself to the supposition of
                    some historians that Trajan was inordinately vain. That the emperor had an
                    honest and soldierly satisfaction in his own well-doing is clear; but, if he had
                    had anything like the vanity of a Domitian, the senate, ever eager to outrun a
                    ruler’s taste for flattery, would never have kept within such moderate
                    bounds.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of 100, or early in 101, Trajan left Rome for the Danube.
                    Pretexts for a Dacian war were not difficult to find. Although there was no lack
                    of hard fighting, victory in this war depended largely on the work of the
                    engineer. The great military road connecting the posts in Upper Germany with
                    those on the Danube, which had been begun by Tiberius, was now extended along
                    the right bank of the river as far as the modern Orsova. The year 101 was spent
                    mainly in road-making and fortification. In the following campaign, after
                    desperate fighting to the north of the Danube in the mountainous region of
                    Transylvania, such as Caesar never encountered in all his Gaulish wars, the
                    capital of Decebalus was taken, and he was forced to terms. He agreed to raze
                    all fortresses, to surrender all weapons, prisoners, and Roman deserters, and to
                    become a dependent prince under the suzerainty of Rome. Trajan came back to
                    Italy with Dacian envoys, who in ancient style begged the senate to confirm the
                    conditions granted by the commander in the field. The emperor now enjoyed his
                    first Dacian triumph, and assumed the title of Dacicus. At the same time he
                    royally enter tained the people, and no less royally rewarded his brave
                    officers. But the Dacian chief could not school his high spirit to endure the
                    conditions of the treaty, and Trajan soon found it necessary to prepare for
                    another war. A massive stone bridge was built across the Danube, near the modern
                    Turn Severin, by Apollodorus, the gifted architect who afterwards designed the
                    forum of Trajan. In 105 began the new struggle, which on the side of Decebalus
                    could now only lead to victory or to destruction. The Dacians fought their
                    ground inch by inch, and their army as a whole may be said to have bled to
                    death. The prince put an end to his own life. His kingdom became an imperial
                    province; in it many colonies were founded, and peopled by settlers drawn from
                    different parts of the empire. The work done by Trajan in the Danubian regions
                    left a lasting mark upon their history. The emperor returned to the capital in
                    106, laden with captured treasure. His triumph outdid in splendour all those
                    that went before it. Games are said to have been held continuously for four
                    months. Ten thousand gladiators contended in the arena, and eleven thousand
                    beasts were killed in the contests. Congratulatory embassies came from all
                    lands, even from India. The grand and enduring monument of the Dacian wars is
                    the noble pillar which still stands on the site of Trajan’s forum at Rome.</p>
                <p>The end of the Dacian wars was followed by seven years of peace. During part of
                    that time Pliny was imperial <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n524/mode/1up"

                    and in constant communication with Trajan. The correspondence is extant, and
                    gives us the means of observing the principles and tendencies of the emperor as
                    a civil governor.</p>
                <p>The provinces (hitherto senatorial) were in considerable disorder, which Pliny
                    was sent to cure. It is clear from the emperor’s letters that in regard to nine
                    out of ten of the matters which his anxious and deferential legate referred to
                    him for his decision he would have been better pleased if the legate had decided
                    them for himself. Trajan’s notions of civil government were, like those of the
                    duke of Wellington, strongly tinged with military prepossessions. He regarded
                    the provincial ruler as a kind of officer in command, who ought to be able to
                    discipline his province for himself, and only to appeal to the
                    commander-in-chief in a difficult case. In advising Pliny about the different
                    free communities in the provinces, Trajan showed the same regard for traditional
                    rights and privileges which he had exhibited in face of the senate at Rome. At
                    the same time, these letters bring home to us his conviction that, particularly
                    in financial affairs, it was necessary that local self-government should be
                    carried on under the vigilant supervision of imperial officers. The control
                    which he began in this way to exercise, both in Italy and in the provinces, over
                    the “municipia” and “liberae civitates,” by means of agents entitled (then or
                    later) “correctores civitatium liberarum,’’ was carried continually farther and
                    farther by his successors, and at last ended in the complete centralization of
                    the government. On this account the reign of Trajan constitutes a turning point
                    in civil as in military history. In other directions, though we find many
                    salutary civil measures, yet there were no far-reaching schemes of reform. Many
                    details in the administration of the law, and particularly of the criminal law,
                    were improved. To cure corruption in the senate the ballot was introduced at
                    elections to magistracies. The finances of the state were economically managed,
                    and taxpayers were most carefully guarded from oppression. Trajan never lacked
                    money to expend on great works of public utility; as a builder, he may fairly be
                    compared with Augustus. His forum and its numerous appendages were constructed
                    on a magnificent scale. Many regions of Italy and the provinces besides the city
                    itself benefited by the care and munificence which the emperor bestowed on such
                    public improvements. His attitude towards religion was, like that of Augustus,
                    moderate and conservative. The famous letter to Pliny about the Christians is,
                    according to Roman ideas, merciful and considerate. It was impossible, however,
                    for a Roman magistrate of the time to rid himself of the idea that all forms of
                    religion must do homage to the civil power. Hence the conflict which made Trajan
                    appear in the eyes of Christians like Tertullian the most infamous of monsters.
                    On the whole, Trajan’s civil administration was sound, careful, and sensible,
                    rather than brilliant or epoch-making.</p>
                <p>In 113 or 114 Trajan left Italy to make war in the East. The never-ending
                    Parthian problem confronted him, and with it were more or less connected a
                    number of minor difficulties. Already by 106 the position of Rome in the East
                    had been materially improved by the peaceful annexation of districts bordering
                    on the province of Syria. The district of Damascus, hitherto a dependency, and
                    the last remaining fragment of the Jewish kingdom, were incorporated with Syria;
                    Bostra and Petra were permanently occupied, and a great portion of the
                    Nabathaean kingdom was constituted the Roman province of Arabia. Rome thus
                    obtained mastery of the most important positions lying on the great trade routes
                    from East to West. These changes could not but affect the relations of the Roman
                    with the Parthian empire, and the affairs of Armenia became in 114 the occasion
                    of a war which has been described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol.
                    xviii. p. 603. Trajan’s campaigns in the East ended in complete though brilliant
                    failure. In the retreat from Ctesiphon (117) the old emperor tasted for almost
                    the first time the bitterness of defeat in the field. He attacked the desert
                    city of Hatra, westward of the Tigris, whose importance is still attested by
                    grand ruins. The want of water made it impossible to maintain a large force near
                    the city, and the brave Arabs routed the Roman cavalry. Trajan, who narrowly
                    escaped being killed, was forced to withdraw. A more alarming difficulty lay
                    before him. Taking advantage of the absence of the emperor in the far East, and
                    possibly by an understanding with the leaders of the rising in Armenia and the
                    annexed portions of Parthia, the Jews all over the East bad taken up arms at the
                    same moment, and at a given signal. The massacres they committed were
                    portentous. In Cyprus 240,000 men are said to have been put to death, and at
                    Cyrene 220,000. At Alexandria, on the other hand, many Jews were killed. The
                    Romans punished massacre by massacre, and the complete suppression of the
                    insurrection was long delayed, but the Jews made no great stand against
                    disciplined troops. Trajan still thought of returning to Mesopotamia, and of
                    avenging his defeat at Hatra, but he was stricken with sickness and compelled to
                    take ship for Italy. His illness increasing, he landed in Cilicia, and died at
                    Selinus in that country about the end of July 117. Trajan, who had no children,
                    had continually delayed to settle the succession to the throne, though Pliny in
                    the “Panegyric” had pointedly drawn his attention to the matter, and it must
                    have caused the senate much anxiety. Whether Hadrian, the cousin of Trajan, was
                    actually adopted by him or not is impossible to determine; certainly Hadrian had
                    not been advanced to any great honours by Trajan. Even his military service had
                    not been distinguished. Plotina asserted the adoption, and it was readily and
                    most fortunately accepted, if not believed, as a fact.</p>
                <p>The senate had decreed to Trajan as many triumphs as he chose to celebrate. For
                    the first time a dead general triumphed. When Trajan was deified, he
                    appropriately retained, alone among the emperors, a title he had won for himself
                    in the field, that of “Parthicus.” He was a patient organizer of victory rather
                    than a strategic genius. He laboriously perfected the military machine, which
                    when once set in motion went on to victory. Much of the work he did was great
                    and enduring, but the last year of his life forbade the Romans to attribute to
                    him that <hi rend="italic">felicitas</hi> which they regarded as an inborn
                    quality of the highest generals. Each succeeding emperor was saluted with the
                    wish that he might be “better than Trajan and more fortunate than Augustus.” Yet
                    the breach made in Trajan’s <hi rend="italic">felicitas</hi> by the failure in
                    the East was no greater than that made in the <hi rend="italic">felicitas</hi>
                    of Augustus by his retirement from the right bank of the Rhine. The question
                    whether Trajan’s Oriental policy was wise is answered emphatically by Mommsen in
                    the affirmative. It was certainly wise if the means existed which were necessary
                    to carry it out and sustain it. But succeeding history proved that those means
                    did not exist. The assertion of Mommsen that the Tigris was a more defensible
                    frontier than the desert line which separated the Parthian from the Roman empire
                    can hardly be accepted. The change would certainly have created a demand for
                    more legions, which the resources of the Romans were not sufficient to meet
                    without danger to their possessions on other frontiers.</p>
                <p>The records of Trajan’s reign are miserably deficient. Our best authority is the
                    68th book of Dio Cassius; then comes the “Panegyric” of Pliny, with his
                    correspondence. The facts to be gathered from other ancient writers are
                    scattered and scanty. Fortunately the inscriptions of the time are abundant and
                    important. Of modern histories which comprise the reign of Trajan the best in
                    English is that of Merivale; but that in German by H. Schiller <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Geschichte der römischcn Kaiserzeit,</hi> Gotha, 1883) is more on a level with
                    recent inquiries. There are special works on Trajan by H. Francke (Güstrow,
                    1837), De la Berge (Paris, 1877), and Dierauer (in M. Büdinger’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Untersuchungen zur römischcn Kaisergeschichte,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1868). A paper by Mommsen in <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> iii. pp. 30 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> entitled “Zur Lebensgeschichte des jüngeren Plinius,” is
                    important for the chronology of Trajan’s reign. (J. S. R.)</p>
