                    Soon, however, he attached himself to the school of the great exegete and
                    ascetic, Diodorus, a presbyter in Antioch, and, with only a transitory period of
                    vacillation, he ever afterwards remained faithful to the theology and ascetic
                    discipline of this master. Under Diodorus he became a skilful exegete, and
                    ultimately the pupil outstripped the master in Biblical learning. About 383
                    Theodore became a presbyter in Antioch, and began to write against Eunomius the
                    Arian and against the christology of Apollinaris. Soon after 392 he became
                    bishop of Mopsuestia in Cilicia (the modern Missis near Adana). As such he was
                    held in great respect, and took part in several synods, with a reputation for
                    orthodoxy that was never questioned. It was greatly to his advantage that in the
                    Eastern Church the period between the years 390 and 428 was one of comparative
                    repose. He was on friendly terms even with Cyril of Alexandria. He died in 428
                    or 429, towards the beginning of the Nestorian controversy.</p>
                <p>Theodore was a very prolific writer, but, before all, an exegete. He wrote
                    commentaries on almost every book of the Old and New Testaments, of which,
                    however, only a small proportion is now <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0272-0255"/> extant, as at a later period he lost credit in
                    the church. We still possess in Greek his commentary on the Minor Prophets, and
                    in Latin translations commentaries on the minor Pauline epistles, besides very
                    many fragments, especially of that on the epistle to the Romans. Theodore’s
                    importance as an exegete lies in two characteristics:—(1) in opposition to the
                    allegorical method he insists on getting at the literal meaning, and adheres to
                    it when found; (2) in his interpretation of the Scriptures he takes into account
                    the historical circumstances in which they were produced, and substitutes the
                    historical-typological for the pneumatico-christological interpretation of
                    prophecy; in other words, he interprets all Old Testament passages historically
                    in the first instance, and sees the fulfilment of Old Testament prophecy in the
                    history of Christ and His church only in so far as the entire Old Testament is a
                    “shadow of things to come.” Following his master Diodorus, who had already
                    written a treatise Tís <hi rend="italic">διαφορά</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >θεωριas</hi><hi rend="italic">καί</hi><hi rend="italic">ahληyoριas,</hi>
                    Theodore also was the author of a special dissertation against the allegorists,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> against Origen and his followers, which, however,
                    has unfortunately perished. The comparative freedom of Theodore’s view of
                    inspiration is also noteworthy. He discriminates between historical,
                    prophetical, and didactic writings, and in accordance with this distinction
                    assumes varying degrees of inspiration. Finally, he entertained very bold
                    opinions about the canon and several of the books included in it He esteemed
                    very lightly the Solomonic writings and the book of Job; Canticles he explained
                    as a nuptial poem of Solomon’s; the book of Job appeared to him in many places
                    hardly worthy of its subject, and he censures the writer sharply; Chronicles,
                    Ezra, and Nehemiah he entirely rejected; he denied the accuracy of the titles of
                    the Psalms, and referred the so-called Messianic element almost invariably to
                    the kings of Israel; he even criticized the catholic epistles and rejected the
                    epistle of James. His commentaries contain a great deal of learned matter, and
                    his grammatico-historical observations are still to some extent useful. But, on
                    the other hand, his learning must not be overestimated. It falls behind that of
                    Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, notwithstanding the superiority of his method. It
                    is specially noticeable that Theodore troubled himself little about textual
                    criticism. He simply accepts the text of the LXX. as that of revelation, and
                    never manifests the slightest effort to control it by the original or by the
                    Syriac.</p>
                <p>But in addition to his commentaries Theodore also wrote extensive
                    dogmatico-polemical works, which were destined to operate long after his death
                    disastrously for his fame. As a disciple of Diodorus, Theodore accepted the
                    Nicene teaching on the doctrine of the Trinity, but at the same time in
                    christology took up a position very closely approaching that of Paul of
                    Samosata. The violence of his opposition to his fellow countryman, Apollinaris
                    of Laôdicea, perhaps the most acute and far-seeing theologian of the century,
                    made it necessary for Theodore to formulate his christology with precision (in
                    fifteen books on the Incarnation—all lost except a few fragments—and in special
                    treatises against Apollinaris). He held the Logos to have assumed a complete
                    manhood, which had to pass through the stages of ethical development just as in
                    the case of any other human being. In this the Logos only sup[&gt;orted the man
                    Christ Jesus, but was not essentially connected with him; the Logos dwelt in him
                    <hi rend="italic">(ενοικεΐν),</hi> but any such thing as <hi rend="italic"
                    >εvωσιs</hi><hi rend="italic">φυσική</hi> did not and could not exist, because
                    the finite is not “capax infiniti,” and because any <hi rend="italic"
                    >εvωσιs</hi> would have destroyed the reality of the human nature. The same
                    sober and thoughtful way of looking at things, and the same tendency to give
                    prominence to the moral element, which characterize the commentaries of Theodore
                    appear also in his dogmatic. When, accordingly, the Nestorian controversy broke
                    out, his works also were dragged into the discussion. At Ephesus, indeed, the
                    memory of Theodore does not appear to have been attacked,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A confession, however, drawn up by him was
                    spoken of; see Hahn, <hi rend="italic">Biblioth.</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Symbole,</hi> 2d ed., p. 229 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p></note> but soon
                    afterwards the assault began. Marius Mercator, Rabulas of Edessa, Cyril, and
                    other monophysites brought the charge of heresy against his writings, and sought
                    to counteract their influence. But it was not until more than a century
                    afterwards that his fanatical adversaries succeeded—in spite of the strong
                    opposition of the best theologians of the West—in obtaining from Justinian the
                    condemnation of his works in the controversy of the Tria Capitula, as it is
                    called; this act of the emperor was confirmed by the fifth aecumenical council,
                    and Theodore’s name was accordingly deleted from the list of orthodox writers.
                    From that day Theodore’s works ceased to be read within the Byzantine Church,
                    and hence have been lost. The Syrians, on the other hand, have always held in
                    high esteem the memory of the great teacher, and have even carried back their
                    liturgy to his name. The Nestorians possess, or possessed, a very large number
                    of writings by him in Syriac translations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Theodore took part also in the Pelagian controversy at the time when it raged in

                    sin and Jerome its advocate. In his view the theory of Augustine is “a new
                    heresy,” “a malady”; he regarded it as a doctrine which necessarily led to
                    dualism and Manichaeism. The attitude thus taken by Theodore is not surprising;
                    he more nearly takes up the ground of the old church doctrine as set forth in
                    the apologists and in the great Greek fathers of the 3d and 4th centuries. The
                    Pelagians driven from the East were received by him in Cilicia.</p>
