                    which a savage regards with superstitious respect, believing that there exists
                    between him and every member of the class an intimate and altogether special
                    relation. The name is derived from an Ojibway (Chippeway) word which was first
                    introduced into literature, so far as appears, by J. Long, an Indian interpreter
                    of last century, who spelt it <hi rend="italic">toiarn.</hi><note

                    Travels of an Indian Interpreter,</hi> p. 86, 1791.</p></note> The connexion
                    between a man and his totem is mutually beneficent: the totem protects the man,
                    and the man shows his respect for the totem in various ways, by not killing it
                    if it be an animal, and not cutting or gathering it if it be a plant. As
                    distinguished from a fetich, a totem is never an isolated individual, but always
                    a class of objects, generally a species of animals or of plants, more rarely a
                    class of inanimate natural objects, very rarely a class of artificial
                    objects.</p>
                <p>Considered in relation to men, totems are of at least three kinds :—(1) the clan
                    totem, common to a whole clan, and passing by inheritance from generation to
                    generation; (2) the sex totem, common either to all the males or to all the
                    females of a tribe, to the exclusion in either case of the other sex; (3) the
                    individual totem, belonging to a single individual and not passing to his
                    descendants. Other kinds of totems exist and will be noticed, but they may
                    perhaps be regarded as varieties of the clan totem. The latter is by far the
                    most important of all; and where we speak of totems or totemism without
                    qualification the reference is always to the clan totem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Clan Totem.—</hi> The clan totem is reverenced by a body of
                    men and women who call themselves by the name of the totem, believe themselves
                    to be of one blood, descendants of a common ancestor, and are bound together by
                    common obligations to each other and by a common faith in the totem. Totemism is
                    thus both a religious and a social system. In its religious aspect it consists
                    of the relations of mutual respect and protection between a man and his totem;
                    in its social aspect it consists of the relations of the clansmen to each other
                    and to men of other clans. In the later history of totemism these two sides, the
                    religious and the social, tend to part company; the social system sometimes
                    survives the religious; and, on the other hand, religion sometimes bears traces
                    of totemism in countries where the social system based on totemism has
                    disappeared. We begin with the religious side.</p>

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The members of a totem clan call themselves by the name of
                    their totem, and commonly believe themselves to be actually descended from
                    it.</p>
                <p>Thus the Turtle clan of the Iroquois are descended from a fat turtle, which,
                    burdened by the weight of its shell in walking, contrived by great exertions to
                    throw it off, and thereafter gradually developed into a man. <note

                    lived underground, coming up occasionally through the mud to the surface. Once a
                    party of Choctaws smoked them out, and, treating them kindly, taught them the
                    Choctaw language, taught them to walk on two legs, made them cut off their toe
                    nails and pluck the hair from their bodies, after which they adopted them into
                    the tribe. But the rest of their kindred, the cray-fish, are still living
                    underground. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Catlin,

                <p>Somewhat different are the myths in which a human ancestress is said to have
                    given birth to an animal of the totem species. Thus the Snake clan among the
                    Moquis of Arizona are descended from a woman who gave birth to snakes. <note

                    western equatorial Africa believe that their women once gave birth to the totem
                    animals; one woman brought forth a calf, others a crocodile, hippopotamus,
                    monkey, boa, and wild pig. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Believing himself to be descended from, and therefore akin to, his totem, the
                    savage naturally treats it with respect. If it is an animal he will not, as a
                    rule, kill nor eat it. In the Mount Gambier tribe (South Australia) “a man does
                    not kill or use as food any of the animals of the same subdivision with himself,
                    excepting when hunger compels; and then they express sorrow for having to eat
                    their <hi rend="italic">wingong</hi> (friends) or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tumanang</hi> (their flesh). When using the last word they touch their breasts,
                    to indicate the close relationship, meaning almost a part of themselves.</p>
                <p>To illustrate :—One day one of the blacks killed a crow. Three or four days
                    afterwards a Boortwa (crow) named Larry died. He had been ailing for some days,
                    but the killing of his <hi rend="italic">wvngοng</hi> hastened his death. <note

                    say, “What for you kill that fellow? that my father !” or “That brother
                    belonging to me you have killed; why did you do it ?” <note anchored="true"

                    and never without affording it a chance to escape. This arises from the family
                    belief that some one individual of the species is their nearest friend, to kill
                    whom would be a great crime, and to be carefully avoided.” <note anchored="true"

                    do it, he will hide his face for shame, and afterwards demand compensation for
                    the act. Whenever one of these Indians exhibits his totem badge (as by painting
                    it on his forehead), all persons of the same totem are bound to do honour to it
                    by casting property before it. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    is that they are not whole animals, but parts of animals, as the head of a
                    tortoise, the stomach of a pig. In such cases (which are not confined to Bengal)
                    it is of course not the whole animal, but only the special part, that the
                    clansmen are forbidden to eat. Such totems may be distinguished as <hi
                    rend="italic">split totems.</hi> The Jagannáthi Kumhár in Bengal abstain from
                    killing or injuring the totems of their respective clans, and they bow to their

                <p>When the totem is a plant the rules are such as these. A native of western
                    Australia, whose totem is a vegetable, “may not gather it under certain
                    circumstances and at a particular period of the year.” <note anchored="true"

                <p>The rules not to kill or eat the totem are not the only taboos; the clansmen are

                    it.</p>

                    They even avoid, at least in some cases, to look at the totem. Thus to a man of
                    the Bakuena (Bakwain) or Crocodile clan, it is “hateful and unlucky” to meet or
                    gaze on a crocodile; the sight is thought to cause inflammation of the eyes.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the totem animal is fed or even kept alive in captivity. Among the

                    then be wrapped up and buried with as much ceremony as if it had been a human
                    being. “This, however, was not the death of the god. He was supposed to be yet

                <p>As some totem clans avoid looking at their totem, so others are careful not to
                    speak of it by its proper name, but use descriptive epithets instead. The three

                    to the bird’s habit of swallowing its food; and the clans called themselves, not
                    Wolves, Turtles, and Turkeys, but “Round Feet,” “Crawlers,” and “Those who do

                <p>The Samoans thought it death to injure or eat their totems. The totem was
                    supposed to take up his abode in the sinner’s body, and there to gender the very
                    thing which he had eaten till it caused his death. <note anchored="true"

                <p>Thus if a Turtle man ate of a turtle he grew very ill, and the voice of the

                    the angry totem. The offender himself or one of his clan was wrapped in leaves
                    and laid in an unheated oven, as if he were about to be baked. Thus if amongst
                    the Cuttle-Fish clan a visitor had caught a cuttle-fish and cooked it, or if a
                    CuttleFish man had been present at the eating of a cuttle-fish, the CuttleFish
                    clan met and chose a man or woman who went through the pretence of being baked.
                    Otherwise a cuttle-fish would grow in the stomach of some of the clan and be
                    their death. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Turner,

                    strictest and most extensive at puberty, and gradually relaxing with advancing
                    years. Thus young men are forbidden to eat the emu; if they ate it, it is
                    thought that they would be afflicted with sores all over their bodies. <note

                <p>The relation between a man and his totem is one of mutual help and protection. If

                    same by him. In Senegambia the totems, when they are dangerous animals, will not

                <p>Other totem clans regard a man who has been bitten by the totem, even though he
                    survives, as disowned by the totem, and therefore they expel him from the clan.
                    Among the Crocodile clan of the Bechuanas, if a man has been bitten by a
                    crocodile, or merely had water splashed over him by a crocodile’s tail, he is
                    expelled the clan. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>But it is not enough that the totem should merely abstain from injuring, he must
                    positively benefit the men who put their faith in him. The Snake clan
                    (Ophiogenes) of Asia Minor believed that if they were bitten by an adder they
                    had only to put a snake to the wound and their totem would suck out the poison
                    and soothe away the inflammation and the pain. <note anchored="true"

                <p>Again, the totem gives his clansmen important information by means of omens. In
                    the Coast Murring tribe of New South Wales each man’s totem warned him of coming
                    danger; if his totem was a kangaroo, a kangaroo would warn him against his foes.

                <p>Thus, in harvest time, when the birds eat the corn, the Small Bird clan of the
                    Omahas take some corn which they chew and spit over the field. This is thought
                    to keep the birds from the crops. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    some of them and pound them up with some grains of com which have been heated.
                    They make a soup of the mixture and eat it, believing that the corn will not be

                <p>In order, apparently, to put himself more fully under the protection of the
                    totem, the clansman is in the habit of assimilating himself to the totem by
                    dressing in the skin or other part of the totem animal, arranging his hair and
                    mutilating his body so as to resemble the totem, and representing it on his body

                <p>Among the Thlinkets on solemn occasions, such as dances, memorial festivals, and

                    communicate with persons speaking different languages, and thus ascertain
                    whether they belonged to clans with which marriage was allowed. The totem clans
                    of the Bechuanas have each its special dance or pantomime, and when they wish to

                    particular species, and beat his son with it till the bird was dead and its head
                    crushed, thus transferring the life and spirit of the martial bird to the future

                    Amongst some Australian tribes the youth at initiation is smeared with blood
                    drawn from the arms either of aged men or of all the men present, and he even
                    receives the blood to drink. Amongst some tribes on the Darling this tribal
                    blood is his only food for two days. Among some tribes the youths at initiation
                    sleep on the graves of their ancestors, in order to absorb their virtues. <note

                    wolf skins and run about on all fours, howling and mimicking wolves; at last
                    they scratched up a living clansman, who had been buried on purpose, and,
                    putting a bow and arrows in his hands, bade him do as the wolves do—rob, kill,
                    and murder. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    have been an initiatory ceremony, revealing to the novice in pantomime the
                    double origin of the clan—from wolves and from the ground. For it is a common
                    belief with totem clans that they issued originally from the ground.</p>
                <p>Connected with this mimic death and revival of a clansman appear to be the real
                    death and supposed revival of the totem itself. We have seen that some
                    Californian Indians killed the buzzard, and then buried and mourned over it like
                    a clansman. But it was believed that, as often as the bird was killed, it was
                    made alive again. Much the same idea appears in a Zuni ceremony described by an
                    eyewitness, Mr Cushing. He tells how a procession of fifty men set off for the
                    spirit-land, or (as the Zunis call it) “the home of our others,” and returned
                    after four days, each man bearing a basket full of living, squirming turtles.
                    One turtle was brought to the house where Mr Cushing was staying, and it was
                    welcomed with divine honours. It was addressed as, “Ah! my poor dear lost child
                    or parent, my sister or brother to have been! Who knows which? May be my own
                    great great grandfather or mother ?” Nevertheless, next day it was killed and
                    its flesh and bones deposited in the river, that it might “return once more to
                    eternal life among its comrades in the dark waters of the lake of the dead.” The
                    idea that the turtle was dead was repudiated with passionate sorrow; it had
                    only, they said, “changed houses and gone to live for ever in the home of ‘ our
                    lost others.’” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr

                    >Sex Totems.—</hi> In Australia (but, so far as is known at present, nowhere
                    else) each of the sexes has, at least in some tribes, its special sacred animal,
                    whose name each individual of the sex bears, regarding the animal as his or her
                    brother or sister respectively, not killing it nor suffering the opposite sex to
                    kill it. These sacred animals therefore answer strictly to the definition of
                    totems.</p>
                <p>Thus amougst the Kurnai all the men were called Yeerung (Emu-Wren) and all the
                    women Djeetgun (Superb Warbler). The birds called Yeerung were the “brothers” of
                    the men, and the birds called Djeetgun were the women’s “sisters.” If the men
                    killed an emu-wren they were attacked by the women, if the women killed a superb
                    warbler they were assailed by the men. Yeerung and Djeetgun were the mythical
                    ancestors of the Kurnai. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The Kulin tribe in Victoria, in addition to sixteen clan totems, has two pairs of
                    sex totems: one pair (the emu-wren and superb warbler) is identical with the
                    Kurnai pair; the other pair is the bat (male totem) and the small night jar
                    (female totem). The latter pair extends to the extreme north-western confines of
                    Victoria as the “man’s brother” and the “woman’s sister.” <note anchored="true"

                    in New South Wales, in addition to regular clan totems, has a pair of sex
                    totems, the bat for men and a small owl for women; men and women address each
                    other as Owls and Bats; and there is a fight if a woman kills a bat or a man
                    kills a small owl. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    even to the half killing of their wives for its sake. The fern owl, or large
                    goatsucker, belongs to the women, and, although a bird of evil omen, creating
                    terror at night by its cry, it is jealously protected by them. If a man kills
                    one, they are as much enraged as if it was one of their children, and will
                    strike him with their long poles.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The sex totem seems to be still more sacred than the clan totem; for men who do
                    not object to other people killing their clan totem will fiercely defend their

                    not only the clans and the sexes that have totems; individuals also have their
                    own special totems, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> classes of objects (generally
                    species of animals), which they regard as related to themselves by those ties of
                    mutual respect and protection which are characteristic of totemism. This
                    relationship, however, in the case of the individual totem, begins and ends with
                    the individual man, and is not, like the clan totem, transmitted by inheritance.
                    The evidence for the existence of individual totems in Australia, though
                    conclusive, is very scanty. In North America it is abundant.</p>
                <p>In Australia we hear of a medicine-man whose clan totem through his mother was
                    kangaroo, but whose “secret” (ι.e., individual) totem was the tiger-snake.
                    Snakes of that species, therefore, would not hurt him. <note anchored="true"

                    50.</p></note> An Australian seems usually to get his individual totem by
                    dreaming that he has been transformed into an animal of the species. Thus a man
                    dreamed three times he was a kangaroo; hence he became one of the kangaroo
                    kindred, and might not eat any part of a kangaroo on which there was blood; he
                    might not even carry home one on which there was blood. He might eat cooked
                    kangaroo; but, if he were to eat the meat with the blood on it, the spirits
                    would no longer take him up aloft <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In America the individual totem is usually the first animal of which a youth
                    dreams during the long and generally solitary fasts which American Indians
                    observe at puberty. He kills the animal or bird of which he dreams, and
                    henceforward wears its skin or feathers, or some part of them, as an amulet,
                    especially on the war-path and in hunting. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    may even (though this'seems exceptional) acquire several totems in this way;
                    thus an Ottawa medicine-man had for his individual totems the tortoise, swan,
                    woodpecker, and crow, because he had dreamed of them all in his fast at puberty.
                    The respect paid to the individual totem varies in different tribes. Among the
                    Slave, Hare, and Dogrib Indians a man may not eat, skin, nor if possible kill
                    his individual totem, which in these tribes is said to be always a carnivorous
                    animal. Each man carries with him a picture of his totem (bought of a trader);
                    when he is unsuccessful in the chase, he pulls out the picture, smokes to it,
                    and makes it a speech. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    manitoos, but did not pay so much heed to them as did the men. They tattooed

                    was then set to it, and thus the figure of the totem was burned into the flesh.

                    be confined, the relations assembled in the hut and drew on the floor figures of
                    different animals, rubbing each one out as soon as it was finished. This went on
                    till the child was born, and the figure that then remained sketched on the
                    ground was the child’s <hi rend="italic">tona</hi> or totem. When he grew older
                    the child procured his totem animal and took care of it, believing that his life
                    was bound up with the animal’s, and that when it died he too must die. <note

                    Similarly in Samoa, at child-birth the help of several “gods” was invoked in
                    succession, and the one who happened to be addressed at the moment of the birth
                    was the infant’s totem. These “gods” were dogs, eels, sharks, lizards, &amp;c. A
                    Samoan had no objection to eat another man’s “god”; but to eat his own would
                    have been death or injury to him. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Besides the clan totem, sex totem, and individual totem, there are (as has been
                    indicated) some other kinds or varieties of totems; but the consideration of
                    them had better be deferred till after the consideration of the social
                    organization based on totemism.</p>

                    totem to each other and to men of other totems.—</hi> (1) All the members of a
                    totem clan regard each other as kinsmen or brothers and sisters, and are bound
                    to help and protect each other. The totem bond is stronger than the bond of
                    blood or family in the modern sense. This is expressly stated of the clans of
                    western Australia and of north-western America, <note anchored="true"

                    to the superiority of the totem bond over the tribal bond (Morgan, <hi

                    full force. Hence in totem tribes every local group, being necessarily composed
                    (owing to exogamy) of members of at least two totem clans, is liable to be
                    dissolved at any moment into its totem elements by the outbreak of a blood feud,
                    in which husband and wife must always (if the feud is between their clans) be
                    arrayed on opposite sides, and in which the children will be arrayed against
                    either their father or their mother, according as descent is traced through the
                    mother or through the father. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    solidarity carried farther than among the Goajiros in Colombia, South America.
                    The Goajiros are divided into some twenty to thirty totem clans, with descent in
                    the female line; and amongst them, if a man happens to cut himself with his own
                    knife, to fall off his horse, or to injure himself in any way, his family on the
                    mother’s side immediately demand payment as blood-money from him. “Being of
                    their blood, he is not allowed to spill it without paying for it.” His father’s
                    family also demands compensation, but not so much. <note anchored="true"

                    have sexual intercourse with each other. The Navajos believe that if they
                    married within the clan “their bones would dry up and they would die.” <note

                    for infringing this fundamental law is not merely natural; the clan steps in and
                    punishes the offenders. In Australia the regular penalty for sexual intercourse
                    with a person of a forbidden clan is death.</p>
                <p>It matters not whether the woman he of the same local group or has been captured
                    in war from another tribe; a man of the wrong clan who uses her as his wife is
                    hunted down and killed by his clansmen, and so is the woman; though in some
                    cases, if they succeed in eluding capture for a certain time, the offence may be
                    condoned. In the Ta-ta-thi tribe, New South Wales, in the rare cases which
                    occur, the man is killed but the woman is only beaten or speared, or both, till
                    she is nearly dead; the reason given for not actually killing her being that she
                    was probably coerced. Even in casual amours the clan prohibitions are strictly
                    observed; any violations of these prohibitions “are regarded with the utmost
                    abhorrence and are punished by death.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    said that though persons of the same clan never marry, yet “they do not seem to

                    intercourse they are perfectly free, and incest of every grade continually

                <p>In America the Algonkins consider it highly criminal for a man to marry a woman
                    of the same totem as himself, and they tell of cases where men, for breaking
                    this rule, have been put to death by their nearest relations. <note

                    prohibition includes several clans, in none of which is a man allowed to marry.
                    For such an exogamous group of clans within the tribe it is convenient to have a
                    name; we shall therefore call it a phratry (L. H. Morgan), defining it as an
                    exogamous division intermediate between the tribe and the clan. The evidence
                    goes to show that in many cases it was originally a totem clan which has
                    undergone subdivision.</p>
                <p>The Choctaws, for example, were divided into two phratries, each of which
                    included four clans; marriage was prohibited between members of the same
                    phratry, but members of either phratry could marry into any clan of the other.

                    tribe of the Iroquois was divided into two phratries, each including four
                    clans,—the Bear, Wolf, Beaver, and Turtle clans forming one phratry, and the
                    Deer, Snipe, Heron, and Hawk clans forming the other. Originally, as among the
                    Choctaws, marriage was prohibited within the phratry but was permitted with any
                    of the clans of the other phratry; the prohibition, however, has now broken
                    down, and a Seneca may marry a woman of any clan but his own. Hence phratries,
                    in our sense, no longer exist among the Senecas, though the organization
                    survives for certain religious and social purposes. <note anchored="true"

                <p>The phratries of the Thlinkets and the Mohegans deserve especial attention,
                    because each phratry bears a name which is also the name of one of the clans
                    included in it. The Thlinkets are divided as follows :—Raven phratry, with clans
                    Raven, Frog, Goose, Sea-Lion, Owl, Salmon; Wolf phratry, with clans Wolf, Bear,
                    Eagle, Whale, Shark, Auk. Members of the Raven phratry must marry members of the
                    Wolf phratry, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi><note anchored="true"

                    mythology by the ancestors of the two phratries, and considering that the names
                    of the phratries are also names of clans, it seems probable that the Raven and
                    Wolf were the two original clans of the Thlinkets, which afterwards by
                    subdivision became phratries. This was the opinion of the Russian missionary
                    Veniaminoff, the best early authority on the tribe. <note anchored="true"

                    p.166.</p></note> Still more clearly do the Mohegan phratries appear to have
                    been formed by subdivision from clans. They are as follows: <note

                    Great Turtle, Yellow Eel; Turkey phratry, with clans Turkey, Crane, Chicken.
                    Here we are almost forced to conclude that the Turtle phratry was originally a
                    Turtle clan which subdivided into a number of clans, each of which took the name
                    of a particular kind of turtle, while the Yellow Eel clan may have been a later
                    subdivision. Thus we get a probable explanation of the origin of split totems;
                    they seem to have arisen by the segmentation of a single original clan, which
                    had a whole animal for its totem, into a number of clans, each of which took the
                    name either of a part of the original animal or of a subspecies of it. We may
                    conjecture that this was the origin of the Grey Wolf and Yellow Wolf and Great

                <p>Iu Australia the phratries are still more important than in America. Messrs
                    Howitt and Fison, who have done so much to advance our knowledge of the social
                    system of the Australian aborigines, have given to these exogamous divisions the
                    name of classes; but the term is objectionable, because it fails to convey (1)
                    that these divisions are kinship divisions, and (2) that they are intermediate
                    divisions; whereas the Greek term phratry conveys both these meanings, and is
                    therefore appropriate.</p>
                <p>We have seen examples of Australian tribes in which members of any clan are free
                    to marry members of any clan but their own; but such tribes appear to be
                    exceptional. Often an Australian tribe is divided into two (exogamous)
                    phratries, each of which includes under it a number of totem clans; and oftener
                    still there are sub-phratries interposed between the phratry and the clans, each
                    phratry including two subphratries, and the sub-phratries including totem clans.
                    We will take examples of the former and simpler organization first.</p>
                <p>The Turra tribe in Yorke Peninsula, South Australia, is divided into two
                    phratries, Wiltû (Eaglehawk) and Mülta (Seal). The Eaglehawk phratry includes
                    ten totem clans (Wombat, Wallaby, Kangaroo, Iguana, Wombat-Snake, Bandicoot,
                    Black Bandicoot, Crow, Rock Wallaby, and Emu); and the Seal phratry includes six
                    (Wild Goose, Butterfish, Mullet, Schnapper, Shark, and Salmon). The phratries
                    are of course exogamous, but (as with the Choctaws, Mohegan, and, so far as
                    appears, all the American phratries) any clan of the one phratry may intermarry
                    with any clan of the other phratry. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Australian tribe is divided into two exogamous phratries; each of these
                    phratries is subdivided into two subphratries; and these subphratries are
                    subdivided into an indefinite number of totem clans. The phratries being
                    exogamous, it follows that their subdivisions (the subphratries and clans) are
                    so also. The well-known Kamilaroi tribe in New South Wales will serve as an
                    example. Its subdivisions are as follows: <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In such tribes the freedom of marriage is still more curtailed. A subphratry is
                    not free to marry into either subphratry of the other phratry; each subphratry
                    is restricted in its choice of partners to one subphratry of the other phratry;
                    Muri can only marry Kumbo, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>; Kubi can only
                    marry Ipai, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence (supposing the tribe to
                    be equally distributed between the phratries and subphratries), whereas under
                    the two phratry and clan system a man is free to choose a wife from half the
                    women of the tribe, under the phratry, subphratry, and clan system he is
                    restricted in his choice to one quarter of the women.</p>
                <p>A remarkable feature of the Australian social organization is that divisions of
                    one tribe have their recognized equivalents in other tribes, whose languages,
                    including the names for the tribal divisions, are quite different. A native who
                    travelled far and wide through Australia stated that “he was furnished with
                    temporary wives by the various tribes with whom he sojourned in his travels;
                    that his right to these women was recognized as a matter of course; and that he
                    could always ascertain whether they belonged to the division into which he could
                    legally marry, ‘ though the places were 1000 miles apart, and the languages
                    quite different.’” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    shown that the class divisions correspond with each other, as for instance in
                    the classes of the Flinders river and Mitchell river tribes; and these tribes
                    are separated by 400 miles of country, and by many intervening tribes. But, for
                    all that, class corresponds to class in fact and in meaning and in privileges,
                    although the name may be quite different and the totems of each dissimilar.”

                    between the intermarrying divisions of distinct and distant tribes, with the
                    rights which it conveys to the members of these divisions, points to sexual
                    communism on a scale to which there is perhaps no parallel elsewhere, certainly
                    not in North America, where marriage is always within the tribe, though outside
                    the clan. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    that of mortal strife” (Dodge, <hi rend="italic">Our Wild Indians,</hi> p.
                    45).</p></note> But even in Australia a man is always bound to marry within a
                    certain kinship group; that group may extend across the whole of Australia, but
                    nevertheless it is exactly limited and defined. If endogamy is used in the sense
                    of prohibition to marry outside of a certain kinship group, whether that group
                    be exclusive of, inclusive of, or identical with the man’s own group, then
                    marriage among the totem societies of Australia, America, and India is both
                    exogamous and endogamous; a man is forbidden to marry either within his own clan
                    or outside of a certain kinship group. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the Australian tribal organization of two phratries, four subphratries, and
                    totem clans, there occurs a peculiar form of descent of which no plausible
                    explanation has yet been offered. It seems that in all tribes thus organized the
                    children are born into the subphratry neither of their father nor of their
                    mother, and that descent in such cases is either female or male, according as
                    the subphratry into which the children are born is the companion subphratry of
                    their mother’s or of their father’s subphratry. In the former case we have what
                    may be called indirect female descent; in the latter, 'indirect male descent.
                    But it is only in the subphratry that descent is thus indirect. In the totem
                    clan it is always direct; the child belongs to the clan either of its mother or
                    of its father. Thus, in the typical Australian organization, descent, whether
                    female or male, is direct in the phratry, indirect in the subphratry, and direct
                    in the clan.</p>
                <p>To take examples, the following is the scheme of descent, so far as the phratries
                    and subphratries are concerned, in the Kamilaroi:—</p>

                    phratries, each of which includes under it sixteen totem clans, (Caterpillar,
                    Mullet, Dog, Rat, Kangaroo, Frog, Crow, &amp;c.);<note anchored="true"

                <p>Besides the tribes whose line of descent is definitely fixed in the female or
                    male line, or, as with the Dieri and Ikula, half-way between the two, there are
                    a number of tribes among whom a child may be entered in either his mother’s or
                    his father’s clan. Among the Haidas, children regularly belong to the totem clan
                    of their mother; but in very exceptional cases, when the clan of the father is
                    reduced in numbers, the newly-born child may be given to the father’s sister to
                    suckle. It is then spoken of as belonging to the paternal aunt, and is counted
                    to its father’s clan.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    sometimes, when the father’s clan was one which was bound to furnish human
                    victims from its ranks, the mother had it adopted into her clan by having the
                    name of her totem pronounced over it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Here we must revert to the religious side of totemism, in order to consider some
                    facts which have emerged from the study of its social aspect. We have seen that
                    some phratries, both in America and Australia, bear the names of animals;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As among the Chickasas,
                    Thlinkets, and Mohegans in America, and the Turra, Ngarego, and Theddora tribes
                    in Australia. The sub-phratries of the Kiabara also bear animal
                    names.</p></note> and in the case of the Thlinkets and Mohegans we have seen
                    reason to believe that the animals which give their names to the phratries were
                    once clan totems. The same seems to hold of the names of the Australian
                    phratries, Eaglehawk, Crow, and Seal, or at least of Eaglehawk and Crow, for
                    these are clan totems in other tribes, and are, besides, important figures in
                    Australian mythology. Indeed, there appears to be direct evidence that both the
                    phratries and subphratries actually retain, at least in some tribes, their
                    totems. Thus the Port Mackay tribe in Queensland is divided into two phratries,
                    Yungaru and Wutaru, with subphratries Gurgela, Burbia, Wungo, and Kubera; and
                    the Yungaru phratry has for its totem the alligator, and Wutaru the
                    kangaroo,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fison and
                    Howitt, 38 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 40.</p></note> while the sub-phratries
                    have for their totems the emu (or the carpet snake), iguana, opossum, and
                    kangaroo (or scrub turkey).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    differently. But they seem to be speaking of the same tribe; at least Mr Fison
                    understands them so.</p></note></p>

                <p>As the subphratries of this tribe are said to be equivalent to the subphratries
                    of the Kamilaroi, it seems to follow that the subphratries of the Kamilaroi
                    (Muri, Kubi, Ipai, and Kumbo) have or once had totems also. Hence it appears
                    that in tribes organized in phratries, subphratries, and clans each man has
                    three totems—his phratry totem, his subphratry totem, and his clan totem. If we
                    add a sex totem and an individual totem, each man in the typical Australian
                    tribe has five distinct kinds of totems. What degree of allegiance he owes to
                    his subphratry totem and phratry totem respectively we are not told; indeed, the
                    very existence of such totems, as distinct from clan totems, appears to have
                    been generally overlooked. But we may suppose that the totem bond diminishes in
                    strength in proportion to its extension; that therefore the clan totem is the
                    primary tie, of which the subphratry and phratry totems are successively
                    weakened repetitions.</p>
                <p>In these totems superposed on totems may perhaps be discerned a rudimentary
                    classification of natural objects under heads which bear a certain resemblance
                    to genera, species, &amp;c. This classification is by some Australian tribes
                    extended so as to include the whole of nature. Thus the Port Mackay tribe in
                    Queensland (see above) divides all nature between the phratries; the wind
                    belongs to one phratry and the rain to another; the sun is Wutaru and the moon
                    is Yungaru; the stars, trees, and plants are also divided between the
                    phratries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Brough Smyth,

                    I.,</hi> xiii. 300.</p></note> As the totem of Wutaru is kangaroo and of Yungaru
                    alligator, this is equivalent to making the sun a kangaroo and the moon an
                    alligator.</p>
                <p>The Mount Gambier tribe in South Australia is divided into two phratries (Kumi
                    and Kroki), which again are subdivided into totem clans. Everything in nature
                    belongs to a totem clan, thus:<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    eats grass: it is Boortwerio. ’ I then said, ‘ A cray-fish does not eat grass;
                    why is it Boortwerio? ’ Then came the standing reason for all puzzling
                    questions: ‘ That is what our fathers said it was.’”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Of the subtotems in this tribe Mr Howitt says, “They appear to me to be totems in
                    a state of development. Hot wind has at least five of them, white cockatoo has
                    seventeen, and so on for the others. That these subtotems are now in process of
                    gaining a sort of independence may be shown by the following instance: a man who
                    is Krokitch-Wartwut (hot wind) claimed to own all the five subtotems of hot wind
                    (three snakes and two birds), yet of these there was one which he specially
                    claimed as ‘belonging’ to him, namely, Moiwuk (carpet-snake). Thus his totem,
                    hot wind, seems to have been in process of subdivision into minor totems, and
                    this man’s division might have become hot wind carpet-snake had not civilization
                    rudely stopped the process by almost extinguishing the tribe.”</p>

                    nicknames”: savages first named themselves after natural objects, and then,
                    confusing these objects with their ancestors of the same names, reverenced them
                    as they already reverenced their ancestors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    367.</p></note> But this view attributes to verbal misunderstandings far more
                    influence than, in spite of the so-called comparative mythology, they ever seem
                    to have exercised.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature.—</hi> Apart from the original authorities, the
                    literature on totemism is very scanty. The importance of totemism for the early
                    history of society was first recognized by Mr J. F. M‛Lennan in papers published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> (Oct. and Nov. 1869, Feb.
                    1870). The subject has since been treated of by E. B. Tylor, <hi rend="italic"
