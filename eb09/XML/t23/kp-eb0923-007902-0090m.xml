                <p><label type="entry">TASTE</label> is the sensation referred to the mouth when
                    certain soluble substances are brought into contact with the mucous membrane of
                    that cavity. The sense is located almost entirely in the tongue. Three distinct
                    sensations are referable to the tongue—(1) taste, (2) touch, and (3)
                    temperature. The posterior part of its surface, where there is a Λ-shaped group
                    of large papillae, called circumvallate papillae, supplied by the
                    glosso-pharyngeal nerve, and the tip and margins of the tongue, covered with
                    filiform (touch) papillae and fungiform papillae, are the chief localities where
                    taste is manifested, but it also exists in the glosso-palatine arch and the
                    lateral part of the soft palate. The middle of the tongue and the surface of the
                    hard palate are devoid of taste. The terminal organs of taste consist of
                    peculiar bodies named taste-bulbs or tastegoblets, discovered by Schwalbe and
                    Lovèn in 1867. They can be most easily demonstrated in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >papiUae foliatae,</hi> large oval prominences found on each side near the base
                    of the tongue in the rabbit. Each papilla consists of a series of laminae or
                    folds, in the sides of which the tastebodies are readily displayed in a
                    transverse section. Tastebodies are also found on the lateral aspects of the
                    circumvallate papillae (see fig. 1), in the fungiform papillae, in the papillae
                    of the soft palate and uvula, the under surface of the epiglottis, the upper
                    part of the posterior surface of the epiglottis, the inner sides of the
                    arytenoid cartilages, and even in the vocal cords.</p>
                <p>The taste-bulbs are minute oval bodies, somewhat like an old-fashioned Florence
                    flask, about <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> ⅞- <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> ∙ inch
                    in length by <hi rend="subscript"> κ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> γj</hi> ∙ in
                    breadth. Each consists of two sets of cells,—an <hi rend="italic">outer</hi>
                    set, nucleated, fusiform, bent like the staves of a barrel, and arranged side by
                    side so as to leave a small opening at the apex (the mouth of the barrel),
                    called the gustatory pore; and an <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> set, five to ten
                    in number, lying in the centre, pointed at the end next the gustatory pore, and
                    branched at the other extremity. The branched ends are continuous with
                    non-medullated nerve fibres from the gustatory nerve. These taste-bodies are
                    found in immense numbers: as many as 1760 have been counted on one circumvallate
                    papilla in the ox. They are absent in reptiles and birds. F. E. Schultze states
                    that they exist in the mouth of the tadpole, whilst the tongue of the frog is
                    covered with epithelium resembling that of the gustatory bodies. Leydig has
                    described organs having a similar structure in the skins of freshwater fishes
                    and the tadpole: these may possibly be widely distributed taste-organs. The
                    proofs that these are the terminal organs of taste rest on careful observations
                    which have shown (1) that taste is only experienced when the sapid substance is
                    allowed to come into contact with the taste-body, and that the sense <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0091-0080"/> is absent or much weakened in those areas of
                    mucous membrane where these are deficient; (2) that they are most abundant where
                    the sense is most acute; and (3) that section of the glosso-pharyngeal nerve
                    which is known to be distributed to the areas of mucous membrane where taste is
                    present is followed by degeneration of the tastebodies. At the same time it
                    cannot be asserted that they are absolutely essential to taste, as we can hardly
                    suppose that those animals which have no special taste-bodies are devoid of the
                    sense.</p>
                <p>Taste is no doubt closely allied to smell; hence in invertebrates organs are
                    found that may be referred to either of the senses (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Smell).</hi> Tastes have been variously classified. One of the most useful
                    classifications is into sweet, bitter, acid, and saline tastes. To excite the
                    sensation, substances must be soluble in the fluid of the mouth. Insoluble
                    substances, when brought into contact with the tongue, give rise to feelings of
                    touch or of temperature, but excite no taste. The specific mode of action of
                    sapid substances is quite unknown. The extent of surface acted on increases the
                    massiveness of the sensation, whilst the intensity is affected by the degree of
                    concentration of the solution of the sapid substance. If solutions of various
                    substances are gradually diluted with water until no taste is experienced,
                    Valentine found that the sensations of taste disappeared in the following order—
                    syrup, sugar, common salt, aloes, quinine, sulphuric acid; and Camerer found
                    that the taste of quinine still continued although diluted with twenty times
                    more water than common salt. Von Vintschgau found that the time required to
                    excite taste after the sapid substance was placed on the tongue varied. Thus
                    saline matters are tasted most rapidly (’ 17 second), then sweet, acid, and
                    bitter (’ 258 second). This is probably due to the activity of diffusion of the
                    substance. No relation between the chemical constitution of the substance and
                    the nature of the taste excited by it has yet been discovered, and there are
                    many curious examples of substances of very different chemical constitutions
                    having similar tastes. For example, sugar, acetate of lead, and the vapour of
                    chloroform have all a sweetish taste. A temperature of from 50° to 90° F. is the
                    most favourable to the sense, water above or below this temperature either
                    masking or temporarily paralysing it. Taste is often associated with smell,
                    giving rise to a sensation of flavour, and we are frequently in the habit of
                    confounding the one sensation with the other. Chloroform excites taste alone,
                    whilst garlic, asafoetida, and vanilla excite only smell. This is illustrated by
                    the familiar experiment of blindfolding a person and touching the tongue
                    successively with slices of an apple and of an onion. In these circumstances the
                    one cannot be distinguished from the other when the nose is firmly closed. No
                    doubt also experience aids in detecting slight differences of taste by
                    suggesting to the mind what may be expected; it is not easy, for instance, to
                    distinguish the tastes of red and white wine when the eyes are blindfolded.
                    Taste may be educated to a remarkable extent; and careful observation—along with
                    the practice of avoiding all substances having a very pronounced taste or having
                    an irritating effect—enables tea-tasters and winetasters to detect slight
                    differences of taste, more especially when combined with odour so as to produce
                    flavour, which would be quite inappreciable to an ordinary palate. As to the
                    action of electrical currents on taste, observers have arrived at uncertain
                    results. So long ago as 1752 Sulzer stated that a constant current caused, more
                    especially at the moments of opening and of closing the current, a sensation of
                    acidity at the anode ( + pole) and of alkalinity at the katode ( - pole). This
                    is in all probability due to electrolysis, the decomposition products exciting
                    the tastebodies. Grünhagen found that rapidly interrupted currents fail to
                    excite the sense; Von Vintschgau, who has directed much attention to the sense
                    of taste, says that when the tip of his tongue is traversed by a current there
                    is only a tactile sensation. Again Honigschmied, on the contrary, found that a
                    current excited the metallic or acid taste at the anode placed on the tip of the
                    tongue, whilst the alkaline taste of the katode was absent. The writer of this
                    article has found that this is the experience of most persons examined by
                    him.</p>
                <p>Disease of the tongue causing unnatural dryness may interfere with taste.
                    Substances circulating in the blood may give rise to subjective sensations of
                    taste. Thus santonine, morphia, and biliary products (as in jaundice) usually
                    cause a bitter sensation, whilst the sufferer from diabetes is distressed by a
                    persistent sweetish taste. The insane frequently have subjective tastes, which
                    are real to the patient, and frequently cause much distress. In such cases, the
                    sensation is excited by changes in the taste-centres of the brain. Increase in
                    the sense of taste is called <hi rend="italic">hypergeusia,</hi> diminution of
                    it <hi rend="italic">hypogeusia,</hi> and its entire loss <hi rend="italic"
                    >ageusia.</hi> Rare cases occur where there is a subjective taste not associated
                    with insanity nor with the circulation of any known sweetish matters in the
                    blood, possibly caused by irritation of the gustatory nerves or by changes in
                    the nerve centres.</p>
