                    (1763-1826), French tragedian, was born at Paris 15th January 1763. After
                    attending the Mazarin college, he accompanied his father, who was a dentist, to
                    London, where he studied in the hospitals. While in London he took part in some
                    amateur theatricals, and, his talents at once attracting notice, a professional
                    engagement was offered him. To this, however, his father would not consent, and
                    shortly afterwards he was sent to Paris, where for some years he was assistant
                    to a dentist. His predilection for the drama could not be restrained, andon 21st
                    November 1787 he made his d√©but at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahomet.</hi> His efforts from the first won appreciation, but for a
                    considerable time he was restricted to secondary parts. It was in <hi
                    rend="italic">jeune premier</hi> parts that he first came prominently into
                    notice, and he attained only gradually to his unrivalled position as the
                    exponent of strong and concentrated passion. In 1791 he and other dissentients
                    founded the Th√©√¢tre Fran√ßais de la rue de Richelieu,‚Äîa name changed in 1792 to
                    Th√©√¢tre de la R√©publique, where he won his most striking successes. Talma was
                    among the earliest advocates of realism in scenery and costume, being greatly
                    aided in his reforms by his friend the painter David. He possessed in perfection
                    the physical gifts fitting him to excel in the highest tragic parts, an
                    admirably proportioned figure, a striking countenance, and a voice of great
                    beauty and power, which, after he had conquered a certain thickness of
                    utterance, enabled him to acquire a matchless elocution. At first somewhat
                    stilted and monotonous in his manner, he gradually emancipated himself from all
                    artificial trammels, and became by perfection of art a model of simplicity.
                    Talma enjoyed the intimacy of Napoleon, with whom he had an acquaintance before
                    Napoleon attained greatness; and he was a friend of Ch√©nier, Danton, Camille
                    Desmoulins, and other revolutionists. He made his last appearance 11th June
                    1826. and died at Paris 19th October of that year.</p>
