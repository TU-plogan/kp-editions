                    Italy was, for administrative purposes, divided by Augustus. Under Constantine
                    it was united into one province with Umbria, an arrangement which subsisted
                    until at least 400, as the <hi rend="italic">Notitia</hi> speaks of a
                    “consularis Tusciae et Umbriae.” In Ammianus Marcellinus there is implied a
                    distinction between “Tuscia suburbicaria” and “Tuscia annonaria,” the latter
                    being that portion which lies to the north of the Arno. After the fall of the
                    Western empire Tuscia, with other provinces of Italy, came successively under
                    the sway of Herulians, Ostrogoths, and Greek and Lombard dukes. Under the
                    last-named, “Tuscia Langobardorum,” comprising the districts of Viterbo,
                    Corneto, and Bolsena, was distinguished from “Tuscia Regni,” which lay more to
                    the north. Under Charlemagne the name of Tuscia or Toscana became restricted to
                    the latter only. One of the earliest of the Frankish marquises was Boniface,
                    either first or second of that name, who about 828 fought with success against
                    the Saracens in Africa. Adalbert I., who succeeded him, in 878 espoused the
                    cause of Carloman as against his brother Louis III. of France, and suffered
                    excommunication and imprisonment in consequence. Adalbert II. (the Rich), who
                    married the ambitious Bertha, daughter of Lothair, king of Lorraine, took a
                    prominent part in the politics of his day. A subsequent marquis, Hugo (the
                    Great), became also duke of Spoleto in 989. The male line of marquises ended
                    with Boniface II. (or III.), who was murdered in 1052. His widow, Beatrice, in
                    1055 married Godfrey, duke of Lorraine, and governed the country till her death
                    in 1076, when she was succeeded by <hi rend="smallcaps">Matilda</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>), her only child by her first husband. Matilda died
                    in 1114 without issue, bequeathing all her extensive possessions to the church.
                    The consequent struggle between the popes, who claimed the inheritance, and the
                    emperors, who maintained that the countess had no right to dispose of imperial
                    fiefs, enabled the principal cities of Tuscany gradually to assert their
                    independence and govern themselves under consuls and elders of their own
                    selection. The most important of these Tuscan republics or self-governed
                    communes were Florence, Pisa, Siena, Arezzo, Pistoia, and Lucca. Some account of
                    the manner in which they were all gradually absorbed by Florence will be found
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Florence</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Medici.</hi>
                    The title of grand-duke of Tuscany was conferred on Cosmo de’ Medici by Pius V.
                    in 1567, and the emperor (Maximilian II.), after withholding his consent for
                    some years, ultimately confirmed it to Cosmo’s successor in 1576. In 1735, in
                    view of the childlessness of Giovan Gastone, the last of the Medici, the
                    succession of Francis, duke of Lorraine, afterwards emperor F rancis I., was
                    arranged for by treaty. In 1765 he was succeeded as grand-duke by his second son
                    Leopold (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Leopold</hi> II.), who, on becoming emperor in
                    1790, handed Tuscany over to his second son Ferdinand, third grand-duke of the
                    name. The duchy was occupied by the French in 1799, ceded to Louis, prince of
                    Parma, by the convention of Madrid in 1801, and annexed to the French empire in
                    1808. Ferdinand, however, was reinstated in 1814, and on his death in 1824 was
                    succeeded by his son Leopold, second grand-duke of the name, who was deposed by
                    the constituent assembly on 16th August 1860. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
