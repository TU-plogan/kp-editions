                    Haute-Garonne, 478 miles south from Paris and 160 southeast from Bordeaux,
                    stands on the right bank of the Garonne, which here describes a bold outward
                    curve to the east. On the left bank is the Faubourg St Cyprien. The river is
                    spanned by three bridges,—that of St Pierre to the north, that of St Michel
                    towards the south, and the Pont Neuf in the centre; the last-named, a fine
                    construction of seven arches, was begun in 1543. The city is peculiarly subject
                    to great floods, such as that of 1855, which destroyed the suspension bridge of
                    St Pierre, or the still more disastrous one of June 1875, which, besides
                    carrying away that of St Michel, laid the Faubourg St Cyprien under water,
                    destroyed 7000 houses, and drowned 300 people. East and north of the city runs
                    the great Canal du Midi (from the Mediterranean), which here joins the Garonne.
                    Between this canal and the city proper extends the long line of boulevards
                    (Boulevards Lacrosses, d’Arcole, du 22 Sen-tembre, &amp;c.) leading by the Allee
                    St Etienne to the Boulid-grin, whence a series of allées shoot out in all
                    directions. South-west the Allée St Michel leads towards the Garonne, and south
                    the Grande Allee towards the Faubourg St Michel. These boulevards take the place
                    of the old city walls. Between them and the canal lie the more modern faubourgs
                    of St Pierre, Arnaud-Bernard, Matabiau, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The more ancient part of the city consists of narrow irregular pebble-paved
                    streets. Most of the houses are of brick, and none of any great architectural
                    pretensions, except those which date back at least to the 17th century. In 1868
                    the municipal authorities determined to construct two entirely new streets,
                    broad and straight, intended to cut one another at right angles near the centre
                    of the city. Of these the first, the Rue de Metz, starts eastward from the Pont
                    Neuf, and will ultimately intersect the Rue d’Alsace-Lorraine running from north
                    to south. These alterations, however, go on very slowly. The Place du Capitole
                    may be regarded as the centre, whence streets branch out in every direction.
                    Eastward and north-east the Rue La Fayette leads across the boulevards towards
                    the Allee La Fayette, beyond which, across the Canal du Midi, are the École
                    Vétérinaire and the railway station, and still farther off the obelisk erected
                    to commemorate the battle of Toulouse (April 10, 1814), and the observatory.
                    From the northwest of the Place du Capitole the Rue du Taur runs due north past
                    the ancient Église du Taur to the great Église St Sernin, the largest and most
                    famous church of southern France. From the north-west corner of the same Place
                    the Rue des Lois conducts towards the École de Droit and the arsenal. In a more
                    westerly direction the Rue Pargamin-iere stretches towards the venerable church
                    and the bridge of St Peter From the south-west corner the Rue des Balances
                    extends towards the Rue de Metz and the Pont Neuf. From the south the Rue St
                    Rome, Rue des Changes, and Rue des Filatiers lead to the Place des Carmes or de
                    la République; while from the south-east corner the Rue de la Pomme and the Rue
                    Boulbonne lead across the Rue d’Alsace-Lorraine to the cathedral of St Stephen.

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0504-0485"/> south of the city lies the palais de justice,
                    near which are the ancient church of the Inquisition and several of the finest
                    houses in Toulouse. Going northwards, the traveller passes the Église de la
                    Dalbade on his way towards the Pont Neuf, immediately to the north of which is
                    the Église de la Daurade. North of this church, but somewhat farther from the
                    river, is the military hospital, to the immediate east of which lie the lycée,
                    the church of the Jacobins, and the public library. South-east from this, about
                    halfway towards the cathedral, is the museum. North of the military hospital and
                    beyond the Rue Pargaminiére lie the arsenal and the Faubourg St Pierre. Slightly
                    to the northwest of the Pont St Pierre the Canal de Brienne (finished 1778) cuts
                    across the angle formed by the Garonne and Canal du Midi. Between the Canal de
                    Brienne and the Garonne is the chief manufacturing part of the city, where the
                    great Bazacle flour-mill stands. Along the right bank of the river run the
                    various quays of St Pierre, &amp;c. In the Faubourg St Cyprien, just north of
                    the Pont Neuf, is the Hotel Dieu St Jacques, said to have been founded before
                    the 12th century, with its large gardens. Close to the Pont St Pierre is the
                    hospital of St Joseph de la Grave, which makes up 1432 beds, and affords shelter
                    to foundlings and the aged. South of the Allee St Michel is the Jardin des
                    Plantes, founded by the ill-fated La Perouse.</p>
                <p>The most interesting building is the church of St Sernin or Saturninus, whom
                    legend represents as the first preacher of the gospel in Toulouse, where he was
                    perhaps martyred towards the middle of the 3d century. The oldest part of the
                    present building was consecrated by Urban II. in 1096. This church is now the
                    largest edifice of southern France, being 375 feet from east to west and 217
                    feet in its utmost breadth. The nave (12th and 13th centuries) is remarkable for
                    having double aisles. Four pillars, supporting the central tower, are surrounded
                    by heavy masonry, which somewhat spoils the general harmony of the interior. In
                    the southern transept is the “portail des comtes,” so named because near it lie
                    the tombs of William Taillefer, Pons, and other early counts of Toulouse. The
                    little chapel in which these tombs (ascribed to the 11th century) are found was
                    restored by the capitols of Toulouse in 1648. Another chapel contains a
                    Byzantine Christ of late 11th-century workmanship. The choir (11th and 12th
                    centuries) ends in an apse, or rather chevet, surrounded by a range of columns,
                    marking off an aisle which in its turn opens into five chapels. The stalls are
                    of 16th-century work and very grotesquely carved. Against the northern wall is
                    an ancient <hi rend="italic">table d'autel,</hi> which an 11th-century
                    inscription declares to have belonged to St Sernin. In the crypts are many
                    relics, which, however, were robbed of their gold and silver shrines during the
                    Revolution. The finest gate is on the south, and is surmounted by a fine
                    representation of the Ascension in Byzantine style. The capitals of the St
                    Sernin pillars are sometimes ornamented with leaves and sometimes with grotesque
                    animals, &amp;c. The belfry consists of five stories, of which the two highest
                    are of later date, but harmonize very well with the three lower ones. The
                    cathedral, dedicated to St Stephen, dates from three different epochs. The nave,
                    commenced by Raymond VI. towards the beginning of the 13th century, still
                    displays the sculptured arms of its founder, and a few years ago preserved the
                    pulpit in which St Bernard and St Dominic are said to have preached. The choir,
                    commenced by Bertrand de Lille (c. 1272), was burned in 1609, but restored in
                    the same century. It is surrounded by seventeen chapels, which were finished by
                    the Cardinal d’Orléans, nephew of Louis XI , towards the beginning of the 16th
                    century. These chapels are adorned with glass dating from the 15th to the 17th
                    century. The great western gate was constructed by Peter du Moulin, archbishop
                    of Toulouse, from 1439 to 1451. It has been greatly battered, and presents but a
                    poor approximation to its ancient beauty. Over this grand gate, which was once
                    ornamented with the statues of St Sernin, St Exuperius, and the twelve apostles,
                    as well as those of the two brother archbishops of Toulouse, Denis (1423-1439)
                    and Peter du Moulin, there is a beautiful 13th-century rose-window, whose
                    centre, however, is not in a perpendicular line with the point of the Gothic
                    arch below. In the same way the choir and the nave have not the same axis.</p>
                <p>Among other remarkable churches may be noticed those of St Pierre des Cuisines
                    (12th century), with its beautifully sculptured capitals; of Notre Dame de la
                    Daurade, near the Pont Neuf, built on the site of a 9th-century Benedictine
                    abbey, but reconstructed in 1764; and of Notre Dame de la Dalbade, perhaps
                    existing in the 11th century but in its present form dating from the 15th. The
                    Église des Jacobins, held by Viollet le Duc to be “one of the most beautiful
                    brick churches constructed in the Middle Ages,” was built towards the end of the
                    13th century, and originally consisted of but one structure divided into two
                    aisles by a range of columns. It has a beautiful octagonal belfry. Before the
                    Revolution it contained the mausoleum of Thomas Aquinas. On the left of the
                    Garonne stands the church of St Nicholas, also with an octagonal belfry and a
                    spire dating from the 15th century. There are many other churches of
                    considerable antiquity.</p>
                <p>Of secular buildings the most noteworthy are the capitole, the museum, and the
                    lycée. The capitole (16th-17th centuries) has a long Ionic façade constructed by
                    Gammas (1750-60). The theatre is situated in the left wing. Running along almost
                    the whole length of the first floor is the “salle des illustres” adorned with
                    the busts of forty-four great natives of Toulouse; the word “native” has,
                    however, been construed very liberally. In the capitole the Académie des Jeux
                    Floraux holds its annual meetings. The museum (opened 1795) occupies the church
                    and other buildings of the Augustinian convent (14th-15th cent.). It contains a
                    splendid collection of antiquities arranged in two cloisters, and a collection
                    of pictures. The natural history museum is at the Jardin des Plantes. The lycée
                    occupies the group of buildings known as “Les Jacobins,” the Hôtel Bernui (16th
                    century), &amp;c. Here is the public library (65,000 volumes).</p>
                <p>Toulouse is singularly rich in mansions of the 16th and 17th centuries. Several
                    of these are richly adorned by Bachelier, Michelangelo’s pupil. The Hotels
                    d’Assezat, de St Jean, Las Bordes, Fel-zins, Duranti, and Maison de Pierre may
                    be specially mentioned. A few houses are said to date from the 14th century or
                    even earlier. Near the Allee St Michel is the palais de justice, the old meeting
                    house of the parlement of Toulouse. Close by was the old Chateau Narbonnais.</p>
                <p>Besides its university, which ranks next to those of Paris and Lyons, and has
                    faculties of law, science, letters, and medicine, Toulouse possesses many
                    educational and learned societies, among which may be mentioned the École des
                    Beaux Arts et des Sciences Industrielles, the École Normale, the École de
                    Musique, the Academies des Jeux Floraux, des Sciences et des Belles Lettres et
                    Arts, and de Legislation, the Société d’Agriculture, and the archaeological
                    Sociéte du Midi.</p>
                <p>The geographical position of Toulouse, on the plain of Languedoc, has made it the
                    chief entrepot of the district for wine, corn, and almost all the industries of
                    the neighbourhood. Besides the grinding of flour, its leading industries are
                    cabinetmaking, hat-making, calico printing, the manufacture of pots and pans,
                    macaroni, and starch, leather-making (morocco), cloth and paper making,
                    glassblowing, saddlery, and pottery. The tobacco factory occupies 1250 hands,
                    and manufactures 1000 tons of snuff, a corresponding quantity of tobacco, and
                    250 tons of cigars annually.</p>
                <p>The population of the city, 127,196 in 1881, numbered 133,775 in 1886, that of
                    the commune being 147,617.</p>
                <p>Tolosa (T <hi rend="italic">oλῶσσα</hi>), chief town of the Volcae Tectosages,
                    does not seem to have been a place of great importance during the early
                    centuries of the Roman rule in Gaul, though one incident in its early history
                    gave rise to the famous Latin proverb “habet aurum Tolosanum” (Aul. Gell., iii.
                    c. 12). It was possessed of a circus and an amphitheatre, but its most
                    remarkable remains are to be found on the heights of Old Toulouse (vetus Tolosa)
                    some 6 or 7 miles to the east, where huge accumulations of broken pottery and
                    fragments of an old earthen wall mark the site of an ancient settlement. The
                    numerous coins that have been discovered on the same spot do not date back
                    farther than the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and seem to indicate
                    the position of a Roman manufacturing centre then beginning to occupy the Gallic
                    hill-fortress that, in earlier days, had in times of peril been the stronghold
                    of the native tribes dwelling on the river bank. Tolosa does not seem to have
                    been a Roman colony; but its importance must have increased greatly towards the
                    middle of the 4th century. It is to be found entered in more than one itinerary
                    dating from about this time; and Ausonius, in his <hi rend="italic">Ordo
                    Nobilium Urbium,</hi> alludes to it in terms implying that it then had a large
                    population. In 419 it was taken by Wallia, king of the Visigoths, under whom or
                    whose successors it became the seat of the great Teutonic kingdom of the
                    West-Goths,—a kingdom that within fifty years had extended itself from the Loire
                    to Gibraltar and from the Rhone to the Atlantic. On the defeat of Alaric II.
                    (507) Toulouse fell into the hands of Clovis, who carried away the royal
                    treasures to Angoulême. Under the Merovingian kings it seems to have remained
                    the greatest city of southern Gaul, and is said to have been governed by dukes
                    or counts dependent on one or other of the rival kings descended from the great
                    founder of the Frankish monarchy. It figures prominently in the pages of Gregory
                    of Tours and Sidonius Apollinaria. About 628 Dagobert erected South Aquitaine
                    into a kingdom for his brother Charibert, who chose Toulouse as his capital. For
                    the next eighty years its history is obscure, till we reach the days of Charles
                    Martel, when it was besieged by Serna, the leader of the Saracens from Spain
                    (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 715-20), but delivered by Eudo, “princeps
                    Aquitaniae,” in whom later winters discovered the ancestor of all the later
                    counts of Toulouse. Modern criticism, however, has discredited this genealogy;
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0505-0486"/> and the real history of Toulouse recommences in
                    780 or 781, when Charlemagne appointed his little son Louis king of Aquitaine,
                    with Toulouse for his chief city.</p>
                <p>During the minority of the young king his tutor Chorson ruled at Toulouse with
                    the title of duke or count. Being deposed at the council of Worms (790), he was
                    succeeded by William Courtnez, the traditional hero of southern France, who in
                    806 retired to his newly founded monastery at Gellone, where he died in 812. In
                    the unhappy days of Louis the Pious and his children Toulouse suffered in common
                    with the rest of western Europe. It was besieged by Charles the Bald in 844, and
                    taken four years later by the Normans, who in 843 had sailed up the Garonne as
                    far as its walls. About 852 Raymond L, count of Querci, succeeded his brother
                    Fridolo as count of Rouergue and Toulouse; it is from this noble that all the
                    later counts of Toulouse trace their descent. Raymond I.’s grandchildren divided
                    their parent’s estates; of these Raymond II., the elder (d. 924), became count
                    of Toulouse, and Ermengaud, the younger, count of Rouergue, while the hereditary
                    titles of Gothia, Querci, and Albi were shared between them. Raymond II.’s
                    grandson, William Taillefer (d. <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1037), married Emma of
                    Provence, and handed down part of that lordship to his younger son
                    Bertrand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About 975
                    there was a partition of the estates which William Taillefer and his cousin

                    William, and Gothia, &amp;c., to Raymond.</p></note> William’s elder son Pons
                    left two children, of whom William IV. succeeded his father in Toulouse, Albi,
                    Querci, &amp;c.; while the younger, Raymond IV. of St Gilles (c. 1066), made
                    himself master of the vast possessions of the counts of Rouergue, married his
                    cousin the heiress of Provence, and about 1085 began to rule the immense estates
                    of his elder brother, who was still living.</p>
                <p>From this time the counts of Toulouse were the greatest lords in southern France.
                    Raymond IV., the hero of the first crusade, assumed the formal titles of marquis
                    of Provence, duke of Narbonne, and count of Toulouse. While Raymond was away in
                    the Holy Land, Toulouse was seized by William IX., duke of Aquitaine, who
                    claimed the city in right of his wife Philippa, the daughter of William IV., but
                    was unable to hold it long (1098-1100). Raymond’s son and successor Bertrand
                    followed his father’s example and set out for the Holy Land in 1109, leaving his
                    great estates at his death to his brother Alphonse-Jourdain. The rule of this
                    prince was disturbed by the ambition of William IX. and his granddaughter
                    Eleanor, who urged her husband Louis VII. to support her claims to Toulouse by
                    war. On her divorce from Louis and her marriage with Henry II., Eleanor’s claims
                    passed on to this monarch, who at last forced Raymond V. to do him homage for
                    Toulouse in 1173. Raymond V., the patron of the troubadours, died in 1194, and
                    was succeeded by his son Raymond VI., under whose rule Languedoc was desolated
                    by the remorseless crusaders of Simon de Montfort. Raymond VII., the son of
                    Raymond VI. and Princess Joan of England, succeeded his father in 1222, and died
                    in 1249, leaving an only daughter Joan, married to Alfonso the brother of Louis
                    IX. On the death of Alfonso and Joan in 1271 the vast inheritance of the counts
                    of Toulouse lapsed to the crown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>From the middle years of the 12th century the people of Toulouse seem to have
                    begun to free themselves from the most oppressive feudal dues. An act of
                    Alphonse-Jourdain (1141) exempts them from the tax on salt and wine; and in 1152
                    we have traces of a “commune consilium Tolosae” making police ordinances in its
                    own name “with the advice of Lord Raymond, count of Toulouse, duke of Narbonne,
                    and marquis of Provence.” This act is witnessed by six “capitularii,” four duly
                    appointed judges <hi rend="italic">(judices constitute),</hi> and two advocates.
                    Twenty-three years later there are twelve capitularii or consuls, six for the
                    city and six for its suburbs, all of them elected and sworn to do justice in
                    whatever municipal matters were brought before them. In 1222 their number was
                    increased to twenty-four; but they were forbidden to touch the city property,
                    which was to remain in the charge of certain “commun-arii” chosen by themselves.
                    Early in the 14th century the consuls took the name of “domini de capitulo,” or,
                    a little later, that of “capitulum nobilium.” From the 13th century the consuls
                    met in their own house, the "palatium communitatis Tolosae” or hôtel-de-ville.
                    In the 16th century a false derivation changed the ancient consuls <hi
                    rend="italic">(domini de capitulo)</hi> into the modern “capitouls” <hi
                    rend="italic">(domini capitolii Tolosani),</hi> a barbarous etymology which in
                    its turn has, in the present century, transformed the old assembly house of
                    Toulouse into the capitole.</p>
                <p>The parlement of Toulouse was established as a permanent court in 1443. Louis XI.
                    transferred it to Montpellier in 1467, but restored it to Toulouse before the
                    close of the next year. This parlement was for Languedoc and southern France
                    what the parlement of Paris was for the north. Towards the end of the 16th
                    century, during the wars of the League, it was split up into three different
                    sections, sitting respectively at Carcassonne or Beziers, at Castel Sarrasin,
                    and at Toulouse. The three were reunited in 1596. Under Francis I. it began to
                    persecute heretics, and in 1618 rendered itself notorious by burning the
                    philosopher Vanini. The university of Toulouse owes its origin to the action of
                    Gregory IX., who in 1229 bound Raymond VII. to maintain four masters to teach
                    theology and eight others for canon law, grammar, and the liberal arts. Civil
                    law and medicine were taught only a few years later. The famous “Floral Games”
                    of Toulouse, in which the poets of Languedoc contended (May 1-3) for the prize
                    of the golden violet and other gold or silver flowers, given at the expense of
                    the city, were instituted in 1323-24.</p>
