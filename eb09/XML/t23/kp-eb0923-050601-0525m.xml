                <p><label type="entry">TRAMWAY</label>. Originally a tramway signified a wheel track
                    laid with timbers, and afterwards with iron plates, having a flange on the inner
                    edge by which wheels of the ordinary sort were kept in the track (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Railway).</hi> The introduction of the flanged wheel and edge
                    rail caused tramways to be superseded by railways, but not until many miles of
                    tramroads had been laid and successfully worked in various parts of the United
                    Kingdom. Although the name is sometimes given to a light railway, by a tramway
                    is now generally understood a street railway, constructed so as to interfere but
                    little with the ordinary traffic, on which vehicles having flanged wheels are
                    propelled by animal or mechanical power. Tramways in this sense originated in
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>A street railway for passengers was laid in New York in 1832, but it was soon
                    removed on account of the accidents caused by it. In 1852 a French engineer,
                    Loubât, revived tramways in New York, and they were soon afterwards laid in
                    other American cities. A short line was also laid in Paris in 1853. The rails
                    used were of wrought-iron, 5 inches wide, having a groove for the flanged wheels
                    of the cars 1¾ to 2¼ inches wide and 1 to 1½ inches deep (fig. 1). To lessen the
                    inconvenience to ordinary traffic occasioned by this rail, the “step rail” (fig.
                    2) was introduced, consisting of a flat surface 3 to 5 inches wide, which can be
                    used by ordinary wheels, and a raised tread on the outer side 1 inch higher and
                    If inch wide, on which the flanged wheels of the cars run.</p>
                <p>This form of rail is still very general in America, and is a good one for the
                    tramways, though not for the general public. In 1858-9 Train, an American,
                    endeavoured to obtain an Act of Parliament authorizing tramways in London;
                    failing in that, he laid tramways, by consent of the road authority, first in
                    1860 at Birkenhead, and soon afterwards in London. The rail laid at Birkenhead
                    had a step of ¾ inch between flat surfaces 3 inches and 1½ inches wide. That
                    laid in London was narrower, with a step of half an inch, but the slippery flat
                    surface and the step of the rail caused serious inconvenience and numerous
                    accidents to carriages, and the tramways were removed in a few months, after one
                    of them had been successfully indicted as a nuisance. In Birkenhead, in spite of
                    complaints of the inconvenience caused to the general traffic, the original
                    rails remained until 1864, when, after a short length had been laid as an
                    experiment with a rail of the grooved section now in general use (fig. 3), the
                    whole of the tramway, several miles in length, was relaid with it. The tramway
                    was subsequently indicted as a nuisance, but the trial resulted in a verdict in
                    favour of the grooved rail. In 1868 an Act of Parliament authorizing the
                    construction of about 6¾ miles of tramways in Liverpool was obtained; and in
                    1869-71 Acts for 61 miles of tramways in London were passed, and were soon
                    followed by other Acts for tramways in Glasgow, Dublin, Edinburgh, and other
                    provincial towns.</p>
                <p>In 1870 the Tramways Act was passed, enabling the Board of Trade to make
                    provisional orders authorizing the construction of tramways in Great Britain,
                    with the consent of the local authorities, and giving considerable powers for
                    regulating their construction and working. By the Act the gauge, unless
                    otherwise prescribed by special Act, is to be such as will admit of the use of
                    carriages constructed for use on railways of a gauge of 4 feet 8½ inches.
                    Tramways for which Acts had been previously obtained were of 4 feet 8½ inches
                    gauge, to comply with a standing order intended for railways, and not to make
                    them available for railway rolling stock, which the narrow groove of an ordinary
                    tramway rail will not admit. There is reason to think that a narrower gauge,
                    such as 3 feet 6 inches, is often sufficient and preferable to the 4 feet
                    8½inches gauge.</p>
                <p>Tramways in towns, authorized by provisional order, are to be constructed in the
                    middle of the road, and are not to be so laid that for 30 feet and upwards a
                    less space than 9 feet 6 inches shall be left between the outside of the
                    footpath and the rail, if. one-third of the owners or occupiers of premises
                    abutting upon that part of the road object. Vehicles are thus enabled to stop at
                    the road side without hindrance from the tramcars. To leave 9 feet 6 inches on
                    each side of a single line of tramway of 4 feet 8½ inches gauge a street must be
                    upwards of 24 feet wide. No carriage used on a tramway must extend more than 11
                    inches beyond the outer edge of the wheels, and there must be a space of at
                    least 15 inches between the sides of the widest carriages or engines to be used,
                    when passing one another. A width of not less than 3 feet 2 inches between
                    double lines and at passing places is thus necessary, and a double line of
                    tramway, leaving 9 feet 6 inches space on each side, requires a street at least
                    32 feet 6 inches wide between the footways. In narrow roads there is a
                    convenience in having the tramway at the side, and it is sometimes provided for
                    in special Acts. The space between the rails, and for 18 inches beyond them, is
                    repairable as part of the tramway. Power is given to local authorities to
                    purchase tramways at the expiration of twenty-one years, and they may be removed
                    under certain circumstances.</p>
                <p>It appears from a parliamentary return that in 1886 there were 779 miles of
                    street tramways open for traffic in Great Britain, on which a capital of
                    £11,503,438 had been expended, the net receipts for the year being £563,735, and
                    the working expenses 79 per cent. of the gross receipts.</p>
                <p>The grooved rail first laid in England was 4½ inches wide and an inch thick,
                    having a tread or rolling surface for the wheel 1¾ inches wide, and a groove ¾
                    inch deep, ¾ inch wide at the bottom, and 1¼ inches wide at the top (fig. 3).
                    The rail was spiked through to a longitudinal timber laid on cross sleepers, and
                    secured to them by angle brackets and spikes. This rail and method of laying
                    were generally adopted, but it was found that the heads of the spikes wore off,
                    and the rails required respiking, and split and worked loose at the joints. A
                    rail known as the box-rail was introduced, having flanges below on each side,
                    through holes in which clips are driven to fasten the rail to the timber<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n526/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0526-0507"/>. This constitutes a good fastening, and the
                    flanges give stiffness to the rail, but the clips cause gaps between the rail
                    and the paving stones, which lead to the formation of ruts alongside the rails.
                    The longitudinal timbers, instead of being laid on cross sleepers, on which the
                    paving does not bed well, are often fixed in cast-iron chairs connected by
                    transverse tie-bars. A bed of concrete is always laid under the longitudinal
                    timbers, and should extend to the whole width of the paving. The rails first
                    laid weighed 40 lb per yard, but it was soon found desirable to increase the
                    weight to 60 lb per yard. It is, however, impossible to fish the joints of rails
                    like the above, and it was found that the working of the joints under the
                    passage of the cars loosened the ends of the rails, dislocated the paving, and
                    damaged both the tramway cars and ordinary vehicles. Tramways proved hardly able
                    to withstand heavy street traffic; and to provide for steam traction a stronger
                    form of rail and a better system of permanent way became necessary. Many forms
                    of iron bearings have been devised, the rail being either supported continuously
                    or on chairs at intervals. In the best of these the tram rail can be replaced
                    when worn without disturbing the foundation. In the system used in Liverpool
                    cast-iron longitudinal sleepers weighing 80 and 90 lb a yard carry steel rails
                    of a ┬ section (fig. 4) weighing 40 lb a yard, both sleepers and rails being
                    held down by bolts to jaws anchored in the concrete foundation. The rails can be
                    renewed and the sleepers can be taken up with very little disturbance of the
                    paving.</p>
                <p>Steel rails of a flatfooted or a bridge section, and of such a depth as to
                    constitute both rail and sleeper, are also used. In some of the latest and best
                    examples the rail is of a flatfooted section (fig. 5), 6 or 7 inches deep, and 6
                    or 7 inches wide at the base, weighing 65 to 93 lb per yard. The head has a
                    groove either planed out or rolled in it, giving the usual profile to the upper
                    surface. The joints are fished in the ordinary way, and are as strong as the
                    rail itself. Cross ties are sometimes used, but when the rail is slightly bedded
                    in the concrete foundation they are dispensed with. The paving is set in cement
                    close against the rail, and is bedded directly or in sand on the base of the
                    rail, upon which there is a bearing of 1½ or 2 inches. Such a tramway will stand
                    steam traction and the heaviest street traffic, but the rail, which is of an
                    expensive section, requires entire renewal when the head is worn out. Iron or
                    steel continuous bearings are less elastic, and therefore more jarring and noisy
                    than timber sleepers.</p>
                <p>The profile of the upper surface of tram rails has been little altered since the
                    first grooved rail was devised for Birkenhead in 1863, though slight
                    modifications have been made in the form of the groove with the object of
                    lessening tractive resistance. For the sake of the ordinary traffic the groove
                    should not exceed 1 inch in width, and a rounded section with sides splaying
                    outwards facilitates the forcing out of the mud and dirt. A nearly upright side
                    next the tread or rolling surface with a splay on the inner side throws the mud
                    away from the wheel. The upper corners of the rail should be angular, to make as
                    thin a joint as possible between the rail and the paving. There has been a
                    tendency to diminish the width, and a rail as narrow as 3 inches has been laid.
                    A deviation from the usual profile has been adopted in Liverpool, where the
                    groove is in the middle of a rail 3¼ inches wide.</p>
                <p>A tramway must not only afford a good rolling surface capable of bearing the
                    weights running on it, but it must also be able to resist the shocks of heavy
                    vehicles crossing the rails in all directions. The space between the rails, and
                    for 18 inches beyond them, which is repairable with the tramway, is always
                    paved, sometimes in provincial towns and in the suburbs of London with wood, but
                    generally with stone sets in the best manner on a concrete foundation. The sets
                    alongside the rail should be carefully dressed and fitted to make a thin joint.
                    There is much extra wear, and a tendency to form a rut alongside the rail,
                    arising from ordinary wheels using the tram rail, and unless the surface of the
                    paving is kept to the level of the rail the wheels of carriages are caught by
                    the rail, and damage and accidents are caused. To resist the wear near the
                    rails, chilled castiron blocks have been used where the traffic is great. On a
                    macadamized road there is the same tendency to form a rut along the outer edge
                    of the tramway paving, which is to some extent prevented by giving a serrated
                    edge to the paving. There is always great difficulty in keeping the road surface
                    to the level of the paving, and it is better to pave the entire width of a
                    street in which a tramway is laid.</p>
                <p>Although cars can be drawn round very sharp curves, the latter should be as easy
                    as possible. A radius of 150 to 200 feet is the least that should be used when
                    there is any choice, but necessity may compel the use of curves of 50 or even 30
                    feet radius. On such curves, however, the cars are liable to be strained, and
                    the resistance to traction is greatly increased.</p>
                <p>A single line of tramway must have passing places for the cars, consisting of
                    pieces of double line of length sufficient to hold two cars at least, with
                    connecting curves and the necessary points and crossings. Where steam or other
                    mechanical power is to be used the passing loops should be at least 200 feet in
                    length. There is inevitable delay and interference with the street traffic at
                    passing places, and where cars are to be run at frequent intervals it is better
                    to lay down a double line if the street is wide enough. It is a great advantage
                    to the ordinary traffic to have the cars moving always in the same direction on
                    the same line of rails.</p>
                <p>For horse traction fixed points of chilled cast-iron or steel are sufficient, as
                    the driver can turn his horses and direct the car on to either line of rails.
                    When mechanical power is used, drop points or movable points are required. In
                    the former the groove leading into the road to be taken is of the full depth,
                    and the other groove shallow, so that the engine and cars naturally take the
                    former. On coming out of the shallower groove to the deeper there is, however, a
                    drop encountered which is damaging to the rolling stock, and especially to the
                    engines. Movable points require setting by hand, or they are actuated by a
                    spring or balance weight. In one form of spring point one groove is filled up by
                    a tongue which is pressed down by wheels passing out of a loop, but which forms
                    the side of the groove for wheels running the opposite direction. A spring point
                    of steel, which is forced aside by the flange of the wheel passing out, and
                    shuts close again by its own elasticity, is also successfully used. A movable
                    point on one side of the way is sufficient. Crossings are either built up from
                    rails cut to the required angle, or they are cast solid in steel or chilled
                    iron. Filling pieces of the same material, roughened on the surface for
                    foothold, are inserted between the rails at the angles of points and crossings.
                    Both points and crossings wear rapidly, and are troublesome to maintain in good
                    condition, and when not so maintained are dangerous to ordinary traffic.</p>
                <p>The tramcars generally in use in the United Kingdom are constructed to carry 22
                    persons inside and 24 outside. They are 16 feet long in the body, or 24 feet
                    including the platforms at each end, and weigh 2½ to 2¾ tons when empty and
                    about 5½ tons when fully loaded. Smaller cars to carry 20 or 14 persons inside,
                    drawn by one horse, are useful to run at short intervals when the traffic is not
                    great, a frequent service of cars being a great element of success. The car
                    wheels are usually of steel or chilled iron, with a flange half an inch deep,
                    and are fitted with powerful brakes. The axles are about 6 feet apart, giving a
                    short wheel-base to enable the cars to pass sharp curves, but with the
                    disadvantage of overhanging ends. Cars to be drawn by mechanical power,
                    especially if outside passengers are to be carried, should have a flexible
                    wheel-base, either by means of bogie frames or radiating axles. In Hamburg and
                    Copenhagen tramcars have wheels without flanges, and a small guiding wheel
                    running in the groove, which can be raised to allow the car to leave the
                    track.</p>
                <p>The tractive force required on a straight and level tramway is found to vary from
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 150</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> of the load,
                    according to the condition of the rails. On a tramway in average condition it is
                    about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi>. The
                    resistance is thus at the best nearly double that on a railway, and sometimes as
                    much as on a good pavement. This is due to the friction of the flange of the
                    wheel in the grooved rail, and to the circumstance that the latter is always
                    more or less clogged with dirt. The clearance between the flange and the groove
                    is necessarily small, as the former must have sufficient strength, and the
                    latter must be narrow. The least inaccuracy of gauge, therefore, causes extra
                    friction, which is greatly increased on curves. By removing the flanges from two
                    of the four wheels of a tramway car Tresca found that the resistance was reduced
                    from <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 148</hi> of the load. The
                    resistance due to gravity is of course not lessened on a tramway; and, if <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 100</hi> of the load be the
                    tractive force required on the level, twice as much, or <hi rend="superscript">

                    gradient of 1 in 100 and three times as much on a gradient of 1 in 50. To start
                    a tramcar, four or five times as great a pull is required as will keep it in
                    motion afterwards, and the constant starting after stoppages, especially on
                    inclines, is very destructive to horses. Horses employed on tramways are worked
                    only a few hours a day, a day’s work being a journey of 10 or 12 miles, or much
                    less on steep gradients. In London a tram-car horse bought at the age of five
                    years has to be sold at a low price after about four years’ work. On the
                    Edinburgh tramways, in consequence of the steep gradients, the horses last a
                    less time, and they have to be constantly shifted from steep to easier
                    gradients. The cost of traction by horses is generally 6d. or 7d. per mile for
                    two horses, and more when the gradients are steep.</p>
                <p>The application of steam as a motive power on street tramways is attended with
                    special difficulties, arising from the conditions <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0527-0508"/> under which the engines have to work. A tramway
                    engine must be able to draw its load up steep gradients, demanding perhaps seven
                    or eight times the power required on a level, and it must have the necessary
                    adhesion without being too heavy for the permanent way. It must be capable of
                    traversing sharp curves, of going backwards or forwards with safety, and of
                    stopping and starting quickly. For the safety and convenience of the public the
                    Board of Trade require that tramway engines shall have brakes to each wheel, to
                    be applied by hand and by steam, a governor so arranged as to shut off the steam
                    and apply the brakes when the engine exceeds the speed of 10 miles an hour or
                    other stated speed, an indicator to show the speed, a whistle or bell to be
                    sounded as a warning, and a fender to push aside obstructions; the engine must
                    be free from noise produced by blast, and from clatter of machinery such as to
                    constitute a reasonable ground of complaint; and the machinery and fire must be
                    concealed from view; no smoke or steam must be emitted so as to constitute any
                    reasonable ground of complaint to passengers or the public.</p>
                <p>The first attempt to use steam on a modern tramway was with Grantham’s combined
                    engine and car. It was about 25 feet long, having a vertical boiler in a central
                    compartment, with the steam cylinders below, driving one pair of wheels 2 feet 6
                    inches in diameter. It carried 20 passengers inside and 24 outside, weighing 6½
                    tons empty and 12 tons when fully loaded. In a later car the boiler and
                    machinery were at one end, and the body of the car was carried on a bogie frame.
                    In a combined engine and car the λveight of the car and passengers is utilized
                    for adhesion of the driving wheels, and this is conveniently effected in Rowan’s
                    car, in which there are two four-wheel bogies, the leading one carrying the
                    engine and boiler, and half the body of the car and passengers. The engine can
                    be detached from the car for repair and another engine can be substituted in a
                    few minutes. Economy of rolling stock, and the advantage of being able to use
                    cars intended for horses, are in favour of independent engines. They are usually
                    in general construction similar to locomotives, but are enclosed so as to
                    resemble in outward appearance a short tramcar. The cylinders are 6 to 9 inches
                    in diameter, with a stroke of 10 to 12 inches. The wheels are coupled, 2 to 3
                    feet in diameter, and the engines weigh 4 to 6 tons with fuel and water. The
                    governor to shut off steam and apply the brakes when any determined speed is
                    attained is actuated either by the engine wheels or by an independent wheel to
                    prevent the possibility of the brakes being put on when the driving-wheels slip.
                    An effectual way of rendering the exhaust steam invisible is to condense it by
                    passing it through water in a tank, or through a shower of water let off at each
                    blast, but when the water gets hot it must be changed, and in streets it is
                    difficult to get rid of the hot water. Several methods of superheating by
                    passing the exhaust steam through the fire have been adopted, but they are all
                    attended with an increased consumption of fuel, which in cold damp weather is
                    considerable. It is now preferred to pass the steam into tubes exposed to the
                    air on the top of the engine car, from which the condensed water is returned to
                    the feed-tank, to be again pumped into the boiler at a high temperature. Any
                    steam remaining uncondensed passes into the smoke-box. Compound cylinders have
                    been applied to tramway engines, giving a greater range of power, economizing
                    fuel, and rendering the exhaust steam easier to deal with. The extra
                    complication of a compound engine is, however, a drawback.</p>
                <p>The cost of steam traction with engines of ordinary size is generally 3d. to 4d.
                    per mile run by the engine, and more on lines with steep gradients. To this must
                    be added for depreciation 10 per cent., or, according to some authorities, 15
                    per cent. on the original cost of the engines, making altogether 4d. to 6d. per
                    mile run on a tramway with average gradients.</p>
                <p>Fireless engines were first tried in New Orleans, and have been in successful use
                    on tramways in France for some years. The motive power is obtained from water
                    heated under pressure to a very high temperature in stationary boilers and
                    carried in a reservoir, where it gives off steam as the pressure and temperature
                    are reduced. Two tons of water heated to give a steam-pressure of 250 lb to the
                    square inch serves for a run of 8 or 10 miles, leaving more than <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 9</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> of the water and a
                    pressure of 20 to 25 lb above the atmosphere on returning to the boiler. Large
                    boiler-power is required to reheat the engine reservoirs quickly, and this
                    cannot be afforded for only a few engines, but, when worked on a sufficient
                    scale, the fireless engines are claimed to be economical, the economy resulting
                    from the generation of the steam in large stationary boilers.</p>
                <p>Compressed air as a motive power offers the advantage of having neither steam nor
                    the products of combustion to be got rid of. In Scott Moncrieff's engine, which
                    was tried on the Vale of Clyde tramways in 1876, air was compressed to 310 lb on
                    the square inch, and expanded in the cylinders from a uniform working pressure
                    to that of the atmosphere. There is a considerable loss of heat during the
                    expansion of the air which is attended with a serious loss of pressure, and in
                    Mékarski’s system, which has been in use for the propulsion of tramcars at
                    Nantes for seven years, the loss of pressure is considerably lessened by heating
                    the air during expansion. The air, at a pressure of 426 lb per square inch, is
                    stored in cylindrical reservoirs beneath the car, and before use is passed
                    through a vessel three quarters full of water heated to 300° F., by which it is
                    heated and mixed with steam. The heat of the latter is absorbed by the air
                    during its expansion, first to a working pressure which can be regulated by the
                    driver, and then to atmospheric pressure in the cylinders. At Nantes the average
                    cost for three years for propelling a car holding 34 persons was about 6d. per
                    mile.</p>
                <p>In San Francisco a main charged with air at a pressure of about 120 lb per square
                    inch has been laid along the tram route, from which reservoirs on the cars are
                    charged by means of standpipes and flexible connexions at convenient points, the
                    operation taking a very short time. The inventor claims to utilize 30 per cent.
                    of the power applied to the compressor.</p>
                <p>Street tramways worked by means of a wire rope have been in successful operation
                    in San Francisco since 1873. There are now upwards of 24 miles of double line in
                    San Francisco, and 10 miles in Chicago, and the system is being adopted in other
                    American and colonial cities. It has also been in operation in England at
                    Highgate Hill for several years, and is about to be adopted in other localities.
                    The motive power is transmitted from a stationary engine by a rope of steel wire
                    running always in one direction up one track and down the other, in a tube
                    midway between the rails, on pulleys which are arranged so as to suit curves and
                    changes of gradient as well as straight and level lines. Over the rope is a slot
                    ¾ inch wide, in which travels a flat arm of steel connecting the dummy car with
                    the gripper which grasps the cable. The flat arm is in three pieces, the two
                    outer ones constituting a frame which carries the lower jaw of the gripper, with
                    grooved rollers at each end of it, over which the cable runs when the gripper is
                    not in action. The upper jaw is carried by the middle piece, which slides within
                    the outer frame, and can be depressed by a lever or screw, pressing the cable
                    first on the rollers, and then on the lower jaw until it is firmly held. The
                    speed of the cable, which is generally 6 to 8 miles an hour, is thus imparted to
                    the car gradually and without jerk. The arrangements for passing the pulleys,
                    for changing the dummy and cars from one line to the other at the end of the
                    road, for keeping the cable uniformly taut, and for crossings and junctions with
                    other lines are of considerable ingenuity. When the cars are cast off from the
                    cable they must be stopped by hand brakes, which on steep gradients especially
                    must be of great power.</p>
                <p>The system has advantages on double lines with few and easy curves when the
                    gradients are long and steep, and it can be employed on gradients too steep for
                    steam traction. On level lines it is doubtful if it could compete in economy
                    with steam, or even with horse traction, unless with a very frequent service of
                    cars, though then it presents the advantages of being comparatively quiet, and
                    free from smoke and steam, and of admitting a frequent service of cars with
                    little extra cost. On the cable roads of San Francisco it has been found that,
                    of the average daily power employed, 68 per cent. is expended in moving the
                    cables, &amp;c., 28 per cent. for the cars, and 4 per cent. for passengers. It
                    is considered that it is practicable to utilize in moving cars and passengers as
                    much as 50 per cent. of the power, provided the cars are fully loaded and run at
                    short intervals.</p>
                <p>Electricity has been applied as a motive power on a tramway about 2 miles long at
                    Blackpool. The current is conveyed by two copper conductors in a central channel
                    beneath the roadway, and is communicated to the motors in the car by a collector
                    running <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n528/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0528-0509"/> upon the conductors and passing through a narrow
                    slit in the channel. The return current passes through the rails. The cars carry
                    as many as 56 passengers ou a level line. Tramways have also been worked by
                    accumulators at Antwerp and Brussels, but the weight of them appears to be at
                    present prohibitory to this method of applying electricity, except for short
                    trips. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Traction.</hi></p>

                    Adriatic, in the province of Bari, and 26 miles by rail west-north-west of that
                    town, still retains its old walls and bastions, with the citadel, now used as a
                    prison. Some of the streets remain much as they were in the mediaeval period,
                    and many of the houses display more or less of Norman decoration. The cathedral,
                    on a raised open site near the sea, dating from about the year 1100, is a
                    basilica with three apses, a large crypt, and a lofty tower. The arches of the
                    Romanesque portal are beautifully ornamented, in a manner suggestive of Arab
                    influence; the bronze doors, executed by Barisanus of Trani in 1175, rank among
                    the best of their period in southern Italy. The capitals of the pillars in the
                    crypt are fine examples of the Romanesque. The interior of the cathedral has
                    been barbarously modernized. The vicinity of Trani produces an excellent wine
                    (Moscado di Trani); and its figs, oil, almonds, and corn are also profitable
                    articles of trade. The harbour was once deep and good, but latterly has got
                    silted up. The population of the town in 1881 was 25,173 (commune 25,647).</p>

                    princes. Several synagogues continue to afford an indication of its former
