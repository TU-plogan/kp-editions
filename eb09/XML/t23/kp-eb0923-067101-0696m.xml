                    of Tusculum.</p></note> distant to the north-west, on the west the sea near
                    Ostia, and the long range of the Sabine Hills on the north-east. According to
                    tradition, the city was founded by Telegonus, the son of Ulysses and Circe;
                    hence Horace (<hi rend="italic">Epod.,</hi> i. 30) speaks of it as “Circaea
                    moenia” and Ovid (<hi rend="italic">Fast.,</hi> iii. 91) as “Telegoni moenia”
                    (see also Prop., iii. 30, 4, and Sil. Ital., xii. 535). The legendary descent of
                    one of the chief Tusculan families, the gens Mamilia, from Ulysses through
                    Telegonus is commemorated on some denarii struck by the Mamilian gens in the
                    later years of the Roman republic; these have on the reverse a figure of Ulysses
                    recognized by his dog Argo. When Tarquinius Superbus was expelled from Rome his
                    cause was espoused by the chief of Tusculum, Octavius Mamilius, who took a
                    leading part in the formation of the Latin League, composed of the thirty
                    principal cities of Latium, banded together against Rome. Mamilius commanded the
                    Latin army at the battle of Lake Regillus, a piece of water which then lay
                    immediately below the Colles Tusculani, but is now dried up. At this battle (497
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) Mamilius was killed, and the predominance of
                    Rome among the Latin cities was practically established. From that time Tusculum
                    became an ally of Rome, and on that account frequently incurred the hostility of
                    the other Latin cities. In 378 B.C., after an expression of complete submission
                    to Rome, the people of Tusculum received the Roman franchise, and thenceforth
                    the city continued to hold the rank of a <hi rend="italic">municipium.</hi>
                    Several of the chief Roman families were of Tusculan origin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the gentes Mamilia, Fulvia, Fonteia, Juventia, and Porcia; to the
                    last-named the celebrated Catos belonged. During the imperial period little is
                    recorded about Tusculum; but soon after the transference of the seat of empire
                    to Constantinople it became a very important stronghold, and for some centuries
                    its counts occupied a leading position in Rome and were specially influential in
                    the selection of the popes. During the 12th century there were constant
                    struggles between Rome and Tusculum, and towards the close of the century the
                    Romans, supported by the German emperor, gained the upper hand, and the walls of
                    Tusculum, together with the greater part of the city, were destroyed.</p>
                <p>Extensive remains still exist of the massive walls, which surrounded the city,
                    and of its arx—a separate citadel—which stood on an abrupt rock, approached only
                    on one side, that towards the city, with which it was connected by long walls.
                    The walls are built of large blocks of the native “lapis Albanus” or peperino,
                    some of them as much as 5 feet long by 3 feet thick. They probably belong to the
                    early republican period; restorations in concrete faced with “opus reticulatum”
                    of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> can be traced in many
                    places.</p>
                <p>During the latter years of the republic and under the empire Tusculum was a
                    favourite site for the country villas of wealthy Romans. That of Lucullus was
                    very large and magnificent; other handsome houses were built there by Julius
                    Caesar, L. Crassus, Q. Metellus, Marcus Brutus, and others. A palace was erected
                    by Tiberius near Tusculum on the way to Rome, close to the Via Latina.</p>
                <p>The most interesting associations of the city are those connected with Cicero,
                    whose favourite residence and retreat for study and literary work was at
                    Tusculum. It was here that he composed his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Tusculan
                    Disputations</hi> and other philosophical works. Much has been written on the
                    position of his villa, but its true site still remains doubtful. Its grounds are
                    known to have adjoined the more splendid villas of Lucullus and the consul
                    Gabinius (see Cic., <hi rend="italic">De Fin.,</hi> iii. 2, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pro Dom.,</hi> 24). The most probable site is that now marked by
                    the Villa Rufinella to the west of Tusculum, where the hill is divided into two
                    ridges. The scholiast on Horace, <hi rend="italic">Epod.,</hi> i. 30, states
                    that Cicero’s villa was “ad latera superiora,” the plural probably being used in
                    allusion to the double ridge. The other theory, which places the site at Grotta
                    Ferrata, some distance farther to the west, has little evidence to support it.
                    Although Cicero <hi rend="italic">(Pro Sestio,</hi> 43) speaks of his own house
                    as being insignificant in size compared to that of his neighbour Gabinius, yet
                    we gather from other notices in various parts of his works that it was a
                    building of no mean size and pretension. It comprised two gymnasia <hi
                    rend="italic">(Div.,</hi> i. 5), with covered <hi rend="italic">porticus</hi>
                    for exercise and philosophical discussion <hi rend="italic">(Tusc. Disp.,</hi>
                    ii. 3). One of these, which stood on higher ground, was called “the Lyceum,” and
                    contained a library <hi rend="italic">(Div.,</hi> ii. 3); the other, on a lower
                    site, shaded by rows of trees, was called “the Academy.” The main building
                    contained a covered <hi rend="italic">porticus</hi> or cloister, with apsidal
                    recesses <hi rend="italic">(exedrae)</hi> containing seats (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Fam.,</hi> vii. 23). It also had bath-rooms <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ad Fam.,</hi> xiv. 20), and contained a number of works of art, both pictures
                    and statues in bronze and marble <hi rend="italic">(Ep. ad Att.,</hi> i. 1, 8,
                    9,10). The central atrium appears to have been small, as Cicero speaks of it as
                    an <hi rend="italic">atriolum (Ad Quint. Fr.,</hi> iii. 1). The cost of this and
                    the other house which he built at Pompeii led to his being burdened with debt
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ep. ad Att.,</hi> ii. 1). Nothing now exists which can be
                    asserted to be part of Cicero’s villa with any degree of certainty. The
                    so-called “scuola di Cicerone,” near the line of the ancient wall of Tusculum,
                    is the substructure of some building formed in the usual Roman way by a series
                    of vaulted chambers, and is clearly later in date than the time of Cicero. Other
                    remains of houses exist in and near the city, but nothing is known as to their
                    history or ownership.</p>
                <p>Ruins of two theatres still exist. One of them, which is not earlier than the
                    beginning of the 1st century, between the city and the arx, is fairly perfect,
                    and still possesses most of its ancient seats, divided into four <hi
                    rend="italic">cunei</hi> by three flights of steps. Only traces remain <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n697/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0697-0672"/> of the other theatre, which abutted against the
                    long walls that defended the road from the city to the arx. Remains of an
                    amphitheatre of no great size can be traced, dating probably from the 3d
                    century. There is also a large <hi rend="italic">piscina,</hi> near the
                    first-mentioned theatre. In the vicinity of Tusculum a number of interesting
                    tombs have been discovered at various times; some, as for example that of the
                    Furii, contained valuable inscriptions of the 4th and 3d centuries <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>The city was supplied with water by the Aqua Crabra, and near it were the springs
                    which fed two of the Roman aqueducts—the Aqua Tepula and Aqua Virgo (Front., <hi
                    rend="italic">De Aq.,</hi> 8).</p>
