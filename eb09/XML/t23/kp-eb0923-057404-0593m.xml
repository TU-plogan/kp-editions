                <p><label type="entry">TRIPOLI</label>, a North African state, bounded by the
                    Mediterranean on the north, by the desert of Barca (or Libyan Desert), which
                    separates it from Egypt, on the east, by the Sahara and Fezzan on the
                    south-east, south, and southwest, and by Tunis on the north-west. The country is
                    made up of a strip of fertile soil adjacent to the sea, with vast sandy plains
                    and parallel chains of rocky mountains, which finally join the Atlas range near
                    Kairwán in Tunis. It is naturally divided into five parts, viz.,—Tripoli proper,
                    to the north-east of which is the plateau of Barca and Jebel al-Akhdar, to the
                    south the oasis of Fezzan, to the south-east that of Aujala, and to the
                    south-west that of Ghadámes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    are often dry. As regards the coast, it is extremely difficult to fix the exact
                    border between Egypt and Tripoli. The seaboard of the Libyan Desert is so little
                    known to Europeans that the spacious harbours of Tebruk (Tabraca and Tabarka)
                    and Bomba (Bombaea) have almost escaped notice. The land bordering the sea to
                    the west of Cape Rás al-Tín does not partake of the sterile character of the
                    wastes of Barca. The district of Jebel al-Akhdar (“the Green Mountain ”), which
                    intervenes between Rás al-Tín and Benghazi, abounds in wood, water, and other
                    resources; but its ports are scarcely worthy of the name, except Derna (Darnis),
                    where vessels from Alexandria call to embark honey, wool, and wax. From Mersá
                    Suza (Apollonia, later Sozusa), now a mere boat cove, but once a powerful city
                    of Cyrenaica, to Bengházi the coast abounds in extensive ruins. Benghazi itself,
                    on the Bay of Sidra (Syrtis Major), is an insignificant fortified town trading
                    in cattle and other produce. The principal products of the country are corn,
                    barley, olives, saffron, figs, and dates,—these last being perhaps the finest in
                    the whole of North Africa. Fruit also is abundant in certain parts, and so are
                    many kinds of vegetables. The horses and mules, though small, are capable of
                    much hard work. The native tissues and pottery are almost as good as those of
                    Tunis. Great quantities of castor oil come from Tad-jura. In consequence of
                    recent events in Tunis, Tripoli has become the last surviving centre of the
                    caravan trade to Northern Africa. It is at least 250 miles nearer the great
                    marts of the interior than either Tunis or Algiers. A large proportion of the
                    commerce of Tripoli is in the hands of British merchants or dealers in British
                    goods, who send cloth, cutlery, and cotton fabrics southwards and receive in
                    return esparto grass, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The sirocco blows with great
                    force at times during the autumn, and the heat is as a rule much greater than in
                    Tunis. The climate is very variable; cold nights often succeed warm days; storms
                    are of frequent occurrence; and rain is at times wanting for many months. In
                    addition to the capital <hi rend="smallcaps">Tripoli</hi> (see below), called
                    Tarábulus al-Gharb to distinguish it from the town of the same name in Syria,
                    the only important places are Murzuk and Ghadámes in the interior and Benghazi
                    (Berenice) on the coast. The population of the country consists of Moors, Arabs,
                    Kabyles, Kuluglis (descendants of Turkish fathers and Moorish mothers), Turks,
                    Jews, Europeans, and Negroes. Nothing like a census has ever been attempted, and
                    the number of inhabitants is purely a matter of conjecture. In the interior the
                    population is very scattered, and it is not probable that the total exceeds from
                    800,000 to a million. The Europeans (2500 or 3000) on the coast are nearly all
                    Maltese. There is a Jewish colony of about 4000 in the capital, and the trade is
                    almost entirely in their hands and in those of the Maltese.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Since 1835 Tripoli has lost the semi-independent character of a regency which it
                    formerly enjoyed in common with Tunis, and has become a vilayet or outlying
                    province of the Turkish empire. For administrative purposes it is divided into
                    five districts, which are again subdivided into twenty-five cantons, the former
                    being governed by motasarrifs and the latter by caimacams. Each village has its
                    sheikh, who is assisted by a sort of municipal council. Since the invasion of
                    Tunis by the French, the Turkish garrison of Tripoli has been considerably
                    reinforced, and many new fortifications are partially erected on the coast. The
                    chief judge or <hi rend="italic">cacti</hi> is nominated by the Porte; the <hi
                    rend="italic">muftis</hi> are subject to his authority. There are also a
                    criminal court and a commercial tribunal. The taxes are collected by a
                    receiver-general, also nominated from Constantinople, and they press very
                    heavily on all classes of the inhabitants. The principal sources of revenue are
                    the usual Mohammedan taxes. The constant succession of Turkish governors, each
                    of whom invariably follows a different policy from that of his predecessor, has
                    been fatal to the material progress of the country. There are few elementary
                    schools in the capital, and instruction in the interior is entirely limited to
                    the Koran.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> After falling successively into the hands of the
                    Phoenicians, Romans (a four-sided triumphal arch, erected in honour of Aurelius
                    Antoninus and Aurelius Pius, still stands near the Marina gate), Vandals, and
                    Greeks, Tripoli was finally conquered by the Arabs twelve centuries ago, and has
                    remained a Moslem state ever since. In 1510 Ferdinand the Catholic of Spain took
                    it, and thirteen years later it was given to the Knights of St John, who were
                    expelled in 1553 by the Turkish corsairs Dragut and Sinan. Dragut, who
                    afterwards fell in Malta, lies buried in a much venerated <hi rend="italic"
                    >kubba</hi> close to one of the mosques. After his decease the connexion between
                    Tripoli and Constantinople seems to have been considerably weakened. But the
                    Tripolitan pirates soon became the terror and scourge of the Mediterranean; half
                    the states of Europe seem at some time or other to have sent their fleets to
                    bombard the capital. In 1714, when Hosain ibn 'Alí founded the present line of

                    at Tripoli from 1783 to 1793, throw a strange and vivid light on Tripolitan life
                    during the 18th century.</p></note> Ahmed Pasha Caramanli achieved independence,
                    and his descendants governed Tripoli until 1835. In that year the Turks took
                    advantage of a civil war to reassert their authority, and since that date
                    Tripoli has been governed by representatives of the sultan.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">khouan (ikhwán)</hi> or semi-religious semi-political
                    fraternities which exercise such considerable influence in Tunis, Algeria, and
                    Morocco are perhaps still more powerful in Tripoli. The most remarkable is that
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Senúsíya,</hi> the centre of whose authority is Jaghbub
                    or Jerabub, north-west of the oasis of Síwa. The sectaries of Senúsíya are found
                    in all parts of North Africa, but exist in unusual force in Tripoli, and
                    particularly in Ghadámes and Murzuk. A certain halo of romance surrounds the
                    history of this powerful sect; but its chief has, up to the present time (1887),
                    not played any conspicuous part in the affairs of the Soudan or in those of the
                    North African littoral. Mohammed el-Senúsí came originally in 1830 from
                    Mostaghánem in Algeria. He acquired a high reputation for sanctity at Fez in
                    Morocco. After a visit to Mecca and the holy places he started a <hi
                    rend="italic">záwiya</hi> or convent-college at Alexandria, but, being
                    excommunicated by the sheikh al-Islam at Cairo, he fled across the Libyan Desert
                    to the Jebel al-Akhdar near Benghazi. He afterwards removed to Jaghbub, which
                    has never been visited by any European traveller. Here he established his záwiya
                    in the midst of palm-groves and soon gathered nearly a thousand followers. His
                    austere doctrines are received with enthusiasm in the Moslem states of Northern
                    and Central Africa. He established some one hundred sanctuaries in every
                    considerable place between Morocco and Mecca, and appointed mukaddemín or
                    lieutenants in nearly every part of Islam. Senúsí the elder died in 1860 and was
                    succeeded by his son, who bore the title of Al-Mahdí. Under his rule the
                    prosperity of the záwiya at Jerabub is said to have greatly increased. Pilgrims
                    to Mecca from North Africa, as well as those coming from Bornou and the Saharan
                    provinces, flock there to seek his blessing. He not only receives caravans of
                    ivory and ostrich feathers from the different sultans of the interior, but
                    cargoes of arms and ammunition often arrive for him at the almost unknown
                    harbours of the coast. Rohlfs, Nachtigal, and Duveyrier found their passage
                    barred by Senusian agents. It was confidently expected Senúsí would make some
                    demonstration at the beginning of the 14th century of the Hijra (November 1882).
                    His followers were, however, doomed to disappointment. Most of the Tripolitan
                    sheikhs are affiliated to the Senúsíya confraternity.</p>
                <p>From an archaeological point of view Tripoli possesses an interest equal to, if
                    not greater than, that which attaches to Tunis. On this subject the fullest
                    information is afforded by the book of the Beecheys, and in a less degree by
                    that of Mr Rae. The former is illustrated by numerous plans and engravings and
                    still affords the safest guide to the antiquities of Tripoli. (A. Μ. B.)</p>
