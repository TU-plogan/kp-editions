                    type="authorial"><p>The prefix “Tit,” by heedless writers often used alone,
                    though equally proper to the Titlark (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pipit,</hi> vol.
                    xix. p. 112), is perhaps cognate with the Greek τtτis, which originally meant a
                    small chirping bird <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Nat. History,</hi> ser. 4, x. p.
                    227), and has a diminutive form in the Icelandic <hi rend="italic">TiÜingur</hi>
                    —the English or at least Scottish <hi rend="italic">Titling.</hi> It is by false
                    analogy that the plural of Titmouse is made <hi rend="italic">Titmice</hi>; it
                    should be <hi rend="italic">Titmouses.</hi> A nickname is very often added, as
                    with many other familiar English birds, and in this case it is
                    “Tom.’’</p></note> long in use for several species of small English birds, which
                    are further distinguished from one another by some characteristic appellation.
                    These go to make up the genus <hi rend="italic">Parus</hi> of Linnaeus, and with
                    a very uncertain number of other genera form the Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paridae</hi> of modern ornithology. Its 1imits are, however, very ill-defined;
                    and here only the species best known to English readers can be noticed.</p>
                <p>The first to be mentioned is that called from its comparatively large size the
                    Great Titmouse, <hi rend="italic">P. major,</hi> but known also in many parts as
                    the Oxeye,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    signification of this name is obscure. It may perhaps be correlated with a
                    Swedish name for the bird— <hi rend="italic">Talgoxe.</hi></p></note>
                    conspicuous by its black head, white cheeks, and yellow breast, down which runs
                    a black fine, while in spring the cock makes himself heard by a loud love-note
                    that resembles the noise made in sharpening a saw. It is widely distributed
                    throughout the British Islands, and over nearly the whole of Europe and northern
                    Asia. The next is the Blue Titmouse, Bluecap, or Nun, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    caeruleus,</hi> smaller than the last and more common. Its names are so
                    characteristic as to make any description needless. A third common species, but
                    not so numerous as either of the foregoing, is the Coal-Titmouse, <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">oder,</hi> distinguished by its black
                    cap, white cheeks, and white nape. Some interest attaches to this species
                    because of the difference observable between the race inhabiting the scanty
                    remnants of the ancient Scottish forests and that which occurs throughout the
                    rest of Britain. The former is more brightly tinted than the latter, having a
                    clear bluish grey mantle and the lower part of the back greenish, hardly either
                    of which colours are to be seen in the same parts of more southern examples,
                    which last have been described as forming a distinct species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P. britannieus.</hi> But it is to be observed that the denizens of the old
                    Scotch fir-woods are nearly midway in coloration between the dingy southern
                    birds and those which prevail over the greater part of the Continent. It would
                    therefore seem unreasonable to speak of two species only: there should be either
                    three or one, and the latter alternative is to be preferred, provided the
                    existence of the local races be duly recognized. Much the same thing is to be
                    noticed in the next species to be mentioned, the Marsh-Titmouse, <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">palustris,</hi> which, sombre as is its
                    plumage, is subject to considerable local variation in its very extensive range,
                    and has been called <hi rend="italic">P. borealis</hi> in Scandinavia, <hi
                    rend="italic">F</hi><hi rend="italic">alpestris</hi> in the Alps, and <hi
                    rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">lugubris</hi> in south-eastern Europe, to
                    say nothing of forms like <hi rend="italic">P. baicalensis, P.
                    camchatkensis,</hi> and others, whose names denote its local variations in
                    northern Asia, while no great violence is exercised if to these be tacked on <hi
                    rend="italic">P. atricapilla</hi> with several geographical races which inhabit
                    North America. A fifth British species is the rare Crested Titmouse, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. cristatus,</hi> only found in limited districts in Scotland,
                    though common enough, especially in pine-woods, in many parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to state how many species of <hi rend="italic">Parus</hi> exist,
                    their recognition at present being wholly subjective to the view taken by the
                    investigator of the group. Its latest monographer is Dr Gadow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Gat. B. Br. Museum,</hi> viii pp. 3-53), who recognizes fortyeight, besides
                    several sub-species. North-American ornithologists include some fifteen as
                    inhabitants of Canada and the United States; but scarcely two writers agree on
                    this point, owing to the existence of so many local forms. Of the species
                    inhabiting the Indian and Ethiopian Regions there is no space here to treat, and
                    for the same reason the presumably allied forms of Australia and New Zealand
                    must be left unnoticed. During the greater part of the year the various species
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Parus</hi> associate in family parties in a way
                    that has been already described <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii., p.
                    766), and only break up into pairs at the be <hi rend="underline">ginn</hi> ing
                    of the breeding-season. The nests are nearly always placed in a hollow stump,
                    and consist of a mass of moss, feathers, and hair, the last being worked almost
                    into a kind of felt. Thereon the eggs, often to the number of eight or nine, are
                    laid, and these have a translucent white shell, freckled or spotted with
                    rust-colour. The first plumage of the young closely resembles that of the
                    parents; but, so far as is known, it has always a yellower tinge, very apparent
                    on the parts, if there be such, which in the adult are white. Few birds are more
                    restless in disposition, and if “irritability” be the test of high organization,
                    as a much bepraised systematist asserts, the <hi rend="italic">Paridae</hi>
                    should stand very near the top of the list. Most of the European species and
                    some of the North-American become familiar, haunting the neighbourhood of
                    houses, especially in winter, and readily availing themselves of such scraps of
                    food, about the nature of which they are not particular, as they can get.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Persons fond of watching the
                    habits of birds may with little trouble provide a pleasing spectacle by adopting
                    the plan, practised by the late Mr A. E. Knox, of hanging a lump of suet or
                    tallow by a short string to the end of a flexible rod stuck aslant into the
                    ground close to the window of a sitting-r∞m. It is seldom long before a Titmouse
                    of some kind finds the dainty, and once found visits are made to it until every
                    morsel is picked off. The attitudes of the birds as they cling to the swinging
                    lure are very diverting, and none but a Titmouse can succeed in keeping a
                    foothold upon it.</p></note> By gardeners every Titmouse is generally regarded
                    as an enemy, for it is supposed to do infinite damage to the buds of fruit-trees
                    and bushes; but the accusation is wholly false, for the buds destroyed are
                    always found to be those to which a grub—the bird’s real object—has got access,
                    so that there can be little doubt that the Titmouse is a great benefactor to the
                    horticulturist, and hardly ever more so than when the careless spectator of its
                    deeds is supposing it to be bent on mischief.</p>
                <p>Akin to the genus <hi rend="italic">Parus,</hi> but in many respects differing
                    from it, is <hi rend="italic">Acredula,</hi> containing that curious-looking
                    bird the Long-tailed or Bottle-Titmouse, with its many local races or species,
                    which must be here passed over without a word. The bird itself, having its tail
                    longer than its body, is unlike any other found in the northern hemisphere,
                    while its nest is a perfect marvel of construction, being in shape nearly oval
                    with a small hole in one side. The exterior is studded with pieces of lichen,
                    worked into a firm texture of moss, wool, and spiders’ nests, and the inside is
                    profusely lined with soft feathers—2379 having been, says Macgillvray, counted
                    in one example. Not inferior in beauty or ingenuity is the nest built by the
                    Penduline Titmouse, <hi rend="italic">Aegithalus peηdulimιs,</hi> of the south
                    of Europe, which differs, however, not merely in composition but in being
                    suspended to a bough, while the former is nearly always placed between two or
                    more branches.</p>
                <p>The so-called Bearded Titmouse, <hi rend="italic">Panurus biarmwus,</hi> has
                    habits wholly unlike those of any of the foregoing, and certainly does not
                    be!ong to the Family <hi rend="italic">Paridae,</hi> though its real affinity
                    has not yet been clearly shown. It was formerly found in many parts of England,
                    especially in the eastern counties, where it bore the name of Reed-Pheasant<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The common names given to
                    this bird are so very inapplicable that it is a pity that “Silerella” (<hi
                    rend="italic">from</hi><hi rend="italic">siler,</hi> an osier) bestowed upon it
                    by Sir T. Browne, its original discoverer, cannot be restored.</p></note>; but
                    through the draining of meres, the destruction of reed-beds, and (it must be
                    added) the rapacity of collectors it now only exists as a native in a very few
                    localities. It is a beautiful little bird of a bright tawny colour, variegated
                    with black and white, while the cock is further distinguished by a bluish grey
                    head and a black tuft of feathers on each side of the chin. Its chief food seems
                    to be the smaller kinds of freshwater mollusks, which it finds among the
                    reed-beds it seldom quits.</p>
                <p>The general affinities of the <hi rend="italic">Paridae</hi> seem to lie rather
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Sittidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Nuthatch,</hi>
                    vol. xvii. p. 665) and the Tree-Creepers; and those systematists who would ally
                    them to the <hi rend="italic">Laniidae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Shrike,</hi>
                    vol. xxi. p. 845), or still more interpose the last between the former Families,
                    have yet to find grounds for so doing. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
