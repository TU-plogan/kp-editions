                    the peerage in December 1687, and was educated at Eton and King’s College,
                    Cambridge. When he took his seat in the House of Lords his sympathies leant to
                    Toryism, but this predilection soon faded away, and in February 1701-2 it was
                    rumoured among the courtiers that he would hold the office of privy seal in the
                    Whig ministry which William III. had in view. For some years after the accession
                    of Queen Anne he remained without office, but on 29th September 1707 he was
                    created captain of the yeomen of the guard, and in the same year he was summoned
                    to the privy council, a distinction renewed by the queen’s two successors on the
                    throne. The command of the yeomen remained in his hands until 13th June 1711,
                    but its responsibilities did not prevent him from acting as joint
                    plenipotentiary with the duke of Marlborough in the peace negotiations with
                    France which were carried on at Gertruydenberg, near Breda, or from serving as
                    ambassador extraordinary at The Hague congress (2d May 1709-26th March 1711).
                    Townshend was high in favour with George I., and on that king’s arrival at The
                    Hague in September 1714 he published the appointment of Townshend as secretary
                    of state for the southern department, and entrusted to his new minister the
                    privilege of nominating his own colleague. Horace Walpole, his brother-in-law
                    and private secretary, recommended Stanhope for the vacant post, and Stanhope
                    was duly appointed. Townshend did not neglect to avail himself of the advantages
                    afforded by his attendance on the king, and before the arrival of George I. in
                    England he had obtained complete ascendency both over his mind and the
                    dispositions of the advisers by whom his line of conduct was generally
                    determined. The policy of the new ministers at home and abroad lay in the
                    promotion of peace. With this object they endeavoured to limit the charges
                    against their predecessor Harley, Lord Oxford, to high crimes and misdemeanours.
                    To gain this end they brought about, in 1716, an alliance between those ancient
                    rivals in arms, France and England. In spite of their success, their influence
                    was gradually undermined by the intrigues of Lord Sunderland and by the
                    discontent of the Hanoverian favourites, who deemed the places and the pensions
                    which they had gained an insufficient reward for their exertions. In October
                    1716 Stanhope accompanied the king on his journey to Hanover, and during this
                    visit was seduced from his allegiance to his colleagues by the wily Sunderland,
                    who had ingratiated himself into the royal favour. George I. was induced to
                    believe that Townshend and Walpole were caballing with the prince of Wales, and
                    were forming designs against the royal authority. Townshend was dismissed in
                    December 1716 from his place of secretary of state, and was offered in lieu
                    thereof the splendid banishment of lord-lieutenant of Ireland, a gilded sinecure
                    which he at first contemptuously declined and only condescended ultimately to
                    accept on the condition that he was not required to set foot on Irish soil. His
                    latent spirit of hostility to this arrangement quickly developed into open
                    antagonism, and in March 1717 Townshend was dismissed from his position. At the
                    close of May 1720 a partial reconciliation took place between the opposing Whig
                    sections of Stanhope and Townshend. The latter was readmitted into the ministry
                    as lord president of the council (11th June 1720), and his devoted relation and
                    colleague Sir Robert Walpole became paymaster-general. When the South Sea Bubble
                    burst, the fortunes of the principal members of the ministry shared in the
                    misfortune of the scheme which they had promoted. Stanhope, in a paroxysm of
                    passion during a heated debate, broke a bloodvessel, and Sunderland, though
                    acquitted of the charge of personal corruption, was forced to retire into
                    private life. The withdrawal of these statesmen assigned to their rivals <pb

                    (10th February 1721) secretary of state, and Walpole gained the position of
                    first lord of the treasury and chancellor of the exchequer. The death of George
                    I. threatened a change of advisers, but the dismay of the new king’s favourite,
                    Spencer Compton, at being called upon to draw up the royal speech, led to the
                    old ministers of the crown being retained in their places. What the attacks of
                    the opposition could not effect, the internal strife of the administration
                    accomplished. Townshend was of a proud, impetuous disposition, born with a
                    nature more accustomed to rule than to obey. His family had for several
                    generations stood higher in the social life of Norfolk than Walpole’s
                    progenitors, and when he himself attained to distinction in politics his
                    position as a member of the Upper House was greater than that enjoyed by his
                    friend in the Commons. As the power of the Lower House increased, and as Walpole
                    became more and more the object of the attacks of the Tories, the pre-eminence
                    of Townshend passed from him. So long, to use the witty remark of Sir Robert
                    Walpole, as the firm was Townshend and Walpole, things went well with them, but
                    when the positions were reversed jealousies arose between the partners. The
                    growing alienation was hastened by the death, in 1726, of the secretary’s wife,
                    the sister of Walpole. At the close of 1729 Townshend endeavoured to obtain the
                    appointment of his old and attached friend, Lord Chesterfield, as his fellow
                    secretary of state, and the failure of the attempt brought about a fierce scene
                    between Walpole and himself. They broke out into passionate words, seized one
                    another by their coat-collars, and would have come to blows had they not been
                    prevented by their friends who were present. After this outbreak of passion
                    further co-operation was impossible, and Townshend, having the good sense to
                    recognize the position, retired into private life on 15th May 1730. The chief
                    domestic events of his ministry were the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, the
                    partial restoration of Lord Bolingbroke, and the troubles in Ireland over the
                    granting to a man called Wood of a patent for coining pence. Its concluding act
                    was the signing of the treaty of Seville (9th November 1729). Townshend died of
                    apoplexy 21st June 1738.</p>
                <p>Townshend was slow in forming, but resolute in adhering to, his opinion, and,
                    like most other men of that stamp, was impatient of contradiction. His manners
                    have been styled “coarse, rustic, and seemingly brutal,” but these defects were
                    not visible in his domestic life. Never did minister leave office with cleaner
                    hands; he did not add one acre to his estate nor leave large fortunes to his
                    younger children.</p>
