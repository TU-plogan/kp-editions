                <p><label type="entry">TORONTO</label>, the capital of the province of Ontario and
                    the second largest city in the Dominion of Canada, is situated on a large and
                    finely sheltered bay on the north shore of Lake Ontario, between the rivers Don
                    and Humber. The magnetical and meteorological observatory, in the university
                    grounds, stands at a height of 108 feet above the lake, and approximately 342
                    feet above the level of the sea, in lat. 43° 39' 35" N., long. 79° 23' 39" W.
                    Toronto is 39 miles north-east of Hamilton, at the head of Lake Ontario, and 310
                    miles west-south-west of Montreal. The bay is formed by a peninsula or island
                    about 6 miles long, enclosing a fine basin of 3’44 square miles, with a narrow
                    entrance at the west end. This forms a safe and commodious harbour. The city
                    stands on a thick deposit of boulder clay, overlying shaly sandstones of the
                    Cincinnati or Hudson River group, practically equivalent in position to the
                    Caradoc horizon of British geology. These thin-bedded sandstones crop out on the
                    lake shore, and have been quarried for flagging and building purposes at the
                    mouth of the Humber. In the northern part of the city the boulder clay is
                    overlaid by stratified clays of the Post-Glacial age, largely used in the
                    manufacture of bricks, of which many of the houses are built. The site slopes
                    gradually from the margin of the bay for a distance of 3 miles to a terrace or
                    ancient lake margin immediately outside the northern limits of the city, which
                    occupies an area of 12 ’ 83 square miles, or of 17 ’ 99 square miles including
                    the harbour and island. The streets cross each other at right angles. Yonge
                    Street, the main thoroughfare<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n467/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0467-0448"/> running north and south, was constructed as a
                    great military road in 1796, and extends under the same name, for upwards of 30
                    miles, to Lake Simcoe. It constitutes the dividing line of the city, the streets
                    being reckoned east or west according to their relation to it.</p>
                <p>The city is the seat of the provincial Government, with the official residence of
                    the lieutenant-governor, the parliament buildings and Government offices, the
                    courts of law, and the educational departmental buildings for Ontario. The
                    provincial legislature occupies the old parliament buildings erected in 1849,
                    when Toronto was the capital of Upper Canada; but they have long been recognized
                    as inadequate for the purpose. Plans have accordingly been prepared, and the new
                    buildings are now in process of erection. The site is in the centre of the
                    Queen’s Park, a finely wooded park of upwards of 30 acres, originally laid out
                    for the provincial university, and on which the old buildings of King’s College
                    stood. The new university building occupies a fine site immediately to the west.
                    It is an imposing structure, of great architectural beauty, in the Norman style,
                    with a massive central tower. The buildings of the provincial school of
                    practical science, and of the magnetical observatory, are also erected in the
                    university grounds. The observatory is one of the meteorological stations
                    established by the British Government, on the recommendation of the Royal
                    Society, in 1840. It is now maintained by the Dominion Government.</p>
                <p>The university, University College, and the school of practical science embrace
                    in their conjoint teaching a comprehensive system of training in arts and
                    science; and in them upwards of 500 students receive their training in arts, in
                    the natural and applied sciences, and in engineering. There is also a medical
                    faculty, reorganized under a recent Act, in conjunction with the department of
                    science in the university. The university and college constitute unitedly the
                    state institution maintained by public funds, and strictly secular. But it is
                    surrounded with the theological and training colleges of different denominations
                    in affiliation with it, the students of which pursue their undergraduate course
                    in the university for a degree in arts. The affiliated colleges, some of which
                    give degrees in divinity, include Knox College (Presbyterian), Wycliffe College
                    (Church of England), St Michael’s College (Roman Catholic), Macmaster Hall
                    (Baptist), and Victoria College (Methodist). Besides the provincial university
                    and its affiliated colleges, Trinity College (Church of England) gives
                    instruction in divinity and arts, and confers degrees in all the faculties.
                    Toronto and Trinity medical schools occupy convenient buildings in the immediate
                    vicinity of the general hospital, the Burnside lying-in hospital, and the Mercer
                    eye and ear infirmary. The students in medicine number nearly 500, including a
                    small number of lady students, for whom special instruction is provided. Upper
                    Canada College, founded in 1829, is a provincial institution analogous to one of
                    the great English public schools. It has about 300 students. The Collegiate
                    Institute occupies a fine building immediately to the west of the horticultural
                    gardens. It is the higher school, forming an important feature in the provincial
                    system of education, and is maintained, along with the free public schools, from
                    local taxes. Its students number 443, of whom 182 are females.</p>
                <p>Osgoode Hall, the seat of the superior courts of law and equity, is an ornate
                    Italian building, extended at various dates. The provincial asylum for the
                    insane affords accommodation for upwards of 700 patients; it is surrounded with
                    recreation grounds extending to 50 acres.</p>
                <p>The city charities are numerous and well organized. The churches include some
                    large and handsome buildings. Among the more important public buildings are
                    those of the educational department, including a museum and gallery of art,
                    normal and model schools; the customhouse, a fine Renaissance building, with
                    extensive warehouses attached; and the post-office, also of tasteful
                    architectural design. The free city library occupies a commodious building in
                    Church Street, in addition to branch libraries in different parts of the city.
                    It contains upwards of 47,000 vols. There are 35 city public schools, occupying
                    large and commodious buildings, with 262 teachers and 20,213 children. The
                    separate (Roman Catholic) schools number 13, with 60 teachers and 3792
                    children.</p>
                <p>Toronto is the seat of many flourishing industries, including foundries,
                    tanneries, furniture, stove, shoe, and other manufactories, flour-mills,
                    breweries, &amp;c. The site of the city is favourable to commerce. It is the
                    centre of a rich agricultural district; and its harbour is of easy access to the
                    largest vessels that navigate the lakes. It lies directly opposite the mouth of
                    the Niagara river, distant 40 miles; and throughout the season of navigation
                    well-appointed steamers maintain communication with the principal routes of
                    travel in the United States and Canada. By means of the Grand Trunk, the Great
                    Western, the Northern, the Canada Pacific, and other railways, it forms an
                    important commercial centre for distribution; and it is the seat of the head
                    offices of most of the banks and of the chief wholesale trade of western Canada.
                    The direct route from the lower lakes to Lake Superior and the great North-West
                    is by the Northern Railroad to Georgian Bay, where lines of steamers maintain
                    constant communication from Collingwood and Owen Sound to Prince Arthur’s
                    Landing and the railways to Manitoba and the North-West.</p>
                <p>In 1861 the population numbered 44,821; in 1871 it had increased to 56,092; in
                    1881 to 86,415; and in 1887 it is believed to amount to 140,000. The actual
                    number on the assessment rolls is 111,800. The estimated value of real estate in
                    Toronto is $105,000,000. The assessed value in 1886 was $83,556,811. The annual
                    revenue of the city is estimated for 1887 at $1,812,941. The amount of customs
                    duties for the fiscal year ending 30th June 1887 was $4,273,038. The value of
                    exports to the same date was $3,192,157, and of imports $21,020,528. The city
                    returns three members to the Canadian House of Commons, and three to the
                    provincial legislature of Ontario.</p>
                <p>In the despatches of Canadian officials of Louis XIV. in the 17th century Toronto
                    means the country of the Hurons, a region lying between Lake Simcoe and Lake
                    Huron, about 40 miles north. The river Humber, which enters Lake Ontario
                    immediately to the west of the Bay of Toronto, though navigable only for a short
                    distance even by canoes, formed with its portages a line of communication
                    between Lake Ontario and the Huron country. Hence the station near the mouth of
                    the river became the common landing-place for trading and hunting parties bound
                    for the region known of old as Toronto, and so received its name. A French
                    trading post, built there in 1749, and originally named Fort Rouillé, after the
                    French colonial minister Antoine Louis Rouillé, comte de Jouy, was familiarly
                    known as Fort Toronto. The Northern Railway, the first one constructed in Upper
                    Canada, followed the route of the old Indian trail, and established a direct
                    line of communication, by means of steamers from Collingwood, with Lakes Huron,
                    Michigan, and Superior. The railway passes through a fine agricultural country,
                    and is now extended into the Muskoka and Nippitsing districts, bringing an
                    extensive lumbering region into direct communication with Toronto.</p>
                <p>The site for the town was surveyed ini 793 by Surveyor-General Bouchette, under
                    the instruction of the lieutenant-governor, General Simcoe; and in his narrative
                    of the original survey Bouchette describes the untamed aspect of the scene, with
                    the group of wigwams of a little band of Mississaga Indians who constituted the
                    sole occupants of the land; while the waters of the bay and the neighbouring
                    marshes were the haunts of innumerable coveys of wildfowl. The first parliament
                    of Upper Canada held its second session in May 1793 at the town of Newark, at
                    the mouth of the Niagara river; but in the following August the seat of
                    government was transferred to Toronto, to which General Simcoe gave the name of
                    York, in honour of the duke of York, the second son of George III. Under its new
                    name the embryo metropolis <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n468/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0468-0449"/> slowly progressed as the surrounding country was
                    cleared and settled. The entrance to the harbour was guarded by two block
                    houses; provision was made for barracks and garrison stores; buildings were
                    erected for the legislature; and there the members of parliament, summoned by
                    royal proclamation to “meet us in our provincial parliament in our town of
                    York,” assembled on the 1st of June 1797. Sixteen years later the population
                    numbered only 456. The town was twice sacked in the war of 1812. General
                    Dearborn captured it at the head of a force of upwards of 2000 drawn from the
                    neighbouring States. On their advance to the outworks of the garrison, the
                    magazine of the fort exploded, whether by accident or design, killing many of
                    the invaders. The halls of legislature and other buildings were burnt, and the
                    town pillaged. On the restoration of peace the work of creating a capital for
                    Upper Canada had well nigh to begin anew. But the city advanced with the general
                    progress of the country. Trade centred in the little capital; the population
                    increased; and needful manufactures were established. The organization of Upper
                    Canada College in 1830, with a staff of teachers nearly all graduates of
                    Cambridge, gave a great impetus to the city and province. In 1834 the population
                    of York numbered fully 10,000; and an Act of the provincial legislature
                    conferred on it a charter of incorporation, giving it for the first time an
                    efficient system of municipal government, with a mayor, aidermen, and
                    councilmen, entrusted with the administration of its affairs. Under this charter
                    it was constituted a city, with the name of Toronto. (D. W.)</p>
