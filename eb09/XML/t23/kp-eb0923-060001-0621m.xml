                    Saratoff, Russia, situated on the right bank of the lower Volga where it
                    suddenly turns towards the south-east, only 40 miles distant from the Don. It is
                    the terminus of a railway line which begins at Riga and, running
                    south-eastwards, crosses all the main lines which radiate from Moscow to the
                    south. It is also connected by rail with Kaɫatch on the Don, where merchandise
                    from the Sea of Azoff is disembarked and transported by rail to Tsaritsyn, to be
                    sent thence by rail or steamer to different parts of Russia. Corn from Middle
                    Russia for Astrakhan is transferred from the railway to boats at Tsaritsyn;
                    timber and wooden wares from the upper Volga are unloaded here and sent by rail
                    to Kaɫatch; and fish, salt, and fruits sent from Astrakhan by boat up the Volga
                    are here unloaded and despatched by rail to the interior of Russia. The town has
                    grown rapidly since the completion of the railway system, and has a large trade
                    in naphtha from Baku, which is shipped up the Volga to Tsaritsyn and sent thence
                    by rail to the interior of Russia. The railway between the Baskunchak salt lakes
                    of Astrakhan and the Volga has made Tsaritsyn also a depot for the salt trade.
                    In 1882 10,000,000 cwts. of merchandise, valued at one million sterling, were
                    landed at Tsaritsyn, and since then the figures have notably increased. In
                    addition Tsaritsyn is the centre of the trade connected with the mustard
                    plantations of Sarepta, Dubovka, and the neighbourhood; 170,000 cwts. of mustard
                    seed are either ground or converted into oil annually, the exports being 70,000
                    cwts. of mustard and half the corresponding quantity of oil (valued at
                    &lt;£250,000). The fisheries of the place are also important. The population
                    (6750 in 1861) numbered 31,220 in 1882. It is still larger in summer, Tsaritsyn
                    having become the gathering-place of poor people in search of work, and the
                    misery and filth in its poorer quarters are very great. The buildings of the
                    town do not improve proportionately with the increase of wealth. They include a
                    (wooden) theatre, a public library, and two gymnasia for boys and girls. The old
                    church of St John (end of 16th century) is a fine specimen of the architecture
                    of its period.</p>
                <p>Tsaritsyn was founded in the 16th century, when a fort was erected to prevent the
                    incursions of the free Cossacks and runaway serfs who gathered on the lower
                    Volga, as also those of the Kalmucks and Circassians. In 1606 Tsaritsyn took
                    part in the rising in favour of the false Demetrius, and Razin took the town in
                    1670. The Kalmucks and Circassians of the Kuban attacked it repeatedly in the
                    17th century, so that it had to be fortified by a strong earthen and palisaded
                    wall, traces of which are still visible.</p>
