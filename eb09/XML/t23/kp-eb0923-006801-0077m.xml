                    stress of dire poverty, and was marked by a cruel misfortune. During the sack of
                    Brescia in 1512 he was, in the cathedral where he had vainly sought a refuge,
                    horribly mutilated by some infuriated French soldiers. His skull was laid open
                    in three places, his palate cloven, both jawbones fractured. Yet he recovered
                    with no further assistance than his mother’s patient care. He, however, long
                    continued to stammer in his speech, whence the nickname, adopted by himself, of
                    “Tartaglia.” His education remains a mystery. Save for the barest rudiments of
                    reading and writing, he tells us that he had no master; yet we find him at
                    Verona in 1521 an esteemed teacher of mathematics. In 1534 he transferred his
                    residence to Venice, and was there met by Antonio del Fiore with a challenge to
                    one of the intellectual duels then customary. Del Fiore relied on his possession
                    of an undivulged formula by Scipione del Ferro for the solution of a particular
                    case of cubic equations. But Tartaglia had attained in 1530 a similar result,
                    which he now, in February 1535, greatly extended. His consequent triumph over
                    his adversary gave him a high reputation, and his house became the resort of the
                    learned of all grades and nations. The mystery in which he chose to shroud his
                    method of dealing with cubic equations promised him a highly effective weapon in
                    future contests, as well as leisure to perfect, before publishing, the coveted
                    rules. But in 1539 Cardan enticed him to Milan, and there, by unremitting
                    solicitations, procured from him the rude verses in which he had enshrined his
                    discovery (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Algebra,</hi> vol. i. p. 513). The Milanese
                    physician’s breach of his oath of secrecy gave rise to a bitter and lifelong
                    quarrel, the most conspicuous incident in which was a public disputation at
                    Milan, August 10, 1548, at which Cardan shrank from appearing. In 1548 Tartaglia
                    accepted a situation as professor of Euclid at Brescia, but returned to Venice
                    at the end of eighteen months. He died at Venice December 13, 1557. Acrid and
                    emulous in disposition, he incurred abundant enmities; yet his honesty,
                    uprightness, and the morality of his life remain unimpeached. He was
                    keen-witted, diligent, and ingenious, and by his discoveries in the solution of
                    equations helped to initiate the rapid progress of modern mathematics.</p>
                <p>Tartaglia’s first printed work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Nova Scientia</hi>
                    (Venice, .1537), dealt with the theory and practice of gunnery, to which his
                    attention had been drawn in 1531 by the question of a bombardier at Verona as to
                    the elevation giving the greatest range. He easily found it to be 45° (true only
                    <hi rend="italic">in vacuo),</hi> but failed to demonstrate the correctness of
                    his intuition. Indeed, he never shook off the erroneous ideas of his time
                    regarding the paths of projectiles, further than to see that no part of them
                    could be a straight line. He nevertheless inaugurated the scientific treatment
                    of the subject, and his propositions reappeared in most ballistical treatises
                    down to Blondel’s in 1683. The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Nova
                    Scientia</hi> was determined by the menacing attitude of Soliman II. Unless in
                    the interests of Christendom, Tartaglia regarded it as a crime to promote arts
                    of destruction. Inquiries rendered lawful by necessity were, however, resumed in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Quesiti et Invenzioni Diverse,</hi> a collection of the
                    author's replies to questions addressed to him by persons of the most varied
                    conditions, published in 1546, with a dedication to Henry VIII. of England.
                    Problems in artillery occupy two out of nine books; the sixth treats of
                    fortification; the ninth gives several examples of the solution of equations of
                    the third degree. His last years were full of activity. He published in 1551 <hi
                    rend="italic">Rcgola Generate per sollevare ogni affondata Nave, intitolata la
                    Travagliata Invenzionc</hi> (an allusion to his personal troubles at Brescia),
                    setting forth a method for raising sunken ships, and describing the diving-bell,
                    then little known in western Europe. He pursued the subject in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ragionarnenti sopra la Travagliata Invenzionc</hi> (May 1551), adding a table
                    of specific gravities. Of his largest work, entitled <hi rend="italic">General
                    Trattato di Numeri e Misure,</hi> two parts appeared at Venice in 1556, the
                    remaining four posthumously in 1560. This is a comprehensive mathematical
                    treatise, including arithmetic, geometry, mensuration, and algebra as far as
                    quadratic equations. He designed to embody the results of his original
                    investigations in a separate form; but his <hi rend="italic">Algebra Nova</hi>
                    remained unwritten. He published the first Italian translation of Euclid (1543)
                    and the earliest version from the Greek of some of the principal works of
                    Archimedes (1543). These included the tract <hi rend="italic">De Insidentibus
                    Aguae,</hi> of which his Latin now holds the place of the lost Greek text. An
                    Italian version of it is appended to his <hi rend="italic">Ragionarnenti.</hi>
                    Tartaglia was the first Italian writer on fortification, and claimed the
                    invention of the gunner’s quadrant.</p>
                <p>Tartaglia’s own account, of his early life is contained in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quesiti,</hi> lib. vi. p. 74. See also Bittanti’s <hi rend="italic">Discorso di
                    Niccolô Tartaglia,</hi> Brescia, 1871; Buoncompagni, <hi rend="italic">Intorno
                    ad un Testamento inedito di N. Tartaglia,</hi> Milan, 1881; Libri, <hi

                    Illustri,</hi> p. 386. Tartaglia’s writings on gunnery were translated into
                    English by Lucar in 1588, and into French by Rieffel in 1845. Thos. Sainsbury
                    published (London, 1564) an English version of his <hi rend="italic">Travagliata
                    Inventione,</hi> and a selection from his writings appeared at Venice in 1606
                    with the title <hi rend="italic">oρere del Famosissimo Niccolô Tartaglia,</hi> 1
                    vol. 8vo.</p>
