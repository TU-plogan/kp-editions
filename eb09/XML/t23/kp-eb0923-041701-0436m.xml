                <p><label type="entry">TITLES OF HONOUR</label> are words and phrases used for
                    marking and distinguishing the rank or station of the persons to whom they are
                    assigned and appropriated. Whatever may have been their actual or verbal origin,
                    it is certain that among nations which have made any considerable progress in
                    civilization their immediate derivation has been in the great majority of cases
                    from some kind of public office or employment. As Mr Freeman has pointed
                    out,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In <hi
                    rend="italic">Longman!s Mag.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 477 <hi rend="italic"
                    >so</hi></p></note> the principal exceptions to this rule are the merely
                    complimentary additions which it is usual to accord in Europe and America to
                    persons who have no ascertained place or precedence in the social scale. Among
                    ourselves “mister” or “master” <hi rend="italic">(magister)</hi> and its
                    feminine equivalents, and on the Continent <hi rend="italic">signor, señor,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">sieur (senior)</hi> and their feminine equivalents, are
                    the leading examples. They are employed simply to avoid the necessity of calling
                    those to whom they are applied by their proper names only, and are not
                    indicative of any special rank or station. In France, however, <hi rend="italic"
                    >maître,</hi> which answers to our mister or master, is the professional
                    designation of an <hi rend="italic">avocat,</hi> and in England “sir,” which
                    answers to <hi rend="italic">signor, señor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sieur,</hi> is the appropriate prefix to the Christian name and surname of a
                    baronet or a knight. Of the derivatives of <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—don, donna,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dame</hi> —the last in
                    French compounded like <hi rend="italic">sieur</hi> with the possessive pro noun
                    in ordinary speech and appearing in <hi rend="italic">madame</hi> as the
                    feminine equivalent of <hi rend="italic">monsieur,</hi> much the same may be
                    said as of the derivatives of <hi rend="italic">magister</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">senior.</hi> And, although our word “lord” has a special reference
                    to the House of Lords, as the German <hi rend="italic">Herr</hi> has to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Herrenhaus</hi> in certain of its uses, it largely partakes of the
                    character which belongs to them. Its derivation is analogous to theirs, and
                    within somewhat narrower limits it is almost as indiscriminately employed. More
                    strictly lord and lady are the equivalents of baron and baroness, the fifth
                    grade of the British peerage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“The baron alone among the ranks of peerage can hardly be
                    called official, except so far as peerage itself is an office. His title rather
                    marks a rank or class than an office; it does not at once point out even the
                    memory of distinct functions like those of the duke, the marquis, or the earl”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Longman's Mag.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 483).</p></note> But
                    colloquially it is applied to all grades of the peerage except the first; and,
                    though duchesses are not called ladies in society, dukes are unquestionably
                    lords in their capacity as members of the second chamber of the legislature.
                    Certain of the sons and daughters of peers are lords and ladies by courtesy,
                    while the wives of baronets are legally and the wives of knights are
                    conventionally called ladies, although the wives of knights are more accurately
                    described as dames. But besides this we have our 1ord the king and our lady the
                    queen, lord bishops, lord lieutenants, lord justices, lord advocates, lord
                    mayors, lord provosts, lords of the council, lords of the treasury, lords of the
                    admiralty, lords of manors, and a variety of other lords who have no necessary
                    connexion with the nobility. Lord and lady in fact are among the titles of
                    honour which have never been historically associated with any particular
                    function. Lord was originally in Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">hldford,</hi>
                    probably a corruption of <hi rend="italic">hldfweard,</hi> “the warden of
                    bread.” Lady in Anglo-Saxon is <hi rend="italic">hlaefdige,</hi> and has also
                    some connection with <hi rend="italic">hldf.</hi> Neither name acquired by means
                    of official association any definite signification beyond the more or less

                <p>It is exceedingly difficult to distribute titles of honour into rigidly distinct
                    categories. The following is as near an approximation as we are able to
                    make.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Supreme Sovereign Titles.—</hi> Among titles implying
                    sovereignty the first place is occupied by “emperor” and “king.” Under existing
                    international arrangements the crowned heads of Europe take precedence according
                    to the date of their accession, and their rank is precisely the same, whether
                    their style is imperial or royal. But the proper meaning of emperor is the chief
                    of a confederation of states of which kings are members. The German emperor is
                    an emperor in this sense, and he of course has precedence of the kings of
                    Saxony, Bavaria, and Würtemberg, whose dominions are included in his empire. But
                    neither he nor the emperors of Russia and Austria have any precedence as such of
                    the queen of the United Kingdom or the kings of Italy and Spain. Originally the
                    title of king was superior to that of emperor, and it was to avoid the
                    assumption of the superior title of <hi rend="italic">rex</hi> that the chief
                    magistrates of Rome adopted the names of <hi rend="italic">Caesar,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">imperator,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">princeps</hi> to signalize
                    their authority. As <hi rend="italic">imperator</hi> was the distinctive title
                    of the ruler of the Western empire, so <hi rend="italic">βασιλεύς</hi> was the
                    distinctive title of the ruler of the Eastern empire, and the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">βασιλεύς</hi> is the exact equivalent of the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">rex.</hi> The emperor of the East was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >αύτοκράτωρ</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">βασιλεύς.</hi> But <hi
                    rend="italic">βασιλεύς</hi> came to mean the same as <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperator</hi> in so special a way that the word (rife was borrowed to express
                    what had grown to be the inferior dignity of king.<note anchored="true"

                    >Comparative</hi><hi rend="italic">Polities,</hi> p. 353). Mr Freeman notices
                    also the great controversy concerning the imperial titles, especially the word
                    <hi rend="italic">βασιλεύς,</hi> which arose three generations later between the
                    emperors Basil the Macedonian and Lewis the Second. See also John Lydus, <hi

                    Western and the Eastern emperors alike, that the Teutonic word for emperor— <hi
                    rend="italic">kaiser—</hi> was derived. Until recent times, in fact, no
                    sovereign thought of calling himself emperor unless he claimed in some way to
                    represent the Roman Caesars. Down to the beginning of the 19th century a German
                    emperor who was not Roman emperor would have been an anomaly. At remote periods
                    more than one of the West-Saxon kings called himself emperor of Britain, and
                    more than one king of Castile called himself emperor of the Spains. But these
                    assumptions appear to have been merely intended as protests against the
                    assertion of superiority over them by the Roman emperors, German or Greek. Later
                    on the kings of Portugal called themselves emperor of the Indies. But that
                    title, like the queen of the United Kingdom’s title of empress of India, was
                    secondary only and did not affect their official designation in the hierarchy of
                    European sovereigns.</p>
                <p>The title of king does not suggest any of the questions which have been raised by
                    that of emperor. “There is,” as Mr Freeman says, “a common idea of kingship
                    which is at once recognized, however hard it may be to define it. This is shown
                    among other things by the fact that no difficulty is ever felt as to translating
                    the word king and the words which answer to it in other languages.”<note

                    >Comp. Pol.,</hi> p. 138.</p></note> Etymologically indeed the Romance and
                    Teutonic words for king have quite distinct origins. The Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >rex</hi> corresponds to the Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">rajah,</hi> and meant
                    originally steersman. The Teutonic king on the contrary corresponds to the
                    Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">ganaka,</hi> and “simply meant father, the father of
                    a family, the king of his own kin, the father of a clan, the father of a
                    people.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Max Müller, <hi
                    rend="italic">Leet. Sei. Lαng.,</hi> 2d ser., p. 255. “All people, save those
                    who fancy that the name <hi rend="italic">king</hi> has something to do with a
                    Tartar <hi rend="italic">khan</hi> or with a ‘ ‘ canning” or “cunning” man, are
                    agreed that the English <hi rend="italic">cyning</hi> and the Sanskrit <hi
                    rend="italic">ganaka</hi> both come from the same root, from that widely spread
                    root whence comes our own <hi rend="italic">cyn</hi> or kin and the Greek <hi
                    rend="italic">yévos.</hi> The only question is whether there is any connexion
                    between <hi rend="italic">cyning</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ganaka</hi> closer
                    than that which is implied in their both coming from the same original root.
                    That is to say, are we to suppose that <hi rend="italic">cyning</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ganaka</hi> are strictly the some word common to Sanskrit and
                    Teutonic, or is it enough to think that <hi rend="italic">cyning</hi> is an
                    independent formation made after the Teutons had separated themselves from the
                    common stock ?... The difference between the two derivations is not very remote,
                    as the <hi rend="italic">cyn</hi> is the ruling idea in any case; but if we make
                    the word immediately cognate with <hi rend="italic">ganaka</hi> we bring in a
                    notion about <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> the father of his people ’ which has
                    no place if we simply derive <hi rend="italic">cyning</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">cyn'</hi> ’ (Freeman, <hi rend="italic">Comp. Pol.,</hi> pp.
                    450-451; see also his <hi rend="italic">Norm. Conq.,</hi> vol. i. p. 583, and

                    In English there is no feminine form of king like <hi rend="italic"
                    >königin,</hi> the feminine form of <hi rend="italic">könig</hi> in German. As
                    the feminine equivalent of king, queen is used, which Prof. Max Müller says is
                    “the old word for mother.” He also cites the translation of the Bible by Ulfilas
                    in the 4th century to prove its meaning at that early period as wife or woman.
                    The queen was in fact in a special sense “the woman,” or “the wife,” the highest
                    of women and the highest of wives in the kingdom.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The king’s wife was called <hi rend="italic"
                    >regina</hi> in Latin from the beginning; but there is no English word answering
                    to <hi rend="italic">regina</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> we have not and never
                    had any word like the German <hi rend="italic">königin.</hi> The queen is simply

                    husband’s dominions. So the earl’s wife was simply the earl’s wife; the Norman
                    style of countess now came in to fill up what was thought a defect. So with all
                    strictly English titles, knight, sheriff, portreeve, aiderman: they have no
                    feminines; in most cases the wife does not share her husband’s dignity. But the
                    mayor, being a French title, has his mayoress, just as the duke has his duchess”
                    (Freeman on “Titles,” in <hi rend="italic">Longman’s Magazine,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    489).</p></note> King should properly describe the head of a nation in
                    distinction from the head of a tribe, as emperor should properly describe the
                    head of a confederation in distinction from the head of a nation. The idea of
                    territorial sovereignty, of kingship over a land instead of over a people, grew
                    up under the feudal system. In Britain it was unknown until long after the
                    Norman Conquest. William the Conqueror, like Harold or Edward, was king of the
                    English, and it was only from the reign of Henry II. that his successors were
                    transformed into kings of England. The Eastern titles of sultan and shah are
                    accepted as equivalent to those of emperor and king in the West. The sovereigns
                    of China and Japan are called emperors both in common and in diplomatic
                    parlance.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Honorary Religious Titles of Sovereigns.—</hi> The German
                    emperors were formerly styled “defenders of the church,” while the kings of
                    France were called “very Christian majesty” and “eldest sons of the church.” The
                    queen of England is “defender of the faith,” the emperor of Austria as king of
                    Hungary “apostolic majesty,” the emperor of Russia as king of Poland “orthodox
                    majesty,” the king of Spain “catholic majesty,” and the king of Portugal “very
                    faithful majesty.” All these titles were originally conferred by the popes. But
                    the queen of the United Kingdom and the emperor of Austria alone employ them as
                    part of their official description.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">Inferior Titles of Sovereignty.—</hi> Grand-dukes rank
                    next to kings. Grand-duke was the original title of the czars and was introduced
                    into western Europe by Pope Pius V., who created Cosimo de’ Medici grand-duke of
                    Tuscany in the last half of the 16th century. There are now seven reigning
                    grand-dukes in Germany. Prince and duke are titles also borne by the reigning
                    chiefs of minor Germanic states. There are reigning princes of Monaco and
                    Montenegro. The Eastern equivalents for these subordinate titles are khedive,
                    emir, khan, and bey.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Titles of Nobility.—</hi> The titles of the greater
                    nobility are prince, duke, marquis, earl or count, viscount, and baron, and most
                    of them exist in all European empires and kingdoms. In the United Kingdom there
                    are no princes outside the royal family. In Russia there are no dukes except the
                    imperial grand-dukes and neither marquises nor viscounts. In Germany there are
                    no viscounts. Among the titles of the lesser nobility or gentry baronet and
                    esquire are peculiar to the United Kingdom. Knight, chevalier, and ritter are
                    recognized throughout Europe, and as far as Persia and Japan. Of old time in
                    Scotland baron, now represented by laird, was not a title of the greater
                    nobility, and the same may be said of <hi rend="italic">freiherr</hi> in
                    Germany. The peculiar designations of the chiefs of some of the Scottish clans
                    and Irish septs, as The Chisholm, The O’Donoghue, Cameron of Lochiel,
                    Macgillicuddy of the Reeks, and others must also be included among titles of
                    honour. It would be improper to prefix “mister,” or to affix “esquire,” to their
                    names in addressing them either orally or in writing, and their wives are always
                    called madam. Pasha, bey, and effendi are the most familiar of the Eastern
                    titles of nobility. The ecclesiastical titles of archbishop, bishop, dean,
                    &amp;c., and the military and naval titles of field-marshal, admiral, general,
                    colonel, major, captain, &amp;c., are common to all the countries of Europe, and
                    are expressed by words in their several languages which are the precise
                    equivalents of each other. But their incidentally dignified character is so
                    overshadowed by their essentially administrative character that they can be
                    regarded as titles of honour only in the same sense as the titles of officers of
                    state or justice.</p>
                <p>To the foregoing titles of honour may be added the large assortment of
                    complimentary epithets which are attendant on them, and which are used as
                    alternatively descriptive of the persons by whom they are borne. The Roman
                    Caesars were by decree of the senate called in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >augustus,</hi> or sacred, which was rendered in Greek by <hi rend="italic"
                    >σεβαστός,</hi> or adorable. They were also habitually styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >dim, pius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">felix, clemens, tranquillus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sanctissimus. Augustalis majestas</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >àyla</hi><hi rend="italic">βασιλεία</hi> were among the styles of the Western
                    and Eastern emperors respectively. Majesty, sacred majesty, or Caesarean
                    majesty, was the peculiar title of the emperors, and it was not assumed by any
                    of the other sovereigns of Europe until comparatively modern times. But it is
                    said to have been adopted in France as early as the reign of Louis XI.; in
                    England the first king who used it was Henry VIII. Before that the kings of
                    England had been called grace and highness, and sometimes excellent grace and
                    kingly highness. All emperors are now imperial majesties, and all kings
                    majesties, while grand-dukes, royal highnesses, and all infeι∙ior reigning
                    potentates are highnesses of one sort or another. Imperial or royal highness is
                    the proper title of the sons and daughters of emperors and kings, serene
                    highness, or highness merely, being that of the members of princely families.
                    The German <hi rend="italic">hoheit,</hi> although it is commonly employed as
                    the equivalent of highness or <hi rend="italic">altesse,</hi> has a special
                    signification of its own. It holds an intermediate rank between <hi
                    rend="italic">altesse</hi><hi rend="italic">royal</hi> or royal highness and <hi
                    rend="italic">altesse</hi><hi rend="italic">serénissime</hi> or serene highness,
                    unless it is qualified by the adjectives <hi rend="italic">kaiserliche</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">königliche.</hi> For many years, however, it has been
                    appropriated to the less important reigning and the mediatized princely houses,
                    to distinguish them from the princely houses of new creation and the mediatized
                    countly houses, to whom the titles of <hi rend="italic">durchlaucht</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">erlaucht</hi> are severally assigned. In the United Kingdom grace
                    is the title of dukes and duchesses, and lordship and ladyship of all other
                    grades of the peerage and the bearers of courtesy titles of superior rank to any
                    one of them. Dukes and duchesses are styled most noble, marquises and
                    marchionesses most honourable, and all other peers and peeresses, lords and
                    ladies by courtesy; privy councillors and the lord mayor of London are styled
                    right honourable. Honourable is the title of the younger sons of earls, the sons
                    and daughters of viscounts and barons, and the judges of the High Court of
                    Justice. Archbishops are most reverend, bishops right reverend, deans very
                    reverend, archdeacons venerable, and all clergymen reverend. The pope is his
                    holiness, and cardinals are eminences. Viceroys, ambassadors, and governors are
                    excellencies. But we have not yet rivalled the nice gradations in the descending
                    scale of <hi rend="italic">illustres,</hi><hi rend="italic">spectabiles,
                    clarissimi, perfectissimi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">egregii</hi> which
                    characterized the official or administrative hierarchy of the later Roman
                    empire. (F. DR. )</p>
