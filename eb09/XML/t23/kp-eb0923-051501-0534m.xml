                    Circle</hi></label>, an instrument for observing the time of a star’s passing
                    the meridian, at the same time measuring its angular distance from the zenith.
                    The idea of having an instrument (quadrant) fixed in the plane of the meridian
                    occurred even to the ancient astronomers, and is mentioned by Ptolemy, but it
                    was not carried into practice until Tycho Brahe constructed a large meridian
                    quadrant. This instrument enabled the observer to determine simultaneously right
                    ascension and declination, but it does not appear to have been much used for
                    right ascension during the 17th century, the method of equal altitudes by
                    portable quadrants or distance measures with a sextant being preferred (see <hi

                    methods were, however, very inconvenient, which induced <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Roemer</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> to invent the transit instrument about
                    1690. It consists of a horizontal axis in the direction east and west resting on
                    firmly fixed supports, and having a telescope fixed at right angles to it,
                    revolving freely in the plane of the meridian. At the same time Roemer invented
                    the altitude and azimuth instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal
                    angles, and in 1704 he combined a vertical circle with his transit instrument,
                    so as to determine both coordinates at the same time. This latter idea was,
                    however, not adopted elsewhere, although the transit instrument soon came into
                    universal use (the first one at Greenwich was mounted in 1721), and the mural
                    quadrant continued till the end of the century to be employed for determining
                    declinations. The advantage of using a whole circle, as less liable to change
                    its figure, and not requiring reversal in order to observe stars north of the
                    zenith, was then again recognized by <hi rend="smallcaps">Ramsden</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), who also improved the method of reading off angles by
                    means of a micrometer microscope as described below. The making of circles was
                    shortly afterwards taken up by <hi rend="smallcaps">Troughton</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> who in 1806 constructed the first modern transit
                    circle for Mr Groombridge’s observatory at Blackheath, but he afterwards
                    abandoned the idea, and designed the mural circle to take the place of the mural
                    quadrant. In the United Kingdom the transit instrument and mural circle
                    continued till the middle of the present century to be the principal instruments
                    in observatories, the first transit circle constructed there being that at
                    Greenwich (mounted in 1850), but on the Continent the transit circle superseded
                    them from the years 1818-19, when two circles by <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    >Surveying</hi> (vol. xxii. p. 719).</p>
                <p>In the earliest transit instrument the telescope was not placed in the middle of
                    the axis, but much nearer to one end, in order to prevent the axis from bending
                    under the weight of the telescope. It is now always placed in the centre of the
                    axis. The latter consists of one piece of brass or gun-metal with carefully
                    turned cylindrical pivots at each end. The centre of the axis is shaped like a
                    cube, the sides of which form the basis of two cones which end in cylindrical
                    parts. The pivots rest on V-shaped bearings, either let into the massive stone
                    or brick piers which support the instrument or attached to metal frameworks
                    bolted on the tops of the piers. In order to relieve the pivots from the weight
                    of the instrument, which would soon destroy their figure, the cylindrical part
                    of each end of the axis is supported by a hook supplied with friction rollers,
                    and suspended from a lever supported by the pier and counterbalanced so as to
                    leave only about 10 pounds pressure on each bearing. Near each end of the axis
                    is attached a circle or wheel (generally of 3 or 3½ feet diameter) finely
                    divided to 2' or 5' on a slip of silver let into the face of the circle near the
                    circumference. The graduation is read off by means of microscopes, generally
                    four for each circle at 90° from each other, as by taking the mean of the four
                    readings the eccentricity and to a great extent the accidental errors of
                    graduation are eliminated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>On Reichenbach’s circles there were verniers instead of microscopes, and
                    they were attached to an alidade circle, the immovability of which was tested by
                    a level.</p></note> In the earlier instruments by Pistor and Mar-wards they let
                    the piers be tins the microscopes were made narrower, so that the fixed in holes
                    drilled microscopes could be at the through the pier, but after-sides of them,
                    attached to radial arms starting from near the bearings of the axis. This is
                    preferable, as it allows of the temporary attachment of auxiliary microscopes
                    for the purpose of investigating the errors of graduation of the circle, but the
                    plan of the Repsolds and of Simms, to make the piers short and to let the
                    microscopes and supports of the axis be carried by an iron framework, is better
                    still, as no part of the circle is exposed to radiation from the pier, which may
                    cause strain and thereby change the angular distance between various parts of
                    the circle. Each microscope is furnished with a micrometer screw, which moves a
                    frame carrying a cross, or <pb break="no"

                    being estimated) while the number of revolutions are counted by a kind of comb
                    in the field of view. The periodic errors of the screw must be investigated and
                    taken into account, and care must be taken that the microscopes are placed and
                    kept at such a distance from the circle that one revolution will correspond to
                    1', the excess or defect (error of run) being determined from time to time by
                    measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle.</p>
                <p>The telescope consists of two slightly conical tubes screwed to the central cube
                    of the axis. It is of great importance that this connexion should be as firm and
                    the tube as stiff as possible,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    deduced from the observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the
                    tube may be determined by means of two collimators or telescopes placed
                    horizontally in the meridian, north and south of the transit circle, with their
                    object glasses towards it. If these are pointed on one another (through holes in
                    the central cube of the telescope), so that the wire-crosses in their foci
                    coincide, then the telescope, if pointed first to one and then to the other,
                    will have described exactly 180°, and by reading off the circle each time the
                    amount of flexure will be found. Μ. Loewy has constructed a very ingenious

                    following ways :—either the tube is so arranged that eye-piece and object-glass
                    can be interchanged, whereby the mean of two observations of the same star in
                    the two positions of the object-glass will be free from the effect of flexure,
                    or a star is not only observed directly (in zenith distance Z), but also by
                    reflexion from a mercury trough (in zenith distance 180°- <hi rend="italic"

                    observations, before and after reversing the instrument east and west, will only

                    sin4 <hi rend="italic">Z</hi>, &amp;c. In order to raise the instrument a
                    reversing carriage is provided which runs on rails between the piers, and on
                    which the axis with circles and telescope can be raised by a kind of screw-jack,
                    wheeled out from between the piers, turned exactly 180°, wheeled back, and
                    gently lowered on its bearings.</p>
                <p>The eye end of the telescope has in a plane through the focus a number of
                    vertical and one or two horizontal wires (spider lines). The former are used for
                    observing the transits of the stars, each wire furnishing a separate result for
                    the time of transit over the middle wire by adding or subtracting the known
                    interval between the latter and the wire in question. The intervals are
                    determined by observing the time taken by a star of known declination to pass
                    from one wire to the other, the pole star being best on account of its slow
                    motion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The transits are

                    instillment is provided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after
                    having beforehand set to the approximate declination of a star, can clamp the
                    axis so that the telescope cannot be moved except very slowly by a handle
                    pushing the end of a fine screw against the clamp arm, which at the other side
                    is pressed by a strong spring. By this slow motion the star is made to run along
                    one of the horizontal wires (or if there are two close ones, in the middle
                    between them), after which the microscopes are read off. The field or the wires
                    can be illuminated at the observer’s pleasure; the lamps are placed at some
                    distance from the piers in order not to heat the instrument, and the light
                    passes through holes in the piers and through the hollow axis to the cube,
                    whence it is directed to the eye-end by a system of prisms.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The time of the star’s transit over the middle wire is never exactly equal to the
                    actual time of its meridian passage, as the plane in which the telescope turns
                    never absolutely coincides with the meridian. Let the production of the west end
                    of the axis meet the celestial sphere in a point of which the altitude above the
                    horizon is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> (the error of inclination), and of which the

                    correction to the observed time of transit will be (<hi rend="italic">a) [(</hi>

                    >φ</hi> is the latitude of the station and δ the declination of the star (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Geodesy,</hi> vol. x. p. 166). This is called Tobias
                    Mayer’s formula, and is very convenient if only a few observations have to be
                    reduced. Putting <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ - a</hi> cos
                    <hi rend="italic">φ = n,</hi> we get Hansen’s for mula, which gives the

                    tan <hi rend="italic">φ)+c</hi> sec δ, which is more convenient for a greater
                    number of observations. The daily aberration is always deducted from <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>, as it is also multiplied by sec δ (being 0".31cos <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> secδ). The above corrections are for upper culmination;
                    below the pole 180° - δ has to be substituted for δ. The constant <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> is determined by pointing the instrument on one of the
                    collimators, measuring the distance of its wire-cross from the centre wire of
                    the transit circle by a vertical wire movable by a micrometer screw, reversing
                    the instrument and repeating the operation, or (without reversing) by pointing
                    the two collimators on one another and measuring the distance of first one and
                    then the other wire-cross from the centre wire. The inclination <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> is measured directly by a level which can be suspended on
                    the pivots. Having thus found <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and c, the observation of
                    two stars of known right ascension will furnish two equations from which the
                    clock error and the azimuth can be found. For finding the azimuth it is most
                    advantageous to use two stars differing as nearly 90° in declination as
                    possible, such as a star near the pole and one near the equator, or better still
                    (if the weather permits it) two successive meridian transits of a close
                    circumpolar star (one above and one below the pole), as in this case errors in
                    the assumed right ascension will not influence the result.</p>
                <p>The interval of time between the culminations or meridian transits of two stars
                    is their difference of right ascension, 24 hours corresponding to 360° or 1 hour
                    to 15°. If once the <hi rend="italic">absolute right ascensions</hi> of a number
                    of <hi rend="italic">standard stars</hi> are known, it is very simple by means
                    of these to determine the R.A. of any number of stars. The absolute R.A. of a
                    star is found by observing the interval of time between its culmination and that
                    of the sun. If the inclination of the ecliptic (ε) is known, and the declination
                    of the sun (δ) is observed at the time of transit, we have sin <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> tan ε = tanδ, which gives the R. A. of the sun, from which together with
                    the observed interval of time corrected for the rate of the clock, we get the
                    R.A. of the star. Differentiation of the formula shows that observations near
                    the equinoxes are most advantageous, and that errors in the assumed ε and the
                    observed δ will have no influence if the ∆α is observed at two epochs when the
                    sun’s R.A. is A and 180-A or as near thereto as possible. A great number of
                    observations of this kind will furnish materials for a standard catalogue; but
                    the right ascensions of many important catalogues have been found by making use
                    of the R.A.’s of a previous catalogue to determine the clock error and thus to
                    improve the individual adopted R.A.’s of the former catalogue.</p>
                <p>In order to determine absolute declinations or polar distances, it is first
                    necessary to determine the co-latitude (or distance of the pole from the zenith)
                    by observing the upper and lower culmination of a number of circumpolar stars.
                    The difference between the circle reading after observing a star and the reading
                    corresponding to the zenith is the zenith distance of the star, and this plus
                    the co-latitude is the north polar distance or 90° - δ. In order to determine
                    the zenith point of the circle, the telescope is directed vertically downwards
                    and a basin of mercury is placed under it, forming an absolutely horizontal
                    mirror. Looking through the telescope the observer sees the horizontal wire and
                    a reflected image of the same, and if the telescope is moved so as to make these
                    coincide, its optical axis will be perpendicular to the plane of the horizon,
                    and the circle reading will be 180° + zenith point. In observations of stars
                    refraction has to be taken into account as well as the errors of graduation and
                    flexure, and, if the bisection of the star on the horizontal wire was not made
                    in the centre of the field, allowance must be made for curvature (or the
                    deviation of the star’s path from a great circle) and for the inclination of the
                    horizontal wire to the horizon. The amount of this inclination is found by
                    taking repeated observations of the zenith distance of a star during the one
                    transit, the pole star being most suitable owing to its slow motion.</p>
