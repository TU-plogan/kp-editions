                    Persia, whence it originally reached western Europe by way of Turkey, and thus
                    came to be called by the Venetians, who imported it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >turchesa,</hi> and by the French <hi rend="italic">turquoise.</hi> It is
                    chemically a hydrated phosphate of aluminium, associated with a variable
                    proportion of hydrated phosphate of copper, to which it owes much of its colour.
                    The green tints of certain varieties appear to be due to admixture with salts of
                    iron. A fine blue Persian turquoise, analysed by Prof. A. H. Church,
                    yielded—alumina 40∙19, phosphorus pentoxide 32∙86, water 19∙34, cupric oxide
                    5∙27, ferrous oxide 2∙21, and manganous oxide 0∙36. The most valued tint of the
                    turquoise is a delicate blue, inclining slightly to green; in many specimens the
                    green becomes more pronounced with age. Although the turquoise is practically
                    opaque, sections may be ground so thin as to admit of examination by transmitted
                    light. Its microscopic structure was first studied by Prof. Fischer of Freiburg
                    (Baden), afterwards by H. Bücking of Strasburg, and recently by Clarke and
                    Diller.</p>

                <p>Thin sections are almost colourless. Between crossed Nicols they show either a
                    fibrous texture or a finely-granular aggregate of doubly-refracting particles
                    without definite crystalline outlines. The mineral has never been found
                    crystallized, but occurs as veins, nodules, stalactitic masses, and
                    incrustations. Large pieces are exceedingly rare. The specific gravity of
                    turquoise is about 2∙75, and its hardness below 6; it takes a fair polish and
                    exhibits a feeble lustre. It is usually cut <hi rend="italic">en cabochon</hi>
                    or with a low convex surface, and in the East is frequently engraved with
                    Persian and Arabic inscriptions, generally passages from the Koran,— the incised
                    characters being in many cases gilt. Such objects are worn as amulets. The
                    turquoise has always been associated with curious superstitions, the most common
                    being the notion that it changes colour with variations in the state of its
                    owner’s health, or even in sympathy with his affections.</p>
                <p>Persia is the chief centre of the turquoise trade, where the same mines have been
                    worked for at least eight centuries. The finest stones are found near Nishápúr
                    in Khorasan (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 622).
                    Tavernier, writing in the 17th century, states that the best turquoise, reserved
                    for the sole use of the shall, was obtained from the mine which he describes as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vieille Roche,</hi> while inferior stones were got from
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Roche.</hi> These terms still survive, all
                    turquoise of fine colour being said in trade to be from the “old rock,” and that
                    which is pale, or changes tint on exposure, is from the “new rock.” According to
                    a recent report by Consul Benjamin at Teheran the best turquoise is found at Abú
                    Riáh, and all the Khorasan mines are farmed by a few prominent officials, who
                    pay to the shah an annual rent of about £6500. Dr Tietze has lately described
                    specimens of the matrix of the mineral brought to Vienna from Persia by General
                    Schindler. These show that the turquoise occurs, not in clay-slate, as is often
                    stated, but in a porphyritic trachyte or trachytic breccia, and in loose
                    fragments in the neighbouring alluvium. The mineral is also found in Kerman in
                    southern Persia, but the stone is of pale colour, tending to fade, and the mines
                    which yield it are now nearly abandoned. In 1849 Major C. Macdonald found
                    turquoise in Wady Maghara and Wady Sidreh, near <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sinai</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>), where, according to Mr H. Bauerman, it
                    lines the open joints of a ferruginous sandstone, and is also embedded in small
                    ochreous nodules in the rock itself. The redder the rock the finer the colour of
                    the associated turquoise. As the colour is liable to fade, the Arabian turquoise
                    has not a good name among jewellers, and the workings were abandoned by
                    Macdonald in 1865. In Wady Maghara there are relics of extensive mining
                    operations, presumably for turquoise, of so early a date that the rock was
                    wrought by flint implements. The early inhabitants of Mexico made much use of
                    this mineral for inlaying obsidian ornaments, and for mosaic work with
                    iron-pyrites. It was probably one of the stones known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >chalchihuitl.</hi> In 1858 Prof. W. P. Blake called attention to the occurrence
                    of turquoise at Cerillos, about 22 miles southwest of Santa Fé, in New Mexico,
                    where mining operations for this mineral were carried on two centuries ago. The
                    turquoise varies in colour from sky-blue to apple-green, and is found as nodules
                    and small veins in a felspathic rock of microgranitic texture, probably of
                    eruptive origin. The mines of Cerillos are no longer worked. A similar green
                    mineral is found at Turquoise Mountain in Cochise county and at Mineral Park,
                    Mohave county, Arizona. It also occurs to a small extent in southern Nevada,
                    where it is found as blue grains disseminated through a sandstone. In Europe,
                    the turquoise is found at Oelsnitz in Saxony and near Jordansmühl in Silesia,
                    occurring at the latter locality in clay-slate. Under the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">callais</hi> and <hi rend="italic">callaina</hi> Pliny described a
                    green mineral which, if not our turquoise, seems to have been very closely
                    related to it. A bright green mineral, wrought into beads, and found with stone
                    hatchets in ancient graves at Men-er Hroeck (Rock of the Fairy) in Brittany, was
                    described in 1864 by Μ. Damour, who, seeking to identify it with Pliny’s <hi
                    rend="italic">callais,</hi> revived this name. Dana afterwards brought the word
                    into harmony with our mineralogical nomenclature by writing it callainite. The
                    mineral in question is a hydrated phosphate of aluminium, apparently identical
                    with Breithaupt’s variscite. By many mineralogists the true torquoise is called
                    calaite (see vol. xvi. p. 405).</p>
                <p>Turquoise is commonly imitated by enamels, but of late some ingenious
                    counterfeits have been made with the same chemical composition as the natural
                    stone. To increase the deception, ]&gt;ieces of ochreous matter are inserted at
                    the back of the artificial turquoise, to imitate the natural matrix. In order to
                    distinguish between the genuine stone and its imitations, Pohl recommends that a
                    splinter should be strongly heated in a platinum capsule, when the true
                    turquoise is reduced to a brownish black powder or a friable mass with a
                    decrepitating sound; the false turquoise does not decrepitate, but either fuses
                    to a glass or is reduced to a frit.</p>
