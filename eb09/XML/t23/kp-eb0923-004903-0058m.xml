                <p><label type="entry">TAPE-WORMS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cestoda</hi></label>, are
                    a group of worms forming one of the three main divisions of the <hi

                    >Turbellaria</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plan Arians</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Nemertines)</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trematoda</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Trematod a).</hi> They have been defined as follows :—“Flat
                    worms without mouth or alimentary canal, which typically develop by alternation
                    of generations, by budding from a generally pear-shaped nurse, with which they
                    remain united for a lengthened period as a ribbon-like colony or ‘ strobila.’
                    The individual joints of the colony, <hi rend="italic">ie.,</hi> the sexual
                    animals or ‘ proglottides,’ increase in size and maturity as they are removed
                    farther from their origin by the intercalation of new buds, but are not
                    distinguished in any special way. The nurse, however, known by the name of the ‘
                    head ’ <hi rend="italic">(scolex)</hi> is provided with four or two suckers, and
                    usually with curved claw-like hooks. The dorsal and ventral surfaces of the head
                    are perfectly identical, so that the arrangement of the hooks presents a
                    strikingly radiate appearance. By means of this apparatus the worms fasten
                    themselves on the intestinal membrane of their hosts, which (except in the case
                    of the otherwise peculiar <hi rend="italic">Λrchigetes)</hi> all belong to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> The nurses develop from little round
                    six-hooked embryos in a more or less complicated fashion as so-called ‘
                    bladder-worms.’ The latter inhabit very diverse, but usually parenchymatous,
                    organs of the higher and lower animals, and are thence passively transferred to
                    the intestine of their subsequent host” (Leuckart, 1,<note anchored="true"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Historical Sketch.</hi> —Certain forms of Cestodes have been
                    known from time immemorial. The hydatid cyst is alluded to by. early medical
                    writers, and Aristotle speaks of examining the tongue of pigs to ascertain the
                    presence of bladder-worms. By this author and Hippocrates the Cestodes and other
                    flat worms are spoken of as ελp,ιv0ev 7rλατ∈7αι, in opposition to the στρογγυλοί
                    or “round worms”; the word <hi rend="italic">Tεenia</hi> (Gr. ταινία) does not
                    occur in Greek authors, but is first used by the Romans (Pliny, <hi
                    rend="italic">H.</hi> A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>., xi. 33). In the
                    treatises of the Middle Ages the tape-worm figured as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lumbricus latus,</hi> only one species being recognized. Felix Plater (23)
                    separated <hi rend="italic">Bothriocephalus</hi> from the other human
                    tape-worms, and Andry (24) gave it the name <hi rend="italic">Tenia à
                    épine,</hi> mistaking the nodular generative organs for vertebrae. The
                    appellation <hi rend="italic">Bothriocephalus latus</hi> dates from Bremser,
                    1819 (25). Like other <hi rend="italic">Entozoa,</hi> the tape-worms and
                    bladder-worms were supposed to arise by spontaneous generation; it was found,
                    however, that animal forms strikingly like the <hi rend="italic">Entozoa</hi>
                    sometimes lived freely. Pallas (19), seeing that the eggs of intestinal worms
                    are expelled from the animals in which they live, and may remain for some time
                    unaltered in water, suggested the hypothesis that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Entozoa</hi> agree with other animals in originating from eggs which can be <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0059-0050"/> carried from one animal to another. He also
                    supposed that they reached the liver and other internal organs by means of the
                    blood-stream. Other authorities endeavoured to explain the presence of <hi
                    rend="italic">Entozoa</hi> by supposing that they were transmitted from parents
                    to children. Von Siebold (26) in 1838 discovered the six-hooked embryos of <hi
                    rend="italic">Taenia,</hi> and came to the conclusion that they could only pass
                    into the fully-formed animal by a kind of metamorphosis. The subject was fully
                    discussed by Eschricht (27), who endeavoured to prove that this phenomenon was
                    of common occurrence among the <hi rend="italic">Entozoa.</hi> Shortly
                    afterwards appeared Steenstrup’s famous work upon the alternation of generations
                    (28), which furnished a ready explanation of the isolated facts till then
                    observed regarding the Cestodes. The most important advances in modern times
                    have been due to the introduction of helminthological experiment by
                    Küchenmeister, by means of which the demonstration has been furnished that
                    certain bladder-worms are the larval stages of particular tape-worms. The first
                    of these experiments took place in 1851, when Küchenmeister fed a dog with
                    bladder-worms from the rabbit, and a cat with specimens from the mouse, and
                    succeeded in rearing tapeworms in their intestines (29). Similar investigations
                    on different specieshave been made by Van Beneden, Leuckart, and others. Of
                    systematic treatises the most important are those of Rudolphi (35), Diesing
                    (20), and Van Beneden (13), while Von Linstow, in addition to numerous scattered
                    papers (30, 36), has given us an invaluable list of hosts with their respective
                    parasites (21).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anatomy.</hi></p>
                <p>In considering the anatomical peculiarities of the <hi rend="italic">Cestοdα</hi>
                    it will be convenient to describe one particular species and afterwards to
                    indicate the chief differences presented by other members of the group. For this
                    purpose <hi rend="italic">Taenia saginata,</hi> Goze(7'. <hi rend="italic"
                    >mcdiοcanellata,</hi> Küchenmeister), may be selected as a type, as it has been
                    perhaps more studied than any other, and is one of the species most commonly
                    found in man; for further details, see Sommer (31).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dimensions.—</hi> An average specimen of this tape-worm (fig.
                    1, A) will measure in a state of moderate contraction about 500 cm., and consist
                    of nearly 1400 segments; of those which immediately follow the head more than
                    250 will be found within a length of 5 cm.; they gradually widen posteriorly,
                    until the widest, which are situated about half-way down the chain, have a
                    breadth of 14 mm. and a length of 6 mm.; whilst the terminal segments measure 5
                    mm. in breadth by 19 mm. in length.</p>
                <p>The head (fig. 1, B) is spheroidal, 1 ‘5 mm. in diameter, and bears on its
                    lateral surface four equidistant suckers, which serve for the attachment of the
                    whole worm. After death these are generally retracted, but during life they can
                    be protruded and moved in all directions. They are a special development of the
                    musculature of the body-wall, the radial fibres being the most conspicuous. The
                    tape-worm now being described is abnormal, inasmuch as the front of its head is
                    not provided with a circlet of hooks; these are well seen, however, in the other
                    common human tape-worm <hi rend="italic">(Taenia solium),</hi> which bears a
                    double ring of them, situated around a button-shaped muscular pad <hi
                    rend="italic">(rostellum)</hi> which forms the apex of the head (fig. 1, C). By
                    the varying contraction of the separate parts of this organ the hooks may be
                    moved in different directions, and when the worm is attaching itself they are
                    first extended directly forwards, and then brought back so as to force the
                    rostellum into the tissues of the host. Each hook has a broad bifid base, to w
                    hich the muscles are attached, supporting a long curved point. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Taenia saginata,</hi> to the consideration of which we now return,
                    the rostellum is quite rudimentary, and has been described by earlier authors as
                    a fifth sucker or even as a mouth; it is interesting to note that during its
                    incipient stages it bears a number of minute spines homologous with the hooks of
                    other species. The head contains furthermore the anterior portions of the
                    nervous and excretory systems. The latter of these consists of an annular vessel
                    placed immediately below the rostellum, from which four canals, corresponding to
                    the four suckers, pass backwards; two of these gradually disappear, leaving two
                    which pursue their course down the proglottides, in connexion with which they
                    will be again alluded to, and open at the hinder extremity of the worm by a
                    common pore. The nervous system of the Cestodes was long sought in vain:
                    although some early investigators described a ganglion, they were unable to give
                    any satisfactory proof of its existence, this having been first furnished by
                    Schneider. It seems generally to consist of a central ganglion lying within the
                    head, from which two cords proceed backwards; these were regarded by Sommer and
                    Landois as part of the alimentary system. Niemiec (6) has recently given a
                    detailed account of its structure in several different species, and its
                    relations have been discussed by Lang (7).</p>
                <p>The proglottides arise by a species of budding in the narrow neck which
                    immediately succeeds the head; they are separated from each other by grooves,
                    which are at first so shallow and indistinct that it is impossible to say with
                    certainty where the segmentation really begins. The proglottides which have
                    attained sexual maturity are situated some 30-40 cm. from the head, and measure
                    1 5 mm. in length by 5 mm. in breadth. The segments, like the head, consist of a
                    solid mass of tissue in which the various organs are imbedded. Like the
                    Trematodes, the Cestodes were long thought to have no body-cavity or coelom, and
                    hence were called “parenchymatous” worms. Kecently, however, a series of
                    intercellular spaces has been described by Fraipont (8) as leading into the
                    terminal excretory organs, and these spaces have been interpreted both by
                    himself and others as the homologue of a bodycavity, although this opinion has
                    not been allowed to pass unchallenged (see Pintner, 9). The surface of the body
                    is covered by a thin clear homogeneous cuticle, which, according to some
                    authorities, is perforated by fine closely-set pores. The hooks which have been
                    described above, as well as the small spines and bristles found in certain
                    species, are developments of this cuticle. This external covering cannot,
                    according to Leuckart (1, p. 289), be regarded as homologous with the cuticle of
                    other invertebrates, inasmuch as it is not a secretion from a special layer of
                    subjacent cells, but is “the structureless limiting membrane of the connective
                    tissue substance, and is comparable with the so-called basementmembrane found in
                    the other flat-worms . . . between the muscular layer and the dermal
                    epithelium.” It is to be observed, however, that this view has by no means found
                    universal acceptance (see <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n60/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0060-0051"/> Steudener, 10), and it is <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> improbable, since the Cestodes (and Trematodes) would thus form an
                    exception to the general rule by which all animals are clad with an epithelium
                    derived from the embryonic ectoderm. The subcuticular layer is described as
                    consisting of long fusiform cells (probably modified connective-tissue cells)
                    disposed perpendicularly to the cuticle. It seems possible that they are in
                    direct connexion with the transverse muscles of the body. The matrix of the
                    Cestode body consists of connective tissue, the cells composing which are seldom
                    provided with a distinct membrane, and sometimes can only be separately
                    distinguished by their nuclei. The layer of muscles (see below) separates this
                    matrix into a central and a cortical portion. Distributed in it, and especially
                    in its cortical portion, are numerous calcareous corpuscles, which are generally
                    spheroidal in form, varying up to 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 019 mm. in
                    diameter and concentrically laminated; they contain a large amount (often 20 per
                    cent.) of lime salts, diffused through an organic basis, from which the salts
                    can be removed with effervescence by the action of acids. These corpuscles have
                    been variously interpreted by the older authors as eggs, or as lymph or blood
                    corpuscles, but the only theories which have been seriously maintained in modern
                    times are—(1) that they are skeletal (Von Siebold); (2) that they are excretory
                    (Claparède, Griesbach); or (3) that they form a reserve store of calcareous
                    material to be used either in counteracting the acid digestive juices of the
                    host or for the production of egg-shells (Leuckart, 1, p. 283).</p>
                <p>The muscular system consists of three sets of fibres—longitudinal, transverse,
                    and sagittal. The first are the best developed, and run down the inner part of
                    the cortical layer in the form of strong bands; the second set lie immediately
                    below them and pass across the body in the form of two flat muscular plates,
                    which converge towards each other as they approach the margins of the
                    proglottis; the sagittal muscles run primitively straight from one flat surface
                    of the body to the other, but their direction is much modified after the growth
                    of the genital organs, between the various parts of which they lie as isolated
                    bundles; they are the weakest of all the sets. The muscular fibres are
                    non-striated, and when they are fully developed no nucleus can be detected in
                    them. They taper towards the extremities, sometimes branching dichotomously,
                    and, as above mentioned, a connexion has been asserted to be visible between
                    them and the subcuticular cells.</p>
                <p>The excretory system in the proglottides consists of two or four longitudinal
                    canals which lie along their two narrow margins (fig. 1, D, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ex.).</hi> The origin of these in the head has been already noted, and they
                    pass continuously down the whole worm until they open into a vesicle at the
                    posterior extremity of the terminal segment. In the hinder part of each
                    proglottis they are connected by a transverse vessel (fig. 1, D, ir.),
                    immediately above which a valve is formed by a duplicature of the wall, so that
                    it is impossible to inject the excretory system from behind whilst fluid can be
                    readily forced along it from before backwards. Fraipont has drawn a distinction
                    between ascending and descending canals. Excretory openings have been described
                    by various observers in the anterior portion of the worm, near the suckers
                    (Wagener, 11; Fraipont, 8; Riehm, 12), and, although their presence is denied by
                    Pintner (9), there seems sufficient evidence to show that they are more
                    generally present than was formerly supposed. A ramifying network of smaller
                    vessels connected with the main trunks just described is found in the more
                    superficial parenchyma, and this in its turn gives off still finer capillaries
                    which terminate in ciliated funnels. According to Fraipont these open into the
                    intercellular lacunae which are the representatives of the coelom (see above),
                    whilst Pintner maintains that the terminal funnels are completely closed, and
                    are to be regarded as unicellular glands. The subject, however, is one of
                    extreme difficulty and demands further investigation. It is worthy of notice
                    that each of the three systems of canals above described maintains its proper
                    diameter throughout, and that no intermediate sizescan be found. The “plasmatic
                    vascular system” described by Sommer and Landois, and regarded by them as part
                    of the alimentary system, consists partly of some of these delicate canals and
                    partly of the two cords of the nervous system. The main canals open posteriorly
                    into a pulsatile vesicle, at the end of the last proglottis; when, however, some
                    of these have been cast off the opening may be either by a shortened transverse
                    vesicle, as Leuckart (1) maintains to be the case in the present species, or by
                    separate openings, one for each canal.</p>
                <p>The reproductive organs are serially repeated in the proglottides, each of which
                    contains a complete set of male and female organs (fig. 1, D). The male organs
                    may be discussed first. The testes <hi rend="italic">{t.,</hi> i.) are very
                    numerous and scattered throughout the greater part of the proglottis; they are
                    roħnd vesicles (0T5 mm. in diameter) containing spermatozoa, and attached like
                    berries to the terminai ramifications of the vas deferens <hi rend="italic">(υ.
                    d.</hi>); these gradually unite, forming larger and larger branches until they
                    reach the main canal, which runs in a series of coils transversely half way
                    across the joint a little behind its middle, and ends in a common cloaca <hi
                    rend="italic">(cl.),</hi> which receives both the male and female organs, and is
                    connected with the outer world by the porus genitalis. The outer portion of the
                    vas has a thickened muscular wall, and this part of it is capable of extrusion
                    and retraction, thus forming the male intromittent organ or “cirrus” <hi
                    rend="italic">(c.p. ).</hi> The cuticle which lines all the distal portion of
                    the vas deferens is here thin and delicate and armed with a series of minute
                    spines, which are directed backwards <hi rend="italic">(Echeneibothrium).</hi>
                    The cirrus in the present species is very short, but in other forms its length
                    is sometimes considerable. The protrusion is effected by circular muscles placed
                    around the end of the vas deferens, while the retraction is brought about by
                    special longitudinal fibres, lying along the walls of the evaginable
                    portion.</p>
                <p>The female organs may be most conveniently studied by tracing them inwards from
                    the cloaca. The vagina <hi rend="italic">(ν.</hi>) opens immediately posterior
                    to the vas deferens, and like it is lined by a continuation of the external
                    cuticle. After passing about half-way across the segment it bends backwards and
                    terminates in a small cyst, the receptaculum seminis (fig. 1, E, <hi
                    rend="italic">r.s.);</hi> this receives and storesup the male fertilizing
                    elements, retaining them until the ova are ripe. From its posterior extremity
                    there passes a thin-walled canal, wider than the vagina (∕.), which serves to
                    convey the spermatozoa to the ova, and hence is termed the “fertilizingcanal”
                    (Befrιιchtungs-canal of German authors). It unites with the common oviduct, a
                    tube formed by the union of the two oviducts (o.d.), and the two together pass
                    backwards into a spherical glandular structure, called from its discoverer
                    “Mehlis’s body” or the shell-gland (fig. 1, D and E, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sh.g.).</hi> Within this apparatus it receives the duct of the yolk-gland
                    (y.&lt;∕.), and then passes directly forwards to open into the uterus. The
                    ovaries <hi rend="italic">(oν.</hi>) are two in number, situated one on each
                    side of the middle line of the body; they are fan-shaped, and consist of a
                    system of blind tubules situated on a branched efferent duct. The cells of the
                    ovary (primitive eggs) have a sharp contour and a large nucleus; the yolk-gland
                    <hi rend="italic">(y.g.)</hi> is very similar to the ovaries, behind and between
                    which it is situated, but is distinguished by various histological details (it
                    is called “ovary” by Moniez). The shell-gland, formerly regarded as the ovary,
                    consists of closely compressed nucleated cells, and is provided with small thin
                    ducts opening into the narrow internal cavity of the organ. The uterus <hi
                    rend="italic">{ut.),</hi> in its early stage of development, is a long straight
                    tube, lying almost in the longitudinal axis of the proglottis, and receiving
                    posteriorly the oviduct after it emerges from the shell-gland (fig. 1, E, <hi
                    rend="italic">ut. ).</hi> From what has been said it will appear that the ova on
                    their way down the common oviduct are impregnated as they pass the end of the
                    fertilizing canal, and then receive in succession, first their supply of
                    food-yolk and their shell, during their sojourn in Mehlis’s body, after which
                    they go forwards into the uterus, where they undergo the first stages of their
                    development. The uterus assumes a very different shape as it becomes distended
                    with eggs, which are far too numerous to be contained in a simple straight tube;
                    small protuberances arise from its walls, growing rapidly and bifurcating here
                    and there, so as to produce the complicated branched appearance seen in fig. 1,
                    F. As the uterus grows, the male, and later the female, genitalia degenerate and
                    disappear, and in the proglottides which are ready to be liberated the only
                    organ visible is the distended uterus. One of the most characteristic
                    peculiarities in the sexual system just described is that there is no passage by
                    which the ripe eggs can make their exit from the proglottis; these are therefore
                    extruded only on its rupture; a very different state of things obtains in the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Bothriocephalus</hi> (see below). Self-impregnation
                    certainly occurs, and is probably the rule; it is obvious that the contrary case
                    can only happen where two individuals lie side by side within the same host.
                    Furthermore, the cirrus has been seen protruded into the vagina of the same
                    joint, and the emission of sperm has been witnessed (Leuckart, 1; Van Beneden,
                    13, p. 601).</p>
                <p>The eggs are ovoid or spherical, and consist of the germ-cell (nucleus and
                    protoplasm) with an albuminous enveloping substance, which is again surrounded
                    by a thin transparent skin. The shell frequently presents one or more
                    appendages, probably the secretion of the shell-gland drawn out into threads.
                    The structure of the egg has been best studied in <hi rend="italic">Taenia
                    serrata</hi> (Van Beneden, 14), where it consists of a delicate shell containing
                    a germ-cell, with a quantity of secondary yolk; the former divides into a
                    “granular” cell, which segments no further, and an “embryonic” globe, which
                    again divides into a number of cells, of which three are larger and constitute
                    the “albuminogenous layer,” whilst the remainder are smaller and form the
                    “embryonic mass,” and secrete a delicate superficial cuticle, the cell-limits
                    being indistinct. In the embryonic mass from three to five flattened cells form
                    a chitinogenous layer, and give origin to a superficial homogeneous coat, a
                    shell of radially disposed chitinoid cylinders, and an internal faintly striated
                    lining, whilst the remaining cells become the six-hooked embryo or proscolex, a
                    superficial layer to which the hooks belong, and a central mass of clearer
                    cells. When the proscolex is mature the original egg-shell and the
                    albuminogenous layer disappear, and only the chitinoid coats remain.</p>
                <p>The proglottides are cast off by muscular action; the fibres are not continuous
                    between the successive segments, so that these are connected merely bysoft
                    connective tissue, which readily gives way; the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n61/mode/1up"

                    above described, and, as the hinder margin of the proglottis contracts forcibly
                    when the next one has left it, the transverse vessel gives rise to the rounded
                    vesicle which forms the termination of the excretory system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Life-History and Development.</hi></p>
                <p>The six-hooked embryo (fig. 1, G) may be conveyed to the intermediate host in
                    several ways, but the commonest is for it to be taken into the alimentary canal
                    along with food to which it may have adhered, or with water in which it was
                    swimming; the infection may take place either by means of free eggs or by whole
                    proglottides. In the latter case the soft tissues are first digested by the
                    gastric juice of the host, and in either case the egg-shell is dissolved or
                    rendered so brittle that the embryo readily escapes by the movements of its
                    hooks. The proscolex, after spending a longeι∙ or shorter time free in the
                    stomach or intestine, proceeds to perforate the wall of these organs by means of
                    active burrowing motions. Although the embryo of a <hi rend="italic">Taenia</hi>
                    has only once been captured in its progress through the wall of the alimentary
                    canal (Raum, 15, p. 28), there can be no doubt that this is the route by which
                    it usually proceeds, and that its next locality is a blood-vessel, probably some
                    small branch of the portal vein, in the blood of which it has been found by more
                    than one observer. This would explain the frequency with which the next stage is
                    found in the liver. There seems, however, reason to believe that many embryos
                    penetrate the intestinal wall completely and reach the body-cavity, in which
                    they can wander freely. When the six-hooked embryo has reached its
                    resting-place, which in addition to the liver may be lung, muscles, brain,
                    connective tissue, or eye, it at once commences its further development, and in
                    a few days becomes visible to the naked eye. Like any other foreign body, it
                    causes a proliferation of cells, which in due time form a sheath of connective
                    tissue, with a cellular lining, and smooth like a serous cavity within; this
                    covering, however, is not found when the parasite is situated iu the brain or
                    the eye. The embryo now grows in size, generally becoming somewhat elongated,
                    and the hooks drop off. Sometimes they can be found lying detached in the
                    connective-tissue sheath. The central cells enlarge and become clear, and in all
                    the <hi rend="italic">Taeniae</hi> they liquefy, forming a quantity of fluid
                    which fills the centre of the bladder-worm. At this stage the larvae constitute
                    the so-called “measles” of beef (that of pork being due to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cysticercus cellulosae,</hi> the immature stage of <hi rend="italic">Taenia
                    solium)</hi>; they are ovoid vesicles lying between the muscle fibres and
                    varying in length from 4 to 8 mm. and being usually about 3 mm. in diameter
                    (fig. 2, A). At a point on one side of the bladder there appears a small
                    thickening, the meniscus or rudiment of the future head; this is soon followed
                    by an invagination of the cuticle (fig. 2, B). When the rudimentary head thus
                    formed is about 0'2 mm. in length (the bladder being 1 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 5 mm. in diameter) the formation of muscles in its walls commences. At
                    four equidistant points near the bottom of the invagination the suckers are
                    developed, and at the lowest part of the cavity the rostellum (and the double
                    circlet of hooks in the armed species) is formed. Surrounding the head-rudiment
                    on that surface which is towards the cavity of the bladder is a thin layer,
                    known as the “receptacle.” This is best seen in <hi rend="italic">Cysticercus
                    cellulosae,</hi> in which there is also a very characteristic bend or kink in
                    the pedicle of invagination, which in most other bladder-worms remains straight
                    (see fig. 2, C). The rudiments of the vascular system of the bladder have
                    already appeared before the formation of the head, and now they extend into it
                    as four longitudinal vessels, which become connected at the bottom of the
                    invagination by a circular vessel. About this time, too, the calcareous
                    corpuscles above described make their appearance. When the hooks and suckers are
                    fully formed, the head undergoes a process of évagination, so that what was
                    previously a hollow cavity becomes a solid cylinder, and the hooks, which were
                    below the suckers, come to lie above them. Mature bladder-worms vary in size
                    from <hi rend="italic">Cysticercus fasciolaris,</hi> the size of a pea, to <hi
                    rend="italic">Cysticercus tenuicollis,</hi> six inches or more in length.</p>
                <p>The development into the adult tape-worm takes place only after the <hi
                    rend="italic">Cysticercus</hi> has been-swallowed by the permanent or definitive
                    host. The course of this metamorphosis has been followed experimentally, and it
                    has been found that first the bladder and next the neck of the worm are
                    dissolved by the gastric juice. The head only is left; in the moist warmth of
                    the intestine its suckers and rostellum exhibit very lively motions, which serve
                    to bring about its attachment to the intestinal wall. It gradually increases in
                    length, and the formation of segments speedily commences.</p>
                <p>The life history of the Cestodes is generally summed up as consisting of three
                    different forms :—(1) the proscolex, or six-hooked embryo, which gives rise to
                    the bladder-worm; (2) the scolex, which develops the chain or strobila by a
                    process of budding; and (3) the proglottis, or sexual animal, which produces
                    eggs. Each of these three forms has certain claims to be regarded as a
                    zoological “individual.” Van Beneden (13, <hi rend="italic">Vers Int.,</hi> p.
                    251) has laid great stress upon the correspondence between a Trematode and a
                    ripe proglottis, and it has been since pointed out that a proglottis may under
                    favourable circumstances (that is, within the intestine) continue to grow after
                    being detached from the parent chain; it cannot be said, however, that the
                    evidence upon which this rests is quite incontrovertible. Regarded from this
                    point of view the life-history of the tape-worms furnishes an admirable instance
                    of the alternation of generations. The individuality of the proglottides,
                    however, although maintained by authorities so eminent as Leuckart, is by no
                    means universally accepted; a distinction has been drawn between their formation
                    and true budding seen in other animal colonies, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bolyzoa</hi>; and Riehm, in a recent work (12), has pointed out that the
                    casting-off of these sexual segments is in some respects comparable to the
                    detachment of the hectocotylized arm of a Cephalopod, and the formation of new
                    joints to the development of an Oligochaetous worm from a few segments;
                    furthermore, certain organs—for example, the nervous and excretory systems—are
                    continuous throughout the whole chain, and an isolated proglottis is unable to
                    maintain its existence for more than a very limited period. According to this
                    view, alternation of generations only occurs in Cestodes in forms such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Coenurus,</hi> where there is a proliferation of heads in the wall
                    of the bladder.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>At the

                <p>The Cestode larvae corresponding to the stage which has just been described
                    present considerable variations both in form and structure, and upon these
                    classifications of the group have been based, and generic names have been given
                    to the different forms; Von Linstow (36) has, however, pointed out the
                    undesirableness of this, as they are all parts of the life-history of one genus,
                    <hi rend="italic">Taenia.</hi> The most recent arrangement is that of Villot

                <p>I. The caudal bladder arises from the proscolex by simple growth and structural
                    modification, without the formation of any new parts. A larger or smaller
                    quantity of fluid is present, and also a connective-tissue sheath; the host is a

                    words must be added. In the great majority of species only one tape-worm head is
                    produced, and such bladderworms constituted the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cysticercus</hi> of the older helminthologists. In certain cases, however'
                    notably in the worm which produces the “staggers” of sheep, numerous heads are
                    formed in the wall of each bladder; such larvae formed the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Coemιrus,</hi> but apart from their polycephalous condition there
                    are no structural peculiarities calling for special notice. The third variety of
                    bladder - <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n62/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0062-0053"/> worm <hi rend="italic">{Echinococcus}</hi> is
                    characterized by the fact that the tape-worm heads are not directly developed in
                    the wall of the bladder itself, but from “brood capsules” which lie in numbers
                    on the inner wall of the bladder.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Development of the Echinococcus.—</hi> The smallest bladder yet
                    seen was reared by Leuckart in the pig, and consisted of a minute protoplasmic
                    mass surrounded by a structureless cuticle. This cuticle thickens by deposition
                    of new layers as growth proceeds, and the lamination of the cuticle is one of
                    the characteristic peculiarities of the <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus,</hi>
                    another being the absence of an excretory system. At certain points in the
                    parenchyma lining the cyst small warts are noticed (fig. 2, D,α), which enlarge
                    and become hollow; then the cavity enlarges in a direction opposite to the point
                    of origin, and at the extremity of this hollow suckers and hooks are formed as
                    in the case of <hi rend="italic">Cysticercus</hi> described above <hi
                    rend="italic">(b, c}.</hi> No sooner has the development of the first of these
                    reached a certain degree of completeness than others are formed in similar
                    fashion. The first part of the invagination takes place, by which the future
                    head comes to lie within the brood-capsule and the pedicle is no longer hollow
                    but solid <hi rend="italic">{e}</hi>; the suckers and hooks are, however, still
                    invaginated, and remain so for a considerable period. Seeing that the interior
                    of the brood-capsule is lined with cuticle, it corresponds to the outside of the
                    parent cyst, and hence is probably the representative of a previous
                    invagination. If this be so then the development of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echinococcus</hi> would be quite comparable with that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cysticercus,</hi> the only difference being that, instead of the head being an
                    invagination of the wall of the cyst itself, it is a secondary invagination, the
                    primary being the brood-capsule. This does not, however, exhaust the
                    peculiarities of the <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus;</hi> the form just
                    described, with a simple cyst and brood-capsules, is common in cattle, and hence
                    goes by the name of <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus veterinorum;</hi> but cases
                    are frequent, and are the most common in the human subject, in which the cyst
                    contains daughter-vesicles, differing from those just described in being
                    sterile—giving rise to no heads. These daughter-bladders may originate in three
                    different ways:</p>
                <p>(1) from little granular heaps, which are seen between the different layers of
                    the cuticle, and which are probably derived primarily from the parenchymal
                    layer,—since new layers of cuticle are continually formed internally, these
                    bladders gradually make their way outwards, until they come to lie externally to
                    the mother-vesicle <hi rend="italic">{Echinococcus exogena,</hi> Kuhn; <hi
                    rend="italic">E. scolecipariens,</hi> Küchenmeister);</p>
                <p>(2) from brood-capsules; (3) from <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus-heads</hi>;
                    these last two modes of development give rise to vesicles, which are within the
                    mother-vesicle, and produce a form which has been variously called <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinococcus endogena,</hi> Kuhn, <hi rend="italic">E.
                    altricipariens,</hi> Küchenmeister, and <hi rend="italic">E. hydatidosus.</hi> A
                    very remarkable form is <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus multilocularis,</hi>
                    which consists of a number of very small vesicles embedded in a common soft
                    stroma; it is found exclusively in man, and for long was regarded as a form of
                    alveolar cancer. The mode of its development is unknown (for further
                    information, see Virchow, 17). Compound bladders occur in man and the ox, whilst
                    other ruminants, swine, and monkeys usually harbour the simple or exogenous
                    forms. The organs most often affected are liver and lungs. The adult tape-worm
                    (<hi rend="italic">T. echinococcus}</hi> is found in the intestine of the dog,
                    jackal, and wolf, occurring in considerable numbers between the villi. Its
                    length (fig. 3, A) is at most 5 mm. and it consists of only three or four
                    segments; the head has four suckers and a double circlet of hooks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pathological Effects.</hi></p>
                <p>The pathological effects of Cestodes fall naturally into two categories—(1) those
                    due to the adult worm, and (2) those due to the larvae or bladder worms.</p>
                <p>(1) Those of the first group are in general slight, being confined to the
                    abstraction of a certain amount of nutriment, and to a more or less acute
                    feeling of irritation, sometimes amounting even to colic-like pains, in the
                    intestine. There have indeed been many authorities who have maintained that they
                    were beneficial; Jördens went so far as to describe them as the good angels and
                    unfailing helpers of children, and Schimper records that the Abyssinians
                    consider that they prevent constipation, and only regard them as disadvantageous
                    when they grow too long. Notwithstanding all this, however, there are not a few
                    cases on record in w hich anaemia and neurotic, or even mental, diseases have
                    been caused by the malnutrition and irritation which they occasion.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The method of treatment for
                    the removal of these tape-worms from the human body consists in the
                    administration, first of purgatives, and thereafter of one or other of the
                    following anthelmintics:—turpentine, male fem <hi rend="italic">{Lαstreα
                    Filix∙rnas),</hi> pomegranate, or kousso,—of which the first two are the most
                    reliable. Turpentine may be given in half-ounce doses along with castor oil, or
                    made up into an emulsion with yolk of egg; while the male fern is usually
                    administered in the form of liquid extract (half a drachm to one drachm).
                    Careful search should be made in the evacuations for the head or scolex, without
                    the expulsion of which there is no certain evidence that the parasite has been
                    removed from the body.</p></note></p>
                <p>(2) The effects of Cestode larvae may again be divided into two subdivisions, (a)
                    That due to the invasion and wandering of a large brood of six-hooked embryos
                    has been most successfully studied in cases in which animals have been fed for
                    experimental purposes with fragments of ripe tape-worms; in such instances a
                    train of symptoms has been observed to which the name “acute cestodic
                    tuberculosis” has been given. It is characterized by loss of appetite, fatigue,
                    ruffling of the hair, and fever; on post-mortem examination it has been found
                    that the lymphatic system is in a state of inflammation, while the muscles
                    present the appearance w hich has already been described, (ό) The effects of
                    formed bladder-worms may be summed up as dependent upon the pressure of the
                    growing cyst and the consequent absorption of the surrounding tissues of the
                    host, so that the importance of the results depends almost entirely upon the
                    organ which is affected. Bladder-worms in the brain are, of course, the most
                    frequently fatal, especially when, as is not unfrequently the case, they exert
                    pressure upon the ganglia at its base. Küchenmeister has collected a
                    considerable number of occurrences of cystic worms in the brain; among these
                    sixteen were not accompanied by pathological symptoms during life; in six others
                    these were slight; twenty-four were cases of epilepsy, six of cramp, forty-two
                    of paralysis, and twenty-three of mental disturbances of varying intensity. <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyslicerci</hi> in the brain vary greatly in size and form
                    according to the precise situation which they occupy; in its ventricles they
                    have been found as large as a pigeon’s egg. In the meshes of the arachnoid the
                    bladder sometimes grows into a remarkably branched structure, which has been
                    called <hi rend="italic">Cysticercus racemosus</hi> by Zenker (3). Another
                    peculiar form from the same organ has been described by Kciberlé (4); it is
                    characterized by the great length of its head-process (2 cm.), w hich is coiled
                    up into a regular spiral of sometimes three turns; it has received the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Cysticercus turbinatus,</hi> though its specific distinctness is
                    doubtful. The occurrence of <hi rend="italic">Cyslicerci</hi> in the eye is of
                    special interest, because of the opportunity it affords of observing, by means
                    of the ophthalmoscope, the development of the worm in its natural environment.
                    It seems generally to lie at first below the retina, and is visible as a
                    bluish-white sharply defined body; subsequently the retina is destroyed by the
                    pressure, and the worm falls forward into the vitreous body; sometimes the head
                    may be seen protruding first through the opening; in the chambers of the eye the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cysticercus</hi> is almost always free, that is, without a
                    capsule, and swimming in the fluid, so that its form and motions may be readily
                    and accurately observed. A large number of cases of this affection have been
                    recorded, principally by Von Graefe in Berlin (5), and in some the bladder has
                    been successfully removed by operation.</p>
                <p>The special symptoms of the <hi rend="italic">Echinococcus</hi> vary, like those
                    of other bladder-worms, with its situation and size: when it grows within
                    cavities with more or less firm limits compression of adjoining vessels and
                    glandular passages often results, producing oedema, varicose veins, congestion
                    of various organs, or even dyspnoea, if the parasite occur in the thorax. The
                    liver is its most frequent seat, and next the lung; but there is scarcely any
                    organ of the body in w hich it has not been found, even the bones being
                    sometimes affected. Since the expanding cyst grows in the direction of least
                    resistance, it has a tendency to pass <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n63/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0063-0054"/> towards the surface of organs, and sometimes a
                    cure is effected spontaneously by its rupturing into the alimentary canal or
                    into some other passage leading to the exterior. Cases in which the cyst opens
                    into the blood-vessels are almost always suddenly fatal. When the <hi
                    rend="italic">Echinococcus</hi> occurs near the surface of the body, it may be
                    evacuated by puncture and a cure effected with but little risk.</p>

                <p>The following classification of the Cestodes, based mainly on that of Van
                    Beneden, exhibits the present state of our knowledge of the group :—</p>

                <p>Family IV. <hi rend="italic">Diphyllidae.—</hi> Neck and two suckers armed with
                    hooks. Example: <hi rend="italic">Echinobothrium,</hi> two species known from

                <p>Family V. <hi rend="italic">Tetrarhynchidae.—</hi> Head provided with four
                    suckers and four protractile proboscides armed with hooks; sexual openings
                    marginal. Example: <hi rend="italic">Tetrarhynchus</hi> (see below), about forty
                    species known, many only described from immature forms.</p>
                <p>Family VI. <hi rend="italic">Tetraphyllidae.—</hi> Head with four very mobile and
                    distinct suckers, which are often armed with hooks or chitinous rods; body
                    segmented, proglottides cast off when mature; sexual openings marginal.</p>
                <p>Subfamily i. <hi rend="italic">Phyllobothrinae. —</hi> Suckers without hooks or

                <p>Family VII. <hi rend="italic">Taeniadae.—</hi> Head furnished with four suckers
                    and often with a single or double circlet of hooks; proglottides well-defined
                    and cast off when mature; no uterine aperture. Example: <hi rend="italic"
                    >Taenia</hi> (see below).</p>
                <p>It seems advisable to add a few details regarding some of the forms alluded to in
                    the above synopsis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amphilina foliacea,</hi> described as a Trematode by Rudolphi,
                    is found in the body-cavity of the sturgeon. A number of unicellular glands open
                    into the sucker, and are surrounded by the muscles of that organ; the nervous
                    system consists of two ganglia, with a commissure, and two lateral nerves; the
                    male organs resemble those of <hi rend="italic">Bothrioccphalus,</hi> the female
                    those of the Trematodes; the family is generally regarded as furnishing a
                    connecting link between the <hi rend="italic">Cestoda</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tremaloda</hi>; see Salensky (18) and Lang (7).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bothrioccphalus lotus</hi> (32) is the most conspicuous example
                    of the family <hi rend="italic">Pscicdophyllidae,</hi> and is, moreover,
                    noteworthy as being the largest tape-worm found in man; its length often reaches
                    8 to 9 metres, and its extreme breadth 10 to 12 mm. The head bears two grooves,
                    which correspond in position with the flat sides of the body. There are two
                    (more correctly three) genital openings, which are situated, not on the margin
                    but on the flat side of the body, on that surface which is usually called the
                    ventral. The most anterior of these is the male aperture (fig. 4, A, c.), and
                    immediately behind it is that of the vagina (ι ’.o. ), so close that on
                    superficial examination the two often seem to coincide. This vaginal opening,
                    like that of the <hi rend="italic">Taeniadae,</hi> serves for the intromission
                    of the penis and for the fertilization of the ova, but not for the exit of the
                    ripe eggs; this being provided for by a special aperture at the other end of the
                    uterus from that at which the eggs enter it. This uterine opening (u.o.) is
                    situated at a short distance behind the other two. The result of this
                    arrangement is that the eggs can be evacuated without any injury to the
                    proglottis, and consequently their discharge commences before its separation
                    from the parent worm and may continue for a long period. The uterus (uZ.)
                    itself, owing to its disposition in folded coils, when full of eggs, presents an
                    irregular, round, lobular appearance, λvhich has been compared to a flower or
                    heraldic lily. The yolk-gland <hi rend="italic">(y.g.)</hi> is widely
                    disseminated in the lateral areas of the segments, and its ducts <hi
                    rend="italic">{y.d.)</hi> form a series of branching tubules, first described by
                    Eschricht (27) under the name “yellow ducts.” The excretory organs (ex.) differ
                    from those of the <hi rend="italic">Taeniadae</hi> in that the canals exhibit a
                    reticulate arrangement. The embryo (fig. 4, D) as it leaves the egg is covered
                    with a ciliated mantle, which corresponds to the firm eggshell and associated
                    membrane of the cystic tape-worms, and perhaps also to the ciliated envelope of
                    certain Trematode larvae (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trematoda).</hi> This
                    ciliated organism swims freely about in the water, but after a time the
                    six-hooked proscolex escapes from it. The next stage in its life-history is not
                    yet known, but it has been recently shown by Braun of Dorpat (33) that at a
                    subsequent stage it inhabits the pike and burbot, and develops into the sexual
                    adult when transferred to the intestine of the human subject. The geographical
                    distribution of <hi rend="italic">Bothriocephalus</hi> is limited; it has been
                    recorded with certainty in but few places outside Europe; while within that
                    continent the coasts of the Baltic and Switzerland are <pb break="no"

                    distributed in Russia, and has been recorded from Poland, Denmark, Germany, as
                    well as from France and Britain, though it is possible that the cases occurring
                    in these latter countries have been due to importation.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Ligula</hi> has the segmentation obscure or
                    indistinguishable. About six species are known. One is found encapsuled in a
                    monkey, one in the common seal, others in reptiles and teleosteans. <hi
                    rend="italic">Archigetes sieboldi</hi> (fig. 3, B) occurs in the body-cavity of
                    an Oligochaetous worm <hi rend="italic">(Tubifex rivulorum)</hi>; it is about 3
                    mm. long, and consists of an oval body (scolex), to which is attached a
                    cylindrical tail (proscolex), bearing at the posterior extremity three pairs of
                    hooks; both these parts are capable of motion. The scolex lias eight
                    longitudinal excretory canals, and a terminal vesicle; the ventrally situated
                    genital aperture is the common exit of the vas deferens, the vagina, and a
                    uterus separate from the latter; the development is direct, and it attains
                    sexual maturity without a change of host. <hi rend="italic">Duthiersia,</hi>
                    Perrier (34), contains two species, both from the intestines of varanian
                    lizards. The genus is characterized by the presence of two large compressed
                    frilled suckers, separated by a septum and perforated at their bases. The
                    proglottides have three genital apertures resembling those of <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Tetrarhynchus</hi> was, a fewyears ago, made the
                    subject of an elaborate memoir by Pintner (9), who investigated <hi
                    rend="italic">T. longicollis,</hi> V. Ben. The head, in which its most striking
                    anatomical peculiarities are situated, really includes both the head and neck of
                    previous authors (fig. 5, A); it is some 9 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 94 mm.
                    long, but only 0'75 mm. in diameter, and bears at its anterior end two obliquely
                    placed oval disks (fig. 5, B), each of which is perforated towards the apex by
                    two round holes through which the four proboscides protrude. Each of these
                    disks, moreover, shows traces of a division into two, a fact which indicates
                    that it is formed by the fusion of two suckers corresponding to those commonly
                    found in tape-worms. The flattening in this genus seems to be in a direction at
                    right angles to that in which it usually takes place. The proboscides, which are
                    the most characteristic organs of the genus, are four in number, and protrude
                    from or can be retracted into the anterior surface of the head. Each consists of
                    three parts :—(1 ) the toothed portion is the most anterior; it is shaped like a
                    long narrow glovefinger, like which it is invaginable; on its external surface
                    it bears rows of hooks, closely set in diagonal lines (fig. 5, C); there are two
                    forms of these: those which are directed outwards are large triangular hooks,
                    with apices pointing backwards, whilst those situated on that surface of the
                    proboscis which is turned towards the other proboscides are fine, delicate, and
                    curved; between the hooks are fine chitinous hairs; (2) the membranous sheath is
                    firmly attached where the general surface of the body passes over into the
                    toothed portion around the orifice of the invagination; it consists of a thick
                    homogeneous transparent skin, apparently an excretion of cells lining the cavity
                    of the proboscis; (3) the muscular portion is the most posterior of all, and is
                    composed of six layers, remarkable as containing striped muscular fibres;
                    throughout all these three portions of the proboscis there extends a retractor
                    muscle. The action of these various structures is not thoroughly understood, but
                    it is probable that the proboscis is protruded by the action of the last-named
                    muscular sheath, whilst it is retracted, after the relaxation of this, partly by
                    the retractor muscle and partly by the pressure of the surrounding medium.</p>
                <p>The family <hi rend="italic">Taeniadae</hi> is usually described as containing
                    only the one geuus <hi rend="italic">Taenia,</hi> but, owing to the number and
                    variety of its species, of which more than 350 have been described, it has been
                    subdivided into groups, regarded by different authors as genera or subgenera.
                    The subjoined arrangement is mainly that of Leuckart. It labours under the
                    disadvantage that its chief divisions are based upon the bladder-worm or larval
                    stage, which is only known in the case of comparatively few species.</p>
