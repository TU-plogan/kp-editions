                    of the whole of Spain, stands upon a circle of seven hills, 2400 feet above the
                    sea, and washed on three sides by the Tagus. It is 37 miles west-south-west of
                    Madrid. The river is spanned by two fine stone bridges,—the Alcántara, a Moorish
                    bridge of a single arch, giving entrance to the city from the east, and the
                    other, that of San Martin, from the west, while between them the river makes a
                    sweep southwards. The place is enclosed on the land side by two walls, still in
                    fairly perfect condition,—the inner one being built by King Wamba in the 7th
                    century, the outer by Alfonso VI. in 1109. The gates are numerous and well
                    preserved, the most noteworthy being the famous Puerta del So], the Puerta
                    Visagra, and the Cambron. Some Roman remains (a circus, &amp;c.) lie without the
                    walls, on the plain to the north-west. The appearance of Toledo from a distance
                    is imposing in the extreme, from its noble situation and the terraced lines of
                    its buildings; but upon a nearer approach it reveals itself as dull and decayed
                    enough, with little or no traffic in the streets, and a strange silence brooding
                    over all its ways. The houses are large, massive, and gloomy, generally Moorish
                    in style, of the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries, with a great central <hi
                    rend="italic">patio</hi> (courtyard), and yielding abundant traces of Arabic
                    decoration. The principal public square is the Zocodover. It forms the favourite
                    promenade, and from it the one fairly wide street of the city leads to the
                    cathedral. The latter is the glory of Toledo, and one of the finest monuments of
                    art in Spain. Built upon the site of an ancient mosque, and commenced in 1227,
                    it was completed in 1492; and, though sacked over and over again,—finally by the
                    French under La Houssaye in 1808,—it is still, with the exception, perhaps, of
                    the cathedral of Seville, the richest and most magnificent foundation in the
                    Peninsula. The exterior is unfortunately hidden to a great extent by mean
                    surrounding buildings, but the fine western façade, with its two towers, one
                    rising 325 feet, is effective. The interior is somewhat dwarfed in appearance by
                    the immense width. It is 404 feet long by 204 feet broad, and is divided by 84
                    pillars into five naves, with central lantern and choir, and a complete series
                    of side chapels. Most of these <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> latter are late
                    additions, of the 15th and 16th <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0455-0436"/> centuries, and are very magnificent in detail.
                    The 16th-century stained-glass windows, chiefly of Flemish work, are superb; and
                    the treasury, reliquaries, and library, notwithstanding their repeated
                    despoilings, are not unworthy of the see which styles itself the “first of all
                    the Spains.” In the Muzarabic chapel the ritual known by that name is still
                    performed daily. Within the precincts of the cathedral are interred the
                    archbishops and cardinals Tenorio, Fonseca, Mendoza, Ximenez, the great
                    constable Alvaro de Luna, and a long array of kings and heroes. The archbishop
                    is primate of Spain, and has for suffragans Coria, Cuenca, Siguenza, and
                    Palencia. Besides the cathedral Toledo still possesses a great number of fine
                    churches and other religious buildings, together with numerous Moorish and
                    Jewish monuments. The most important church is the 15th-century florid Gothic
                    San Juan de los Reyes, built by Ferdinand and Isabella. The best Moorish work is
                    to be found in the old J ewish synagogues of Santa Maria la Blanca and El
                    Tránsito, in the mosques of Cristo de la Luz and Las Tornerias, in some private
                    houses, and in the later churches of San Roman, Santo Tomé, Santiago, and Santa
                    Leocadia. The patio and staircase of the hospital of Santa Cruz present some of
                    the finest Renaissance work extant. Seen from afar, the Alcazar, or royal
                    palace, is one of the most conspicuous features of the city. It stands upon a
                    commanding position overlooking the Tagus, and was originally built by King
                    Wamba, but has been repeatedly altered and pulled about. It was almost entirely
                    rebuilt by Charles V. and Philip IL, under the architects Covarrubias and
                    Herrera, and has lately been converted into a huge military academy. The city is
                    provided with numerous elementary schools, a public library, museum, town-hall,
                    and several large hospitals. The well-known manufactory of swords is about a
                    mile to the north-west, beyond the Cambron gate. It is in excellent order, and
                    produces blades as perfect as ever, but is no longer of great importance,
                    employing only about 120 hands.</p>
                <p>Toledo existed in the time of the Romans, who conquered it in 193 B.C. They
                    strengthened the fortifications, and built an aqueduct to supply the place with
                    water. By the Goths, who captured the city in 467 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.,</hi> these works were kept up and improved; and, under the Moorish
                    domination, from 714 to 1085, Toledo was second only to Cordova in rank and
                    importance, with a population of 200,000 souls. Alfonso VI. of Castile and Leon
                    recovered the stronghold in 1085; and under him and his successors it continued
                    to flourish until the permanent establishment of the court at Madrid gave a
                    deathblow to its prosperity. The population now is no more than 20,000.</p>
