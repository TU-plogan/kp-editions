                    of the sixth book of his <hi rend="italic">⅜υνaγωγη,</hi> speaks of this
                    collection, the study of which is indispensable to any one who would master the
                    science of astronomy (τov <hi rend="italic">aστpονομουμeνον</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">τόπον).</hi> These writings, which were highly esteemed in the
                    school of Alexandria, were intermediate between the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Elements</hi> of Euclid and the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> of Ptolemy,
                    for the understanding of which, indeed, they formed an indispensable
                    introduction. Of the life of Theodosius nothing is known. As to the time when he
                    lived different opinions have been held, he being placed by some in the first
                    century before and by others in the second century after the Christian era. The
                    latter opinion is founded on an error of Suidas (s.v.), who on the one hand
                    identifies the author of the three works referred to above with a sceptical
                    philosopher of the same name who lived at the time of Trajan or later, and on
                    the other hand distinguishes him from a native of Tripolis who wrote a poem on
                    spring. It is now generally admitted that the subject of this article is the
                    same as Theodosius the mathematician, who is mentioned by Strabo amongst the
                    natives of Bithynia distinguished for their learning, and whose sons were also
                    mathematicians, the same, too, as the inventor of a universal sun-dial <hi
                        rend="italic">{forologium</hi><hi rend="italic">πρός παν κλίμα)</hi> of that
                    name who is praised by Vitruvius <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Architectura,</hi> ix. 9). His date, therefore, could not have been later
                    than the 1st century B.c.; he may, however, have lived in the preceding century,
                    inasmuch as the names mentioned by Strabo in the passage referred to above are,
                    as far as we know, arranged chronologically, and Theodosius immediately follows
                    Hipparchus, who made astronomical observations between 161 and 126 B.C., and
                    precedes Asclepiades the physician, who lived at Rome at the beginning of the
                    1st century B.c.</p>
                <p>The statement that he was “of Tripolis” is made, not on the authority of Suidas,
                    as has been erroneously said, but because he is so described in the title of his
                    principal work. ' It is probable, therefore, that he was a native of <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0277-0260"/> Bithynia, and resided at Tripolis, -where he
                    wrote his work. Tripolis is generally taken to be the city of that name on the
                    Phoenician coast, but it may have been a town of the same name in Lydia, on the
                    Meander.</p>
                <p>His chief work— <hi rend="italic">Σφαιρικά,</hi> in three books—treats of the
                    properties of the sphere and its sections, with the object of establishing the
                    geometrical principles of spherical astronomy. This work, which is classical, is
                    distinguished for the order and clearness of the exposition as well as for the
                    rigour of its proofs, and has ever since formed the basis on which the subject
                    of spherical geometry has been treated. It does not contain any trace of
                    spherical trigonometry, which, on the other hand, was the special subject of the
                    work having the same title, and included in the same collection, of Menelaus of
                    Alexandria, who lived at the end of the 1st century.</p>
                <p>Montucla suspected that a great part of the three books of Theodosius must have
                    been known before his time, and that he merely did with respect to this branch
                    of geometry what Euclid had done with the elements, namely, he collected and
                    incorporated in his work the different propositions found before his time by
                    astronomers and geometers. This conjecture of Montucla has been confirmed by A.

                        >Studien über Euklid,</hi> pp. 43 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Leipsic,
                    1882), and by Hultsch, from whose researches, and especially owing to the
                    publication by the last of the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> of
                    Autolycus, it is now quite certain that as early as the middle of the 4th
                    century B.c. there existed a Greek text-book on <hi rend="italic">Spherics</hi>
                    which, in its essential contents, scarcely deviated from the three books of
                    Theodosius. He must therefore be regarded as merely the editor, or at most the
                    elaborator and expounder, of a doctrine which existed some centuries before
                    him.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spherics of</hi> Theodosius was translated into Arabic at
                    the beginning of the 10th century, and from the Arabic into Latin in the 12th
                    century by Plato of Tivoli (Tiburtinus). This translation was published in 1518
                    at Venice, but was found so faulty by J. Voegelinus that he published a new
                    Latin version, together with additions from the Arabian commentators, Vienna,
                    1529, 4to; other Latin translations were published by F. Maurolycus, Messina,
                    1558, fol.; by C. Clavius, Rome, 1586, 4to; and by Barrow under the title,

                    Greek text was first published, and with it a Latin translation, by J. Pena,
                    Paris, 1558, 4to; it has been edited since by Joseph Hunt, oxford, 1707, and by
                    E. Nizze, Berlin, 1852, but these two editions are founded on that of Pena.
                    There is also a German translation by Nizze, Stralsund, 1826. His two editions
                    are accompanied with valuable notes and an appendix containing additions from
                    Voegelinus and others.</p>
                <p>The two other works of Theodosius which have come down to us have not as yet been
                    published in the original. The propositions, without demonstrations, in the work

                        rend="italic">(On Days and Nights),</hi> in two books, were given by
                    Dasypodius, in Greek and Latin, in his <hi rend="italic">Sphaemcae
                        Doctrinae</hi><hi rend="italic">Propositiones,</hi> Strasburg, 1572, 8vo. A
                    Latin version of the complete work, with ancient <hi rend="italic">scholia</hi>
                    and figures, was given by Joseph Auria, Rome, 1591, 4to. Pappus has given a
                    pretty full commentary on the first book of this work of Theodosius. His work
                    wepì <hi rend="italic">olκησe&lt;ΛV (On Habitations)</hi> also was published by
                    Auria, Rome, 1588. It gives an account of how, for every inhabitant of the earth
                    from the equator.to the pole, the starry firmament presents itself in the course
                    of a year. The propositions in it were also given by Dasypodius in his work
                    mentioned above.</p>
