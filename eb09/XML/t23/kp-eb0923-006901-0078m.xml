                    hard crust adhering to the sides of the cask. Such impure acid tartrate of
                    potash is known commercially as “argol.” It was known to the Greeks as <hi

                    which name has survived in familiar chemical parlance to this day. The true

                    evaporated in leaden pans to a sufficient degree to deposit crystals on standing

                    decolorizing the solution with animal charcoal, and causing the acid to
                    crystallize a second time after addition of sulphuric acid, which promotes the
                    formation of large crystals. The crystals contain a little sulphuric acid and a
                    trace of lead; if intended for internal use, they must be recrystallized from
                    pure water.</p>
                <p>Tartaric acid forms hard colourless transparent monoclinic prisms of L764 spec,
                    grav., easily soluble in cold and abundantly in hot water. It has a strong but
                    agreeable sour taste. At 15° C. 100 parts of water dissolve 138 parts of the
                    acid, 100 of alcohol (absolute) 20 ’ 4, and 100 of ether 0 ’ 39. It fuses at
                    135° C. and passes into an amorphous modification known as meta-tartaric acid;
                    when heated more strongly it loses water, and passes into the forms of
                    anhydrides. At high temperatures it is decomposed with formation of charcoal and
                    volatile products, which smell pretty much like those formed from sugar in the
                    same circumstances. Most oxidizing agents produce formic from the aqueous acid.
                    Boiling with oxide of silver and excess of caustic alkali produces oxalate.</p>
                <p>Tartaric acid is used largely in calico printing as a discharge. In pharmacy and
                    households it serves, conjointly with bicarbonate of soda or potash, for the
                    extemporaneous preparation of effervescing drinks. The so-called German
                    effervescing powders are a combination of weighed-out doses of tartaric acid and
                    of bicarbonate of soda. In the so-called “seltzogènes” (glass apparatus in which
                    carbonic acid is produced in one compartment, to be forced by its own pressure
                    into a mass of water, wine, &amp;c., in the other) the gas is similarly
                    produced.</p>

                    filtering off what remains of tartrate of lime and other impurities, and
                    allowing the filtrate to crystallize. The crystals are generally contaminated
                    with a little of the lime-salt, for the removal of which the best method is to
                    treat the powdered crystals with cold dilute hydrochloric acid and then wash
                    them with cold water by displacement. The lime passes into the filtrate. Cream
                    of tartar forms small colourless hard crystals which dissolve in about 200 parts
                    of cold and in 15 parts of boiling water. In alcohol the salt is even less

                    to be made by igniting one half of the cream of tartar to be operated upon in a

                    the salt gradually separates out as a crystalline precipitate. Neutral tartrate
                    solutions, with chloride of calcium, give a precipitate of tartrate of lime,
                    which is at first amorphous, and in this condition dissolves pretty readily in
                    excess of reagent or tartrate, but in general re-separates in the crystalline

                    >racemic acid</hi> has long been known as an occasional bye-product in the
                    manufacture of tartaric acid. It used to be believed that racemic acid is
                    present ready formed in certain grape-juices, and thus comes to make its
                    appearance occasionally; but it is well known now that the bulk of it at any
                    rate is produced from what was originally tartaric acid, by the continued action
                    of high temperatures and water. Racemic acid is almost identical with tartaric
                    acid; the only purely chemical point of difference is that corresponding salts
                    of the two acids often crystallize with different proportions of water. The two
                    acids, however, are easily distinguished by their action on polarized light (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Polarity,</hi> vol. xix. p. 314). A solution of tartaric
                    acid turns the plane of polarization to the right; racemic acid is, in this
                    sense, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n79/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0079-0070"/> optically inactive. These long-known facts led
                    Pasteur to the discovery of the true relations of the two acids. If the double
                    racemate, (C <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>)Na(NH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>), is allowed to
                    crystallize slowly, two kinds of crystals are produced, both bearing herniedric
                    faces, but differing from each other in the situation of these, exactly as the
                    right hand differs from the left. Pasteur separated the two kinds of crystals,
                    and found that one kind is identical with the ordinary (dextro-) tartrate of
                    soda and ammonia, while the other contains a new kind of tartaric acid, which he
                    called leevo-tartaric acid because it turns the plane of polarization to the
                    left. Equal weights of the two acids, when dissolved separately in water and
                    mixed, unite, with perceptible evolution of heat, into optically neutral racemic
                    acid. Racemic acid, then, is laevo-and dextro-tartaric united (loosely) into one
                    molecule. There are a number of optically inactive tartaric acids, not
                    susceptible of decomposition in the sense in which racemic acid is. (W. D.)</p>
