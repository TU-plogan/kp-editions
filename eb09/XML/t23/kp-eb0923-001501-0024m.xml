                <p><label type="entry">TABOO</label> (also written <hi rend="smallcaps">Tabu</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Tapu)</hi> is the name given to a system of religious
                    prohibitions which attained its fullest development in Polynesia (from Hawaii to
                    New Zealand; see vol. xix. p. 426), but of which under different names traces
                    may be discovered in most parts of the world.</p>
                <p>The word “taboo” is common to the different dialects of Polynesia, and is perhaps
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">ta,</hi> “to mark,” and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pu,</hi> an adverb of intensity. The compound word “taboo” (tapu) would thus
                    originally mean “marked thoroughly.” Its ordinary sense is “sacred.” It does
                    not, however, imply any moral quality, but only “a connexion with the gods or a
                    separation from ordinary purposes and exclusive appropriation to persons or
                    things considered sacred; sometimes it means devoted as by a vow.” Chiefs who
                    trace their lineage to the gods are called <hi rend="italic">arii tabu,</hi>
                    “chiefs sacred,” and a temple is called a <hi rend="italic">vvahi tabu,</hi>
                    “place sacred.” The converse of taboo is <hi rend="italic">noa</hi> (in Tonga
                    <hi rend="italic">gnofooa),</hi> which means “general” or “common.” Thus the
                    rule which forbade women to eat with men, as well as, except on special
                    occasions, to eat any fruits or animals offered in sacrifice to the gods, was
                    called <hi rend="italic">ai tabu,</hi> “eating sacred”; while the present
                    relaxation of the rule is called <hi rend="italic">ai noa,</hi> eating
                    generally, or having food in common. Although it was employed for civil as well
                    as religious purposes, the taboo was essentially a religious observance. In Haw
                    aii it could be imposed only by priests; but elsewhere in Polynesia kings and
                    chiefs, and even to a certain extent ordinary individuals, exercised the same
                    power. The strictness with which the taboo was observed depended largely on the
                    influence of the person who imposed it: if he was a great chief it -would not be
                    broken; but a powerful man often set at nought the taboo of an inferior.</p>
                <p>A taboo might be general or particular, permanent or temporary. A general taboo
                    applied, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> to a whole class of animals; a particular
                    taboo was confined to one or more individuals of the class. Idols, temples, the
                    persons and names of kings and of members of the royal family, the persons of
                    chiefs and priests, and the property (canoes, houses, clothes, &lt;fcc.) of all
                    these classes of persons were always taboo or sacred. By a somewhat arbitrary
                    extension of this principle a chief could render taboo to <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> in favour of) himself anything which took his fancy by merely
                    calling it by the name of a part of his person. Thus, if he said “That axe is my
                    backbone,” or “is my head,” the axe was his; if he roared out “That canoe! my
                    skull shall be the baler to bale it out,” the canoe was his likewise. The names
                    of chiefs and still more of kings were taboo, and could not be uttered. If the
                    name of a king of Tahiti was a common word or even resembled a common word, that
                    word dropped out of use and a new name was substituted for it. Thus in course of
                    time most of the common words in the language underwent considerable
                    modifications or were entirely changed.</p>
                <p>Certain foods were permanently taboo to <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> in favour
                    of or for the use of) gods and men, but -were forbidden to women. Thus in Hawaii
                    the flesh of hogs, fowls, turtle, and several kinds of fish, cocoa-nuts, and
                    nearly everything offered in sacrifice were reserved for gods and men, and could
                    not, except in special cases, be consumed by women. In the Marquesas Islands
                    human flesh was tabooed from women. Sometimes certain fruits, animals, and fish
                    were taboo for months together from both men and women. In the Marquesas houses
                    were tabooed against water: nothing was washed in them; no drop of water might
                    be spilled in them. If an island or a district was tabooed, no canoe or person
                    might approach it while the taboo lasted; if a path was tabooed, no one might
                    walk on it. Seasons generally kept taboo were the approach of a great religious
                    ceremony, the time of preparation for war, and the sickness of chiefs. The time
                    during which they lasted varied from <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n25/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0025-0016"/> years to months or days. In Hawaii there was a
                    tradition of one that lasted thirty years, during which men might not trim their
                    beards, &amp;c. A common period was forty days. A taboo was either common or
                    strict. During a common taboo the men were only required to abstain from their
                    ordinary occupations and to attend morning and evening prayers. But during a
                    strict taboo every fire and light on the island or in the district was
                    extinguished; no canoe was launched; no person bathed; no one, except those who
                    had to attend at the temple, was allowed to be seen out of doors; no dog might
                    bark, no pig grunt, no cock crow. Hence at these seasons they tied up the mouths
                    of dogs and pigs, and put fowls under a calabash or bandaged their eyes. The
                    taboo was imposed either by proclamation or by fixing certain marks (a pole with
                    a bunch of bamboo leaves, a white cloth, &amp;c.) on the places or things
                    tabooed.</p>
                <p>The penalty for the violation of a taboo was either religious or civil. The
                    religious penalty inflicted by the offended <hi rend="italic">atuas or</hi>
                    spirits generally took the form of a disease: the offender swelled up and died,
                    the notion being that the <hi rend="italic">atua or</hi> his emissary (often an
                    infant spirit) had entered into him and devoured his vitals. Cases are on record
                    in which persons who had unwittingly broken a taboo actually died of terror on
                    discovering theiι ’ fatal error. Chiefs and priests, however, could in the case
                    of involuntary transgressions perform certain mystical ceremonies which
                    prevented this penalty from taking effect. The civil penalty for breaking a
                    taboo varied in severity. In Hawaii there were police officers appointed by the
                    king to see that the taboo was observed, and every breach of it was punished
                    with death, unless the offender had powerful friends in the persons of priests
                    or chiefs. Elsewhere the punishment was milder; in Fiji (which, however, is
                    Melanesian) death was rarely inflicted, but the delinquent was robbed and his
                    gardens despoiled. In New Zealand this judicial robbery was reduced to a system.
                    No sooner was it known that a man had broken a taboo than all his friends and
                    acquaintances swarmed down on him and carried off whatever they could lay hands
                    on. Under this system (known as <hi rend="italic">muru)</hi> property circulated
                    with great rapidity. If, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a child fell into the
                    fire, the father was robbed of nearly all he possessed.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The origin of this custom may perhaps be
                    discerned in a custom of the Dieri tribe, South Australia. Among them, if a
                    child meets with an accident, all its relations immediately get their heads
                    broken with sticks or boomerangs till the blood flows down their faces, this
                    surgical operation being supposed to ease the child’s pain <hi rend="italic"
                    >(.Native Tribes of S. Australia,</hi> p. 280).</p></note></p>
                <p>Besides the permanent and the artificially created taboos there were others which
                    arose spontaneously as a result of circumstances. Thus all persons dangerously
                    ill were taboo and were removed from their houses to sheds in the bush; if they
                    remained in the house and died there the house was tabooed and deserted. Mothers
                    after childbirth were taboo, and so were their new-born children. Women before
                    marriage were <hi rend="italic">noa,</hi> and could have as many lovers as they
                    chose; but after marriage they were strictly tabooed to their husbands and from
                    every one else. One of the strictest taboos was incurred by all persons who
                    handled the body or bones of a dead person or assisted at his funeral. In Tonga
                    a common person who touched a dead chief was tabooed for ten lunar months; a
                    chief who touched a dead chief was tabooed for from three to five months
                    according to the rank of the deceased. Burial grounds were taboo; and in N.ew
                    Zealand a canoe which had carried a corpse was never afterwards used, but was
                    drawn on shore and painted red. Red was the taboo colour in New Zealand; in
                    Hawaii, Tahiti, Tonga, and Samoa it was white. In the Marquesas a man who had
                    slain an enemy was taboo for ten days: he might have no intercourse with his
                    wife and might not meddle with fire; he had to get some one else to cook for
                    him. A woman engaged in the preparation of cocoa-nut oil was taboo for five days
                    or more, during which she might have no intercourse with men. ~ A tabooed person
                    might not eat his food with his hands, but was fed by another person; if he
                    could get no one to feed him, he had to go down on his knees and pick up his
                    food with his mouth, holding his hands behind him. A chief who was permanently
                    taboo never ate in his own house but always in the open air, being fed by one of
                    his wives, or taking his food with the help of a fern stalk so as not to touch
                    his head with his hands; food left by him was kept for him in a sacred place;
                    any other person eating of it was supposed to die immediately. A man of any
                    standing could not carry provisions on his back; if he did so they became taboo
                    and were useless to any one but himself. For the taboo was communicated as it
                    were by infection to whatever a tabooed person or thing touched. This rule
                    applied in its fullest force to the king and queen of Tahiti. The ground they
                    trod on became sacred; if they entered a house, it became taboo to them and had
                    to be abandoned to them by its owner. Hence special houses were set apart for
                    them on their travels, and, except in their hereditary districts, they were
                    always carried on men’s shoulders to prevent them touching the ground.
                    Elsewhere, as in New Zealand, this rule was not carried out so strictly. But
                    even in New Zealand the spots on which great chiefs rested during a journey
                    became taboo and were surrounded with a fence of basket-work. The head and hair,
                    especially of a chief, were particularly taboo or sacred; to touch a man’s head
                    was a gross insult. If a chief touched his own head with his fingers he had
                    immediately to apply them to his nose and snuff up the sanctity which they had
                    abstracted from his head. The cutting of a chiefs hair was a solemn ceremony;
                    the severed locks were collected and buried in a sacred place or hung up on a
                    tree. If a drop of a chiefs blood fell upon anything, that thing became taboo to
                    him, i.e., was his property. If he breathed on a fire, it became sacred and
                    could not be used for cooking. In his house no fire could under any
                    circumstances be used for cooking; no woman could enter his house before a
                    certain service had been gone through. Whatever a new-born child touched became
                    taboo to (ι,e., in favour of) the child. The law which separated tabooed persons
                    and things from contact with food was especially strict. Hence a tabooed or
                    sacred person ought not to leave his comb or blanket or anything which had
                    touched his head or back (for the back was also particularly taboo) in a place
                    where food had been cooked; and in drinking he was careful not to touch the
                    vessel with his hands or lips (otherwise the vessel became taboo and could not
                    be used by any one else), but to have the liquid shot down his throat from a
                    distance by a second person.</p>
                <p>There were various ceremonies by which a taboo could be removed. In Tonga a
                    person who had become taboo by touching a chief or anything belonging to him
                    could not feed himself till he had got rid of the taboo by touching the soles of
                    a superior chiefs feet with his hands and then rinsing his hands in water, or
                    (if water was scarce) nibbing them with the juice of the plantain or banana.
                    But, if a man found that he had already (unknowingly) eaten with tabooed hands,
                    he sat down before a chief, took up the foot of the latter, and pressed it
                    against his stomach to counteract the effect of the food inside. In New Zealand
                    a taboo,could be taken off by a child or grandchild. The tabooed person touched
                    the child and took drink or food from its hands; the man was then free, but the
                    child was tabooed for the rest of the day. A Maori chief who became taboo by
                    touching the sacred head of his child was disinfected, so to speak, as follows.
                    On the following day (the ceremony could not be performed sooner) he rubbed his
                    hands over with potato or fern root which had been cooked over a sacred fire;
                    this food was then carried to the head of the family <hi rend="italic">in the
                    female line,</hi> who ate it, whereupon the hands became <hi rend="italic"
                    >noa.</hi> The taboo was removed from a new-born child in a somewhat similar
                    manner. The father took the child in his arms and touched its head, back,
                    &amp;c., with some fern root which had been roasted over a sacred fire; next
                    morning a similar ceremony was performed on the child by its eldest relative in
                    the female line; the child was then <hi rend="italic">noa, i.e.,</hi> free from
                    taboo. Another mode of removing the taboo was to pass a consecrated piece of
                    wood over the right shoulder, round the loins, and back again over the left
                    shoulder, after which the stick was broken in two and either buried, or burned,
                    or cast into the sea.</p>
                <p>Besides the taboos already described there were others which any one could
                    impose. In New Zealand, if a man wished to preserve his house, crop, garden, or
                    anything else, he made it taboo; similarly he could appropriate a forest tree or
                    a piece of drift timber, &amp;c., by tying a mark to it or giving it a chop with
                    his axe. In Samoa for a similar purpose a man would set up a representation of,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a sea pike or a shark, believing that any one who
                    meddled with property thus protected would be killed by a sea pike or shark the
                    next time he bathed. Somewhat similar to this was what may be called the village
                    taboo. In the autumn the <hi rend="italic">ku,mera</hi> (sweet potato) fields
                    belonging to the village were taboo till the crop was gathered, so that no
                    stranger could approach them; and all persons engaged in getting in the crop
                    were taboo, and could therefore for the time engage in no other occupation.
                    Similar taboos were laid on woods during the hunting season and on rivers during
                    the fishing season.</p>
                <p>On looking over the various taboos mentioned above we are tempted to divide them
                    into two general classes,— taboos of privilege and taboos of disability. Thus
                    the taboo of chiefs, priests, and temples might be described as a privilege,
                    while the taboo imposed on the sick and on persons who had come in contact with
                    the dead might be regarded as a disability; and we might say acccordingly that
                    the former rendered persons and things sacred or holy, while the latter rendered
                    them unclean or accursed. But that no such distinction ought to be drawn is
                    clear from the fact that the rules to be observed in the one case and in the
                    other were identical. On the other hand, it is true that the opposition of
                    sacred and accursed, clean and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n26/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0026-0017"/> unclean, which plays so important a part in the
                    later history of religion, did in fact arise by differentiation from the single
                    root idea of taboo, which includes and reconciles them both and by reference to
                    which alone their history and mutual relation are intelligible.</p>
                <p>The original character of the taboo must be looked for not in its civil but in
                    its religious element. It was not the creation of a legislator but the gradual
                    outgrowth of animistic beliefs, to which the ambition and avarice of chiefs and
                    priests afterwards gave an artificial extension. But in serving the cause of
                    avarice and ambition it subserved the progress of civilization, by fostering
                    conceptions of the rights of property and the sanctity of the marriage tie,—
                    conceptions which in time grew strong enough to stand by themselves and to fling
                    away the crutch of superstition which in earlier days had been their sole
                    support. For we shall scarcely err in believing that even in advanced societies
                    the moral sentiments, in so far as they are merely sentiments and are not based
                    on an induction from experience, derive much of their force from an original
                    system of taboo. Thus on the taboo were grafted the golden fruits of law and
                    morality, while the parent stem dwindled slowly into the sour crabs and empty
                    husks of popular superstition on which the swine of modern society are still
                    content to feed.</p>
                <p>It remains to indicate briefly some facts which point to a wide diffusion under
                    various names of customs similar to the taboo. As might have been expected, the
                    taboo is found, though in a less marked form, among the Micronesians, Malays,
                    and Dyaks, all of whom are ethnologically connected with the Polynesians. In
                    Micronesia both the name and the institution occur: the inhabitants of certain
                    islands are forbidden to eat certain animals and the fruits of certain trees;
                    temples and great chiefs are tabooed from the people; any one who fishes must
                    previously for twenty-four hours abstain from women;<note anchored="true"

                    with women men are not allowed to use certain words, &amp;c. Again, the Malays
                    have the custom, though apparently not the name. In Timor and the neighbouring
                    islands the word for taboo is <hi rend="italic">pamali</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">pomαlτ)</hi>; and during the long festival which celebrates a
                    successful head-hunt the man who has secured the most heads is <hi rend="italic"
                    >pamali</hi>; he must not sleep with his wife nor eat from his own hand, but is
                    fed by women. <hi rend="italic">Pamali</hi> is a Javanese word, and had
                    originally in Java and Sumatra the same meaning that it now bears in Timor. In
                    Celebes a mother after childbirth was <hi rend="italic">pamali.</hi> Amongst the
                    Dyaks of Borneo the <hi rend="italic">pamali</hi> (called by the Land Dyaks <hi
                    rend="italic">poriklι)</hi> is regularly practised at the planting of rice,
                    harvest home, when the cry of the gazelle is heard behind, in times of sickness,
                    after a death, &amp;c. At the harvest home it is observed by the whole tribe, no
                    one being allowed to enter or leave the village. The house where a death has
                    taken place is <hi rend="italic">pamali</hi> for twelve days, during which no
                    one may enter it and nothing may be taken out of it. A tabooed Dyak may not
                    bathe, meddle with fire, follow his ordinary occupation, or leave his house.
                    Certain families are forbidden to eat the flesh of particular animals, as
                    cattle, goats, and snakes. The taboo is often indicated by a bundle of spears or
                    a rattan. The Motu of New Guinea also have the taboo: a man is tabooed after
                    handling a corpse. He then keeps apart from his wife; his food is cooked for him
                    by his sister; and he may not touch it with his hands. After three days he
                    bathes and is free.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Joum. Anthrop. Inst.,</hi> viii. p. 370.</p></note> But the Motu
                    appear to be Malayo-Polynesians, not Melanesians proper. However, in Melanesia
                    also we find the taboo. It flour ished in Fiji. It is observed in New Caledonia
                    in cases of death, to preserve a crop, &amp;c. According to the Rev. R. H.
                    Codrington, there is this distinction between the Melanesian and the Polynesian
                    taboo, that for the former there is no supernatural sanction: the man who breaks
                    a taboo simply pays compensation to the person on whose tabooed property he has
                    transgressed. But Mr R. Parkinson states that in New Britain (now New Pomerania)
                    a person who violates a taboo-mark set on a plantation, tree, &amp;c., is
                    supposed to be “attacked by sickness and misfortune.” To go through the similar
                    customs observed by savages all over the world would be endless; we may,
                    however, note that a regular system of taboo is said to exist among some of the
                    wild tribes of the Naga Hills in India,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    rend="italic">Journ. Anthrop. Inst.,</hi> vii. p. 206.</p></note> In fact some
                    of the most characteristic features of taboo—the prohibition to eat certain
                    foods and the disabilities entailed by childbirth and by contact with the dead,
                    together with a variety of ceremonies for removing these disabilities— have been
                    found more or less amongst all primitive races. It is more interesting to mark
                    the traces of such customs among civilized peoples, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Jews, Greeks, and Romans.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Jews—(1) the vow of the Nazarite (Num. vi. 1-21) presents the closest
                    resemblance to the Polynesian taboo. The meaning of the word Nazarite is “one
                    separated or consecrated,” and this, as we saw (p. 15), is precisely the meaning
                    of taboo. It is the head of the Nazarite that is especially consecrated (v. 7,
                    “his separation unto God is upon his head ”; v. 9, “defile the head of his
                    separation”; V. 11, “shall hallow his head ”), and so it was in the taboo. The
                    Nazarite might not partake of certain meats and drinks, nor shave his head, nor
                    touch a dead body,—all rules of taboo. If a person died suddenly beside him,
                    this was said to “defile the head of his separation,” and the same effect,
                    expressed in the same language, would apply to a tabooed Polynesian in similar
                    circumstances. Again, the mode of terminating the vow of the Nazarite
                    corresponds with the mode of breaking a taboo. He shaved his head at the door of
                    the sanctuary and the priest placed food in his hands, either of which acts
                    would have been a flagrant violation of a Polynesian taboo. (2) Some of the
                    rules for the observance of the Sabbath are identical with rules of strict
                    taboo; such are the prohibitions to do any work, to kindle a fire in the house,
                    to cook food, and to go out of doors (Exod. xxxv. 2, 3; xvi. 23, 29). The
                    Essenes strictly observed the rules to cook no food and light no fire on the
                    Sabbath (Josephus, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Jud.,</hi> ii. 8, 9). (3) Any one who
                    touched a dead body was “unclean” for seven days; what he touched became
                    unclean, and could communicate its uncleanness to any other person who touched
                    it. At the end of seven days the unclean person washed his clothes, bathed
                    himself, and was clean (Num. xix. 11, 14, 19, 22). In Polynesia, as we have
                    seen, any one who touched a dead body was taboo; what he touched became taboo,
                    and could communicate the infection to any one who touched it; and one of the
                    ceremonies for getting rid of the taboo was washing. (4) A Jewish mother after
                    childbirth was unclean (Lev. xii.); a Polynesian mother was taboo. (5) A great
                    many animals were unclean, and could infect with their uncleanness whatever they
                    touched; earthen vessels touched by certain of them were broken. Certain animals
                    were taboo in Polynesia, and utensils which had contracted a taint of taboo were
                    in some cases broken.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Greeks a survival, or at least a reminiscence, of a system of taboo
                    is perhaps to be found in certain applications of the epithets “sacred” and

                    An army is sacred (O√., xxiv. 81), and so are sentinels on duty (∕Z., x. 56;
                    xxiv. 681). This resembles the war-taboo of the Polynesians; on a warlike
                    expedition all Maori warriors are taboo, and the permanent personal taboo of the
                    chiefs is increased twofold: they are “tabooed an inch thick.” The Jews also
                    seem to have had a war-taboo, for when out on the war-path they abstained from
                    women (1 Sam. xxi. 4, 5),—a rule strictly observed by Maori warriors on a
                    dangerous expedition. The Dards, who with the kindred Siah Posh Kafirs on the

                    from May to September; and “victory to the chastest” is said to be a maxim of

                    on; and among the Basutos, before the corn on the threshing-floor can be
                    touched, a religious ceremony has to be performed, and all “defiled” persons are

                    epithet “divine” commonly applied to a swineherd in Homer may point to a time
                    when pigs were sacred or tabooed. In Crete pigs were certainly sacred and not
                    eaten (Athenaeus, 376a), and apparently at Pessinus also (Pausanias, vii. 17,
                    10). Amongst the Jews and Syrians, of course, pigs were tabooed; and it was a
                    moot question with the Greeks whether the Jews abhorred or worshipped pigs
                    (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Quoest. Conv.,</hi> iv. 5). The pigs kept in the great
                    temple at Hierapolis were neither sacrificed nor eaten; some people thought that
                    they were sacred, others that they were unclean, ∈vαγeαs (Lucian, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Dea Syria,</hi> 54). Here we have an exact taboo, the ideas of
                    sacredness and uncleanness being indistinguishable. Similarly by the Ojibways
                    the dog is regarded as “unclean and yet as in some respects holy.”<note

                <p>Amongst the Romans, who preserved more traces of primitive barbarism than the
                    Greeks, the flamen dialis was hedged in by a perfect network of taboos. He was
                    not allowed to ride or even touch a horse, nor to look at an army under arms,
                    nor to wear a ring which was not broken, nor to have a knot on any part of his
                    garments; no fire, except a sacred fire, could be taken out of his house; he
                    might not touch or even name a goat, a dog, raw meat, beans, and ivy; he might
                    not walk under a vine; the feet of his bed had to be daubed with mud; his hair
                    could be cut only by a freeman, and his hair and nails when cut had to be buried
                    under a lucky tree; he might not touch a corpse, Ac. His wife, the flaminica,
                    was also subject to taboos: at certain festivals she might not comb her hair; if
                    she heard thunder, she was taboo <hi rend="italic">(feriata)</hi> till she had
                    offered an expiatory sacrifice. The similarity of some of these rules to the
                    Polynesian taboo is obvious. The Roman <hi rend="italic">feriae</hi> were
                    periods of taboo; no work might be done during them except w orks of necessity:
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> an ox might be pulled out of a pit or a tottering
                    roof supported. Any person who mentioned Salus, Semonia, Seia, Segetia, or
                    Tutilina was tabooed <hi rend="italic">(ferias observabat).</hi><note
