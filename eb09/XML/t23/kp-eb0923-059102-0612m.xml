                    species is the least excellent, and the French is possibly the best. The truffle
                    used for Perigord pie <hi rend="italic">(pâté de foie gras)</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">T. melanosporum.</hi> When, however, the stock of <hi
                    rend="italic">T. melanosporum</hi> happens to be deficient, some manufacturers
                    use inferior species of <hi rend="italic">Tuber,</hi> such as the worthless or
                    dangerous <hi rend="italic">Choeromyces meandriformis.</hi> Even the rank and
                    offensive <hi rend="italic">Scleroderma vulgare</hi> (one of the puffball series
                    of fungi) is sometimes used for stuffing turkeys, sausages, &amp;c. Indeed, good
                    truffles, and then only <hi rend="italic">T. aestivum,</hi> are seldom seen in
                    English markets. The taste of <hi rend="italic">T. melanosporum</hi> can be
                    detected in Perigord pie of good quality. True and false truffles can easily be
                    distinguished under the microscope.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tuber aestivum,</hi> the English truffle, is roundish in shape,
                    covered with coarse polygonal warts, black in colour outside and brownish and
                    veined with white within; its average size is about that of a small apple. It
                    grows from July till autumn or winter, and prefers beech, oak, and birch woods
                    on argillaceous or calcareous soil, and has sometimes been observed in pine
                    woods. It grows gregariously, often in company with <hi rend="italic">T.
                    brumale</hi> and (in France and Italy) <hi rend="italic">T. melanosporum,</hi>
                    and sometimes appears in French markets with these two species, as well as with
                    <hi rend="italic">T. mesentericum.</hi> The odour of <hi rend="italic">T.
                    aestivum</hi> is very strong and penetrating; it is generally esteemed
                    powerfully fragrant, and its taste is considered agreeable. Its price in England
                    is two or three shillings a pound. The common French truffle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >T. melanosporum,</hi> is a winter species. The tubers are globose, bright brown
                    or black in colour, and rough with polygonal warts; the mature flesh is blackish
                    grey, marbled within with white veins. It is gathered in autumn and winter in
                    beech and oak woods, and is frequently seen in Italian markets, where it is
                    sometimes sold for 12s. 6d. a pound. The odour of <hi rend="italic">T.
                    melanosporum</hi> is very pleasant, especially when the tubers are young, then
                    somewhat resembling that of the strawberry; with age the smell gets very potent,
                    but is never considered really unpleasant. The common Italian truffle, <hi
                    rend="italic">T. magnatum,</hi> is pallid ochreous or brownish buff in colour,
                    smooth or minutely papillose, irregularly globose, and lobed: the interior is a
                    very pale brownish liver colour veined <pb break="no"

                    plantations of willows, poplars, and oaks, on clayey soil. Sometimes it occurs
                    in open cultivated fields. The odour of the mature fungus is very potent, and is
                    like strong garlic, onion, or decaying cheese. <hi rend="italic">T.
                    brumale,</hi> referred to above, grows in Britain. It is a winter truffle, and
                    is found chiefly under oaks and abele trees from October to December. It is
                    black in colour, globose, more or less regular in shape, and is covered with
                    sharp polygonal warts; the mature flesh is blackish grey marbled with white
                    veins. The odour is very strong and lasts a long time; the taste is generally
                    esteemed agreeable. <hi rend="italic">Choeromyces meandrifοrmis,</hi> which
                    occurs in Britain, is sometimes sold for T. <hi rend="italic">magnatum,</hi> the
                    colour of the flesh of both species being somewhat similar. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scleroderma vulgare,</hi> the " false truffle,” <hi rend="italic">is</hi>
                    extremely common on the surface of the ground in woods, and is gathered by
                    Italians and Frenchmen in Epping Forest for the inferior dining-rooms of London
                    where Continental dishes are served. It is a worthless, offensive, and possibly
                    dangerous fungus. A true summer truffle, <hi rend="italic">T</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">mesentericum,</hi> found in oak and birch woods on calcareous clay
                    soil, is frequently eaten on the Continent. It is esteemed equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">T. aestivum.</hi> It probably grows in Britain. Another edible
                    species, <hi rend="italic">T. macrosporum,</hi> also grows in Britain, in clayey
                    places under young beeches and oaks, on the borders of streams and roads, and
                    sometimes in fields; more rarely it grows in plantations of willow and poplar.
                    It has a strong scent of onions or garlic. <hi rend="italic">Terfezia
                    leonis,</hi> a famous truffle of Italy, Algeria, Sardinia, &amp;c., resembles
                    externally a potato. It grows in March, April, and May. Some persons eat it in a
                    raw state, sliced, and dipped in oil or egg. It is not scented, and its taste is
                    generally considered insipid or soapy. Sometimes an ally of the puff-balls, and
                    therefore (like <hi rend="italic">Scleroderma)</hi> not a true truffle, <hi
                    rend="italic">Melanogaster variegatus,</hi> is eaten in England and France. It
                    has been, and possibly still is, occasionally sold in England under the name of
                    “red truffle.” It is a small ochreous brown species with a strong aromatic and
                    pleasant odour of bitter almonds. When the plant is eaten raw the taste is sweet
                    and sugary, but when cooked it is hardly agreeable. The odour belonging to many
                    truffles is so potent that their places of growth can be readily detected by the
                    odour exhaled from the ground. Squirrels, hogs, and other animals commonly dig
                    up truffles and devour them, and pigs and dogs have long been trained to point
                    out the places where they grow. Pigs will always eat truffles and dogs will do
                    so occasionally; it is therefore usual to give the trained pig or dog a small
                    piece of cheese or some little reward each time it is successful. Truffles are
                    reproduced by spores, bodies which serve the same purpose as seeds in flowering
                    plants; in true truffles the spores are borne in transparent asci or sacs, from
                    four to eight spores in each ascus. The asci are embedded in vast numbers in the
                    flesh of the truffle. In false truffles the spores are free and are borne on
                    minute spicules or supports. The spores of the chief European truffles, true and
                    false, enlarged five hundred diameters, are shown in the accompanying
                    illustration. Many references to truffles occur in classical authors. The
                    truffle <hi rend="italic">Elaphomyces variegatus</hi> was till quite recent
                    times used, under the name of Hart’s nut or Lycoperdon nut, on account of its
                    supposed aphrodisiac qualities.</p>
