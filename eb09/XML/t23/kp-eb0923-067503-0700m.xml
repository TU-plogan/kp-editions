                    north side of the Tyne at its mouth. It is connected with Newcastle, 8 miles to
                    the west-south-west, by a branch of the North-Eastern Railway; its distance from
                    London is 273½ miles by rail. The town has rapidly increased within recent
                    years, and contains many well-built streets, squares, and villas. On the point
                    of the promontory there is a small battery called the Spanish battery, and near
                    it a monument has been erected to Lord Collingwood. Within the grounds to which
                    the gateway of the old castle gives entrance are the ruins of the ancient priory
                    of St Mary and St Oswin—the principal remains being those of the church. A pier,
                    half a mile long, serves as a breakwater to the harbour. Among the principal
                    public buildings are the assembly rooms and the aquarium (1872). The municipal
                    buildings of the borough of Tynemouth are situated in North Shields, where are
                    also the custom house, a master mariners’ home, a seamen’s institute, and a
                    sailors' home founded by the late duke of Northumberland. Shipbuilding is
                    carried on, and there are rope and sail works. The fish trade is of considerable
                    importance and employs several steam and sailing boats. The population of the
                    municipal and parliamentary borough of Tynemouth (incorporated in 1849; area
                    4303 acres), divided into the three wards of North Shields, Percy, and
                    Tynemouth, was 38,941 in 1871, and 44,118 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Tynemouth was a fortress of the Saxons, and was anciently known as Penbal Crag,
                    “the head of the rampart on the rock.” From remains found in 1783 it is supposed
                    to have been a Roman station. The first church was built of wood by Edwin, king
                    of Northumbria, about 625, and was rebuilt in stone by his successor Oswald in
                    634. The body of Oswin, king of Deira, was brought hither for burial in 651, and
                    on this account Tynemouth came to be in great repute as a place of burial both
                    for royal and ecclesiastical persons. The monastery was repeatedly plundered and
                    burnt by the Danes, especially during the 9th century. After its destruction by
                    Healfdeane in 876 it was rebuilt by Tostig, earl of Northumberland, who endowed
                    it with considerable revenue; but, having been granted in 1074 to the monks of
                    Jarrow, it became a cell of Durham. Malcolm III., king of the Scots, and his son
                    Edward, who were slain in battle at Alnwick on 13th November 1093, were both
                    interred in the monastery. In 1095 Earl Mowbray, having entered into a
                    conspiracy against William Rufus, converted the monastery into a castle, which
                    he strongly fortified. By William Rufus the priory was conferred on St Albans
                    abbey, Hertfordshire. It was surrendered to Henry VIII. on 12th January 1539,
                    and the site and remains were granted by Edward VI. in 1550 to the earl of
                    Warwick, afterwards duke of Northumberland. In 1644 the castle was taken by the
                    Scots under the earl of Leven. The town enjoyed various immunities at a very
                    early period, which were <pb break="no"

                    restored to it several free customs of which it had been deprived. Afterwards it
                    received a confirmation of its various former charters by Edward II. and Richard
                    II.</p>
