                    Jews and Gentiles. The doctors of both these recensions were and are called <hi

                    legislature which frames the laws. In these points the doctors of both
                    recensions agree. There are, however, also points of considerable difference
                    between the two Talmuds. These are not merely geographical, and so necessarily
                    linguistic,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Palestinian <hi rend="italic">Amoraim,</hi> teaching people who understood
                    Greek, had not to explain the Greek terms which frequently occur in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> and other works kindred to it. The Babylonian <hi
                    rend="italic">Amoraim,</hi> however, who in common with their hearers were
                    ignorant of Greek, had a somewhat irregular though certainly effective way
                    (received by them traditionally) of explaining the Greek terms in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> &amp;c., by Aramaic etymology. We will give two
                    instances only of this practice: —(1) 'p*D1SN, which is evidently the Greek <hi

                    *ρ*ΓI*Ι is evidently the Greek <hi rend="italic">bιaθηκη,</hi> and is explained

                    (evidently a Babylonian <hi rend="italic">Boroithd),</hi> we see that in T. B.,

                    Whilst the discussions in the Palestinian Talmud are simple, brief, and to the
                    point, those in the Babylonian Talmud are subtle, long-winded, and, although
                    always logical, sometimes even farfetched.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Compare p. 35, footnote 3.</p></note> But there is another
                    difference. The Palestinian Talmud, besides containing legal and religious
                    discussions, is a storehouse of history, geography, and archaeology, whilst the
                    Babylonian Talmud, taking into consideration that it is treble<note

                    into a mistake in describing the size of the Babylonian as twelve times that of
                    the Palestinian Talmud. They forget that two-thirds of the size of the former is

                    On the other hand, it bestows more care upon the legal and religious points,
                    and, being the later and the more studied of the two, it is also the more
                    trustworthy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">System of the Talmud.—</hi> Most people imagine not only that
                    the Talmuds are a pathless wilderness, without so much as grammatical rules in
                    their respective languages, but that the laws laid down in them rest on mere
                    tradition. In reality their languages have strictly grammatical rules (see below
                    under <hi rend="italic">Aids,</hi> &amp;c.), and their laws rest on a strictly
                    logical system. The laws in both Talmuds are discussed and argued on
                    philosophical rules, for which it is claimed that they have existed from time
                    immemorial, and can be traced to the Pentateuch itself. These are—(1) the Seven
                    Rules (n∏O y3B&gt;), put forth by Hillel <hi rend="italic">(fΓosephto
                    Synhedrin,</hi> vii., last §; <hi rend="italic">Siphro,</hi> towards the end of
                    the Introduction; <hi rend="italic">Aboth de-Rabbi Nathan,</hi> xxxvii.) but a
                    great deal older than his time; (2) the Thirteen Rules (∏∏0 K <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,i</hi> PB*), put forth by R. Yishma'el (Introduction to <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphro),</hi> which can, however, be traced <hi rend="italic">in
                    mice</hi> to the foregoing “Seven Rules”: both these are for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Halakhah</hi>; and (3) there are also the Thirty-two Rules (n∏0
                    D'ΠBH D'E⅛B ’), put forth by R. Eli'ezer b. R. Yose Haggalili (vol i. of most
                    editions of the Babylonian Talmud), which are for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agadah.</hi> In addition, most of the points to which these rules apply are
                    secured by early tradition. It is quite true that by idiosyncrasy digressions
                    are very frequent both in Talmud and <hi rend="italic">Midrash</hi>; but in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Halakhah</hi> the digression, however long, invariably ends in
                    coming back to the original cause of the logical combination, whilst in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Agadah</hi> the digression either comes back to the place from
                    which it started, or else will be found, on examination, to have been introduced
                    for its own sake, and have served its own purpose. As the doctors of Talmud and
                    <hi rend="italic">Midrash</hi> are mostly introduced in dialogues, this is the

                    said that the former is more largely represented in the Babylonian Talmud,
                    whilst the latter is more largely and more interestingly given in the
                    Palestinian Talmud. Whole collections of <hi rend="italic">Midrashim</hi> now in

                    a handbook of decisions. This is only in accordance with the nature and spirit
                    of an oral law which delegates the decisions to the Talmudico-speculative
                    capacities of the teachers of every age. Even several of the comparatively few

                    decision or opinion, it uses the phrase; “Rab and Shemuel, &amp;c., both

                <p>Editors.—The editorship of the Palestinian Talmud is generally, after

                    Introduction to the commentary on the Mishnah (commonly, but by mistake, called
                    Introduction to the Seder Ζerairn) and in his Introduction to the Mishneh
                    Torah.</p></note> ascribed to Rabbi Yohanan (b. Napha). But this, if literally
                    taken, is a gross mistake, as that teacher (ob. 279) died more than a hundred
                    years before the latest Amorα (c. 450) mentioned in that Talmud. A similar error
                    is made with respect to the editor or editors of the Babylonian Talmud, whose
                    names are given as Rab Asshi (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rab)</hi> (ob. 427) and
                    Rabina (ob. 550), and who lived still much earlier than the last teachers
                    mentioned in that Talmud (8th century). But it ought to be remembered that when
                    the ancients speak of editors of books of such a mixed character as the Mishnah,
                    the Zohar, both Talmuds, &amp;c., they mean the person or persons who gave the
                    first impulse to the collection or redaction of such books. In this sense,
                    certainly, Rabbi Yohanan was the editor of the Palestinian and Rab Asshi and
                    Rabina were the editors of the Babylonian Talmuds. For, whilst the first of the
                    latter pair went more than once through the discussion of the whole Mishnah by
                    the Amoraim from 190 to his time (c. 427), the latter supplemented the
                    collection down to his own time (550). As regards the Babylonian Talmud, the
                    Amoraim were succeeded by a new order of men called Saboraim (p3Ι 'X")13D),
                    i∙e∙, “opiners,” who ventured only occasionally to revise and authenticate the
                    sayings of their predecessors. The last of these Saboraim were Rab Tna (or Giza)
                    and Rab Simona (c. 550-590). In any case neither the one Talmud nor the other
                    was written down, slight private notes excepted <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(dηγ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">∣</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">d JT)Sjo),</hi> before
                    the close of the 6th century, if then. The apparently insurmountable difficulty
                    of keeping such vast masses of literature in the head is removed when one takes
                    into consideration that both teacher and student had means of help to their
                    memory fully corresponding to the vastness of the literature. In the first
                    place, they had the numbers already occurring in the Mishnah (e.g., five must
                    not separate the heave-offering on account of the benediction to be recited in
                    connexion with the act; Terumoth i. 1), &amp;c. Secondly, they had names. Since
                    to the sayings of the Talmud were generally attached the names of those who
                    uttered them, saying and name became in the memory of the student identical. If
                    somebody who had heard a certain saying from somebody, who in his turn had heard
                    it from somebody else, was mentioned in the Talmud, all other sayings, however
                    unlike these in nature, if they had only the same link of tradition, were
                    recited on the same occasion: e.g., in the Palestinian Talmud, Megillah iv. 1,
                    “says Rabbi Haggai, says Rabbi Shemuel b. Rab Yishak,” &amp;c.; T. B.,
                    Berakhoth, leaf 3δ, Arc., “says Rabbi Zerika, says Rabbi Ammi, says Rabbi
                    Yehoshua' b. Levi,” &amp;c. Thirdly, other oral traditions, which went by the
                    order of the Pentateuch, received in the written Pentateuch vast aids to memory.
                    Fourthly, the Mishnah (although itself not written down), by its divisions,
                    subdivisions, and sub-subdivisions, became, in its turn, a mighty aid to memory.
                    Fifthly, as regards the Babylonian Talmud, there are additional means of aiding
                    memory in existence, for every now and then one meets with a Mnemosynon (Siman),
                    which strings together the order of subjects (e.g., T. B., Berakhoth, '3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> c</hi> la, last line). Both in MSS. and printed editions
                    these Simanim are given in brackets. Rapoport and his followers would have us
                    believe that these mnemonic phrases are late inventions, but they have as yet
                    failed to make good their assertions. See T. B., Shabbath 104α, and T. B.,
                    Hrubνn, 54ό, where these Simanim are positively mentioned early in the 4th
                    century; cf. Rashi in loco.</p>
                <p>Value.—The value of the Talmuds may be estimated by the fact that they contain
                    the Mishnah in various recensions and a large portion of the contents of
                    Midrashic collections, and in addition comprise a vast amount of Sopheric
                    literature not to be found in the canonical Mishnah and Agadic matter not to be
                    found in the known Midrashim, and have thousands of notices on secular knowledge
                    of all kinds. Here, however, the reader ought to be again reminded that, whilst
                    the Babylonian Talmud, the one of much larger extent, contains a great deal more
                    Judaeo-religious matter, the Palestinian Talmud—of much smaller extent—is of
                    much greater value for the historian, the geographer, the numismatist, and other
                    students.</p>
                <p>Vicissitudes of the Talmud.—Whilst the Babylonian Talmud commanded the attention

                    full of Talmud copies were burned in France (see Journal of Philology, xvi.

                    accusations against the Talmud, managed that Rabbi Yehiel of Paris had to
                    dispute with him publicly about its contents. The disputation took place in the
                    midsummer of 1240; and R. Yehiel came out of it so victoriously that only after
                    four years’ fuι∙ther machinations the Talmud was actually burned. The
                    disputation is printed under the name of Disputatio cum Nicolao A. 1252 (!)

                    event of burning the Talmud called forth three .elegies—(1) by R. Binyamin b.

                    Talmud being studied in all parts of the world, the few copies surviving became
                    the means of an endless supply. Not so as regards the Palestinian Talmud, which
                    found no students, or but few, after the closing (c. 450) of the Jewish
                    academies in Palestine; and we have even to thank the enemies of traditional
                    Judaism, the Karaites, who used it in controversy with their Rabbanite
                    opponents, for the preservation of some copies of it. By degrees the neglect of
                    the book became so great that whole chapters of treatises, whole treatises of
                    orders, and almost two whole orders themselves, disappeared, and are lost to

                    <hi rend="italic">Sernah David</hi> belonged. Rabbenu Nathan’s father and
                    grandfather, like Rabbenu Nathan himself and his brother’s descendants, were, no
                    doubt, papal court Jews (and not linendrapers, as the latest editor of
                    the'Arω⅛Λ, by misreading and misinterpreting the somewhat hard verses of his
                    author, contrives to show). This lucrative position furnished them with ample
                    means not only for their noble charities to congregational institutions (a
                    synagogue, religious bath, &amp;c.), but also with the leisure necessary for the
                    pursuit of Talmudic studies. Rabbenu Nathan was <hi rend="italic">resh
                    kallo.h</hi> (rector of the Jewish university), and unquestionably the greatest
                    Talmudist, even as he was the poorest Hebrew poet, in Italy in the 11th and 12th
                    centuries. As regards his teachers we know four, three of whom he attended,
                    whilst he studied and digested the works of the fourth so well that, though
                    personally unknown to one another, they may be justly called master and
                    disciple. His first teacher was his own father; his second teacher, from whom
                    Rabbenu Nathan no doubt obtained his thorough knowledge of Babylonian habits,
                    was R. Masliah of Sicily, who had been a hearer of the greatest “gaon” of
                    Pumbaditha; his third teacher was R. Mosheh b. Ya'akobb. Mosheh b. Abbun of
                    Narbonne (or Toulouse; better known under the name of R. Mosheh Haddarshan); and
                    the fourth was Rabbenu Hananeel of Kairwan. He owed so much to this teacher that
                    as soon as the <hi rend="italic">'Arukh</hi> had appeared most people took it
                    for granted that Rabbenu Hananeel had lived at Rome, and accordingly called him
                    “a man of Rome—'Ish Romi”; see MS. Brit. Mus. Add. 27,201, leaf 735, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Tosaphoth, passim.</hi> (That Rabbenu Gershom, Rabbenu Mosheh

                    >'Amkh,</hi> does not merely explain the foreign <hi rend="italic">lj.e.,</hi>

                    thereby proves himself a doubly useful guide. In this, although he had been
                    preceded by no less a personage than the <hi rend="italic">Gaon</hi> Semah b.
                    Paltoi (fl. 870), who also composed such an <hi rend="italic">'Arukh,</hi>

                    work had been early lost. The assertion that the fourth of the four men captured
                    by the Spanish admiral (see below, p. 39) was R. Nathan Habbabli, that he lived
                    in Narbonne, and that he also composed a similar <hi rend="italic">'A rukh,</hi>
                    rests on a misunderstanding, as the quotation in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yohasin</hi> clearly shows. The passages there given under R. Nathan Habbabli
                    are taken <hi rend="italic">verbatim</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">'

                    Testament. We will only add here a few words concerning the bibliography of the
                    book. Of the <hi rend="italic">'Arukh</hi> exist so far ten editions, the first
                    of which came out undated, but before or about 1480. The seventh edition was
                    enriched by the physician R. Binyamin Musaphia’s <hi rend="italic">Musaph, he.,
                    Additamenta</hi> (Musaphia was a Greek and Latin scholar), and the latest
                    edition by Dr Kohut is now in progress. As regards the MSS. of this remarkable
                    lexicon the best copies are to be found partly in the University Library,
                    Cambridge (Add. 376, which has all the verses of the author and <hi

                    partly at the Court Library, Vienna (Cod. cvi. 1 and 2). The latter were carried
                    off by Napoleon I. to Paris in 1809, but in 1815 were returned to
                    Vienna.</p><p/></note> (b) Grammars.—A slight attempt at compiling a <pb

                    German by Krüger (Breslau, 1873), English by Goldammer (New York, 1876), and

                    Talmud had been commented on in Arabic. As regards the commentaries on the

                    There was indeed an earlier, and perhaps a still more valuable one in existence
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Saadia),</hi> but it is now unfortunately lost. As
                    regards the Palestinian Talmud, the only one in existence is that by the late Z.

                    a different MS. from that used for the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps;</hi>
                    (c) Krotoschin, 1866, with a short commentary differing from that of Cracow:
                    these three editions are each comprised in one volume; (cZ) the fourth edition
                    came out at Zhitomir, with commentaries by different men (see <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries</hi> above). All these editions are in folio. Of the editions of

                    critical student of history that the Talmud has not merely been the means of
                    keeping alive the religious idea among the Jews, but has formed their strongest
                    bond of union. When, after the fall of the city of Jerusalem and its temple, and
                    the expatriation of the Jews from Palestine, a goodly portion of the Mosaic law
                    lost its application, the Talmud became the spirit which put fresh life into the

                    the Talmud, the interpretation of which was chiefly in the hands of the
                    academies of Sura and Pumbaditha, the Jews of all the world found, if not a new
                    Jerusalem, at least a new Yabneh (Jamnia), <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a place
                    where the old learning was not merely continued, but made to shine with a yet
                    greater splendour. This fact will be the more readily acknowledged and
                    appreciated when one casts a glance at the miserable religious condition of the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Transference of Talmudic Learning from the East to the
                    West.—</hi> There naturally came a time when Talmudic learning, if it was to
                    maintain its influence upon the Jews, could not be confined to one spot. We have
                    seen under <hi rend="smallcaps">Rashi</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.vi}</hi> that the
                    great emperor of the West (Charlemagne) had been the means, towards the close of
                    the 8th century, of bringing learned Talmudists not only to Provence but to the
                    north of France and the south of Germany.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Italy, notably Sicily, was apparently the country which
                    obtained her teachers direct from Trak.</p></note> But when nearly two hundred
                    years later the academies of Babylonia were threatened with extinction (because
                    of their lacking, from various causes, the means of subsistence), so that they
                    had to send out members of their body to supplicate the support of their richer
                    brethren in other countries, it providentially happened that the four men whom
                    they sent were taken by a Spanish corsair admiral and sold in four different
                    slave-markets. Rabbi Shemaryah was sold at Alexandria, and was redeemed by the
                    Jews, and great was their astonishment when they recognized in him a most able
                    Talmudist. He became the head of the Cairo community, and one of the most
                    successful Jewish Talmud teachers Egypt ever had. Rabbi Husshiel was taken to
                    Kairwan, in Africa. There the Jews redeemed him; and when his great learning was
                    found out he was named the spiritual head of the Jews in that place. From the
                    school which he founded sprang not merely his own son, the famous Rabbenu
                    Hananeel, but also the great Rabbenu Nissim, both teachers of <hi

                    R. Mosheh, was brought to the slave-market of Cordova, the rabbi of which town,
                    a noble and rare example of unselfishness, modesty, and love of truth, placed
                    the ragged stranger who had only been ransomed for charity’s sake a day or so
                    before at the head of the community instead of himself. The name of the fourth
                    is unknown (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rabad</hi> IL, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Yohasin,</hi> ed. Cracow, leaf 1256). Some assert that he was R. Nathan
                    Habbabli, and that he became the teacher of the Jews in Narbonne, but this is a
                    mere conjecture, the truth of which has yet to be proved (see page 37, footnote
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>). Be this, however, as it may, four great
                    Talmudists, who had come direct from the Babylonian academies, became the means
                    of bringing Babylonico-Talmudic learning to places the Jews of which had been
                    dependent on the religious and literary crumbs that fell from the richly-laden
                    tables of Sura and Pumbaditha. Some years afterwards the former academy was
                    closed, and a short time afterwards the same fate befell that of Pumbaditha, the
                    sunset of which, if not the noonlight, in the persons of Rab Sherira Gaon and
                    his son Rab Haï Gaon was even more glorious than that of the sister academy, the
                    last “gaon” of which was Rab Shemuel b. Hophni, father-in-law of Rabbenu Haï.
                    Meanwhile, however, Talmudic learning had not merely become naturalized, but
                    eventually indigenous in various parts of Africa, and part of Europe (Spain,
                    Italy, Provence, the south of Germany, and the north of France). Rabbenu Gershom

                    Yakar of Worms, Rabbenu Eli'ezer Haggadol and his disciple and successor Rabbenu

                <p>Rabbenu Elyakim of Spires, Rabbenu Nathan b. Yehiel of Rome, and last but not
                    least Rashi himself, and his sons-in-law and other disciples, represented
                    Talmudic learning in such perfection as had not been found before as regards the
                    Babylonian Talmud, even in the land of its birth and growth. It was the
                    disciples’ disciples of these men who studied and taught in various towns of
                    England within a hundred years (1150) after the Conquest. When, towards the end
                    of the 13th century and the commencement of the 14th, the Jews were driven out
                    of England (1290) and France (1306), and flocked chiefly to Italy, Greece,
                    Germany, and Poland, the last-named country appropriated the lion’s share of
                    Talmudic learning, so that till within our own century the rabbis of the chief
                    communities in Hungary, Moravia, Bohemia, and other Austrian states, and in
                    Germany, Holland, England, &amp;c., had to be fetched from Poland. Talmudic
                    learning, since Mendelssohn and his school arose, threatened to die out not
                    merely among the Jews in Germany, but also among those of the other countries
                    where the Jews spoke the German tongue in some form or other. Within the last
                    twenty-five years, however, fresh impulse has been given to these studies, not
                    merely among Jews but also among Christians. (s. Μ. s.-s.)</p>
