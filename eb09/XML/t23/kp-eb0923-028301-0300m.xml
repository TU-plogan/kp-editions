                    branch of science, sometimes called the Dynamical Theory of Heat, deals with the
                    relations between heat and work, though it is often extended so as to include
                    all transformations of energy. Either term is an infelicitous one, for there is
                    no direct reference to force in the majority of questions dealt with in the
                    subject. Even the title of Carnot’s work, presently to be described, is much
                    better chosen than is the more modern designation. On the other hand, such a
                    German phrase as <hi rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">bewegende</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Kraft</hi><hi rend="italic">der Wärme</hi> is in all respects
                    intolerable.</p>
                <p>It has been shown in a previous article <hi rend="smallcaps">(Energy)</hi> that
                    Newton’s enunciation of the conservation of energy as a general principle of
                    nature was defective in respect of the connexion between work and heat, and
                    that, about the beginning of the present century, this <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacuna</hi> was completely filled up by the researches of Rumford and Davy (see
                    also <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat).</hi> In the same article Joule’s experimental
                    demonstration of the principle, and his determination of the work-equivalent of
                    heat by various totally independent processes, have been discussed.</p>
                <p>But the conservation of energy, alone, gives us an altogether inadequate basis
                    for reasoning on the work of a heat-engine. It enables us to calculate how much
                    work is equivalent to an assigned amount of heat, and <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa,</hi> provided the transformation can be effected; but it tells us nothing
                    with respect to the percentage of either which can, under given circumstances,
                    be converted into the other. For this purpose we require a special case of the
                    1aw of transformation of energy. This was first given in Carnot’s extraordinary

                    ><p>The author, N-L-Sadi Carnot (1796-1832), was the second son of Napoleon’s
                    celebrated minister of war, himself a mathematician of real note even among the
                    wonderful galaxy of which France could then boast. The delicate constitution of
                    Sadi was attributed to the agitated circumstances of the time of his birth,
                    which led to the proscription and temporary exile of his parents. He was
                    admitted in 1812 to the École Polytechnique, where he was a fellow-student of
                    the famous Chasles. Late in 1814 he left the school with a commission in the
                    Engineers, and with prospects of rapid advancement in his profession. But
                    Waterloo and the Restoration led to a second and final proscription of his
                    father; and, though Sadi was not himself cashiered, he was purposely told off
                    for the merest drudgeries of his service; il fut “envoyé successivement dans
                    plusieurs places fortes pour y faire son métier d’ingénieur, compter des
                    briques, réparer des pans de murailles, et lever des plans destinés à s’enfouir
                    dans les cartons,” as we leam from a biographical notice written by his younger
                    brother. Disgusted with an employment which afforded him neither leisure for
                    original work nor opportunities for acquiring scientific instruction, he
                    presented himself in 1819 at the examination for admission to the staff-corps
                    (état-major), and obtained a lieutenancy. He now devoted himself with
                    astonishing ardour to mathematics, chemistry, natural history, technology, and
                    even political economy. He was an enthusiast in music and other fine arts; and
                    he habitually practised as an amusement, while deeply studying in theory, all
                    sorts of athletic sports, including swimming and fencing. He became captain in
                    the engineers in 1827, but left the service altogether in the following year.
                    His naturally feeble constitution, farther weakened by excessive devotion to
                    study, broke down finally in 1832. A relapse of scarlatina led to brain fever,
                    from which he had but partially recovered when he fell a victim to cholera. Thus
                    died, at the early age of thirty-six, one of the most profound and original
                    thinkers who have ever devoted themselves to science. The work named above was
                    the only one he published. Though of itself sufficient to put h <hi
                    rend="underline">im in</hi> the very foremost rank, it contains only a fragment
                    of Sadi Carnot’s discoveries. Fortunately his manuscripts have been preserved,
                    and extracts from them have been appended by his brother to a reprint (1878) of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Puissance ΛIοtrice.</hi> These show that he had not only
                    realized for himself the true nature of heat, but had noted down for trial many
                    of the best modern methods of finding its mechanical equivalent, such as those
                    of Joule with the perforated piston and with the internal friction of water and
                    mercury. W. Thomson’s experiment with a current of gas forced through a porous
                    plug is also given. One sentence of extract, however, must suffice, and it is
                    astonishing to think that it was written over sixty years ago. “On peut donc
                    poser en thèse générale que la puissance motrice est en quantité invariable dans
                    la nature, qu’elle n’est jamais, à proprement parler, ni produite, ni détruite.
                    À la vérité, elle change de forme, c’est-à-dire qu’elle produit tantôt un genre
                    de mouvement, tantôt un autre; mais elle n’est jamais anéantie.”</p></note></p>
                <p>The chief novelties of Carnot’s work are the introduction of the idea of a cycle
                    of operations, and the invaluable discovery of the special property of a <hi
                    rend="italic">reversible</hi><hi rend="italic">cycle.</hi> It is not too much to
                    say that, without these wonderful novelties, thermodynamics as a theoretical
                    science could not have been developed.</p>
                <p>Carnot’s work seems to have excited no attention at the time of its publication.
                    Ten years later (1834) Clapeyron gave some of its main features in an anally
                    tical form, and he also employed Watt’s diagram for the exhibition of others.
                    Even this, however, failed to call attention properly to the extremely novel
                    processes of Carnot, and it was reserved for Sir W. Thomson (in 1848, and more
                    at length in 1849) to point out to scientific men their full value. His papers
                    on Carnot’s treatise, following closely after the splendid experimental
                    researches of Colding and Joule, secured for the dynamical theory of heat its
                    position as a recognized branch of science. James Thomson, by Carnot’s methods,
                    predicted in 1849 the lowering of the freezing point of water by pressure, which
                    was verified experimentally in the same year by his brother. Von Helmholtz had
                    published, two years before, a strikingly original and comprehensive pamphlet on
                    the conservation of energy. The start once given, Rankine, Clausius, and W.
                    Thomson rapidly developed, though from very different standpoints, the theory of
                    thermodynamics. The methods adopted by Thomson differed in one special
                    characteristic from those of his concurrents,—they were based entirely on the
                    experimental facts and on necessary principles; and, when hypothesis was
                    absolutely required, attention was carefully directed to its nature and to the
                    reasons which appeared to justify it.</p>
                <p>Three specially important additions to pure science followed almost directly from
                    Carnot’s methods :—(1) the <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> definition of
                    temperature; (2) the thermodynamic function or entropy; (3) the dissipation of
                    energy. The first (in 1848) and the third (in 1852) were given by W. Thomson.
                    The second, though introduced by Rankine, was also specially treated by
                    Clausius.</p>
                <p>In giving a brief sketch of the science, we will not adhere strictly to any of
                    the separate paths pursued by its founders, but will employ for each step what
                    appears to be most easily intelligible to the general reader. And we will
                    arrange the steps in such an order that the necessity for each may be distinctly
                    visible before we take it.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">General Motions.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The conversion
                    of mechanical work into heat can always be effected completely. In fact,
                    friction, without which even statical results would be all but unrealizable in
                    practical life, interferes to a marked extent in almost every problem of
                    kinetics,—and work done against friction is (as a rule) converted into heat. But
                    the conversion of heat into work can be effected only in part, usually in very
                    small part. Thus heat is regarded as the lower or less useful of these forms of
                    energy, and when part of it is elevated in rank by conversion into work the
                    remainder sinks still lower in the scale of usefulness than before.</p>
                <p>There are but two processes known to us for the conversion of heat into work,
                    viz., that adopted in heat-engines, where the changes of volume of the “working
                    substance” are employed, and that of electromagnetic engines driven by
                    thermoelectric currents (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii.
                    p. 96). To the latter we will not again refer. And for simplicity we will
                    suppose the working substance to be fluid, so as to have the same pressure
                    throughout, or, if it be solid, to be isotropic, and to be subject only to
                    hydrostatic pressure, or to tension uniform in all directions and the same from
                    point to point.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n301/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0301-0284"/>
                <p>The state of unit mass of such a substance is known by experiment to be fully
                    determined when its volume and pressure are given, even if (as in the case of
                    ice in presence of water, or of water in presence of steam) part of it is in one
                    molecular state and part in another. But, the state being determinate, so must
                    be the temperature, and also the amount of energy which the substance contains.
                    This consideration is insisted on by Carnot as the foundation of his
                    investigations. In other words, before we are entitled to reason upon the
                    relation between the heat supplied to and the work done by the working
                    substance, Carnot says we must bring that substance, by means of a <hi
                    rend="italic">cycle</hi> of operations, back to precisely its primitive state as
                    regards volume, temperature, and. molecular condition.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Watt's Diagram.—</hi> Watt’s indicator-diagram (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine)</hi> enables us to represent our operations
                    graphically. For if OM (fig. 1) represent the volume, at any instant, of the
                    unit mass of working substance, MP its pressure, the point P is determinate and
                    corresponds to a definite temperature, definite energy, &amp;c. If the points of
                    any curve, as PP', in the diagram repre sent the successive states through which
                    the working substance is made to pass, the work done is <hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    cit.)</hi> represented by the area MPP'M'. Hence, a cycle of operations, whose
                    essential nature is to bring the working substance back to its primitive state,
                    is necessarily represented by a <hi rend="italic">closed</hi> boundary, such as
                    PP'Q'Q, in the diagram. The area enclosed is the excess of the work done by the
                    working substance over that spent on it during the cycle. [This is positive if
                    the closed path be described clockwise, as indicated by the arrow-heads.]</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Carnot’s Cycle.—</hi> For a reason which will immediately
                    appear, Carnot limited the operations in his cycle to two kinds, employed
                    alternately during the expansion and during the compression of the working
                    substance. The first of these involves change of volume <hi rend="italic">at
                    constant temperature</hi>; the second, change of volume <hi rend="italic"
                    >without direct loss or gain of heat.</hi> [In his hypothetical engine the
                    substance was supposed to be in contact with a body kept at constant
                    temperature, or to be entirely surrounded by non-conducting materials.] The
                    corresponding curves in the diagram are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >isothermals,</hi> or lines of equal temperature, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >adiabatic</hi> lines respectively. We may consider these as having been found,
                    for any particular working substance, by the direct use of Watt’s indicator. It
                    is easy to see that one, and only one, of each of these kinds of lines can be
                    found for an assigned initial state of the working substance; also that, because
                    in expansion at constant temperature heat must be constantly supplied, the
                    pressure will fall off less rapidly than it does in adiabatic expansion. Thus in
                    the diagram the adiabatic lines PQ, P'Q' cut the lines of equal temperature PP',
                    QQ' downwards and to the right. Thus the boundary of the area PP'Q'Q does not
                    cross itself. To determine the behaviour of the engine we have therefore only to
                    find how much heat is taken in along PP' and how much is given out in Q'Q. Their
                    difference is <hi rend="italic">equivalent</hi> to the work expressed by the
                    area PP'Q'Q.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Carnot's Principle of Reversibility.—</hi> It will be
                    observed that each operation of this cycle is strictly <hi rend="italic"
                    >reversible;</hi> for instance, to take the working substance along the path P'P
                    we should have to spend on it step by step as much work as it gave out in
                    passing along PP', and we should thus restore to the source of heat exactly the
                    amount of heat which the working substance took from it during the expansion. In
                    the case of the adiabatics the work spent during compression is the same as that
                    done during the corresponding expansion, and there is no question of loss or
                    gain of heat directly.</p>
                <p>If, however, a transfer of heat between the working substance and its
                    surroundings have taken place on account of a finite difference of temperature,
                    it is clear that such an operation is not reversible. Strictly speaking,
                    isothermal expansion or contraction is unattainable in practice, but it is
                    (without limit) more closely approximated to as the operation is more slowly
                    performed. The adiabatic condition, on the other hand, is more closely
                    approximated to in practice the more swiftly the operation is performed. We have
                    an excellent instance of this in the compression and dilatation of air caused by
                    the propagation of a soundwave.</p>
                <p>And now we have Carnot’s invaluable proposition, <hi rend="italic">a reversible
                    heat-engine is a perfect engine,—</hi> perfect, that is, in the sense that no
                    other heat-engine can be superior to it. Before giving the proof, let us see the
                    immense consequences of this proposition. Reversibility is the sole test of
                    perfection; so that all heat-engines, <hi rend="italic">whatever be the working
                    substance,</hi> provided only they be reversible, convert into work (under given
                    circumstances) the same fraction of the heat supplied to them. The only
                    circumstances involved are the temperatures of the source and condenser. Thus we
                    are furnished with a general principle on which to reason about transformation
                    of heat, altogether independently of the properties of any particular
                    substance.</p>
                <p>The proof, as Carnot gave it on the hypothesis of the materiality of heat, is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">absurdo.</hi> It is as follows. Suppose a
                    heat-engine A to be capable of giving more work from a given amount of heat than
                    is a reversible engine B, the temperatures of source and condenser being the
                    same for each. Use the two as a compound engine, A working direct and B
                    reversed. By hypothesis B requires to be furnished with part only of the work
                    given by A to be able to restore to the source the heat abstracted by A, and
                    thus at every complete stroke of the compound engine the source has its heat
                    restored to it, while a certain amount of external work has been done. This
                    wou1d be the <hi rend="smallcaps">Perpetual Motion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.ν.).</hi><hi rend="italic">5. The Basis of the Second Law of
                    Thermodynamics.—</hi> Carnot’s reasoning, just given, is based on the hypothesis
                    that heat (or caloric) is indestructible, and that (under certain conditions) it
                    does work in being let down from a higher to a lower temperature, just as does
                    water when falling to a lower level. It is clear from several expressions in his
                    work that Carnot was not at all satisfied with this view, even in 1824, and we
                    have seen that he soon afterwards reached the true theory. But it is also clear
                    that such an assumption somewhat simplifies the reasoning, for in his
                    hypothetical heat-engine all the heat which leaves the boiler goes to the
                    condenser, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi> in the reversed working. The
                    precise point of Carnot’s investigation where the supposed indestructibility of
                    heat introduces error is when, after virtually saying compress from Q' to a
                    state Q determined by the condition that the heat given out shall be exactly
                    equal to that taken in during the expansion from P to P', he assumes that, on
                    farther compressing adiabatically to the original volume, the point P will be
                    reached and the cycle completed. J. Thomson, in 1849, rectified this by putting
                    it in the true form :— compress from Q' to a state Q, such that subsequent
                    adiabatic compression will ultimately lead to the state P.</p>
                <p>We have now to consider that, if an engine (whether simple or compound) does work
                    at all by means of heat, <hi rend="italic">less</hi> heat necessarily reaches
                    the condenser than left the boiler. Hence, if there be two engines A and B as
                    before, and the joint system be worked in such a way that B constantly restores
                    to the source the heat taken from it by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n302/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0302-0285"/> A, we can account for the excess of work done by
                    A over that spent on B solely by supposing that <hi rend="italic">B takes more
                    heat from the condenser than A gives to it.</hi> Such a compound engine would
                    transform into work heat taken solely from the condenser. And the work so
                    obtained might be employed on B, so as to make it convey heat to the source
                    while farther cooling the condenser.</p>
                <p>Clausius, in 1850, sought to complete the proof by the simple statement that
                    “this contradicts the usual behaviour of heat, which always tends to pass from
                    warmer bodies to colder.” Some years later he employed the axiom, “it is
                    impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency, to convey
                    heat from one body to another at a higher temperature.” W. Thomson, in 1851,
                    employed the axiom, “it is impossible, by means of inanimate material agency, to
                    derive mechanical effect from any portion of matter by cooling it below the
                    temperature of the coldest of the surrounding objects.” But he was careful to
                    supplement this by further statements of an extremely guarded character. And
                    rightly so, for Clerk-Maxwell has pointed out that such axioms are, as it were,
                    only accidentally correct, and that the true basis of the second law of
                    thermodynamics lies in the extreme smallness and enormous number of the
                    particles of matter, and in consequence the <hi rend="italic">steadiness</hi> of
                    their average behaviour. Had we the means of dealing with the particles
                    individually, we could develop on the large scale what takes place continually
                    on a very minute scale in every mass of gas, —the occasional, but ephemeral,
                    aggregation of warmer particles in one small region and of colder in
                    another.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Laws of Thermodynamics.—</hi> I. "When equal quantities
                    of mechanical effect are produced by any means whatever from purely thermal
                    sources, or lost in purely thermal effects, equal quantities of heat are put out
                    of existence, or are generated. [To this we may add, after Joule, that in the
                    latitude of Manchester 772 foot-pounds of work are capable of raising the
                    temperature of a pound of water from 50° F. to 51° F. This corresponds to 1390
                    foot-pounds per centigrade degree, and in metrical units to 425
                    kilogramme-metres per calorie (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat).]</hi></p>
                <p>II. If an engine be such that, when it is worked backwards, the physical and
                    mechanical agencies in every part of its motions are all reversed, it produces
                    as much mechanical effect as can be produced by any thermodynamic engine, with
                    the same temperatures of source and refrigerator, from a given quantity of
                    heat.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Absolute Temperature.—</hi> We have seen that the fraction
                    of the heat supplied to it which a reversible engine can convert into work
                    depends <hi rend="italic">only</hi> on the temperatures of the boiler and of the
                    condenser. On this result of Carnot’s Sir W. Thomson based his absolute
                    definition of temperature. It is clear that a certain freedom of choice is left,
                    and Thomson endeavoured to preserve as close an agreement as possible between
                    the new scale and that of the air thermometer. Thus the definition ultimately
                    fixed on, after exhaustive experiments, runs :—“The temperatures of two bodies
                    are proportional to the quantities of heat respectively taken in and given out
                    in localities at one temperature and at the other respectively, by a material
                    system subjected to a complete cycle of perfectly reversible thermodynamic
                    operations, and not allowed to part with or take in heat at any other
                    temperature; or, the absolute values of two temperatures are to one another in
                    the proportion of the heat taken in to the heat rejected in a perfect
                    thermodynamic engine, working with a source and refrigerator at the higher and
                    lower of the temperatures respectively.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    we now refer again to fig. 1, we see that, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> being the absolute temperatures corresponding to PP' and
                    QQ', and H, H' the amounts of heat taken in during the operation PP' and given
                    out during the operation Q'Q respectively, we have</p>
                <p>H∕i = H'∕i', <hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> be the values of <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> aud <hi rend="italic">t'.</hi> Also, if heat be measured in terms of
                    work, we have</p>
                <p>H-H' = area PP'Q'Q.</p>
                <p>Thus with a reversible engine working between temperatures <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the fraction of the heat supplied which is
                    converted into work is (í - i')∕i.</p>
                <p>It is now evident that we can construct Watt’s diagram in such a way that the
                    lines of equal temperature and the adiabatics may together intercept a series of
                    equal areas. Thus let PP' (fig. 2) be the isothermal <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    and on it so take points P', P', P''', &lt;fcc., that, as the working substance
                    passes from P to P', P' to P", &lt;tc., <hi rend="italic">t</hi> units of heat
                    (the unit being of any assigned value) shall in each case be taken in. Let QQ',
                    RR', &lt;fcc., be other isothermals, so drawn that the successive areas PQ',
                    QR', &lt;fcc., between any two selected adiabatics, may be equal. Then, as it is
                    clear that all the successive areas between each one pair of isothermals are
                    equal (each representing the area <hi rend="italic">t-t'),</hi> it follows that
                    all the quadrilateral areas in the figure are equal.</p>
                <p>It is now clear that the area included between PP and the two adiabatics PQR,
                    P'Q'R' is essentially <hi rend="italic">finite,</hi> being numerically equal to
                    <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Thus the temperature for each isothermal is
                    represented by the corresponding area. This is indicated in the cut by the
                    introduction of an arbitrary line SS', supposed to be the isothermal of absolute
                    zero. The lower parts of the adiabatics also are unknown, so that we may draw
                    them as we please, subject to the condition that the entire areas PS', PS",
                    P"S'", &lt;fcc., shall all be equal. To find, on the absolute scale, the
                    numerical values of two definite temperatures, such as the usually employed
                    freezing and boiling points of water, we must therefore find their <hi
                    rend="italic">ratio</hi> (that of the heat taken and the heat rejected by a
                    reversible engine working between these temperatures), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >assign</hi> the number of degrees in the interval.</p>
                <p>Thomson and Joule experimentally showed that this ratio is about L365. Hence, if
                    we assume (as in the centigrade scale) 100 degrees as the range, the
                    temperatures in question are 274 and 374 nearly. A full discussion of this most
                    important matter will be found under <hi rend="smallcaps">Heat.</hi></p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Entropy.—</hi> Just as the lines PP, QQ', &lt;tc., are
                    characterized by constant temperature along each, so we figure to ourselves a
                    quantity which is characteristic of each adiabatic line,—being constant along
                    it. The equation of last section at once points out such a quantity. If we write
                    √&gt; for its value along PQ, &lt;∕&gt;' for P'Q', we may define <hi
                    rend="superscript"> thus</hi> ≠'-≠=H∕i.</p>
                <p>From the statements as to the equality of the areas in fig. 2 the reader will see
                    at once that the area bounded by <hi rend="italic">t, f, φ, φ'</hi> is <hi
                    rend="italic">(tt')(φ' - φ).</hi> We are concerned only with the <hi
                    rend="italic">changes</hi> of <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> not with its actual
                    magnitude, so that any one adiabatic may be chosen as that for which <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> = 0.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">The Dissipation of Energy.—</hi> In the before-cited article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Energy</hi> (vol. viii. p. 210) this part of the subject
                    has already been treated. Since that article was written Sir William Thomson has
                    introduced the term <hi rend="italic">thermodynamic motivity</hi> to signify
                    “the possession the waste of which is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n303/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0303-0286"/> called dissipation.” We speak of a distribution
                    of heat in a body or system of bodies as having motivity, and we may regard it
                    from without or from within the system.</p>
                <p>In the first case it expresses the amount of work which can be obtained by means
                    of perfect engines employed to reduce the whole system to some definite
                    temperature, that, say, of the surrounding medium. In the second case the system
                    is regarded as self-contained, its hotter parts acting as sources, and its
                    colder parts as condensers for the perfect engine.</p>
                <p>As an instance of internal motivity we may take the case of a system consisting
                    of two equal portions of the same substance at different temperatures, say a
                    pound of boiling water and a pound of ice-cold water. If we neglect the (small)
                    change of specific heat with temperature, it is found that, when the internal
                    motivity of the system is exhausted, the temperature is about 46° C., being the
                    centigrade temperature corresponding to the geometrical mean of the original
                    absolute temperatures of the parts. Had the parts been simply mixed so as to
                    dissipate the internal motivity, the resulting temperature would have been 50°
                    C. Thus the work gained (t.e., the original internal motivity) is the equivalent
                    of the heat which would raise two pounds of water from 46° C. to 50° C.</p>
                <p>As an instance of motivity regarded from without we may take the simple case of
                    the working substance in § 2, on the hypothesis that there is an assigned lower
                    temperature limit. As there is no supply of heat, it is clear that the maximum
                    of work will be obtained by allowing the substance to expand adiabatically till
                    its temperature sinks to the assigned limit.</p>
                <p>Thus if P (fig. 3) be its given position on Watt’s diagram, PQ the adiabatic
                    through P, and P'Q the isothermal of the lower temperature limit, Q is
                    determinate, and the motivity is the area PQNM. If, again, we wish to find the
                    motivity when the initial and final states P and P' are given, with the
                    condition that the temperature is not to fall below that of the state P', the
                    problem is reduced to finding the course PP' for which the area PP'M'M is
                    greatest. As no heat is supplied, the course cannot rise above the adiabatic PQ,
                    and by hypothesis it cannot fall below the isothermal P'Q,—hence it must be the
                    broken line PQP'. Thus, under the circumstances stated, the motivity is
                    represented by the area MPQP'M'. If any other lawful course, such as PP', be
                    taken, there is an unnecessary waste of motivity represented by the area
                    PQP'.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Elementary Thermodynamic Relations.—</hi> From what
                    precedes it is clear that, when the state of unit mass of the working substance
                    is given by a point in the diagram, an isothermal and an adiabatic can be drawn
                    through that point, and thus <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> are determinate for each particular substance when <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> are given. Thus any two of the four
                    quantities ∫&gt;, <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> í, <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> may be
                    regarded as functions of the other two, chosen as independent variables. The
                    change of energy from one state to another can, of course, be expressed as in §
                    9, above. Thus, putting E for the energy, we have at once <hi rend="italic">dΕι
                    = tdφ~ρdυ</hi> (1)</p>
                <p>if <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be chosen as independent
                    variables, and if heat be measured, as above, in units of work. This equation
                    expresses, in symbols, the two laws of thermodynamics. For it states that the
                    gain of energy is the excess of the heat supplied over the work done, which is
                    an expression of the first law. And it expresses the heat supplied as the
                    product of the absolute temperature by the gain of entropy, which is a statement
                    of the second law in terms of Thomson’s mode of measuring absolute
                    temperature.</p>
                <p>But we now have two equations in partial differential coefficients :—</p>

                <p>From these we have two expressions for the value of</p>

                    substances,” defined as in § 1. To state it in words, let us multiply and divide
                    the right hand side by <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and it then reads :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The rate at which the temperature falls off per unit increase
                    of volume in adiabatic expansion is equal to the rate at which the pressure
                    increases per dynamical unit of heat supplied at constant volume, multiplied by
                    the absolute temperature.</hi></p>
                <p>To obtain a similar result with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> as independent variables, we have only to subtract from both sides of
                    (1) the complete differential <hi rend="italic">d {tφh</hi> so that d(E - <hi
                    rend="italic">tφ) — - φdt -pdυ.</hi></p>

                    :—</hi><hi rend="italic">The rate of increase of pressure with temperature at

                    special purpose. We give one example, as sufficiently showing the processes

                    it is found that the freezing point is lowered by about 0°O074 C. for each

                <p>When water and steam are in equilibrium, we have V <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>
                    much greater than V <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, so that the boiling-point (as
                    is well known) is raised by pressure. The same happens, and for the same reason,
                    with the melting point, in the case of bodies which <hi rend="italic"
                    >expand</hi> in the act of melting, such as beeswax, paraffin, cast-iron, and
                    lava. Such bodies may therefore be kept solid by sufficient pressure, even at
                    temperatures far above their ordinary melting points.</p>
                <p>This is, in a slightly altered form, the reasoning of James Thomson, alluded to
                    above as one of the first striking applications of Carnot’s methods made after
                    his work was recalled to notice.</p>
                <p>15. <hi rend="italic">Effect of Pressure on Maximum Density Point of Water.—</hi>
                    One of the most singular properties of water at atmospheric pressure is that it
                    has its maximum density at 4° C. Another, first pointed out by Canton in 1764,
                    is that its compressibility (per atmosphere) is greater at low than at ordinary
                    temperatures,—being, according to his measurements, 0‘000,049 at 34° F., and
                    only 0O00,044 at 64° F. It is easy to see (though it appears to have been first
                    pointed out by Puschl in 1875) that the second x)f these properties involves the
                    <hi rend="italic">lowering</hi> of the maximum density point by increase of
                    pressure. To calculate the numerical amount of this effect, note that the
                    expansibility, like all other thermal properties, may be expressed as a function
                    of any two of the quantities <hi rend="italic">p, v, t, Φ</hi>; say in the
                    present case <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t.</hi> Then we have
                    for the expansibility <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>-K≡^)^(⅛) <hi

                <p>The relation between small simultaneous increments of pressure and temperature,

                <p>Now the expansibility is zero at the maximum density point, for which therefore
                    this equation holds. But the equations above give</p>

                <p>Recent investigations, carried out by direct as well as by indirect methods, seem
                    to agree in showing that the true value is somewhat less than this, viz., about
                    -0°∙018 C.; so that water has its maximum density at 0° C. when subjected to
                    about 223 atmospheres. Thus, taking account of the result of § 14 above, we find
                    that the maximum density point coincides with the freezing point at - 2°‘8 C.

                    we could have a condenser at absolute zero, there could be no dissipation of

                    tends to a maximum is practically merely another way of expressing Thomson’s
                    earlier theory of the dissipation of energy.</p>
