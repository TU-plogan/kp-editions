                    the old law of Exod. xxiii. 16, under the name of “the feast of ingathering, at
                    the end of the year” (which, in the old Hebrew calendar, ran from autumn to
                    autumn), “when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field” (comp. Exod.
                    xxxiv. 22). The same feast is spoken of in Deut. xvi. 13 as “the feast of
                    booths” (E.V. “tabernacles,” whence the current name of the feast), when “thou
                    hast gathered in thy corn and wine” from the corn-floor and the wine-press. No
                    explanation is here given of the name “feast of booths”; but after the exile it
                    was understood that during this feast the people assembled at Jerusalem were to
                    live in booths constructed of branches of trees (Lev. xxiii. 39 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Neh. viii. 14 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> The passage in
                    Nehemiah, describing the celebration of the feast in 444 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> serves as a commentary on the post-exilic law in Leviticus, and from
                    it we learn that the use of booths on that occasion had no foundation in
                    traditional usage, but w as based directly on the law, which then for the first
                    time became generally known.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The expression that the Israelites had not done so since the
                    days of Joshua means that there was no recollection of their having ever done
                    so; for of course it is assumed that Joshua carried out every direction of the
                    law.</p></note> According to the law in question, the booths were to be a
                    memorial of the wilderness wandering (Lev. xxiii. 43), but of this there is no
                    hint in Deuteronomy; and, while it is quite in the style of the later law to
                    attach a new historical reference to an old name like “feast of booths,” it is
                    certain from Exodus that the feast had originally agricultural and not
                    historical significance. As such it is exactly parallel to the vintage feasts of
                    other ancient nations, <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> to the Athenian Oschophoria.
                    And, in particular, it is noteworthy that in Judges ix. 27 we find a vintage
                    feast at Shechem among the Canaanites, from whom the Israelites first learned
                    the ways of agricultural life, and from whom so much of the popular religion was
                    copied. To acts of worship nominally addressed to Jehovah, but really to the
                    Canaanite Baalim, Hosea expressly reckons rites celebrated “on all cornfloors”
                    (ix. 1), expressing thanks for divine gifts of corn, wine, and oil (ii. 8 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> and in their context these allusions leave no doubt that
                    the prophet refers, in part at least, to autumn feasts, in which Jehovah worship
                    was mingled with Canaanite elements (comp. Wellhausen, <hi rend="italic">Prol.
                    zur Gesch. Isr.,</hi> cap. 3, ii.; Eng. trans., p. 92 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi>
                    These feasts were local in character, but in northern Israel there was a great
                    autumn feast at the royal sanctuary at Bethel (1 Kings xii. 33), as even in the
                    days of Solomon there was such a feast at Jerusalem (1 Kings viii. 2). In the
                    nature of things the local feasts were the older, and it was the fame of great
                    shrines that gradually tended to draw worshippers from a distance to temples
                    like those of Jerusalem and Bethel. Finally, the Deuteronomic law of the one
                    sanctuary and the course of events which made that law the practical rule of the
                    remnant of Israel put an end to all local religious feasts, but at the same time
                    obscured the old significance of the festal cycle, and made room for the
                    historical interpretation of the celebrations, now concentrated at the temple,
                    which prevailed among the later Jews (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Passover</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentecost).</hi> In their later form all the yearly
                    feasts have exact times and rules. In Deuteronomy the autumn feast is not yet
                    tied to a day—it could hardly be so while it was still essentially a harvest
                    thanksgiving—but in the priestly legislation it is fixed to commence on the
                    fifteenth day of the seventh month (Lev. xxiii. 34). In Deuteronomy the feast
                    lasts seven days; Lev. xxiii. 36 adds an eighth, and this day ultimately became
                    the most important (John vii. 37).</p>
                <p>If we accept the conclusion that the autumn festival was originally a vintage
                    feast celebrated in local sanctuaries, the name “feast of booths” admits of a
                    natural explanation. The Canaanite feast at Shechem and the Hebrew feast at
                    Shiloh (Judges xxi. 21) were partly celebrated abroad in the vineyards, and
                    Hosea also knows such feasts on the open corn-floors. That it was usual to go
                    forth and live in booths during the vintage may be concluded from Isa. i. 8; the
                    same practice still prevails at Hebron (Robinson, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.
                    Res.,</hi> ii. 81). If it was these booths erected among the vineyards that
                    originally gave their name to the feast, we can understand how the book of
                    Nehemiah recognizes the erection of booths within the city of Jerusalem as an
                    innovation. No doubt at all feasts where there was a great concourse of visitors
                    many would be compelled to live in tents; this seems to have been the case even
                    in old Israel (Hos. xii. 9). But that is quite a different thing from the later
                    observance, in which booths or bowers had to be made and used even by those who
                    had houses of their own.</p>
