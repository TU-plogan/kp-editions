                    The species are numerous, and are distinguished one from another by the scales
                    of the bulb being woolly or smooth on the inner surface, by the character of the
                    flowerstalks, by the filaments being hairy or otherwise, and by other
                    characters. Owing to the great beauty of the flowers they have been favourites
                    in European gardens for two or three centuries, and have been crossed and
                    recrossed till it has become almost impossible to refer the plants to their
                    original types. The early flowering “Van Thol” tulips, the segments of which are
                    mostly scarlet with yellow edges, are derived from <hi rend="italic">T.
                    suaveolens,</hi> a native of the Caspian region. <hi rend="italic">T.
                    Gesneriana,</hi> a native of Armenia and central Russia, is the origin of some
                    of the later flowering varieties. <hi rend="italic">T. pubescens,</hi> thought
                    by Mr Baker to be a hybrid between the two species just named, is the source of
                    some of the early flowering kinds known as “pottebakker,” &amp;c. <hi
                    rend="italic">T. oculus solis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. Clusiana</hi> are
                    lovely species, natives of southern France, and <hi rend="italic">T.
                    silvestris,</hi> with elegant yellow pendulous flowers, is a doubtful native of
                    England. During the last few years, owing to the exertions of Russian
                    naturalists, a large number of new species have been discovered in Turkestan,
                    and introduced into Europe. Some of these are very beautiful, and render it
                    probable that by intercrossing with the older species still further difficulties
                    will be presented in the way of identification. These difficulties are further
                    enhanced by the fact that, quite apart from any cross-breeding, the plants, when
                    subjected to cultivation, vary so greatly in the course of two or three years
                    from the original species from which they are directly descended that their
                    parentage is scarcely recognizable. This innate power of variation has enabled
                    the florist to obtain, and ultimately to “fix,” so many remarkable varieties. At
                    the present day tulips are less fashionable than they once were, and
                    consequently the enormous prices given for new or improved varieties no longer
                    obtain, though, even now, two and three guineas are asked for special bulbs. It
                    must, however, be remembered that the “tulipomania” of the 17th century was
                    really a form of gambling, in which admiration of the flower and interest in its
                    culture were very secondary matters. Tulips were introduced into the Low
                    Countries in the 16th century from Constantinople and the Levant by way of
                    Vienna and Venice. There is a legend that an Antwerp merchant, to whom bulbs
                    were sent, cooked them for onions; and to this day the natives of some parts of
                    Persia and Afghanistan use the bulbs of <hi rend="italic">Tulipa chrysantha</hi>
                    for food. The mode of growth of a tulip bulb is worthy of attention. In spring,
                    at the flowering period, each bulb is a composite structure. It consists, first,
                    of the bulb of the year, which produces the flowers and the leaves. From the
                    axil of one (or more) of the scales of the flowering bulb emerges a secondary
                    bulb, destined to form leaves and flowers for the next season’s growth. In like
                    manner from the side of the second generation are produced tertiary bulbs, which
                    flower in the third year after their formation. Each bulb, therefore, has an
                    existence of three years, flowering in the third year, and dying afterwards, so
                    that the bulb planted in the autumn is not the same one that flowered in the
                    spring, but a second generation. For the cultivation of tulips, see <hi
