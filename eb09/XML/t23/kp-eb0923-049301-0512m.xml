                    indiscretion, was the second son of Charles, third Viscount Townshend, who
                    married Audrey, the daughter and heiress of Edward Harrison of Ball’s Park, near
                    Hertford, a lady who rivalled her son in brilliancy of wit and frankness of
                    expression. Charles was born 29th August 1725, and was sent for his education to
                    Leyden and Oxford. At the Dutch university, where he matriculated 27th October
                    1745, he associated with a small knot of English youths, afterwards well known
                    in various circles of life, among whom were Askew, the book-collector,
                    Dowdeswell, his subsequent rival in politics, Wilkes, the witty and unprincipled
                    reformer, and Alexander Carlyle, the genial Scotchman, who devotes some of the
                    pages of his <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> to chronicling their sayings
                    and their doings. He represented Great Yarmouth in parliament from 1747 to 1761,
                    when he found a seat in the treasury borough of Harwich. Public attention was
                    first drawn to his abilities in 1753, when he delivered a lively attack, as a
                    younger son who might hope to promote his advancement by allying himself in
                    marriage to a wealthy heiress, against Lord Hardwicke’s marriage bill. Although
                    this measure passed into law, he attained this object in August of the following
                    year by marrying Caroline, the eldest daughter of the second duke of Argyle and
                    the widow of Francis, Lord Dalkeith, the eldest son of the second duke of
                    Buccleugh. In April 1754 Townshend was transferred from the position of a member
                    of the Board of Trade, which he had held from 1749, to that of a lord of the
                    admiralty, but at the close of 1755 his passionate attack against the policy of
                    the ministry, an attack which shared in popular estimation with the scathing
                    denunciations of Pitt, the supreme success of Single-Speech Hamilton, and the
                    hopeless failure of Lord Chesterfield’s illegitimate son, caused his instant
                    dismissal. In the administration which was formed in December 1756, and which
                    was ruled by Pitt, the lucrative office of treasurer of the chamber was given to
                    Townshend, and in the following spring he was summoned to the privy council.
                    With the accession of the new monarch in 1760 this volatile politician
                    transferred his attentions from Pitt to the young king’s favourite, Bute, and
                    when, at the latter’s instance, several changes were made in the ministry,
                    Townshend was promoted to the post of secretary of war. In this place he
                    remained after the great commoner had withdrawn from the cabinet, but in
                    December 1762 he threw it up. Bute, alarmed at the growth in numbers and in
                    influence of his enemies, tried to buy back Townshend’s co-operation by sundry
                    tempting promises, and at last secured his object in March 1763 with the
                    presidency of the Board of Trade. When Bute retired and George Grenville
                    accepted the cares of official life, the higher post of first lord of the
                    admiralty fell to Townshend’s lot, but with his usual impetuosity he presumed to
                    designate one of his satellites to a place under him at the board, and the
                    refusal to accept the nomination led to his exclusion from the new
                    administration. While in opposition his mind was swayed to and fro with
                    conflicting emotions of dislike to the head of the ministry and of desire to
                    share in the spoils of office. The latter feeling ultimately triumphed; he
                    condescended to accept in the dying days of Grenville’s cabinet, and to retain
                    through the “lutestring” administration of Lord Rockingham,— “pretty summer
                    wear,” as Townshend styled it, “but it will never stand the winter,”—the
                    highly-paid position of paymaster-general, refusing to identify himself more
                    closely with its fortunes as chancellor of the exchequer. The position which he
                    refused from the hands of Lord Rockingham he was forced to accept from the
                    imperious Pitt (August 1766), and a few weeks later his urgent appeals to the
                    great minister for increased power were favourably answered, and he was admitted
                    to the inner circle of the cabinet. Dowdeswell, his predecessor at the
                    exchequer, resented his removal for his brilliant rival. The new chancellor
                    proposed the continuance of the land tax at four shillings in the pound, while
                    he held out hopes that it might be reduced next year to three shillings,
                    whereupon his predecessor, by the aid of the landed gentlemen, carried a motion
                    that the reduction should take effect at once. This defeat proved a great
                    mortification to Lord Chatham, and in his irritation against Townshend for this
                    blow, as well as for some acts of insubordination, he meditated the removal of
                    his showy colleague. Before this could be accomplished Chatham’s mind became
                    impaired by some mysterious malady, and Townshend, who was the most determined
                    and influential of his colleagues, swayed the ministry as he liked. His wife was
                    created (August 1767) Baroness Greenwich, and his brother was made
                    lord-lieutenant of Ireland. He himself delivered in the House of Commons many
                    speeches unrivalled in parliamentary history for wit and recklessness; and one
                    of them still lives in history as the “champagne speech.”’</p>

                <p>His last act was to pass through parliament resolutions which even his colleagues
                    deprecated in the cabinet, for taxing several articles, such as glass, paper,
                    and tea, on their importation into America, which he estimated would produce the
                    insignificant sum of &lt;£40,000 for the English treasury, and which shrewder
                    observers prophesied would lead to the loss of the American colonies. Shortly
                    after this event he retired to his wife’s country seat in Oxfordshire, where he
                    died on 4th September 1767, from a fever which he had neglected.</p>
                <p>The universal tribute of Townshend’s colleagues allows him the possession of
                    boundless wit and ready eloquence, set off by perfect melody of intonation, but
                    marred by an unexampled lack of judgment and discretion. He shifted his ground
                    in politics with every new moon, and the world fastened on him the nickname,
                    which he himself adopted in his “champagne” speech, of the Weathercock. His
                    official knowledge was considerable; and it would be unjust to his memory to
                    ignore the praises of his contemporaries or his profound knowledge of his
                    country’s commercial interests. The House of Commons recognized in him its
                    spoilt child, and Burke happily said that “he never thought, did, or said
                    anything” without judging its effect on his fellow-members. Charles Townshend is
                    the subject of a memoir by Mr Percy Fitzgerald.</p>
