                <p><label type="entry">TAPIR</label>. The general characters of the animals of the
                    perissodactyle or odd-toed section of the hoofed mammals are described under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 427. This once numerous group is at
                    present represented by only three rather isolated families, the Horses,
                    Rhinoceroses, and Tapirs. The last of these have retained much more of the
                    original characters of the primitive Ungulates of the Eocene period than the
                    others, and have indeed remained practically almost unchanged since the Miocene
                    period, while almost all other mammalian forms which existed then have either
                    become extinct or undergone extensive modification. The tapirs constitute the
                    single genus, <hi rend="italic">Tapirus,</hi> of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tapimdae.</hi></p>
                <p>The dentition is <hi rend="italic">i ∣, c ⅜, p ⅜, m</hi> ⅜; total 42. Of the
                    upper incisors, the first and second are nearly equal, with short, broad crowns,
                    the third is large and conical, considerably larger than the true canine, which
                    is separated from it by an interval. Lower incisors diminishing in size from the
                    first to the third; the canine, which is in contact with the third incisor,
                    large and conical, working against (and behind) the canine-like third upper
                    incisor. In both jaws there is a long interspace between the canines and the
                    commencement of the teeth of the molar series, which are all in contact. First
                    upper premolar with a triangular crown, narrow in front owing to the absence of
                    the anterior inner cusp. The other upper premolars and molars all formed on the
                    same plan and of nearly the same size, with four roots and quadrate crowns,
                    rather wider transversely than from before backwards, each having four cusps,
                    connected by a pair of transverse ridges, anterior and posterior. The first
                    lower premolar compressed in front; the others composed of a simple pair of
                    transverse crests, with a small anterior and posterior cingular ridge.</p>
                <p>Skull elevated and compressed. Orbit and temporal fossa widely continuous, there
                    being no true post-orbital process from the frontal bone. Anterior narial
                    apertures very large, and extending high on the face between the orbits; nasal
                    bones short, elevated, triangular, and pointed in front. Vertebrae: C 7, D 18, L
                    5, S 6, C about 12. Limbs short and stout. Fore feet with four toes, having
                    distinct hoofs: the first is absent, the third the longest, the second and
                    fourth nearly equal, the fifth the shortest and scarcely reaching the ground in
                    the ordinary standing position. Hind feet with the typical perissodactyle
                    arrangement of three toes,—the middle one being the largest, the two others
                    nearly equal. Nose and upper lip elongated into a flexible, mobile snout or
                    short proboscis, near the end of which the nostrils are situated. Eyes rather
                    small. Ears of moderate size, ovate, erect. Tail very short. Skin thick and but
                    scantily covered with hair.</p>
                <p>The existing species of tapir may be grouped into two sections, the distinctive
                    characters of which are only recognizable in the skeleton. (A) With a great
                    anterior prolongation of the ossification of the nasal septum (mesethmoid),
                    extending in the adult far beyond the nasal bones, and supported and embraced at
                    the base by ascending plates from the maxillae (genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elasmognathus,</hi> Gill). Two species, both from Central America, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tapirus bairdi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">T. dowi.</hi> The former
                    is found in Mexico, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama; the latter
                    in</p>
                <p>Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. (B) With ossification of the septum not
                    extending farther forward than the nasal bones <hi rend="italic">(Tapirus</hi>
                    proper). Three species, <hi rend="italic">T. indicus,</hi> the largest of the
                    genus, from the Malay Peninsula (as far north as Tavoy and Mergui), Sumatra, and
                    Borneo, distinguished by its peculiar coloration, the head, neck, fore and hind
                    limbs being glossy black, and the intermediate part of the body white; <hi
                    rend="italic">T. americanus (T. terrestris,</hi> Linn.), the common tapir of the
                    forests and lowlands of Brazil and Paraguay; and <hi rend="italic">T.
                    roulini,</hi> the Pinchaque tapir of the high regions of the Andes. All the
                    American species are of a nearly uniform dark brown or blackish colour when
                    adult; but it is a curious circumstance that when young (and in this the Malay
                    species conforms with the others) they are conspicuously marked with spots and
                    longitudinal stripes of white or fawn colour on a darker ground.</p>
                <p>The habits of all the kinds of tapirs appear to be very similar. They are
                    solitary, nocturnal, shy, and inoffensive, chiefly frequenting the depths of
                    shady forests and the neighbourhood of water, to which they frequently resort
                    for the purpose of bathing, and in which they often take refuge when pursued.
                    They feed on various vegetable substances, as shoots of trees and bushes, buds,
                    and leaves. They are hunted by the natives of the lands in which they live for
                    the sake of their hides and flesh.</p>
                <p>The singular fact of the existence of so closely allied animals as the Malayan
                    and the American tapirs in such distant regions of the earth and in no
                    intervening places is accounted for by what is known of the geological history
                    of the race, for, if we may judge from the somewhat scanty remains which have
                    been preserved to our times, consisting chiefly of teeth, the tapirs must once
                    have had a very wide distribution. There is no proof of their having lived in
                    the Eocene epoch, but in deposits of Miocene and Pliocene date remains
                    undistinguishable generically and perhaps specifically from the modern tapirs
                    (though named <hi rend="italic">T. ρriscus, T. arvernensis,</hi> &amp;c.) have
                    been found in France, Germany, and in the red crag of Suffolk. Tapirs appear,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n66/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0066-0057"/> however, to have become extinct in Europe before
                    the Pleistocene period, as none of their bones or teeth have been found in any
                    of the caves or alluvial deposits in which those of elephants, rhinoceroses, and
                    hippopotamuses occur in abundance; but in other regions their distribution at
                    this age was far wider than at present, as they are known to have extended
                    eastward to China <hi rend="italic">(T. sinensis,</hi> Owen) and westwards over
                    the greater part of the southern United States of America, from South Carolina
                    to California. Lund also distinguished two species or varieties from the caves
                    of Brazil. Thus we have no difficulty in tracing the common origin in the
                    Miocene tapirs of Europe of the now widely separated American and Asiatic
                    species. It is, moreover, interesting to observe how very slight an amount of
                    variation has taken place in forms isolated during such an enormous period of
                    time. (w. H. F.)</p>
