                    were affirmations of this principle. The Act of 7 Jac. I. c. 2 provided that all
                    such as were naturalized or restored in blood should receive the sacrament of
                    the Lord’s Supper. It was not, however, until the reign of Charles II. that
                    actual receiving of the communion of the Church of England was made a condition
                    precedent to the holding of public offices. The earliest imposition of this test
                    was by the Corporation Act of 1661 (13 Car. II. st. 2, c. 1), enacting that,
                    besides taking the oath of allegiance and supremacy and subscribing a
                    declaration against the Solemn League and Covenant, all members of corporations
                    were within one year after election to receive the sacrament of the Lord’s
                    Supper according to the rites of the Church of England. This Act was followed by
                    the Test Act of 1672 (25 Car. II. c. 2). The immediate cause of the Test Act
                    (the full title of which is “An Act for preventing dangers which may happen from
                    popish recusants ”) was the king’s declaration of indulgence, dispensing with
                    laws inflicting disabilities on Nonconformists. This Act enforced upon all
                    persons filling any office, civil or military, the obligation of taking the
                    oaths of supremacy and allegiance and subscribing a declaration against
                    transubstantiation, and also of receiving the sacrament within three months
                    after admittance to office. The Act did not extend to peers; but in 1678 30 Car.
                    II. st. 2 enacted that all peers and members of the House of Commons should make
                    a declaration against transubstantiation, invocation of saints, and the
                    sacrifice of the mass,—a special exception being made in favour of the duke of
                    York. The provisions of the Test Act were violated by both Charles II. and James
                    II. on the ground of the dispensing power claimed by the Stuart kings. In a
                    well-known case of Godden <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Hales (11 <hi rend="italic"
                    >State Trials,</hi> 1166), an action for penalties under the Test Act brought
                    against an officer in the army, the judges decided in favour of the dispensing
                    power,—a power finally abolished by the Bill of Rights. After a considerable
                    number of amendments and partial repeals by the legislature of the Acts of 1661,
                    1672, and 1678, and of Acts of indemnity to protect persons under certain
                    circumstances from penalties incurred under the Test Act, the necessity of
                    receiving the sacrament as a qualification for office was abolished by 9 Geo.
                    IV. c. 17, and all Acts requiring the taking of oaths and declarations against
                    transubstantiation, Ac., were repealed by the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829
                    (10 Geo.</p>
                <p>IV. c. 7). This general repeal has been followed by the special repeal of the
                    Corporation Act by the Promissory Oaths Act, 1871 (34 and 35 Vict. c. 48), of
                    the Test Act by the Statute Law Revision Act, 1863, and of the Act of 1678 by 29
                    and 30 Vict. c. 19. Religious tests remained in the English universities until
                    1871. To be a member of the Church of England was a necessary condition
                    precedent for holding most university or college offices by the Act of
                    Uniformity of 1662, and such offices were not affected by the Toleration Act of
                    1688 and the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829. In 1871 the University Tests Act
                    abolished subscriptions to the articles of the Church of England, all
                    declarations and oaths respecting religious belief, and all compulsory
                    attendance at public worship in the universities of Oxford, Cambridge, and
                    Durham. There is an exception confining to persons in holy orders of the Church
                    of England degrees in divinity and positions restricted to persons in holy
                    orders, such as the divinity and Hebrew professorships.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> A religious test was imposed immediately after
                    the Reformation. By 1567, c. 9, no one was to be appointed to a public office or
                    to be a notary who did not profess the Reformed religion. The Scotch Test Act
                    was 1681, c. 6, rescinded by 1690, c. 7. Renunciation of popery was to be made
                    by persons employed in education (1700, c. 3). A motion to add, after the 18th
                    article of union, an exemption of Scotsmen from the sacramental test in the
                    United Kingdom was negatived by the Scottish parliament. A similar fate awaited
                    a proposal that while a sacramental test was in force in England all persons in
                    public office in Scotland should subscribe their adhesion to the Presbyterian
                    Church government. By 1707, c. 6, all professors, principals, regents, masters,
                    or others bearing office in any university, college, or school in Scotland were
                    to profess and subscribe to the Confession of Faith. All persons were to be free
                    of any oath or test contrary to or inconsistent with the Protestant religion and
                    Presbyterian Church government. The reception of the communion was never a part
                    of the test in Scotland as in England and Ireland. The necessity for
                    subscription to the Confession of Faith by persons holding a university office
                    (other than that of principal or professor of theology) was removed by 16 and 17
                    Vict. c. 89. The Act provides that in place of subscription every person
                    appointed to a university office is to subscribe a declaration according to the
                    form in the Act, promising not to teach any opinions opposed to the divine
                    authority of Scripture or to the Confession of Faith, and to do nothing to the
                    prejudice of the Church of Scotland or its doctrines and privileges.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> An oath of allegiance was required by the Irish
                    Act of Supremacy (2 Eliz. c. 1). The English Act of 3 Will, and Μ. c. 2
                    substituted other oaths and enforced in addition from peers, members of the
                    House of Commons, bishops, barristers, attorneys, and others a declaration
                    against transubstantiation, invocation of the Virgin Mary and the saints, and
                    the sacrifice of the mass. By the Irish Act of 2 Anne c. 6 every person admitted
                    to any office, civil or military, was to take and subscribe the oaths of
                    allegiance, supremacy, and abjuration, to subscribe the declaration against
                    transubstantiation, &amp;c., and to receive the Lord’s Supper according to the
                    usage of the Church of Ireland. English legislation on the subject of oaths and
                    declarations was adopted in Ireland by Yelverton’s Act, 21 and 22 Geo. III. c.
                    48, § 3 (Ir.). These provisions were all repealed by the Promissory Oaths Act,
                    1871. The Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1793 (33 Geo. III. c. 21, Ir.) excepted
                    Trinity College, Dublin, from its provisions, and tests existed in Dublin
                    university until 1873. They were abolished as far as regarded certain scientific
                    professorships in 1867 by 30 Vict. c. 9, and were finally abolished for the
                    whole university by the University of Dublin Tests Act, 1873, except as to
                    professors of and lecturers in divinity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> By art. 6 of the constitution, “no
                    religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public
                    trust under the United States.” A similar provision is generally included in the
                    State constitutions.</p>
