                    chiefly in Kent but partly in Sussex, is situated in the midst of charming and
                    picturesque scenery, on the South-Eastern Railway and at the terminus of a
                    branch line of the London, Brighton, and South Coast Railway, 46 miles (by rail)
                    south-east of London and <hi rend="italic">5</hi> south of Tunbridge. It owes
                    its popularity to its chalybeate spring and its romantic situation. The wells
                    are situated near the Parade (or Pantiles), a walk associated with fashion since
                    the time of their discovery. The houses and shops in the Parade somewhat
                    resemble the Rows at Chester. It was paved with pantiles in the reign of Queen
                    Anne. The town is built in a picturesquely irregular manner, and a large part of
                    it consists of districts called “parks,” occupied by villas and mansions. On
                    Rusthall common, about a mile from the town, is the curiously shaped Toad Rock,
                    and about a mile south-west the striking group called High Rocks. The principal
                    public buildings are the pump-room, the town-hall, the corn exchange, the public
                    hall, the mechanics’ institute, the friendly society’s hall, the dispensary and
                    infirmary, and the provident dispensary. The Tunbridge Wells sanatorium is
                    situated in grounds sixty acres in extent, and is capable of receiving 150
                    visiters. There is a large trade in Tunbridge ware, which is made chiefly at
                    Tunbridge, and includes work tables, boxes, toys, &amp;c., made of hard woods,
                    such as beech, sycamore, holly, and cherry, and inlaid with mosaic. The town is
                    governed by a local board of twenty-four members. The population of the urban
                    sanitary district (area 3351 acres) in 1871 was 19,410 and in 1881 24,308.</p>
                <p>The town owes its rise to the discovery of the medicinal springs by Dudley, Lord
                    North, in 1606. Henrietta Maria, wife of Charles I., retired to drink the waters
                    at Tunbridge after the birth of her eldest son Charles. Soon after the
                    Restoration it was visited by Charles II. and Catherine of Braganza. It was a
                    favourite residence of Anne previous to her accession, and from that time became
                    one of the special resorts of London fashion. It reached the height of its
                    comparative popularity in the latter half of the 18th century, and is specially
                    associated with Colley Cibber, Samuel Johnson, Cumberland the dramatist,
                    Garrick, Richardson, Reynolds, Beau Nash, Miss Chudleigh, and Mrs Thrale. The
                    Tunbridge of that period is sketched with much graphic humour in Thackeray’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Virginians.</hi> Though it still attracts an increasing number of
                    visiters, its importance in reference to London society has considerably
                    declined.</p>
