                    This port, now called the <hi rend="italic">Mare Piccolo,</hi> is a bay 16 miles
                    in circuit, landlocked by a low rocky peninsula. The entrance is so narrow that
                    it is crossed by a bridge of seven arches; it was already bridged in Strabo’s
                    time. The modern town, in the province of Lecce, which is the see of an
                    archbishop and had in 1881 a population of 26,611, stands on the peninsula,
                    which is now rather an island, the isthmus connecting it with the mainland
                    having been cut through for defence by Ferdinand I. The ancient citadel occupied
                    the same site, but the city in its best days was much larger, traces of the
                    walls being visible about 2 miles from the gates of the modern town. The remains
                    of antiquity are inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>Tarentum was a Spartan colony founded about the close of the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (Jerome gives the date 708) to relieve the parent
                    state of a part of its population which did not possess, but claimed to enjoy,
                    full civic rights. Legend represents these <hi rend="italic">Partheniae</hi> (so
                    they are called) as Spartans with a stain on their birth, but the accounts are
                    neither clear nor consistent, and the facts that underlie them have not been
                    cleared up. The Greeks were not the first settlers on the peninsula: recent
                    excavations have brought to light signs of a pre-Hellenic trading-place, and the
                    name of Taras may be older than the colony. To the Greeks Taras was a mythical
                    hero, son of Neptune, and he is sometimes confounded with the oecist of the
                    colony, Phalanthus. Situated in a fertile district, especially famous for olives
                    and sheep, with an admirable harbour, great fisheries, and prosperous
                    manufactures of wool, purple, and pottery, Tarentum grew in power and wealth and
                    extended its domain inland. Even a great defeat by the natives in 473 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when more Greeks fell than in any battle known to
                    Herodotus, did not break its prosperity, though it led to a change of government
                    from aristocracy to democracy. A feud with the Thurians for the district of the
                    Siris was settled in 432 by the joint foundation of Heraclea, which, however,
                    was regarded as a Tarentine colony. In the 4th century Tarentum was the first
                    city of Great Greece, and its wealth and artistic culture at this time are amply
                    attested by its rich and splendid coins; the gold pieces in particular (mainly
                    later than 360) are perhaps the most beautiful ever struck by Greeks (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Numismatics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 637). In the second half of the
                    century Tarentum was in constant war with the Lucanians, and did not hold its
                    ground without the aid of Spartan and Epirote <hi rend="italic"
                    >condottieri.</hi> Then followed war with Rome (281), the expedition of Pyrrhus,
                    and at length, in 272, the surrender of the city by its Epirote garrison (see
                    the details in vol. xx. p. 743 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Tarentum retained
                    nominal liberty as an ally of Rome. In the Second Punic War it suffered
                    severely, when it was taken by Hannibal (212), all but the citadel, and retaken
                    and plundered by Fabius (209). After this it fell into great decay, but revived
                    again after receiving a colony in 123 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It remained
                    a considerable seaport, and its purple, second only to that of Tyre, was still
                    valued, but in Strabo’s time it had shrunk nearly to the limits of the present
                    town. After the fall of the Western empire it was held from time to time by <pb
