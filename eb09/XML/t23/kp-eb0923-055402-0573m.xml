                    (1771-1833), inventor of the locomotive, was descended from a family of great
                    antiquity in the county of Cornwall, and was born 13th April 1771, in the parish
                    of Illogan. Shortly afterwards the family removed to Penponds, near Camborne,
                    where the boy attended his first and only school, his attainments being limited
                    to reading, writing, and arithmetic. Though slow and obstinate as a scholar, he
                    spent much time drawing lines and figures on his slate, and possessed such
                    instinctive skill in mechanics that while still a youth he was able to solve a
                    difficulty in the correction of underground levels which had puzzled some of the
                    mine agents. He inherited more than the average strength for which his family
                    were famous, standing 6 feet 2 inches in height, while his frame was the very
                    model of an athlete. His feats in wrestling and lifting and throwing weights
                    were unexampled in the district. At the age of eighteen he began to assist his
                    father as mine manager, and, manifesting great fertility of mechanical
                    invention, was soon recognized as the great rival of Watt in improvements on the
                    steam-engine (see vol. xxii. p. 476). On the death of his father in 1797, he
                    succeeded him as leading engineer in Cornish mining. He married the same year.
                    His earliest invention of importance was his improved plunger pole pump (1797),
                    which has superseded all others for deep mining. In 1798 he applied the
                    principle of the plunger pole pump to the construction of the waterpressure
                    engine, which he subsequently improved in various ways. About this time he also
                    perfected a high-pressure non-conducting steam-engine, which became a successful
                    rival of the low-pressure steam-vacuum engine of Watt. At an early period he had
                    begun experiments in the construction of locomotives, and a model constructed by
                    him before 1800 is now in the South Kensington Museum. On Christmas eve 1801 his
                    common road locomotive carried the first load of passengers ever conveyed by
                    steam, and on 24th March 1802 he and Andrew Vivian applied for a patent for
                    steam-engines in propelling carriages. In 1803 his locomotive was run in the
                    streets of London, from Leather Lane by Gray’s Inn Lane and along Oxford Street
                    to Paddington, the return journey being made by Islington. The cost was,
                    however, found too great, and his thoughts were now directed to the construction
                    of a steam locomotive for tramways, with such success that in February 1804 he
                    worked a tramroad locomotive in Wales, running with facility up and down
                    inclines of 1 in 50. In 1808 he constructed a circular railway in London near
                    Euston Square, on which the public were carried at the rate of twelve or fifteen
                    miles an hour round curves of 50 or 100 feet radius. The ideas of Trevithick
                    were successfully developed by Stephenson so as to revolutionize the system of
                    modern travelling, but Trevithick had made considerable progress towards this
                    before Stephenson had begun his experiments. Trevithick applied his
                    high-pressure engine with great success to rock boring and breaking, as well as
                    to dredging. In 1806 he entered into a twenty-one years’ engagement with the
                    board of Trinity House, London, to lift ballast from the bottom of the Thames,
                    at the rate of 500,000 tons a year, for a payment of 6d. a ton. The following
                    year he was appointed along with Vazie to execute the Thames driftway, but the
                    work was abandoned owing to disputes about payment when unexpected difficulties
                    had occurred. He then set up workshops at 72 Fore Street, Limehouse, for the
                    construction of iron tanks and buoys and model iron ships. He was the first to
                    recognize the importance of iron in the construction of large ships, and in
                    various ways his ideas have also influenced the construction of steamboats. In
                    the application of steam to agriculture the name of Trevithick occupies one of
                    the chief places. A high-pressure steam threshing engine was erected by him in
                    1812 at Trewithen, the property of Sir Charles Hawkins, while, in the same year,
                    in a letter to the Board of Agriculture, he stated his belief that every part of
                    agriculture might be performed by steam, and that such a use of the steam-engine
                    would “double the population of the kingdom and make our markets the cheapest in
                    the world.” In 1814 he entered on an agreement for the construction of engines
                    for the Peruvian mines, and to superintend their working removed to Peru in
                    1816. Thence he went in 1822 to Costa Rica. He returned to England in 1827, and
                    in 1828 petitioned parliament for a reward for his inventions, but without
                    success. He was equally unsuccessful in his endeavours to induce the lords
                    commissioners of the Admiralty to afford him facilities for demonstrating the
                    value of certain improvements he claimed to have made in steam navigation. He
                    died 22d April 1833.</p>
