                    taken in its most restricted sense, as signifying the Roman province which was
                    so called (Thracia, see Plate of the Roman empire in volJ xx.) after the
                    district that intervened between the river Ister (Danube) and the Haemus
                    Mountains (Balkan) had been formed into the separate province of Maesia, and the
                    region between the rivers Strymon and Nestus, which included Philippi, had been
                    added to Macedonia. The boundaries of this were—towards the N. the Haemus, on
                    the E. the Euxine Sea, on the S. the Propontis, the Hellespont, and the Aegean,
                    and towards the W. the Nestus. The most distinguishing features of the country
                    were the chain of Rhodope (Despoto-dagh) and the river Hebrus (Maritza). The
                    former separates at its northernmost point from the Haemus, at right angles, and
                    runs southward at first, nearly parallel to the Nestus, until it approaches the
                    sea, when it takes an easterly direction: this bend is referred to by Virgil in
                    the line (6⅛ory., iii. 351)—</p>

                <p>The summits of this chain are higher than those of Haemus, and not a few of them
                    range from 5000 to 8000 feet; the highest point, so far as is at present known
                    (for these mountains have been imperfectly explored), rises towards the
                    north-west, near the point where now stands the famous Bulgarian monastery of
                    Rilo. The Hebrus, together with its tributaries which flow into it from the
                    north, east, and west, drains nearly the whole of Thrace. It starts from near
                    the point of junction of Haemus and Rhodope, and at first takes an easterly
                    direction, the chief town which lies on its banks in the earlier part of its
                    course being Philippopolis; but, when it reaches the still more important city
                    of Hadrianopolis, it makes a sharp bend towards the south, and enters the sea
                    nearly opposite the island of Samothrace. The greater part of the country is
                    hilly and irregular, though there are considerable plains; but besides Rhodope
                    two other tolerably definite chains intersect it, one of which descends from
                    Haemus to Adrianople, while the other follows the coast of the Euxine at no
                    great distance inland. One district in the extreme north-west of Thrace lay
                    beyond the watershed that separates the streams that flow into the Aegean from
                    those that reach the Danube: this was the territory of Sardica, the modern
                    Sophia. In the later Roman period two main lines of road passed through the
                    country. One of these skirted the southern coast, being a continuation of the
                    Via Egnatia, which ran from Dyrrhachium to Thessalonica, thus connecting the
                    Adriatic and the Aegean; it became of the first importance after the foundation
                    of Constantinople, because it was the direct line of communication between that
                    city and Rome. The other followed a northwesterly course through the interior,
                    from Constantinople by Hadrianopolis and Philippopolis to the Haemus, and thence
                    by Naissus (Nisch) through Maesia in the direction of Pannonia, taking the same
                    route by which the post-road now runs from Constantinople to Belgrade. The
                    climate of Thrace was regarded by the Greeks as very severe, and that country
                    was spoken of as the home of the north wind, Boreas. The coast in the direction
                    of the Euxine also was greatly feared by sailors, as the harbours were few and
                    the sea proverbially tempestuous; but the southern shore was more attractive to
                    navigators, and here we find the Greek colonies of Abdera and Mesambria on the
                    Aegean, Perinthus on the Propontis, and, the most famous of all, Byzantium, at
                    the meeting-point of that sea and the Bosphorus. Another place which proved
                    attractive to colonists of that race was the curious narrow strip of ground,
                    called the Thracian Chersonese, that intervened between the Hellespont and the
                    Bay of Melas, which penetrates far into the land on its northern side. Among the
                    cities that occupied it, Sestos and Callipolis (Gallipoli) are the most worthy
                    of mention. In order to prevent the incursions of the Thracians, a wall was
                    built across its isthmus, which was less than five miles in breadth. The
                    north-eastern portion of the Aegean, owing to its proximity to the coast of
                    Thrace, was known as the Thracian Sea, and in this were situated the islands of
                    Thasos, Samothrace, and Imbros.</p>
                <p>There is no sufficient evidence to determine the ethnological affinities of the
                    Thracian race. Their language has perished, and the information respecting them
                    which has come down to us hardly furnishes more than material for conjecture, so
                    that the most that we can affirm on the subject is that they belonged to the
                    Indo-European family. The most striking archaeological monuments of the
                    prehistoric period are the sepulchral mounds, which have been compared in
                    appearance to the tumulus on the plain of Marathon; these are found by thousands
                    in various parts of the country, especially in the neighbourhood of the ancient
                    towns. As Roman implements and ornaments have been found in some of them, it is
                    plain that this mode of burial continued to be practised until a late period.
                    The deity whose worship prevailed most extensively in the country was Dionysus.
                    The most powerful Thracian tribe was that of the Odrysae, whose king, Teres, in
                    the middle of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> extended his
                    dominion so as to include the greater part of Thrace. During the Peloponnesian
                    War his son Sitalces was an ally of some importance to the Athenians, because he
                    kept in check the Macedonian monarch, who opposed the interests of the Athenians
                    in the Chalcidic peninsula. On the death of that prince his kingdom was divided,
                    and the power of the Thracians was consequently diminished; but in the time of
                    Philip of Macedon we find Cersobleptes, who ruled the south-eastern portion of
                    the country, exercising an important influence on the policy of Athens. During
                    the early period of the Roman empire the Thracian kings were allowed to maintain
                    an independent sovereignty, while acknowledging the suzerainty of Rome, and it
                    was not until the reign of Vespasian that the country was reduced to the form of
                    a province. From its outlying position in the northern part of the Balkan
                    peninsula, it was much exposed to the inroads of barbarian invaders, so that it
                    was overrun by the Goths on several occasions, and subsequently by the Huns; but
                    its proximity to Constantinople caused its fortunes to be closely connected with
                    those of that city, from the time when it became the capital of the Eastern
                    empire. In the course of time its inhabitants seem to have been thoroughly
                    Romanized, and to have adopted the Latin language, and there is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n336/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0336-0319"/> much probability in the view that they were the
                    progenitors of the Vlachs, or Roumanians south of the Danube, whose language is
                    of Latin origin, and who at various periods formed an important factor in the
                    countries to the northward of Greece. The first evidence of the development of
                    this nationality is found in a curious story told by Theophanes at the end of
                    the 6th century. At that time a khan of the Avars had overrun the Eastern empire
                    and appeared before the walls of Constantinople; but two generals of the
                    imperial forces, who had concealed themselves in the Balkan, succeeded in
                    mustering a considerable body of troops, and were on their way to surprise the
                    rear of the Avars when their project was brought to an end by the following
                    occurrence. One of the beasts of burden happened to fall down in the line of
                    march, on which some one close by called out to its driver, in the language of
                    the country, “Torna, torna, fratre,” that is, “Turn him round, brother.” The
                    driver did not hear this, but the other soldiers did; and, thinking the enemy
                    were upon them, and that this was the sign for retreat, they took up the cry
                    “Torna, torna,” and the whole force fled precipitately. It seems probable that
                    the men who used these words were Roumanian inhabitants of the Balkan. In the
                    course of the Middle Ages the northern parts of Thrace and some other districts
                    of that country were occupied by a Bulgarian population; and in 1361 the
                    Ottomans, who had previously established themselves in Europe, made themselves
                    masters of Adrianople, which for a time became the Turkish capital. When
                    Constantinople fell in 1453, the whole country passed into the hands of the
                    Turks, and in their possession it remained until 1878, when, in accordance with
                    the provisions of the treaty of Berlin, the northern portion of it was placed
                    under a separate administration, with the title of Eastern Roumelia; this
                    province has now become, to all intents and purposes, a part of the principality
                    of Bulgaria. The population of Thrace at the present day is composed of Turks,
                    Greeks, and Bulgarians. (H. F. T.)</p>
