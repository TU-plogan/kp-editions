                    and most interesting of the men of old Greece, is closely bound up with the
                    history of <hi rend="smallcaps">Sicily (⅛.v.),</hi> and more particularly of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Syracuse</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> in the latter half
                    of the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is as the champion of
                    Greece against Carthage, and of constitutional government against violence and
                    oppression, that he stands out as such a grand figure. His early career in his
                    native Corinth was shaped by a tragic incident. Timoleon had saved the life of
                    his brother, Timophanes, on the field of battle; but, when that same brother, at
                    the head of a band of mercenary soldiers, took possession of the acropolis and
                    made himself practically a military despot and master of the city, Timoleon,
                    after an ineffectual protest, let him be struck dow n by his brother-in-law and
                    one or two other friends who had joined in his remonstrance. By the public
                    opinion of Corinth generally his conduct was approved as patriotic; but the
                    curses of his mother and the cold looks of some of his kinsfolk and
                    acquaintances drove him from the city into the solitude of the fields, and
                    there, it would seem, for some years he pined away, hating life and even bent on
                    ending it by voluntary starvation. He must have reached middle life when, in 344
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> envoys came from Syracuse to Corinth to appeal
                    to the mother-city for relief from the intestine feuds and foreign mercenaries
                    under which the Syracusans, and all the Greeks of Sicily, suffered. Carthage
                    too, their old and bitter foe, after some years of quiet, was again bestirring
                    herself and intriguing with the local des pots. Corinth could not refuse her
                    help, though her chief citizens declined the responsibility of attempting to
                    establish a settled government in the factious and turbulent Syracuse. By a sort
                    of Divine inspiration, says Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Tim.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> 3), Timoleon, being named by an unknown voice in
                    the popular assembly, was chosen by a unanimous vote to undertake the mission.
                    He sailed for Sicily with a few of the leading citizens of Corinth and a small
                    troop of Greek mercenaries. On arriving at Rhegium he found that his movements
                    were watched by a Carthaginian squadron, acting under the advice of a Syracusan,
                    Hicetas, who had <pb break="no"

                    supplanting with Carthaginian aid the younger Dionysius, still nominally tyrant
                    of Syracuse, but actually in possession only of the island citadel. Hicetas,
                    whilst seeming to favour Corinthian intervention, was really working with
                    Carthage on behalf of the tyrants. Timoleon, however, slipped away from the
                    Carthaginian watch and landed at Tauromenium (Taormina), where he had a very
                    friendly reception. At Adranum, an inland town, to which he came by invitation
                    from a party among the citizens, he surprised Hicetas, and drove him back, with
                    his troops utterly defeated, to Syracuse. The Sicilian Greeks now rallied round
                    him, and the following year (343) saw the surrender of Dionysius and Timoleon
                    master of the entire city. Hailed by the citizens as a heaven-sent deliverer, he
                    at once began the work of restoration, bringing in a multitude of new settlers
                    from the mother-city and from Greece generally, and establishing a popular
                    government on the basis of the laws of Diodes, which had been forgotten under
                    the Dionysian <hi rend="italic">regime.</hi> The impress of Timoleon’s reforms
                    seems to have lasted to the days of Augustus. The tyrants, too, in the other
                    Sicilian cities were put down, and his old enemy Hicetas went back to Leontini,
                    where he lived as a private though powerful citizen. He made one more attempt to
                    overthrow Timoleon, and induced Carthage to send (340-339) a great army, which
                    landed at Lilybaeum (Marsala). The Syracusans could hardly be brought to face
                    the invader; but with a miscellaneous levy of about 12,000 men, most of them
                    mercenaries, Timoleon marched westwards across the island into the neighbourhood
                    of Selinus and won a great and decisive victory on the Crimisus. The
                    Carthaginian host is said to have outnumbered Timoleon’s army in the proportion
                    of seven to one. The general himself led on his infantry in person (Plut., <hi
                    rend="italic">Tim.,</hi> 27), and their enemy’s discomfiture was completed by a
                    blinding storm of rain and hail driven straight in their faces (Diod., xvi. 79).
                    This victory gave the Greeks of Sicily many years of peace and safety from
                    Carthage. Carthage made, however, one more effort and despatched some
                    mercenaries to prolong the conflict between Timoleon and the tyrants. But it
                    soon ended (338 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> in the defeat of Hicetas, who
                    was taken prisoner and put to death, and in a treaty which confined the dominion
                    of Carthage in Sicily to the west of the Halycus (Platani). Timoleon, having put
                    down the despots and given freedom to the Greek cities of Sicily, retired into
                    private life, though he remained practically supreme not only at Syracuse but
                    throughout Sicily. This island, notwithstanding the many elements of discord
                    which political revolution, with the return of exiles and the influx of new
                    settlers, must have brought in, seems to have been during Timoleon’s lifetime
                    tranquil and contented. There are some characteristic stories told of his last
                    days. Although blind, he used to come in his car into the assembly in the
                    theatre and give his opinion, which was commonly accepted by a unanimous vote.
                    An officious person once insisted on his giving the ordinary bail in a lawsuit;
                    but he replied that he had himself always been the consistent champion of law
                    and of legal rights for them all. Again, when his military strategy was
                    unfavourably criticized, he expressed his gratitude to heaven that he had won
                    for the Syracusans the privilege of liberty of speech. He died in 337, and was
                    buried at the cost of the citizens of Syracuse, who erected a grand monument to
                    his memory in their market-place.</p>
