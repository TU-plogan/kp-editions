                    the important class of continued fevers, having certain characters in common,
                    although each is clearly distinguishable from the others. The following is a
                    general account of the more salient features of each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Typhus Fever.</hi></p>
                <p>Typhus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From τὐ <hi
                    rend="italic">φος,</hi> smoke or mist, in allusion to the stupor of the
                    disease.</p></note> is a continued fever of highly contagious nature, lasting
                    for about fourteen days and characterized mainly by great prostration of
                    strength, severe nervous symptoms, and a peculiar eruption on the skin. It has
                    received numerous other names, such as spotted, pestilential, putrid, jail,
                    hospital fever, &amp;c. It appears to have been known for many centuries as a
                    destructive malady, frequently appearing in epidemic form, in all countries in
                    Europe, under the conditions to be afterwards referred to. The best accounts of
                    the disease are those given by English writers, who narrate its ravages in towns
                    and describe many “black assizes,” in which it was communicated by prisoners
                    brought into court to the judges, jurymen, court-officials, &amp;c., with fatal
                    effect, producing oftentimes a widespread consternation. Typhus fever would seem
                    to have been observed in almost all parts of the world; but, although not
                    unknown in warm countries, it has most frequently prevailed in temperate or cold
                    climates.</p>
                <p>The causes concerned in its production include both the predisposing and the
                    exciting. Of the former the most powerful of all are those influences which
                    lower the health of a community, especially overcrowding and poverty. Hence this
                    fever is most frequently found to affect the poor of large cities and towns, or
                    to appear where large numbers of persons are living crowded together in
                    unfavourable hygienic conditions, as has often been seen in prisons, workhouses,
                    &amp;c. Armies in the field are also liable to suffer from this disease; for
                    instance, during the Crimean War it caused an enormous mortality among the
                    French troops. Some high authorities, including Dr Murchison, have held that
                    such conditions as those referred to are capable of generating typhus fever by
                    themselves, and the apparent occasional <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> origin of
                    this disease has doubtless the support of many striking facts which would appear
                    to favour this view (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology,</hi> vol. xviii. p.
                    803). In the light, however, of recent researches into the relation of specific
                    disease germs to the production of fevers and other infectious maladies, there
                    is increasing difficulty in maintaining this position; and the direction of
                    opinion is decidedly towards the view that, however much insanitary conditions
                    and overcrowding act as causes predisposing to the reception of the disease, the
                    introduction into the system of a living organism or germ is necessary to the
                    manifestation of the phenomena of the fever. Nevertheless no specific organism
                    has yet been clearly identified in the case of typhus fever. This disease is now
                    much less frequently encountered in medical practice than formerly, —a fact
                    which must mainly be ascribed to the great attention which in recent times has
                    been directed to improvement in the sanitation of towns, especially to the
                    opening up of crowded localities so as to allow the free circulation through
                    them of fresh air. In most large cities, however, limited epidemic outbursts of
                    the disease occur from time to time, under the conditions of overcrowding and
                    poverty, although the increased facilities possessed by local authorities for
                    recognizing such outbreaks, and for the prompt isolation or removal of infected
                    persons to hospitals, operate in general effectually to prevent any extensive
                    spread of the fever. All ages are liable to typhus, but the young suffer less
                    severely than the old. The disease appears to be communicated by the exhalations
                    given off from the bodies of those suffering from the fever, and those most
                    closely in contact with the sick are most apt to suffer. This is shown by the
                    frequency with which nurses and physicians take typhus from cases under their
                    care. As in all infectious maladies, there is often observed in typhus a marked
                    proclivity to suffer in the case of individuals, and in such instances very
                    slight exposure to the contagion may convey the disease. Typhus is highly
                    contagious throughout its whole course and even in the early period of
                    convalescence. The contagion, however, is rendered less active by the access of
                    fresh air; hence this fever rarely spreads in well-aired rooms or houses where
                    cases of the disease are under treatment. As a rule one attack of typhus confers
                    immunity from risk of others, but numerous exceptions have been recorded.</p>
                <p>The course of typhus fever is characterized by certain well-marked stages. (1)
                    The stage of <hi rend="italic">incubation,</hi> or the period elapsing between
                    the reception of the fever poison into the system and the manifestation of the
                    special evidence of the disease, is believed to vary from a week to ten days.
                    During this time, beyond feelings of languor, no particular symptoms are
                    exhibited. (2) The <hi rend="italic">invasion</hi> of the fever is in general
                    well marked and severe, in the form of a distinct rigor, or of feelings of
                    chilliness lasting for hours, and a sense of illness and prostration, together
                    with headache of a distressing character and sleeplessness. Feverish symptoms
                    soon appear and the temperature of the body rises to a considerable height
                    (103°-105° Fahr.), at which it continues with but little daily variation until
                    about the period of the crisis. It is, however, of importance to observe certain
                    points connected with the temperature during the progress of this fever. Thus
                    about the seventh day the acme of the fever heat has been reached, and a slight
                    subsidence (1° or less) of the temperature takes place in favourable cases, and
                    no further subsequent rise beyond this lowered level occurs. When it is
                    otherwise, the case often proves a severe one. Again, when the fever has
                    advanced towards the end of the second week, slight falls of temperature are
                    often observed, prior to the extensive descent which marks the attainment of the
                    crisis. The pulse in typhus fever is rapid (100-120 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0702-0677"/> or more) and at first full, but later on feeble.
                    Its condition as indicating the strength of the heart’s action is watched with
                    anxiety. The tongue, at first coated with a white fur, soon becomes brown and
                    dry, while sordes (dried mucus, &amp;c.) accumulate upon the teeth; the appetite
                    is gone and intense thirst prevails. The bowels are as a rule constipated, and
                    the urine is diminished in amount and high-coloured. The physician on
                    examination may make out distinct enlargement of the spleen. (3) The third stage
                    is characterized by the appearance of the <hi rend="italic">eruption</hi> which
                    generally shows itself about the fourth or fifth day or later, and consists of
                    dark red (mulberry coloured) spots or blotches varying in size from mere points
                    to three or four lines in diameter, very slightly elevated above the skin, at
                    first disappearing on pressure, but tending to become both darker in hue and
                    more permanent. They appear chiefly on the abdomen, sides, back, and limbs, and
                    occasionally on the face. Besides this, the characteristic typhus rash, there is
                    usually observed a general faint mottling all over the surface. The typhus rash
                    is rarely absent and is a very important diagnostic of the disease. In the more
                    severe and fatal forms of the fever, the rash has all through a very dark
                    colour, and slight subcutaneous haemorrhages <hi rend="italic">(petechiae)</hi>
                    are to be seen in abundance. After the appearance of the eruption the patient’s
                    condition seems to be easier, so far as regards the headache and discomfort
                    which marked the outset of the symptoms; but this is also to be ascribed to the
                    tendency to pass into the typhous stupor which supervenes about this time, and
                    becomes more marked throughout the course of the second week. The patient now
                    lies on his back, with a dull dusky countenance, an apathetic or stupid
                    expression, and contracted pupils. All the febrile symptoms already mentioned
                    are fully developed, and delirium, usually of a low muttering kind, but
                    sometimes wild and maniacal <hi rend="italic">(delirium ferοx)</hi> is present
                    both by night and day. The peculiar condition to which the term “coma vigil” is
                    applied, in which the patient, though quite unconscious, lies with eyes widely
                    open, is regarded, especially if persisting for any length of time, as an
                    unfavourable omen. Throughout the second week of the attack the symptoms
                    continue unabated; but there is in addition great prostration of strength, the
                    pulse becoming very feeble, the breathing shallow and rapid, and often
                    accompanied with bronchial sounds. (4) A <hi rend="italic">crisis</hi> or
                    favourable change takes place about the end of the second or beginning of the
                    third week (on an average the 14th day), and is marked by a more or less abrupt
                    fall of the temperature <hi rend="italic">(vide</hi> chart) and of the pulse,
                    together with slight perspiration, a discharge of loaded urine, the return of
                    moisture to the tongue, and by a change in the patient’s look, which clears up
                    and shows signs of returning intelligence. Although the sense of weakness is
                    extreme, convalescence is in general steady and comparatively rapid.</p>
                <p>Typhus fever may, however, prove fatal during any stage of its progress and in
                    the early convalescence, either from sudden failure of the heart’s action—a
                    condition which is specially apt to arise— from the supervention of some nervous
                    symptoms, such as meningitis or of deepening coma, or from some other
                    complication, such as bronchitis. Further, a fatal result sometimes takes place
                    before the crisis from sheer exhaustion, particularly in the case of those whose
                    physical or nervous energies have been lowered by hard work, inadequate
                    nourishment and sleep, or intemperance, in all which conditions typhus fever is
                    apt to assume an unusually serious form.</p>
                <p>Occasionally troublesome sequelae remain behind for a greater or less length of
                    time as the effects of the fever. Among these may be mentioned mental weakness
                    or irritability, occasionally some form of paralysis, an inflamed condition of
                    the lymphatic vessels of one leg (the swelled leg of fever), prolonged weakness
                    and ill health, &amp;c. Gradual improvement, however, may be confidently
                    anticipated and even ultimate recovery.</p>
                <p>The mortality from typhus fever is estimated by Murchison and others as averaging
                    about 18 per cent. of the cases, but it varies much according to the severity of
                    type (particularly in epidemics), the previous health and habits of the
                    individual, and very specially the age,— the proportion of deaths being in
                    striking relation to the advance of life. Thus, while in children under fifteen
                    the death-rate is only 5 per cent., in persons over fifty it is about 46 per
                    cent.</p>
                <p>The treatment of typhus fever includes the prophylactic measures of attention to
                    the sanitation of the more densely populated portions of towns. The opening up
                    of cross streets intersecting those which are close-built and narrow, whereby
                    fresh air is freely admitted, has done much to banish typhus fever from
                    districts where previously it was endemic. Further, the enforcement of the law
                    regulating the number of persons accommodated in common lodging-houses, and the
                    application of the powers now vested in local authorities for dealing with eases
                    of overcrowding everywhere, and for isolation and treatment of the infected,
                    have had a like salutary effect. Where typhus has broken out in a crowded
                    district the prompt removal of the patients to a fever hospital and the thorough
                    disinfection and cleansing of the infected houses are to be recommended. Where,
                    on the other hand, a single case of accidentally caught typhus occurs in a
                    member of a family inhabiting a well-aired house, the chance of it being
                    communicated to others in the dwelling is but small; nevertheless every
                    precaution in the way of isolation and disinfection should be taken.</p>
                <p>The treatment of a typhus patient is conducted upon the same general principles
                    as have been illustrated in other fevers (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Scarlet
                    Fever, Smallpox).</hi> Complete isolation should be maintained throughout the
                    illness, and the services of a day and a night nurse procured, who should keep a
                    strict watch and preserve a record of the temperature and other observations,
                    the times of feeding and the form of nourishment administered, as well as every
                    other fact noticed, for the physician’s information. Due attention should be
                    given to the ventilation and cleansing of the sick chamber. The main element in
                    the treatment of this fever is good nursing, and especially the regular
                    administration of nutriment, of which the best form is milk, although light
                    plain soup may also be given. The food should be administered at stated
                    intervals, not, as a rule, offener than once in one and a half or two hours, and
                    it will frequently be necessary to rouse the patient from his stupor for this
                    purpose. Sometimes it is impossible to administer food by the mouth, in which
                    case recourse must be had to nutrient enemata. Alcoholic stimulants are not
                    often required, except in the case of elderly and weakly persons who have become
                    greatly exhausted by the attack and are threatening to collapse. The best
                    indication for their use is that furnished by the condition of the circulation:
                    when the pulse shows unsteadiness and undue rapidity, and the first sound of the
                    heart is but indistinctly heard by the stethoscope, the prompt administration of
                    stimulants (of which the best form is pure spirit) will often succeed in
                    averting danger. Should their use appear to increase the restlessness or
                    delirium they should be discontinued and the diffusible (ammoniacal or ethereal)
                    forms tried instead.</p>
                <p>Many other symptoms demand special treatment. The headache, which persists for
                    days at the commencement and is with many a very distressing symptom, may be
                    mitigated by removing the hair and applying cold to the head. The sleeplessness,
                    with or without delirium, may be combated by quietness, by a moderately darkened
                    room (although a distinction between day and night should be made as regards the
                    amount of admitted light), and by soothing and gentle dealing on the part of the
                    nurse. Opiate and sedative medicines in any form, although recommended by many
                    high authorities, must be given with great caution, as their use is often
                    attended with danger in this fever, where coma is apt to supervene. When
                    resorted to, probably the safest form is a combination of the bromide of
                    potassium or ammonium with a guarded amount of chloral. The writer has seen
                    alarming effects follow the administration of opium. Occasionally the deep
                    stupor calls for remedies to rouse the patient, and these may be employed in the
                    form of mustard or cantharides to the surface (calves of legs, nape of neck,
                    over region of heart, &amp;c. ), of the cold affusion, or of enemata containing
                    turpentine. The height of the temperature may be a serious symptom, and
                    antipyretic remedies appear to have but a slight influence over it as compared
                    to that which they possess in typhoid fever, acute rheumatism, &amp;c. The cold
                    bath treatment, which has been recommended, cannot be carried out without
                    serious risk to life in the necessary movement of the patient. It is a
                    well-recognized rule that persons suffering from typhus fever ought not to be
                    moved up in bed for any purpose after the first few days. Cold sponging of the
                    hands and feet and exposed parts, or cold to the head, may often considerably
                    lower the temperature. Throughout the whole progress of a case the condition of
                    the bladder requires special attention, owing to the patient’s drowsiness, and
                    the regular use of the catheter becomes, as a rule, necessary with the advance
                    of the symptoms.</p>
                <p>The complications and results of this fever fall to be dealt with according to
                    the methods of treatment applicable to their character and extent.</p>

                    uncertain duration, and by a liability to relapses.</p>
                <p>This fever has received various names, such as gastric fever, abdominal typhus,
                    infantile remittent fever, slow fever, nervous fever, &amp;c. Dr Murchison, in
                    reference to its supposed origin in putridity, uses the term “pythogenic fever,”
                    but this designation has not been generally adopted. Up till a comparatively
                    recent period typhoid was not distinguished from typhus fever. For, although it
                    had been noticed that the course of the disease and its morbid anatomy were
                    different from those of ordinary cases of typhus, it was believed that they
                    merely represented a variety of that malady. The distinction between the two
                    diseases appears to have been first accurately made in 1836 by Messrs Gerhard
                    and Pennock of Philadelphia, and still more fully demonstrated by Dr A. P.
                    Stewart of Glasgow (afterwards of London). Subsequently all doubt upon the
                    subject was removed by the careful clinical and pathological observations made
                    by Sir William Jenner at the London fever hospital (1849-51). A clear
                    distinction has been established between the two fevers, not only as regards
                    their phenomena or morbid features, but equally as regards their origin. While
                    typhus fever is a disease of overcrowding and poverty, typhoid may occur where
                    such conditions are entirely excluded; and the connexion of this malady with
                    specific emanations given off from decomposing organic or faeculent matters, or
                    with contamination of food or water by the products of the disease, is now
                    almost universally admitted. Alike in sporadic cases and in extensive epidemic
                    outbreaks the existence of insanitary conditions in house drainage, water
                    supply, &amp;c., can in the majority of instances be made out. The question
                    whether such conditions alone will suffice to beget this fever—or, in other
                    words, its <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> origin—has, as in the case of typhus,
                    been much discussed, and an affirmative opinion expressed by some high
                    authorities. But the same remark must again be made as to the difficulties in
                    the way of maintaining such a position in view of the evidence of the part
                    played by microbes in infective processes.</p>
                <p>That all insanitary conditions in respect of drainage of houses and localities
                    furnish the most ready means for the introduction of the contagion of typhoid
                    there is a general agreement, as there is equally that the most certain means of
                    preventing its appearance or spread are those which provide a thoroughly
                    trustworthy and secure drainage, a safe method of disposal of sewage, and a pure
                    and abundant water supply. Typhoid fever is much less directly communicable from
                    the sick to the healthy than typhus. The infective agent appears to reside in
                    the discharges from the bowels, in which, particularly when exposed and
                    undergoing decomposition, the contagium seems to multiply and to acquire
                    increased potency. Thus in sewers, drains, &amp;c., in association with
                    putrefying matter, it may increase indefinitely, and by the emanations given off
                    from such decomposing material accidentally escaping into houses, or by the
                    contamination of drinking water in places where wells or cisterns are exposed to
                    faecal or sewage pollution, the contagion is conveyed. Of the precise nature of
                    the contagious principle we have as yet no full information,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A bacillus frequently noticed
                    in certain tissues in cases of typhoid fever has not yet been satisfactorily
                    proved to be an organism characteristic of that disease, nor even to be
                    constantly present.</p></note> but there appears to be strong reason for
                    believing that a specific microbe or organism plays a part in the propagation of
                    the disease. Still it is obvious that for its successful implantation in and
                    effect upon the system a peculiar condition of preparedness or receptivity to
                    the morbific agent must be presupposed to exist in the individual, regarding
                    which also our knowledge is of the vaguest. There is abundant evidence that one
                    of the vehicles for the conveyance of the contagion is food, especially milk,
                    which may readily become contaminated with the products of the disease where an
                    outbreak of the fever has occurred in a dairy.</p>
                <p>Typhoid fever is most common among the young, the majority of the cases occurring
                    between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five (Murchison). But children of any age
                    may suffer, as may also, though more rarely, persons at or beyond middle life.
                    It is of as frequent occurrence among the well-to-do as among the poor. The
                    greater number of cases appear to occur in autumn. In all countries this fever
                    seems liable to prevail; and, while some of its features may be modified by
                    climate and locality, its main characters and its results are essentially the
                    same everywhere.</p>
                <p>The more important phenomena of typhoid fever will be better understood by a
                    brief reference to the principal pathological changes which take place during
                    the disease. These relate for the most part to the intestines, in which the
                    morbid processes are highly characteristic, both as to their nature and their
                    locality. The changes (to be presently specified) are evidently the result of
                    the action of the contagium on the system, and they begin to show themselves
                    from the very commencement of the fever, passing through various stages during
                    its continuance. The portion of the bowels in which they occur most abundantly
                    is the lower part of the small intestine (ileum), where the “solitary glands”
                    and “Peyer’s patches” on the mucous surface of the canal become affected by
                    diseased action of a definite and progressive character, which stands in
                    distinct relation to the symptoms exhibited by the patient in the course of the
                    fever. (1) These glands, which in health are comparatively indistinct, become in
                    the commencement of the fever enlarged and prominent by infiltration due to
                    inflammatory action in their substance, and consequent cell proliferation. This
                    change usually affects a large extent of the ileum, but is more marked in the
                    lower portion near the ileo-caecal valve (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anatomy).</hi> It is generally held that this is the condition of the parts
                    during the first eight or ten days of the fever. (2) These enlarged glands next
                    undergo a process of sloughing, the inflammatory products being cast off either
                    in fragments or <hi rend="italic">en masse.</hi> This usually takes place in the
                    second week of the fever. (3) Ulcers are thus formed varying in size according
                    to the gland masses which have sloughed away. They may be few or many in number,
                    and they exhibit certain characteristic appearances. Thus they are frequently,
                    but not always, oblong in shape, with their long axis in that of the bowel, and
                    they have somewhat thin and ragged edges. They may extend through the thickness
                    of the intestine to the peritoneal coat and in their progress erode
                    blood-vessels or perforate the bowel. This stage of ulceration exists from the
                    second week onwards during the remaining period of the fever, and even into the
                    stage of convalescence. (4) In most instances these ulcers heal by
                    cicatrization, leaving, however, no contraction of the calibre of the bowel.
                    This stage of healing evidently occupies a considerable time, since the process
                    does not advance at an equal rate in the case of all the ulcers, some of which
                    have been later in forming than others. Even when convalescence has been
                    apparently completed, some unhealed ulcers may yet remain and prove,
                    particularly in connexion with errors in diet, a cause of relapse of some of the
                    symptoms, and even of still more serious or fatal consequences. The mesenteric
                    glands external to, but in functional relation with, the intestine, become
                    enlarged during the progress of the fever, but usually subside after
                    recovery.</p>
                <p>Besides these changes, which are well recognized, others more or less important
                    are often present. Among these may be mentioned one which the present writer has
                    repeatedly observed in the severe and protracted forms of this fever, namely,
                    marked atrophy, thinning, and softness of the coats of the intestines, even
                    after the ulcers have healed,—a condition which may not improbably be the cause
                    of that long-continued impairment of the function of the bowels so often
                    complained of by persons who have passed through an attack of typhoid fever.
                    Other changes common to most fevers are also to be observed, such as softening
                    of the muscular tissues generally, and particularly of the heart, and evidences
                    of complications affecting chest or other organs, which not unfrequently arise.
                    The swelled leg of fever sometimes follows typhoid, as does also periosteal
                    inflammation.</p>
                <p>The symptoms characterizing the onset of typhoid fever are very much less marked
                    than those of most other fevers, and the disease in the majority of instances
                    sets in somewhat insidiously. Indeed, it is no uncommon thing for patients with
                    this fever to go about for a considerable time after its action has begun. The
                    most marked of the early symptoms are headache, lassitude, and discomfort,
                    together with sleeplessness and feverishness, particularly at night; this last
                    symptom is that by which the disease is most readily detected in its early
                    stages. The peculiar courte of the temperature <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n704/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0704-0679"/> is also one of the most important diagnostic
                    evidences of this fever. During the first week it has a morning range of
                    moderate febrile rise, but in the evening there is a marked ascent, with a fall
                    again towards morning, each morning and evening, however, showing respectively a
                    higher point than that of the previous day, until about the eighth day, when in
                    an average case the highest point is attained. This varies according to the
                    severity of the attack; but it is no unusual thing to register 104° or 105°
                    Fahr. in the evening and 103° or 104° in the morning. During the second week the
                    daily range of temperature is comparatively small, a slight morning remission
                    being all that is observed. In the third week the same condition continues more
                    or less; but frequently a slight tendency to lowering may be discerned,
                    particularly in the morning temperature, and the febrile action gradually dies
                    down as a rule between the twenty-first and twenty-eighth days, although it is
                    liable to recur in the form of a relapse. Although the patient may, during the
                    earlier days of the fever, be able to move about, he feels languid and uneasy;
                    and usually before the first week is over he has to take to bed, and soon the
                    effects of the attack become more apparent. He is restless, hot, and
                    uncomfortable, particularly as the day advances, and his cheeks show a red
                    flush, especially in the evening or after taking food. The aspect, however, is
                    different from the oppressed stupid look which is present in typhus, and more
                    resembles the appearance of hectic. The pulse in an ordinary case, although more
                    rapid than normal, is not accelerated to an extent corresponding to the height
                    of the temperature, and is, at least in the earlier stages of the fever, rarely
                    above 100°. In severe and protracted cases, where there is evidence of extensive
                    intestinal ulceration, the pulse becomes rapid and weak, with a dicrotic
                    character indicative of cardiac feebleness. The tongue has at first a thin
                    whitish fur and is red at the tip and edges. It tends, however, to become dry,
                    brown or glazed looking, and fissured transversely, while sordes may be present
                    about the lips and teeth. There is much thirst and in some cases vomiting.
                    Splenic and hepatic enlargement may be made out. From an early period in the
                    disease abdominal symptoms show themselves with greater or less distinctness and
                    are frequently of highly diagnostic significance. The abdomen is somewhat
                    distended or tumid, and pain accompanying some gurgling sounds may be elicited
                    on light pressure about the lower part of the right side close to the groin,—the
                    region corresponding to that portion of the intestine in which the morbid
                    changes already referred to are progressing. Diarrhoea is a frequent but by no
                    means constant symptom. When present it may be slight in amount, or, on the
                    other hand, extremely profuse, and it corresponds as a rule to the severity of
                    the intestinal ulceration. The discharges are highly characteristic, being of
                    light yellow colour resembling pea soup in appearance. Should intestinal
                    haemorrhage occur, as is not unfrequently the case during some stage of the
                    fever, they may be dark brown, or composed entirely of blood. The urine is
                    scanty and high-coloured. About the beginning, or during the course of the
                    second week of the fever, an eruption frequently makes its appearance on the
                    skin. It consists of isolated spots, oval or round in shape, of a pale pink or
                    rose colour, and of about one to one and a half lines in diameter. They are seen
                    chiefly upon the abdomen, chest, and back, and they come out in crops, which
                    continue for four or five days and then fade away. At first they are slightly
                    elevated, and disappear on pressure. In some cases they are very few in number,
                    and their presence is made out with difficulty; but in others they are numerous
                    and sometimes show themselves upon the limbs as well as upon the body. They do
                    not appear to have any relation to the severity of the attack, and in a very
                    considerable proportion of cases (particularly in children) they are entirely
                    absent. Besides this eruption there are not unfrequently numerous very faint
                    bluish patches or blotches about half an inch in diameter, chiefly upon the body
                    and thighs. When present the rose-coloured spots continue to come out in crops
                    till nearly the end of the fever, and they may reappear should a relapse
                    subsequently occur. These various symptoms persist throughout the third week,
                    usually, however, increasing in intensity. The patient becomes prostrate and
                    emaciated; the tongue is dry and brown, the pulse quickened and feeble, and the
                    abdominal symptoms more marked; while nervous disturbance is exhibited in
                    delirium, in tremors and jerkings of the muscles <hi rend="italic">(subsultus
                    tendinum),</hi> in drowsiness, and occasionally in “coma vigil.” In severe cases
                    the exhaustion reaches an extreme degree, although even in such instances the
                    condition is not to be regarded as hopeless. In favourable cases a change for
                    the better may be anticipated between the twenty-first and twenty-eighth days,
                    more usually the latter. It does not, however, take place as in typhus by a well
                    - marked crisis, but rather by what is termed a “lysis” or gradual subsidence of
                    the febrile symptoms, especially noticeable in the daily decline of both morning
                    and evening temperature, the lessening of diarrhoea, and improvement in pulse,
                    tongue, &amp;c. Convalescence proceeds slowly and is apt to be interrupted by
                    relapses (due not unfrequently to errors in diet), which are sometimes as severe
                    and prolonged as the original attack, and are attended with equal or even
                    greater risks. Should such relapses repeat themselves, the case may be
                    protracted for two or three months, but this is comparatively rare.</p>
                <p>Death in typhoid fever usually takes place from one or other of the following
                    causes. (1) Exhaustion, in the second or third weeks, or later. The attending
                    symptoms are increasing emaciation, weakness of the pulse, and cadaveric aspect.
                    Sometimes sinking is sudden, partaking of some of the characters of a collapse.
                    (2) Haemorrhage from the intestines. The evidence of this is exhibited, not only
                    in the evacuations, but in the sudden fall of temperature and rise in
                    pulse-rate, together with great pallor, faintness, and rapid sinking. Sometimes
                    haemorrhage, to a dangerous and even fatal extent, takes place from the nose.
                    (3) Perforation of an intestinal ulcer. This gives rise, as a rule, to sudden
                    and intense abdominal pain, together with vomiting and signs of collapse, viz.,
                    a rapid flickering pulse, cold clammy skin, and the marked fall of temperature.
                    Symptoms of peritonitis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Peritonitis)</hi> quickly
                    supervene and add to the patient’s distress. Death usually takes place within 24
                    hours. Occasionally peritonitis, apart from perforation, is the cause of death.
                    (4) Occasionally, but rarely, hyperpyrexia (excessive fever). (5) Complications,
                    such as pulmonary or cerebral inflammation, bedsores, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Certain sequelae are sometimes observed, the most important being the swelled
                    leg, periostitis affecting long bones, general ill-health, and anaemia, with
                    digestive difficulties, often lasting for a long time, and sometimes issuing in
                    phthisis. Occasionally, after severe cases, mental weakness is noticed, but it
                    is usually of comparatively short duration.</p>
                <p>The mortality in typhoid fever varies with the character of the outbreak, the
                    general health and surroundings of the individuals attacked, and other
                    conditions. At one time it was regarded as, on an average, about the same as
                    that of typhus; but under modern methods of treatment the chances of recovery
                    are much greater, and the death-rate may be stated as about 12 per cent. or
                    perhaps somewhat less.</p>
                <p>The treatment embraces those prophylactic measures which aim at preventing the
                    escape of sewer gases into dwelling-houses by careful attention to the drainage
                    and plumber-work, and also secure an abundant supply of pure water for domestic
                    use (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hygiene, Sewerage,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ventilation).</hi> When an outbreak of the fever occurs in a family, all such
                    matters should be specially inquired into, and the sources of milk supply
                    carefully scrutinized. The discharges from the bowels of the typhoid patient
                    should be at once disinfected with carbolic acid or other similar agent, and the
                    greatest care taken as to their disposal, with the view of obviating any risk of
                    contamination of drinking-water, &amp;c. The general management is conducted
                    upon the same principles as are observed in the case of typhus, except that in
                    typhoid fever very special care is necessary in regard to diet. Milk, the great
                    value of which as a feverfood was first clearly set forth by Prof. Gairdner, is
                    of eminent service in typhoid, but it must be administered with due regard to
                    time and to the digestive powers of the patient. When given too frequently or in
                    too great quantity it may, by its imperfect digestion, prove a source of
                    irritation to the bowels. Even when given with every care it may fail to agree,
                    as is proved by the presence of undigested curd in the evacuations. In such a
                    case its admixture with lime water or with peptonizing agents may render its
                    digestion less difficult, but sometimes its use must for a time be suspended. It
                    is however, rare that milk cannot be borne when carefully administered. Barley
                    water or simple soups, such as chicken broth, beef-tea, &amp;c., are
                    occasionally useful either as substitutes for or adjuvants to milk. All through
                    the fever the patient should be fed at regular periods—not, as a rule, offener
                    than once in one and a half or two hours—although in the intervals water or
                    other feverdrink may be given from time to time. In convalescence the diet
                    should still be largely milk and soft matters, such as custards, light puddings,
                    meat jellies, boiled bread and milk, &amp;c., but other solid foods, with the
                    exception of fish, should be for a long time avoided. In changing the diet it is
                    of importance to note its effect upon the temperature, which may sometimes be
                    considerably disturbed from this cause, even after the apparent subsidence of
                    all febrile action. Stimulants, although unnecessary in a large proportion of
                    cases, are occasionally called for when there is great exhaustion, and in
                    prolonged attacks. Their effect, however, should be carefully<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0705-0680"/> watched. They are usually best administered in
                    the form of pure spirit.</p>
                <p>The more prominent symptoms which mark the course of typhoid fever frequently
                    call for special treatment. Thus, when the fever continues long, with little
                    break in its course, the employment of remedies to control its action
                    (antipyretics) may often be resorted to with benefit. Such drugs as quinine,
                    salicin, salicylic acid, and salicylate of soda, kairin, antipyrin, antifebrin,
                    &amp;c. (in ten to thirty grain doses of one or other), may frequently break in
                    upon the continuity of the fever, and by markedly lowering the temperature
                    relieve for a time the bo&lt;ly from a source of waste, and aid in
                    tranquillizing the excited nervous system. The times for their administration
                    are either one or two hours before the usual maximum temperature or during the
                    period of remission. These remedies may, however, fail, or by inducing sickness
                    or great prostration and depression of the circulation require to be
                    discontinued. For a similar purpose the cold bath is recommended by many high
                    authorities and is regularly employed in Germany. The method recommended by
                    Liebermeister is this: “When the temperature rises above 104° Fahr., the patient
                    should be placed in a bath of about 94°, which is gradually cooled down by the
                    addition of cold water to 68° Fahr., and remain immersed for twenty or thirty
                    minutes, the limbs being all the while gently rubbed. He should then be put back
                    into bed.” Another method is that of Dr Brand of Stettin: “When the patient’s
                    temperature attains 102° Fahr., he should be placed in a tepid bath of 70° and
                    allowed to remain till a sense of coldness or shivering is produced, which
                    usually occurs in from five to twenty minutes.” By such means no doubt the
                    temperature can often be reduced 2° or 3° Fahr., but it is very apt to rise
                    again and the bath must then be repeated. It is claimed by the advocates of this
                    method of treatment that it has been successful in diminishing greatly the
                    mortality of typhoid fever, but they hold at the same time that its success in
                    large measure depends upon its employment from an early stage in the disease.
                    British physicians are much divided upon the point, many high authorities
                    agreeing in its marked utility, while others no less eminent regard it as
                    fraught with danger from the frequent movement of the patient from bed, the
                    shock to the system, and the risk of haemorrhage, pneumonia, or other
                    complications, and as a plan of treatment difficult of being carried out in
                    ordinary practice. Although employed in some fever hospitals and with apparent
                    success, it has not yet commended itself for general adoption. Other methods of
                    applying cold, while probably less effectual than the bath, are much more
                    available, as, for example, the tepid or cold pack, the frequent sponging of
                    portions of the body with cold water, or the application of icebags to the head.
                    The present writer has resorted to these methods in many cases of typhoid fever,
                    with the effect of markedly lowering a high temperature. When diarrhoea is
                    excessive it may be restrained by such remedies as chalk, bismuth, Dover’s
                    powder, &amp;c. Haemorrhage is dealt with by preparations of ergot, or by
                    acetate of lead, gallic acid, or other styptics. In the event of perforation of
                    the bowel opium is the only means available to lessen the distress attending
                    that fatal occurrence.</p>
                <p>In the convalescent stage, and even after apparently complete recovery, the
                    utmost care should be observed by the patient as to diet, all hard and
                    indigestible substances being dangerous from their tendency to irritate or
                    reopen unhealed ulcers, and bring on a relapse of the fever or cause a sudden
                    perforation. Lastly, the general health demands careful attention for a length
                    of time, in view of the remoter risks of chest and other diseases already
                    alluded to.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Relapsing Fever.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a continued fever occasionally appearing as an epidemic in communities
                    suffering from scarcity or famine. It is characterized mainly by its sudden
                    invasion, with violent febrile symptoms, which continue for about a week and end
                    in a crisis, but are followed, after another week, by a return of the fever.</p>
                <p>This disease has received many other names, the best known of which are famine
                    fever, short fever, synocha, bilious relapsing fever, recurrent typhus, and
                    spirillum fever. As in the case of typhoid, relapsing fever was long believed to
                    be simply a form of typhus. The distinction between them appears to have been
                    first clearly established in 1826, in connexion with an epidemic in Ireland.
                    Outbreaks of relapsing fever have occurred in all parts of the world at times
                    and in places where famine has arisen; but the disease has been most closely
                    observed and studied in epidemics in Great Britain and Ireland, Germany, Poland,
                    Russia, America, and India. It has frequently been found to prevail along with
                    an epidemic of typhus fever.</p>
                <p>Relapsing fever is highly contagious, and appears, like typhus, to be readily
                    communicated by the exhalations from the body. With respect to the nature of the
                    contagion, certain important and interesting observations have been made. In
                    1873 Obermeier discovered in the blood of persons suffering from relapsing fever
                    minute organisms in the form of spiral filaments of the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spirochaete</hi> (see vol. xxi. p. 399, fig. 1, n), measuring in length <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 500</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1500</hi> inch and in breadth
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 40000</hi> to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50000</hi> inch, and
                    possessed of rotatory or twisting movements. This organism has received the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Spirillum obermeieri.</hi> It appears to be present in
                    abundance during the height of the febrile symptoms, and is not seen during the
                    interval until the relapse is impending, when it is again present as before.
                    This observation has been confirmed by numerous investigators, and it has been
                    found that inoculation with the blood containing these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spirilla</hi> produced the symptoms of relapsing fever in both men and animals.
                    Comparatively little is as yet known of the life-history of these organisms, and
                    the question whether they are to be regarded as the prime source of the disease
                    or as mere accompaniments affords ground for difference of opinion (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pathology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 403); nevertheless their
                    discovery and the conditions of their presence already mentioned are noteworthy
                    facts in reference not only to the pathology of this fever but also to the
                    general doctrine of infectiveness in disease-processes. The most constantly
                    recognized factor in the origin and spread of relapsing fever is destitution;
                    but this cannot be regarded as more than a predisposing cause favouring the
                    reception and propagation of the morbific agent, since in many lands widespread
                    and destructive famines have prevailed without any outbreak of this fever.
                    Instances, too, have been recorded where epidemics were distinctly associated
                    with overcrowding rather than with privation. Relapsing fever is most commonly
                    met with in the young. One attack does not appear to protect from others, but
                    rather, according to some authorities, engenders liability.</p>
                <p>The extreme contagiousness of relapsing fever has occasionally been shown by its
                    spreading widely when introduced into a district, even among those who had not
                    become predisposed by destitution or other depressing conditions. The contagion,
                    like that of typhus, appears to be most active in the immediate vicinity of the
                    patient and to be greatly lessened by the access of fresh air. It is capable of
                    being conveyed by clothing. The incubation of the disease is about one week. The
                    symptoms of the fever then show themselves with great abruptness and violence by
                    a rigor, accompanied with pains in the limbs and severe headache. The febrile
                    phenomena are very marked, and the temperature quickly rises to a high point</p>
                <p>(105°-107° Fahr.), at which it continues with little variation, while the pulse
                    is rapid (100-140), full, and strong. There is intense thirst, a dry brown
                    tongue, bilious vomiting, tenderness over the liver and spleen, and occasionally
                    jaundice. Sometimes a peculiar bronzy appearance of the skin is noticed, but
                    there is no characteristic rash as in typhus. There is much prostration of
                    strength. After the continuance of these symptoms for a period of from five to
                    seven days, the temperature suddenly falls to the normal point or below it, the
                    pulse becomes correspondingly slow, and a profuse perspiration occurs, while the
                    severe headache disappears and the appetite returns. Except for a sense of
                    weakness, the patient feels well and may even return to work, but in some cases
                    there remains a condition of great debility, accompanied with rheumatic pains in
                    the limbs. This state of freedom from fever continues for about a week, when
                    there occurs a well-marked relapse with scarcely less abruptness and severity
                    than in the first attack, and the whole symptoms are of the same character, but
                    they do not, as a rale, continue so long, and they terminate in a crisis in
                    three or four days, after which convalescence proceeds satisfactorily. Second,
                    third, and even fourth relapses, however, may occur in exceptional cases.</p>
                <p>The mortality in relapsing fever is comparatively small, about 5 per cent. being
                    the average death-rate in epidemics (Murchison). The fatal cases occur mostly
                    from the complications common to continued fevers. The treatment is essentially
                    the same as that for typhus fever (see above). (J. O. A.) <pb break="no"
