                    (1809-1884), a ballet dancer, was the daughter of Filippo Taglioni, an Italian
                    master of the ballet, and was born at Stockholm 23d April 1809. She was trained
                    by her father, who in his discipline is said to have been pitilessly severe. It
                    was to his care and her own special talent for dancing that she owed her
                    success, for she possessed no remarkable personal attractions. Her first
                    appearance was at Vienna, 10th June 1822, in a ballet of which her father was
                    the author, <hi rend="italic">La Reception Tune jeune nymphe à la cour de
                        Terpsichore.</hi> Her success was immediate, and was repeated in the chief
                    towns of Germany. On 23d July 1827 she made her debut at the Opera House, Paris,
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Ballet de Sicilien,</hi> and aroused a furore of
                    enthusiasm. Her style was entirely new, and may be termed ideal as opposed to
                    the realistic and voluptuous ballet previously in vogue. Among her more
                    remarkable performances were the dancing of the Tyrolienne in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Guillaτιme Tell</hi> and of the <hi rend="italic">pas de fascination
                        in</hi> Meyerbeer’s <hi rend="italic">Robert le Diable.</hi> At this period
                    the ballet was a much more important feature in opera than it is now, and in
                    fact with her retirement in 1845 the era of grand ballets may be said to have
                    closed. In 1832 she married Comte Gilbert de Voisins, by whom she had two
                    children. Losing her savings in speculation, she afterwards supported herself in
                    London as a teacher of deportment, especially in connexion with the ceremony of
                    presentation at court. During the last two years of her life she stayed with her
                    son at Marseilles, where she died in April 1884. Taglioni is frequently
                    mentioned in the novels of Balzac; and Thackeray, in <hi rend="italic">The
                        Newcomes,</hi> says that the young men of that epoch “will never see
