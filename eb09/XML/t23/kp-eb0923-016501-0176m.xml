                    “house of God”; Latin, <hi rend="italic">aedes sacrae).</hi> In this connexion
                    the term “house of God” has quite a different sense from that -which we connect
                    with it when we apply it to a Christian place of worship. A temple is not a
                    meeting-place for worshippers; for many ancient temples were open only to
                    priests, and as a general rule the altar, which was the true place of worship,
                    stood not within the house but before the door. The temple is the dwelling-house
                    of the deity to which it is consecrated, whose presence is marked by a statue or
                    other sacred symbol; and in it his sacred treasures, the gifts and tribute of
                    his worshippers, are kept, under the charge of his attendants or priests. Again,
                    a temple implies a sanctuary; but a sanctuary or holy spot does not necessarily
                    contain a temple. A piece of land may be reserved for the deity without a
                    dwelling-house being erected to him upon it, and a sacred tree, stone, or altar,
                    with the holy precinct surrounding it, may be recognized as a place where the
                    worshipper can meet his god and present his offerings, although no temple is
                    attached. Indeed the conception of a holy place, separated from profane use, is
                    older than the beginnings of architecture; and natural objects of worship, such
                    as trees and stones, which need no artificial protection or official keeper, are
                    older than images enshrined under roofs and protected by walls and doors. All
                    antique religion is essentially altar-worship (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Sacrifice),</hi> and for ritual purposes the altar always continued to be the
                    true centre of the sanctuary. But the altar is only a modification of the sacred
                    stone (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Priest,</hi> vol. xix. p. 726), and it has
                    already been observed that, even in later times, the chief altar of a sanctuary
                    stood outside the temple. In the oldest and most primitive forms of religion the
                    sacred stone is at once the place -where gifts are offered and the material sign
                    of the presence of the deity; thus the temple with its image belongs to a later
                    development, in which the significance of the sacred stone is divided between
                    the altar outside the door and the idol, or its equivalent, within. But in many
                    very ancient sanctuaries the place of a temple is taken by a natural or
                    artificial grotto <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the Phoenician Astarte grottoes,
                    the grotto of Cynthus in Delos), or else the temple is built over a subterranean
                    opening (as at Delphi); and, while this may be in part explained as connected
                    with the cult of telluric deities, or the worship of the dead, it seems not
                    unreasonable to think that in their origin cave temples may date back to the
                    time when caves were commonly used as human habitations, that the altar in front
                    of the temple had its prototype in altars at the mouths of sacred caves, which
                    were approached with holy fear and not entered by ordinaryworshippers, and that
                    thus some of the main features of the ancient temple were fixed from the first
                    by the analogy <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0177-0166"/> of more primitive sanctuaries. The influence of
                    the cave temple seems at least to be undeniable in that widespread type of
                    sanctuary in which, besides the court for the worshippers and an outer chamber,
                    there was a dark and mysterious inner room, an adytum or Holy of Holies. This
                    type is found in Egypt (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    388 and plate VII.), among the Semites, as in the temple at Jerusalem and in
                    that of Hierapolis <hi rend="italic">(De Dea Syr.,</hi> § 31), and also among
                    the Greeks and Romans. In Greece the adytum was not a universal feature, though
                    large temples usually had an antechamber as well as the cella or proper chamber
                    of the god. But, where an oracle was given, or mysteries were celebrated, an
                    adytum was always found, and one of its names was <hi rend="italic"
                    >μiγαpov,</hi> which seems to be a transcription of a Semitic word for a cave
                    <hi rend="italic">(megharap</hi> Certain adyta in Greece were actually
                    subterranean; and the association of oracles with caves is well known.</p>

                    successive temples at Jerusalem is called for by the unique interest of the
                    subject, while a glance at the topographical problems connected with this holy

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Temple of Solomon.—</hi> There were temples among the
                    Hebrews before the time of Solomon, whether private, like that of Micah (Judges
                    xvii. 5), or public, like that of Shiloh, where the ark was housed for a time
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tabernacle).</hi> In this, as in other matters, the
                    Israelites must have learned from the Canaanites, who had large temples in the
                    time of the Judges. The “hold” (vault?) of the temple of El-Berith at Shechem
                    was the place of refuge for a thousand men (Judges ix. 46 s&lt;∕.), and at Gaza
                    there was a vast temple with a roof supported on two middle pillars (Judges xvi.
                    29). Solomon’s enterprise was not therefore absolutely novel, and in point of
                    size his temple can hardly have surpassed those just mentioned. But his subjects
                    were much behind the Canaanites and Philistines in the constructive arts, and as
                    Solomon had to call in the aid of Tyrian craftsmen it cannot be questioned that
                    the design was derived from Tyrian architecture. The general plan, indeed, of
                    the house or “palace” <hi rend="italic">(hehat)</hi> of Jehovah, with an adytum
                    <hi rend="italic">(debιr,</hi> E.V. “oracle ”), an outer chamber, and an altar
                    before the door, is, as we have seen, common to many countries, especially in
                    temples which had an oracle, as was the case with Solomon’s temple, built to
                    contain the ark. But all the distinctive features are Phoenician, or at least
                    characteristic of the northern Semites, of whose art the Phoenicians were then
                    the leading exponents. For the general arrangements the temple of Hierapolis
                    (Mabbög), described by Lucian, offers a complete parallel. Like that of Solomon,
                    it faced the east, and had two cellae and a pronaos. The interior was enriched
                    with gold work. Before the door stood a brazen altar within a walled court. The
                    walled court is a constant feature in the Phoenician and Syrian temples, known
                    to us from their remains or from coins,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    decoration of Solomon’s temple were the palm tree and the cherub. The former is
                    one of the commonest Phoenician symbols, and the Phoenician associations of the
                    latter are clear from Ezek. xxviii. The cherub, in fact, is only a variety of
                    the sphinx, and the way in which the Dahn and winded animal fisures were
                    combined in</p>
                <p>Phoenician decoration is shown in a fragment of alabaster preserved in the Louvre

                    131). Two cherubs with outstretched wings stood in the adytum to form a
                    baldachin over the ark. Baldachins over the image or symbol of the deity existed
                    in other temples of the northern Semites (Donaldson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >op.cit.,</hi> pp. 73, 76 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 99), and in many

                    the figure or symbol of a deity is overshadowed by the winged disk (an Assyrian

                    cubits deep. That the two chambers were separated by a solid wall and not by a
                    mere wooden partition may be taken as certain if, with Stade, we understand 1
                    Kings vi. 31 to say that the doorway of the adytum was pentagonal, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that instead of a horizontal lintel a rude arch of two
                    blocks was introduced to distribute the pressure of the superincumbent wall. In
                    this case it is not likely that the exterior walls of the adytum were carried up
                    to a height of 30 cubits, so as to allow of a continuous roof. The reduction of
                    the dimensions to English feet is approximately determined by the Siloam
                    inscription, which gives a round number of 1200 cubits for a measured length of
                    1760 feet. The Hebrew cubit, therefore, was the short cubit of antiquity, and
                    for practical purposes may be taken as equal to the Greek cubit of 18 inches,
                    used by Josephus for the measurements of Herod’s temple. Thus the roof-beams of
                    the temple had a span of 30 feet, a length sufficient to make it probable that
                    the wooden pillars spoken of in 1 Kings x. 12 (comp. 2 Kings xviii. 16) were
                    employed to support them. The roof of the temple at Gaza rested on pillars, as
                    we have seen, and wooden pillars seem to have been used within the temple at
                    Golgus (Cesnola, <hi rend="italic">Cyprus,</hi> p. 139), which was smaller than
                    that of Jerusalem. A peculiar feature in Solomon’s temple was that all its sides
                    except the front were surrounded by three stories (each 5 cubits high) of small
                    chambers, 5 cubits wide on the ground floor, 6 on the first floor, and 7 on the
                    second, the increasing breadth being evidently got by reducing the thickness of
                    the walls by 1 cubit at each floor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    hardly have been more than a vertical post with footholds nailed to it (Prof. J.
                    H. Middleton).</p></note> Thus, allowing for the walls, the external
                    measurements of the house cannot have been much less than 45 cubits by 90. The
                    aspect of the façade can only be conjecturally determined. Several Phoenician
                    temples, known from coins, show on their façade a high-pitched gable (Byblus,
                    Tripolis), and that of Tripolis has also a flat-roofed wing on each side of the
                    gable and portico, which would answ er to the ends of the side chambers in <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n178/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0178-0167"/> our temple. But perhaps the closest analogy to
                    the frontispiece of Solomon’s temple is the often-cited one of the temple at
                    Paphos, of which a representation from a coin is annexed (fig. 2). Here the
                    portico between the side wings is flanked by two slender towers, and in the end
                    of the nave above the door there are square-topped windows. Solomon’s temple had
                    “windows of beams” (or “with horizontal lintels ”) “framed in,” which, as
                    Professor J. H. Middleton observes, is naturally explained on the analogy of the
                    windows between the beams in the wooden gables of Coptic churches. This is the
                    obvious position of openings for light in buildings the type of which was
                    derived from wooden constructions, and we know that the oldest Phoenician
                    temples were, at least in great part, of wood (L <hi rend="superscript"> T</hi>
                    tica; Pliny, <hi rend="italic">H.N.,</hi> xvi. 79; comp. Jos., <hi rend="italic"
                    >C. Ap.,</hi> i. 17, 18, and Solomon’s house of the forest of Lebanon). That
                    Solomon’s temple had towers cannot be proved, for the height of the porch is not
                    given in Kings, and the 120 cubits of 2 Chron. iii. 4 is obviously an excessive
                    figure, due to a mistake of the writer or of a copyist. But the fact that in
                    Ezekiel’s ideal temple the door-posts of the porch are 5 cubits broad makes the
                    existence of slender turrets like those of Paphos on each side of the portal
                    probable. Another feature of Solomon’s temple is exactly reproduced at Paphos.
                    On each side of the door the coin shows a fantastic pillar standing free.
                    Solomon erected two such pillars of bronze, 18 cubits high (1 Kings vii. 15 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> with capitals of “lily work,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> adorned with lotus flowers, like the Phoenician capital from Cyprus
                    figured by Perrot <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> p. 116). Such twin pillars
                    or twin stelae in stone are of constant occurrence in Phoenician sacred art, and
                    are still familiar to us as the Pillars of Hercules. In Solomon’s temple both
                    the oracle and the outer cella had folding doors. In the second and third
                    temples the inner door was replaced by a vail <hi rend="italic"
                    >(parokheth),</hi> and a vail also hung before the outer door (Mal. i. 10; 1
                    Mac. i. 22, iv. 51; <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> v. 5, § 4 sg.). The Chronicler
                    (2 Chron. iii. 14) introduces a vail in the first temple. This feature also
                    seems to be common to the temple with other Semitic shrines (comp. <hi

                    tissue given by Antiochus to the temple at Olympia (Pausan., v. 12, § 4), which

                <p>The temple had an inner court of its own (1 Kings vi. 36), but the outer or great
                    court (1 Kings vii. 12) was the court of the palace as well as of the sanctuary.
                    Details as to the position of the courts and buildings must be reserved till we
                    speak of the site, but it may be noticed that Jer. xxxvi. 10 speaks of the
                    “higher court,” to which the “new gate” of the temple belonged. This new gate in
                    the higher court can hardly be different from the “higher gate” built by Jotham
                    (2 Kings xv. 35), or from the “higher gate” of Benjamin, which, in Jer. xx. 2,
                    is not the city gate of that name, but a gate “in” (not “by” as E.V.) “the house
                    of the Lord.” From its name this gate must have been on the north side or at the
                    north-east angle of the temple area, so that the ground rose to the north or
                    north-east. The upper court may be merely the upper part of the great court near
                    the “higher gate” leading to the palace (2 Chrom xxiii. 20), or may be the same
                    as the “new court” of 2 Chrom XX. 5. But one cannot be sure that the Chronicler
                    is not transferring to Jehoshaphat’s time a new court of the second temple. We
                    know, however, that the kings of Judah made from time to time considerable
                    changes in and about the temple.</p>

                    of stone took the place of the brazen altar, or rather perhaps of the altar of
                    Ahaz (2 Kings xvi. 10 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> The altar was erected
                    immediately after the return (Ezra iii.</p>
                <p>2); but the rebuilding of the temple was long delayed, and the work was not
                    completed till 520 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Haggai).</hi> It was much inferior to the first temple in magnificence, though
                    not perhaps in size (Haggai ii. 3). The proposed breadth of 60 cubits and height
                    of 60 cubits spoken of in Ezra vi. 3 would indeed imply that it was larger than
                    the first temple, but in view of the testimony of Haggai <hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    cit.)</hi> it seems unlikely that these dimensions were realized by
                    Zerubbabel.</p>
                <p>The first temple resembled other temples of antiquity in being built to contain a
                    visible symbol of the presence of the deity, namely, the ark, which stood in the
                    inner chamber. In the second temple the adytum was empty, but the idea that the
                    Godhead was locally present in it still found expression in the continuance of
                    the altar service, in the table of showbread (a sort of continual <hi
                    rend="italic">lectisternium)</hi> that stood in the outer chamber, and above all
                    in the annual ritual of the day of atonement, when the high priest entered the
                    Holy of Holies to sprinkle the blood of the expiatory sacrifice on behalf of the
                    people. Not only in this point but in all others the ritual of the second temple
                    was dominated by the idea of priestly mediation, and the stated sacrifices of
                    the priests on behalf of the people, -which replaced the old stated oblations of
                    the kings, became the main feature of the altar service. The first temple was
                    primarily the royal chapel, and the kings did as they pleased in it; the second
                    temple was the sanctuary of the priests, whose chief now became the temporal as
                    well as the spiritual head of the people. In the time of Ezekiel not only laymen
                    but uncircumcised foreigners entered the sanctuary and acted as servants in the
                    sacred offices (Ezek. xliv. 7); in the second temple the laity were anxiously
                    kept at a distance from the holy things, and even part of the court around the
                    altar was fenced off by a barrier, which only the priests were allowed to cross
                    (Joseph., <hi rend="italic">Anh,</hi> xiii. 13, § 5). Being no longer hemmed in
                    by the royal buildings, as the first temple had been (Ezek. xliii. 8), its
                    precincts could be expanded to suit the necessities of the enormous host of
                    ministers of various ranks demanded by the growing complexity of the ritual,
                    which, in matters of music and the like, was immensely developed as time went on
                    (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Psalms).</hi> Herod’s temple, with the dependent
                    buildings, was a little city enclosed in its own fortifications. But long before
                    his time the temple was a sort of priestly citadel, the fortress as well as the
                    sanctuary of the hierocracy; and the sacred offerings which flowed to Jerusalem
                    from Jews in all parts of the world were lavishly expended on enlarging and
                    strengthening it (Jos., <hi rend="italic">B. J.,</hi> v. 5, § 1). The name of
                    Simon II. (c. 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> is associated in Ecclus. 1. 1
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> with important works of fortification on the circuit
                    of the temple. Twice ruined in the wars with the Seleucids, these bulwarks were
                    twice rebuilt, by Judas and Jonathan Maccabaeus (1 Mac. vi. 7; Jos., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xiii. 5, § 11). The works were further strengthened by
                    Simon (1 Mac. xiii. 52), and at the time of Pompey’s siege (63 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> constituted an almost impregnable fastness,
                    strengthened on its weakest or northern side by great towers and a deep ditch
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xiv. 4, § 2). Twenty-six years later the temple
                    was again besieged by Herod, who, attacking, like Pompey, from the north, had to
                    force three lines of defence,—the city wall and the outer and inner temple <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xiv. 16, § 2).</p>
                <p>Of the temple as it was in the Greek or the Hasmonean period we have two
                    descriptions by Hellenistic Jews, Pseudo-Aristaeus (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Septuagint)</hi> and Pseudo-Hecataeus (Jos., <hi rend="italic">C. Ap.,</hi> i.
                    22). In such a matter <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> we may suspect even
                    notorious literary forgers of carelessness and exaggeration rather than of
                    absolute untruth. Pseudo-Aristaeus describes the temple as surrounded by a
                    triple circuit of walls more than 70 cubits high, and as further protected by
                    the adjoining Aera, which overlooked the place of sacrifice. Comparing the
                    account of Herod’s siege, we may perhaps take the third circuit to be the wall
                    of the town, which is represented as lying below the <pb break="no"

                    western hill is ignored, which seems to show that the account was written before
                    the Hasmonean period (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerusalem,</hi> vol. xiii. p.
                    641), as has been argued on other grounds in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Septuagint.</hi> The Aera, which is often mentioned in the history of the
                    Maccabee wars, seems to have been on the same site as the Baris or castle of the
                    Hasmonean priest-princes, where they put on their priestly robes before doing
                    sacrifice <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xv. 11, § 4). That the Baris was close
                    to the temple appears both from this circumstance and from the fact that
                    Antigonus was charged with setting fire to the porticoes of the temple during
                    the siege by Herod <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xiv. 16, § 2),—an accusation
                    which would have had no plausibility unless the destruction of the porticoes had
                    been useful to isolate the castle. Pseudo-Hecataeus gives the temple precincts a
                    length of 500 feet and a breadth of 100 cubits. The explanation of these numbers
                    will appear in the sequel.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Temple of Herod.—</hi> In the eighteenth year of his
                    reign (20-19 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Herod the Great began to rebuild
                    the temple and its precincts from the foundation, doubling the old area (Ani.,
                    xv. 11; <hi rend="italic">Bell. Jud.,</hi> i. 21). The works included the
                    reconstruction, on the old site, of the Baris, which now received the name of
                    Antonia, and is generally reckoned by Josephus as forming part of the temple
                    precincts. Apart from the Antonia, the temple area formed a quadrangular plateau
                    supported by retaining walls of great height and strength, and surrounded by
                    porticoes. Three of the porticoes were double walks, 30 cubits broad, with
                    monolith pillars 25 cubits high, and cedar roofs; the fourth or southern portico
                    (the Stoa Basilica) had four rows of Corinthian pillars and three walks,
                    respectively 30, 45, and 30 cubits in breadth. The middle walk was twice the
                    height of the aisles, and the latter were 50 feet high. As regards the size of
                    this enclosure, we are told by Josephus that the Stoa Basilica was a stadium or
                    G00 feet long <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xv. 11, § 5); and in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xx. 9, § 7, the same length is assigned to the eastern
                    colonnade, which was known as Solomon’s Porch (comp. John x. 23; Acts iii. 11
                    and v. 12), because it, and it alone, rested on an ancient substructure held to
                    be the work of Solomon. The whole circuit of the porticoes was therefore 4

                    measurement <hi rend="italic">(Aηt.,</hi> xv. 11, § 3) has often been taken to
                    refer to Solomon’s temple. But this view is not demanded by the words of
                    Josephus, and is inconsistent with the other measurements he gives and with <hi
                    rend="italic">B.J.,</hi> v. 5, § 1, which states that the plateau was levelled
                    up by Solomon only on the east. This from the lie of the contour lines makes a
                    plateau 600 feet square impossible. The Mishnah makes the “mountain of the
                    house” a square of 500 cubits, apparently borrowing from Ezekiel.</p></note> or
                    with the Antonia 6 stadia <hi rend="italic">(B.J.,</hi> v. 5, § 2). The Antonia
                    lay on the north side <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> xv. 11, § 4) and
                    communicated by stairs with the north and west porticoes at the north-west angle
                    of the enclosure. Fergusson and others suppose that it touched the temple only
                    at this angle, thence stretching north and west. But in this case the Antonia,
                    which, as we shall see below, lay just north of Wilson’s arch, would have been
                    built over the hollow of the Tyropoeon valley, a supposition absurd in itself
                    and inconsistent with <hi rend="italic">B.J.,</hi> v. 5, § 8, which says that it
                    stood on a cliff. Again, the tower 70 cubits high that stood at the south-east
                    angle of the Antonia overlooked the whole temple, just as we know from
                    Pseudo-Aristaeus that the old Aera overlooked the altar. But, if the south-east
                    angle of the Antonia had been, as Fergusson supposes, at the north-west angle of
                    the temple porticoes, the view from the tower would have been intercepted by the
                    lofty porch in front of the Holy Place. The Antonia, therefore, had its south
                    face along part of the north face of the temple enclosure, and to gain a circuit
                    of 6 stadia for temple and Antonia together we must assign to the latter the
                    length of a stadium from north to south. This is not too much, for Josephus
                    describes it as a little town in itself <hi rend="italic">(B. J.,</hi> v. 5, §
                    8).</p>
                <p>The Antonia, the porticoes, and the space immediately within them (the outer
                    court, or, as modern writers call it, the court of the Gentiles) were not holy
                    ground. But in the middle of the enclosure there was a platform raised 15 cubits
                    above the court of the Gentiles and fenced off by a barrier, with inscriptions,
                    one of which still exists <hi rend="italic">(Palestine E. F. Quarterly
                    Statement,</hi> 1871, p. 132), forbidding aliens to pass on pain of death. The
                    platform was approached by steps on all sides but the west <hi rend="italic">(B.
                    J.,</hi> v. 1, § 5, and 5, § 2), and was surrounded by a wall, rising 25 cubits
                    above the inner level, and pierced by four gates on the north side and as many
                    on the south. On the west there was no gate, but on the east—that is, in front
                    of the fane—there were two, one within the other; for the eastern end of the
                    platform was walled off to form a separate court for the women, at a somewhat
                    lower level. One of the northern and one of the southern gates belonged to the
                    court of the women, but it was also entered directly from the east by a very
                    splendid gate of Corinthian brass, much more costly than the others, though they
                    were overlaid with silver and gold. An enormous gate, 40 cubits wide and 50 high
                    (gate Nicanor), connected the women’s court with the higher part of the
                    platform, or court of the men of Israel. The beautiful gate of Acts iii. 2 is
                    variously identified with the first or second of these eastern portals. The
                    Avails of the platform were lined within with chambers, in front of which ran a
                    splendid colonnade; and the gateways were connected with the colonnade by small
                    lofty halls <hi rend="italic">(exedrse),</hi> which from without had a
                    tower-like aspect. It is doubtful whether all the gates had <hi rend="italic"
                    >exedrae</hi>; but, on the other hand, there was such a hall also at the west
                    end where no gate opened. In the court of the men— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    in the upper and western part of the platform just described— stood the fane or
                    temple proper raised twelve steps above the court. For the ground plan of the
                    Holy Place and the Holy of Holies the ancient dimensions of Solomon’s temple
                    were preserved, and the external size demanded by the scale of the surroundings
                    was gained by increasing their height, placing a lofty second story above them,
                    making their walls and those of the surrounding chambers (corresponding to the
                    chambers in the first temple) enormously thick, and placing at the front or east
                    end a porch 100 cubits wide and 100 cubits high. The open doorway of this porch
                    was overlaid with gold, as was also the door of the fane and the wall round it.
                    To the ornament of the entrance belonged also a golden vine with clusters of
                    grapes as big as a man. In front of the fane beneath the steps was the great
                    altar of stone, 50 (or, according to the <hi rend="italic">Middoth,</hi> 32)
                    cubits square and 15 high; it was ascended by a flight of steps from the south.
                    The part of the court round the fane and the altar was fenced off for the use of
                    the priests, and other Israelites were admitted only when the sacrificial ritual
                    required the presence of the sacrificer.</p>
                <p>Besides the descriptions in Josephus, we have for Herod’s temple a mass of
                    details and measurements in the Mishnic treatise <hi rend="italic">Middoth.</hi>
                    Josephus was himself a priest, while the Mishnah was not written till a century
                    after the destruction of the temple, though it uses traditions that go back to
                    Levites who had served in the temple. The two sources differ in many
                    measurements, and the <hi rend="italic">Middoth</hi> appears to be possessed of
                    detailed traditions only for the inner temple. The state of the evidence is not
                    such as to allow a plan of the temple to be formed with architectural precision.
                    The above account rests almost entirely on Josephus, who, apart from certain
                    exaggerations in detail, gives a satisfactory general account, such as could be
                    written from memory without notes and drawings.</p>
                <p>Herod’s gigantic and costly structures were still in building, forty-six years
                    after their commencement, when our Lord began His ministry (John ii. 20), and
                    the works were not completed till the procuratorship of Albinus (62- 64 A.D.).
                    In 66 the great revolt against Rome broke out, and in August 70 Jerusalem was
                    taken by Titus and the temple perished in a great conflagration.<note

                    temple lay within the great Haram platform (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jerusalem),</hi> now a Moslem holy place, and it is generally agreed also that
                    the south-west corner of that platform is the south-west corner of Herod’s outer
                    plateau, parts of the southern and western retaining walls being confidently
                    ascribed by experts to his age. But if Herod’s temple (excluding the Antonia)
                    was only 600 feet square it can have occupied but a small part of the Haram
                    area, which measures about 1500 feet from north to south and 922 feet along the
                    south wall. Moreover, the highest part of the hill, where the Dome of the Rock
                    now stands, must have been outside and north of the temple enclosure. But this
                    affords no good reason to doubt the accuracy of Josephus’s measurements in a
                    matter in which his memory could hardly fail him, and where his tendency would
                    be rather to exaggerate than to diminish. There is no evidence that the eastern
                    wall of the Haram is as old as Herod, much less as old as Solomon; for the
                    supposed Phoenician letters found on stones belonging to it are not letters at
                    all, and may be of any date.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Jerusalem published by the Palestine Explora-tiorf Fund.</p></note> Moreover,
                    there are various evidences of later building about the east wall of the Haram;
                    the so-called Golden Gate is certainly a later construction, and Justinian’s
                    church rested on new substructures to the south and east (Procopius, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Aecl.,</hi> v. 6), which implies an extension eastward of the
                    old platform. And this is confirmed by the fact that in the neighbourhood of the
                    south-east angle the platform does not rest on solid substructures such as
                    Josephus speaks of, but on the vaults known as Solomon’s stables. Again, though
                    the temple of Solomon lay above the town, there is no evidence that it was on
                    the very top of the hill; on the contrary, buildings of the dimensions given in
                    1 Kings might have been placed on the hill-top without the need for such great
                    substructures as are spoken of in 1 Kings vii. 10; and we have seen in speaking
                    of the courts of the first temple that the ground appears to have risen to the
                    north, the upper court being on that side.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    site before the ark was placed there.</p></note></p>
                <p>If we accept the measurements of Josephus we have to break with mediaeval
                    tradition, both Moslem and Christian, which associates the Sakhra or rock under
                    the dome on the top of the hill with the sacred site of the Jews. So much weight
                    has been laid on this circumstance by writers of eminence that it is necessary
                    here to go into some particulars and show that earlier tradition goes quite the
                    other way. It is a Talmudic legend that in the Holy of Holies the place of the
                    lost ark was taken by a stone called the “foundation stone.” Further this stone
                    was identified with Jacob’s stone at Bethel (comp. Rashi on Gen. xxviii. and
                    Breithaupt’s notes). Both Mohammedans and Christians transferred these legends
                    to the Sakhra, which the former accordingly venerated as “a gate of heaven” (Ibn
                    'Àbd Rabbih, <hi rend="italic">'Ikd,</hi> iii. 369). Mohammedan sources enable
                    us to trace back this identification to the Moslem Jew Wahb ibn Monabbih, who
                    enriched Islam with so many Jewish fables and died a century after Jerusalem was
                    taken by the Arabs (Tabari, i. 571 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Ibn al-Fakih, p.
                    97 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Eutychius, on the other hand, who is the first
                    Christian writer to apply the Jewish legend to the Moslem Sakhra, avers that the
                    tradition was communicated to Omar by the Christian patriarch Sophronius on the
                    taking of Jerusalem, and guided the caliph in the choice of a site for his
                    mosque. Eutychius wrote nearly three hundred years after this event; and, though
                    it is known from earlier authorities (Arculphus, Theophanes) that the first
                    Moslem mosque was built on what was pointed out as the site of the temple, it is
                    equally certain, and was known to Eutychius himself, that that mosque lay to the
                    south of the Sakhra (Eutychius, ii. 289), which was not embraced in the
                    precincts of the Moslem sanctuary till the reign of 'Abd al-Malik, who built the
                    dome, as an inscription with the date 691 still testifies <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hbicl.,</hi> p. 365). This is confirmed by the excellent Arabian historian Ibn
                    Wadih (ii. 311). 'Abd al-Malik’s motive was political, as both historians
                    attest: Mecca beinsr in the hands of a rival, he resolved to set un another
                    place of pilgrimage to supplant the Kaaba, and recommended it to the faithful as
                    the point from which the Prophet made his miraculous ascent from Jerusalem to
                    heaven (Ibn Wadih, <hi rend="italic">ut supra).</hi> There is nothing of the
                    Jewish legend here; that, as we have seen, was supplied by ΛVahb in the next
                    generation, and on his foundation there grew up a mass of other fables for which
                    it is enough to refer to Ibn al-Fakih, p. 93 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> From all
                    this it may be taken as certain that at the time of Omar it was towards the
                    south-west angle of the Haram, on the site of the original mosque, that
                    tradition supposed the temple to have stood; indeed Eutychius is guilty of
                    self-contradiction when he first says that Sophronius indicated the Sakhra to
                    Omar as the site on which to build his mosque, and then adds that it was not
                    part of the Moslem sanctuary till a generation later. Finally, the extension of
                    the Haram to the north so as to bring the Dome of the Rock into the centre of
                    the sacred area was the work of 'Abd al-Malik’s son Walid (Eutychius, ii.
                    373).</p>
                <p>Thus far we have met with nothing but confirmation of Josephus’s measurements and
                    the site they imply; but there are other topographical indications which supply
                    confirmation more decisive. And first let us compare what is related of the
                    outer gates of Herod’s temple with existing remains. On the north was the gate
                    Tadi of the Mishnah, which Josephus mentions only incidentally. This, like the
                    gate Shushan on the east, which he does not mention at all, must have been of
                    minor importance; the chief accesses were necessarily from the lower city to the
                    south and the upper city to the west beyond the Tyropoeon valley. The south
                    wall, says Josephus, had gates in the middle <hi rend="italic">(Änt., xv.</hi>
                    11, 5). The Mishnah names them the two gates of Huldah, which may mean “tunnel
                    (weaselhole) gates.” There is a double gate in the substructure of the south
                    wall, 350 feet from the south-west angle, and from it a double tunnel leads up
                    to the platform. This double gate exactly fits Josephus’s description. There is
                    also a triple gate, 600 feet from the south-west angle, which those who suppose
                    the wall to have been more than 600 feet long regard as the second Huldah gate.
                    But this view does not give us two gates in the middle of the wall, especially
                    as the old wall cannot have enclosed Solomon’s stables. In the west side the
                    Mishnah places one gate (Kiponus), while Josephus recognizes four. But these
                    accounts are at once reconciled if we accept Josephus’s measurements. For of his
                    four gates the most southerly is necessarily the one which opened on a flight of
                    steps descending and then reascending across the Tyropoeon to the upper city
                    opposite. Now at the south-west corner of the platform there are still remains
                    of a great arch (Robinson’s arch), which must have belonged to a bridge
                    connecting the upper city with the south portico of the temple. Thus one of the
                    four gates is fixed. The second gate led to Herod’s palace (at the extreme north
                    of the upper city) by means of an embankment crossing the Tyropoeon <hi
                    rend="italic">(Λnt.,</hi> xv. 11, § 5). Comparing <hi rend="italic">JB. J.,</hi>
                    ii. 16, § 3, vi. 6, § 2, and v. 4, § 2, we see that the embankment also carried
                    the city wall (the so-called first wall). Of this approach there are remains at
                    Wilson’s arch, 600 feet north of Robinson’s arch<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The adjoining remains of ancient buildings
                    unquestionably mark the site of the council hall where the Sanhedrim met, and

                    rend="italic">(B. J.,</hi> v. 4, § 2; vi. 6, § 3).</p></note>; thus, if
                    Josephus’s measurements are correct, the two western accesses were at the
                    extreme ends of the western portico. Josephus’s other two gates led to the
                    suburbs outside the first wall, and therefore lay north of Wilson’s arch, and
                    were not gates of the temple enclosure proper but of the Antonia, which Josephus
                    habitually reckons as part of the outer temple.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One of the suburban gates may be Warren’s
                    gate, in the substructures of the Antonia wall, about 170 feet north of Wilson’s

                    arch and Robinson’s arch. But this would not lead into the suburb.</p></note> Of
                    them the Mishnah would naturally take no account, and as naturally it would
                    neglect the gate that led to the palace as being not a public entrance. But
                    further, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0181-0170"/> according to Josephus’s account of the whole
                    circumference of the temple with Antonia, the latter extended a stadium north of
                    the north-west angle of the temple portico, Le., 600 feet north of Wilson’s
                    arch; and, if we measure off this distance on a plan of the rock contours and
                    then draw a line at right angles to represent the north face of the Antonia, we
                    find that this line runs across the narrowest part of the saddle from which the
                    temple hill is assailable. The breadth of the Antonia from east to west cannot
                    have been more than about 300 feet if, as is to be presumed, the gate Tadi was
                    opposite ¾he twin gates of Huldah; but with this breadth it would entirely cover
                    the dangerous saddle.</p>
                <p>Every attempt to reconstruct the area and situation of the temple as it was
                    before Herod must be more or less conjectural, and an analysis of the
                    possibilities would take up so much space that it seems better simply to offer a
                    plan which appears to satisfy the main conditions of the problem.</p>
                <p>According to this plan the area of the temple enclosure was doubled by Herod, his
                    additions being in the parts where the work of levelling up was heaviest, and
                    where neither the convenience of worshippers nor reasons of defence called on
                    earlier builders to extend the plateau. It is certain that the substructures of
                    the south-west angle, raised to a dizzy height above the Tyropoeon, are Herod’s
                    <hi rend="italic">{Ant.,</hi> XV. 11, § 5), and Josephus also speaks of an
                    extension to the north (Ae J^., v. 5, § 1). But, on the other hand, the Baris
                    already adjoined the temple, a condition which is satisfied by giving the older
                    north court K (corresponding to the new court of Chronicles, and perhaps also to
                    the upper court of the first temple) a length from east to west of 300 feet and
                    a breadth from north to south of 150. The old east face of the plateau is, as
                    Josephus says, 600 feet long, but this length was gained after the time of
                    Nehemiah by taking in the site of the armoury or house of the forest of Lebanon
                    (H) and the street in front of the water gate (J). For the proof that the water
                    gate stood at a re-entrant angle between the retaining walls of the armoury and
                    the palace and faced east as shown in the plan reference must be made to an
                    article in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of Philology</hi> (vol. xvi.). The
                    rocky boss between these two walls was in Nehemiah’s time surrounded by an
                    outwork, which to the north joined the wall of Ophel,—that is, of the swelling
                    mass of hill which lies out to the northeast of the palace. From the lower city
                    (south of the Haram area) a stair near the wall led up to the plateau H (Neh.
                    iii. 19; xii. 37). The armoury was 150 feet long and 75 broad; the plan allows
                    the same dimensions for the open space within the water gate. The great court C,
                    C, C is arranged in accordance with 1 Kings vii. 12, in such a way that it is at
                    once the court of the palace and that of the temple, enclosing the inner court
                    B. The dimensions of the inner court are not given in 1 Kings, but as the temple
                    was twice the size of the tabernacle the court was probably also double the
                    court of the tabernacle. This gives a length of 300 feet and a breadth of 150,
                    as in the plan. The part of the court in front of the temple is 150 feet square,
                    which agrees with the dimensions given in Ezek. xl. 23, 27. The great court is a
                    square of 300 feet. This gives room on the east face for two porches D and E
                    leading to the palace and each 7 5 feet long. Both porches are described in 1
                    Kings vii. 6, 8, and the dimensions of one are given. It is also expressly
                    stated that the porch was before (t&gt;., on the east side of) the pillars that
                    decorated its front, and that it led into the inner court of the palace, so that
                    the arrangement in the plan is fully justified. In the time of Jeremiah
                    (xxxviii. 14) there were three entries from the palace to the temple; the third
                    was probably into the north court, the palace having been extended northwards.
                    It is evident that before the time of Herod the palace had disappeared. It was
                    on a lower level than the temple, and when it was cleared away the great
                    substructures on the line PE stood out as the boundary of Solomon’s building.
                    North of E the substructures were less considerable, the rock at the north end
                    of this porch being but 20 feet under the present level of the plateau. In
                    Herod’s time, as can be seen at Robinson’s arch, the level of the plateau was
                    the same as at present (2420 feet), but in older times there was a fall between
                    the upper and lower court, and K was probably 10 feet above C, C, C. In that
                    case D was on the natural level of the ground, while (unless the great court was
                    on two levels) E stood on a retaining wall 10 feet high at the north end of the
                    porch and nearly twice as lofty at the south end. The plan shows the temple
                    thrown out on very lofty substructures, so as to be practically inaccessible on
                    all sides and overhang the Tyropoeon in the most striking way.<note

                    observed that the contour lines in and near B, B, B are almost purely

                    to the city of David on its northern or vulnerable side. It will be observed
                    that in Herod’s temple the Huldah gates at R led directly to the altar, the
                    position of which seems never to have been changed, and also that the plan
                    explains the statement of Hecataeus that the temple was 150 feet broad. His
                    length of 500 feet from east to west is 50 feet too much unless he includes some
                    remains of the old palace. The Baris is shown as standing on the south-west
                    corner of the existing platform of the Dome of the Rock.</p>
                <p>A word may be said in conclusion on the ancient line of wall to the west of the
                    temple, which, as has been shown from Neh. iii. in the article <hi

                    bridge connected the temple with the upper city in the time of the later
                    Hasmoneans, and, as the palace (on the site of Herod’s palace) <pb break="no"

                    important to connect, it no doubt corresponded to the northern bridge already
                    spoken of, at Wilson’s arch M. But at that date it must have led, not directly
                    to the temple, but to a lower point on the slope south of the Baris. In
                    Nehemiah’s time there ∙was no bridge, but the gate of Ephraim probably
                    corresponded to the east end of the bridge near the southwest angle of the
                    Baris. In that case the wall, as is natural, ran close under the western
                    substructures of the temple and probably served as a buttress to them in the
                    part of its course south of the gate of Ephraim, which in Neh. xii. 38 is called
                    “the broad wall.” The throne of the Persian governor, beside the gate of Ephraim
                    (see J <hi rend="smallcaps">erusalem,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 640), stood so close to
                    the Baris that we may conclude that there was already a castle on its site, held
                    for the great king. The position assigned to the gate of Ephraim, which,
                    according to 2 Kings xiv. 13, was 600 feet from the corner gate, where the north
                    wall of the city joined the west Avail, suits the fact that a line drawn east
                    and west 600 feet north of Wilson’s arch coincides with the line of scarped rock
                    marked on the plan. Here, therefore, the old north wall ran, with the great.
                    fosse filled up by Pompey. This wall figures also in Herod’s siege, but seems to
                    have been destroyed by him.</p>
