                <p>More than two thousand years ago Aristotle gave a short account of a Simple
                    Ascidian under the name of <hi rend="italic">Tethyum.</hi> He described the
                    appearance and some of the more important points in the anatomy of the animal.
                    From that time onwards to little more than a century ago, although various forms
                    of Ascidians had been briefly described by writers on marine zoology,
                    comparatively little advance was made upon the knowledge of Aristotle. Schlosser
                    and Ellis, in a paper containing a description of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Botryllus,</hi> published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society for 1756, first brought the Compound
                    Ascidians into notice; but it was not until the commencement of the 19th
                    century, as a result of the careful anatomical investigations of Cuvier (<hi
                    rend="italic">I</hi>) upon the Simple Ascidians and of Savigny (<hi
                    rend="italic">2</hi>) upon the Compound, that the close relationship between
                    these two groups of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> was conclusively
                    demonstrated. Up to 1816, the date of publication of Savigny’s great work (<hi
                    rend="italic">2</hi>), the few Compound Ascidians then known had been generally
                    regarded as <hi rend="italic">Alcyonaria</hi> or as Sponges; and, although many
                    new Simple Ascidians had been described by O. F. Müller (<hi rend="italic"
                    >4</hi>) and others, their internal structure had not been investigated. Lamarck
                    (<hi rend="italic">3</hi>) in 1816, chiefly as the result of the anatomical
                    discoveries of Savigny and Cuvier, instituted the class <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> which he placed between the <hi rend="italic">Radiata</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vermes</hi> in his system of classification. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> included at that time, besides the Simple and the
                    Compound Ascidians, the pelagic forms <hi rend="italic">Pyrosoma,</hi> which had
                    been first made known by Péron in 1804, and <hi rend="italic">Salpa,</hi>
                    described by Forskal in 1775.</p>
                <p>Chamisso in 1820 made the important discovery that <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi>
                    in its life-history passes through the series of changes which were afterwards
                    more fully described by Steenstrup in 1842 as “alternation of generations”; and
                    a few years later Kuhl and Van Hasselt’s investigations upon the same animal
                    resulted in the discovery of the alternation in the directions in which the wave
                    of contraction passes along the heart and in which the blood circulates through
                    the body. It has since been found that this observation holds good for all
                    groups of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata.</hi> In 1826 H. Milne-Edwards and
                    Audouin made a series of observations on living Compound Ascidians, and amongst
                    other discoveries they found the free-swimming tailed larva, and traced its
                    development into the young Ascidian. Milne-Edwards (<hi rend="italic">5</hi>)
                    also founded the group of “Social” Ascidians, now known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clavelinidae,</hi> and gave a classification of the Compound Ascidians which
                    was universally accepted for many years. From the year 1826 onwards a number of
                    new and remarkable forms were discovered, as, for instance, some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bolteninae</hi> (Macleay), <hi rend="italic">Chelyosoma</hi>
                    (Broderip and Sowerby, and afterwards Eschricht), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oikopleura</hi> (Mertens), <hi rend="italic">Perophora</hi> (Lister), <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelonaia</hi> (Forbes and Goodsir), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chondro-stachys</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Diplosoma</hi> (Denis Macdonald),
                    <hi rend="italic">Diazona</hi> (Forbes and Goodsir), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhodosoma</hi> (Ehrenberg, and afterwards Lacaze-Duthiers).</p>
                <p>In 1845 Carl Schmidt (<hi rend="italic">6</hi>) first announced the presence in
                    the test of some Ascidians of “tunicine,” a substance very similar to cellulose,
                    and in the following year Löwig and Kölliker (7) confirmed the discovery and
                    made some additional observations upon this substance and upon the structure of
                    the test in general. Huxley (<hi rend="italic">8</hi>), in an important series
                    of papers published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal and
                    Linnean Societies of London from 1851 onwards, discussed the structure,
                    embryology, and affinities of the pelagic Tunicates <hi rend="italic">Pyrosoma,
                    Salpa, Doliolum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Appendicularia.</hi> These important
                    forms were also investigated about the same time by Gegenbaur, Vogt, H. Müller,
                    Krohn, and Leuckart. The most important epoch in the history of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> is the date of the publication of Kowalevsky’s
                    celebrated memoir upon the development of a Simple Ascidian (p). The tailed
                    larva had been previously discovered and investigated by several
                    naturalists—notably H. Milne-Edwards (<hi rend="italic">5</hi>), J. P. van
                    Beneden (zo), and Krohn (<hi rend="italic">II</hi>); but its minute structure
                    had not been sufficiently examined, and the meaning of what was known of it had
                    not been understood. It was reserved for Kowalevsky in 1866 to demonstrate the
                    striking similarity in structure and in development between the larval Ascidian
                    and the vertebrate embryo. He showed that the relations between the nervous
                    system, the notochord, and the alimentary canal are much the same in the two
                    forms, and have been brought about by a very similar course of embryonic
                    development. This discovery clearly indicated that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata</hi> are closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and that the tailed larva represents the
                    primitive or ancestral form from which the adult Ascidian has been evolved by
                    degeneration, and this led naturally to the view usually accepted at the present
                    day, that the group is a degenerate side-branch from the lower end of the phylum
                    <hi rend="italic">Chordata,</hi> which includes the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata
                    (Urochorda), Amphioxus (Cephalochorda),</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi> Kowalevsky’s great discovery has since been confirmed and
                    extended to all other groups of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> by Kupffer
                    (<hi rend="italic">12</hi>), Giard (<hi rend="italic">13</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">15</hi>), and others. Important observations upon the process of
                    gemmation and the formation of colonies in various forms of Compound Ascidians
                    have been made by Krohn, Metschnikoff, Kowalevsky, Ganin, Giard, Della Valle,
                    and others, and have gradually led to the establishment of the general
                    principle, that all the more important layers of the bud are derived more or
                    less directly from the corresponding regions in the body of the parent.</p>
                <p>In 1872 Fol (<hi rend="italic">14</hi>) added largely to the knowledge of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Appendiculariidae,</hi> and Giard (<hi rend="italic">15)</hi> to
                    that of the Compound Ascidians. The latter author described a number of new
                    forms and remodelled the classification of the group. The most important
                    additions which have been made to the Compound Ascidians since Giard’s work have
                    been those described by Von Drasche (<hi rend="italic">16</hi>) from the
                    Adriatic and those discovered by the “Challenger” expedition (<hi rend="italic"
                    >17</hi>). The structure and the systematic arrangement of the Simple Ascidians
                    have been mainly discussed of recent years by Alder and Hancock (<hi
                    rend="italic">18</hi>), Heller (zp), Lacaze-Duthiers (<hi rend="italic"
                    >20</hi>), Traustedt (<hi rend="italic">21</hi>), and Herdman (<hi rend="italic"
                    >17</hi>, <hi rend="italic">22).</hi> In 1874 Ussoff (<hi rend="italic">23</hi>)
                    investigated the minute structure of the nervous system and of the underlying
                    gland, which was first discovered by Hancock, and showed that the gland has a
                    duct which communicates with the front of the branchial sac or pharynx by an
                    aperture in the dorsal (or “olfactory”) tubercle. In an important paper
                    published in 1880 Julin <hi rend="italic">(24)</hi> drew attention to the
                    similarity in structure and relations between this gland and the <hi
                    rend="italic">hypophysis cerebri</hi> of the vertebrate brain, and insisted upon
                    their homology. He suggests that they perform a renal function. The <hi

                    very important memoirs. The researches of Todaro, Brooks (<hi rend="italic"
                    >25</hi>), Salensky (<hi rend="italic">26</hi>), and others have elucidated the
                    embryology, the gemmation, and the life-history of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salpidae;</hi> and Grobben, Barrois <hi rend="italic">(27</hi>), and more
                    especially Uljanin (<hi rend="italic">28</hi>) have elaborately worked out the
                    structure and the details of the complicated life-history of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Doliolidae.</hi> Finally, in an important work published in 1886
                    on the morphology of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata,</hi> E. van Beneden and
                    Julin (<hi rend="italic">30</hi>) have, mainly as the result of a close
                    comparison of the embryology of Ascidians with that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphioxus</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Chordata,</hi> added considerably to
                    our knowledge of the position and affinities of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> and of the exact relations of their organs to the corresponding
                    parts of the body in the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anatomy.</hi></p>
                <p>As a type of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata, Ascidia mentula,</hi> one of the
                    larger species of the Simple Ascidians, may be taken. This species is found in
                    most of the European seas, generally in shallow water on a muddy bottom. It has
                    an irregularly ovate form, and is of a dull grey colour. It is attached to some
                    foreign object by one end (fig. 1). The opposite end of the body is usually
                    narrow, and it has a terminal opening surrounded by eight rounded lobes. This is
                    the mouth or branchial aperture, and it always indicates the anterior end<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some writers use a different
                    nomenclature of regions; see ().</p></note> of the animal. About half-way back
                    from the anterior end, and on a rounded projection, is the atrial or cloacal
                    aperture— an opening surrounded by six lobes—which is always placed upon the
                    dorsal region. When the Ascidian is living and undisturbed, water is being
                    constantly drawn in through the branchial aperture and passed out through the
                    atrial. If coloured particles be placed in the water near the apertures, they
                    are seen to be sucked into the body through the branchial aperture, and after a
                    short time some of them are ejected with considerable force through the atrial
                    aperture. The current of water passing in is for respiratory purposes, and it
                    also conveys food into the animal. The atrial current is mainly the water which
                    has been used in respiration, but it also contains all excretions from the body,
                    and at times the ova and spermatozoa or the embryos.</p>
                <p>The outer grey part of the body, which is attached at or near its posterior end
                    and penetrated by the two apertures, is the “test.” This is a firm gelatinous
                    cuticular secretion from the outer surface of the ectoderm, which is a layer of
                    flat cells lining its inner surface. Although at first produced as a cuticle,
                    the test soon becomes organized by the migration into it of cells derived from
                    the ectoderm (see fig. 2). These test cells may remain as rounded or fusiform or
                    stellate cells imbedded in the gelatinous matrix, to which they are constantly
                    adding by secretions on their surfaces; or they may develop vacuoles in their
                    protoplasm, which become larger and fuse to form a huge ovate clear cavity (a
                    “bladder cell ”), surrounded by a delicate film of protoplasm and having the
                    nucleus still visible at one point; or they may form pigment granules in the
                    protoplasm; or, lastly, they may deposit carbonate of lime, so that one or
                    several of them together produce a calcareous spicule in the test. Only the
                    unmodified test cells and the bladder cells are found in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ascidia mentula.</hi> Calcareous spicules are found chiefly in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Didemnidae,</hi> amongst Compound Ascidians; but pigmented cells
                    may occur in the test of almost all groups of <hi rend="italic">Tunicata.</hi>
                    The matrix in which these structures are imbedded is usually clear and
                    apparently homogeneous; but in some cases it becomes finely fibrillated,
                    especially in the family <hi rend="italic">Cynthiidae.</hi> It is this matrix
                    which contains tunicine. At one point on the left side near the posterior end a
                    tube enters the test, and then splits up into a number of branches, which extend
                    in all directions and finally terminate in rounded enlargements or bulbs,
                    situated chiefly in the outer layer of the test. These tubes are known as the
                    “vessels” of the test, and they contain blood. Each vessel is bounded by a layer
                    of ectoderm cells lined by connective tissue (fig. 3, <hi rend="italic">B),</hi>
                    and is divided into two tubes by a septum of connective tissue. The septum does
                    not extend into the terminal bulb, and consequently the two tubes com municate
                    at their ends (fig. 3, A). The vessels are formed by an outgrowth of a blood
                    sinus (derived originally from the blastocoele of the embryo) from the body wall
                    (mantle) into the test, the wall of the sinus being formed by connective tissue
                    and pushing out a covering of ectoderm in front of it (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi> '). The test is turned inwards at the branchial and atrial apertures to
                    line two funnel-like tubes, —the branchial siphon leading to the branchial sac
                    and the atrial siphon leading to the atrial or peribranchial cavity.</p>
                <p>The body wall, inside the test and the ectoderm, is formed of a layer (the
                    somatic layer of mesoderm) of connective tissue, inclosing muscle fibres, blood
                    sinuses, and nerves. This layer (the mantle) has very much the shape of the test
                    outside it, but at the two apertures it is drawn out to form the branchial and
                    atrial siphons (fig. 4). In the walls of these siphons the muscle fibres form
                    powerful circular bands, the sphincter muscles. Throughout the rest of the
                    mantle the bands of muscle fibres form a rude irregular network. They are
                    numerous on the right side of the body, and almost totally absent on the left.
                    The muscles are all formed of very long fusiform non-striped fibres. The
                    connective tissue of the mantle is chiefly a clear gelatinous <pb break="no"

                    frequently pigmented and is penetrated by numerous lacunae, in which the blood
                    flows. Inside the mantle, in all parts of the body, except along the ventral
                    edge, there is a cavity,—the atrial or peribranchial cavity, —which opens to the
                    exterior by the atrial aperture. This cavity is lined by a layer of cells

                    aperture (fig. 5); consequently the mantle is covered both externally and
                    internally by ectodermal cells.</p>
                <p>The branchial aperture (mouth) leads into the branchial siphon (buccal cavity or
                    stomodaeum), and this opens into the anterior end of a very large cavity (the
                    branchial sac) which extends nearly to the posterior end of the body (see figs.
                    4 and 5). This branchial sac is an enlarged and modified pharynx, and is
                    therefore properly a part of the alimentary canal. The oesophagus opens from it
                    far back on the dorsal edge (see below, p. 612). The wall of the branchial sac
                    is pierced by a large number of vertical slits, — the stigmata, —placed in
                    numerous transverse rows. These slits place the branchial sac in communication
                    with the</p>
                <p>.</p>
                <p>peribranchial or atrial cavity, which lies outside it (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic"
                    >P).</hi> Between the stigmata the wall of the branchial sac is traversed by
                    blood-vessels, which are arranged in three regular series (fig. 6),—(1) the
                    transverse vessels, which run horizontally round the wall and open at their
                    dorsal and ventral ends into large longitudinal vessels, the dorsal and ventral
                    sinuses <hi rend="italic">; (2)</hi> the fine longitudinal vessels, which run
                    vertically between adjacent transverse vessels and open into them, and which
                    bound the stigmata; and (3) the internal longitudinal bars, which run vertically
                    in a plane internal to that of the transverse and fine longitudinal vessels.
                    These bars communicate with the transverse vessels by short side branches where
                    they cross, and at these points are prolonged into the lumen of the sac in the
                    form of hollow papillae. The edges of the stigmata are richly set with cilia,
                    which drive the water from the branchial sac into the peribranchial cavity, and
                    so cause the currents that flow in through the branchial aperture and out
                    through the atrial.</p>
                <p>Along its ventral edge the wall of the branchial sac is continuous externally
                    with the mantle (fig. 5, <hi rend="italic">B</hi>), while internally it is
                    thickened to form two parallel longitudinal folds bounding a groove, the
                    “endostyle,” hypobranchial groove, or ventral furrow (figs. 4, 5, <hi
                    rend="italic">end).</hi> The endoderm cells which line the endostyle are greatly
                    enlarged at the bottom and on parts of the sides of the furrow so as to form
                    projecting pads, which bear very long cilia. It is generally supposed that this
                    organ is a gland for the production of the mucous secretion which is spread
                    round the edges of the branchial sac and catches the food particles in the
                    passing current of water; but it has recently been pointed out that there are
                    comparatively few gland cells in the epithelium of the endostyle, and that it is
                    more probable that this furrow is merely a ciliated path along which the mucous
                    secretion (produced possibly by the subneural gland) is conveyed posteriorly
                    along the ventral edge of the branchial sac. At its anterior end the edges of
                    the endostyle become continuous with the right and left halves of the posterior
                    of two circular ciliated ridges,—the peripharyngeal bands,— which run parallel
                    to one another round the front of the branchial sac. The dorsal ends of the
                    posterior peripharyngeal band bend posteriorly (enclosing the epibranchial
                    groove), and then join to form the anterior end of a fold which runs along the
                    dorsal edge of the branchial sac as far as the oesophageal aperture. This fold
                    is the dorsal lamina (figs. 4, 5, <hi rend="italic">dl</hi>). It probably serves
                    to direct the stream of food particles entangled in a string of mucus from the
                    anterior part of the dorsal lamina to the oesophagus. In many Ascidians this
                    organ, instead of being a continuous membranous fold as in <hi rend="italic">A.
                    mentula,</hi> is represented by a series of elongated triangular processes—the
                    dorsal languets,—one attached in the dorsal median line opposite to each
                    transverse vessel of the branchial sac. The anterior peripharyngeal band is a
                    complete circular ridge, having no connexion with either the endostyle or the
                    dorsal lamina. In front of it lies the prebranchial zone, which separates the
                    branchial sac behind from the branchial siphon in front. The prebranchial zone
                    is bounded anteriorly by a muscular band—the posterior edge of the sphincter
                    muscle,—which bears a circle of long delicate processes, the tentacles (figs. 4,
                    7, 8, <hi rend="italic">tn).</hi> These project inwards at right angles so as to
                    form a network across the entrance to the branchial sac. Each tentacle consists
                    of connective tissue covered with epithelium<pb break="no"

                    which are continuous with blood sinuses in the mantle. In the dorsal median line
                    near the anterior end of the body, and imbedded in the mantle on the ventral
                    surface of the nerve ganglion, there lies a small glandular mass—the subneural
                    gland—which, as Julin has shown (<hi rend="italic">24</hi>), there is reason to
                    regard as the homologue of the <hi rend="italic">hypophysis cerebri</hi> of the
                    vertebrate brain. Julin and E. van Beneden have suggested that the function of
                    this organ may possibly be renal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Hancock, communicates anteriorly, as Ussoff (<hi rend="italic">23</hi>) pointed
                    out, by means of a narrow duct with the front of the branchial sac (pharynx).
                    The opening of the duct is enlarged to form a funnel-shaped cavity, which may be
                    folded upon itself, convoluted, or even broken up into a number of smaller
                    openings, so as to form a complicated projection, called the dorsal tubercle,
                    situated in the dorsal part of the prebranchial zone (fig. 7). The dorsal
                    tubercle in <hi rend="italic">A. mentula</hi> is somewhat horse-shoe-shaped
                    (fig. 8); it varies in form in most Ascidians according to the genus and
                    species, and in some cases in the individual also. Possibly, besides being the
                    opening of the duct from the subneural gland, it may be a sense-organ for
                    testing the quality of the water entering the branchial sac.</p>
                <p>The single elongated ganglion in the median dorsal line of the mantle between the
                    branchial and atrial siphons is the only nerve-centre in <hi rend="italic">A.
                    mentula</hi> and most other <hi rend="italic">Tunicata.</hi> It is the
                    degenerate remains of the anterior part of the cerebro-spinal nervous system of
                    the tailed larval Ascidian (see below, p. 614). The posterior or spinal part has
                    entirely disappeared in most <hi rend="italic">Tunicata.</hi> It persists,
                    however, in the <hi rend="italic">Appendiculariidae,</hi> and traces of it are
                    found in some Ascidians (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clavelina</hi>; see Julin). The ganglion gives off distributory nerves at both
                    ends, which run through the mantle to the neighbourhood of the apertures, where
                    they divide and subdivide. The only sense-organs are the pigment spots between
                    the branchial and atrial lobes, the tentacles at the base of the branchial
                    siphon, and possibly the dorsal tubercle and the languets or dorsal lamina.
                    These are all in a lowly developed condition. The larval Ascidians on the other
                    hand have well-developed intra-cerebral optic and auditory sense-organs; and in
                    some of the pelagic <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> otocysts and pigment spots
                    are found in connexion with the ganglion.</p>
                <p>The mouth and the pharynx (branchial sac) have already been described. The
                    remainder of the alimentary canal is a bent tube which in <hi rend="italic">A.
                    mentula</hi> and most other Ascidians lies imbedded in the mantle on the left
                    side of the body, and projects into the peribranchial cavity. The oesophagus
                    leaves the branchial sac in the dorsal middle line near the posterior end of the
                    dorsal lamina (see fig. 4, oe <hi rend="italic">a).</hi> It is a short curved
                    tube which leads ventrally to the large fusiform thick-walled stomach. The
                    intestine emerges from the ventral end of the stomach, and soon turns
                    anteriorly, then dorsally, and then posteriorly so as to form a curve—the
                    intestinal loop—open posteriorly. The intestine now curves anteriorly again, and
                    from this point runs nearly straight forward as the rectum, thus completing a
                    second curve—the rectal loop—open anteriorly (see fig. 4). The wall of the
                    intestine is thickened internally, to form the typhlosole, a pad which runs
                    along its entire length. The anus opens into the dorsal part of the
                    peribranchial cavity near to the atrial aperture. The walls of the stomach are
                    glandular; and a system of delicate tubules with dilated ends, which ramifies
                    over the outer wall of the intestine and communicates with the cavity of the
                    stomach by means of a duct, is probably a digestive gland.</p>
                <p>A mass of large clear vesicles which occupies the rectal loop, and may extend
                    over the adjacent walls of the intestine, is a renal organ without a duct. Each
                    vesicle is the modified remains of a part of the primitive coelom or
                    body-cavity, and is formed of cells which eliminate nitrogenous waste matters
                    from the blood circulating in the neighbouring blood-lacunae and deposit them in
                    the cavity of the vesicle, where they form a concentrically laminated concretion
                    of a yellowish or brown colour. These concretions contain uric acid, and in a
                    large Ascidian are very numerous. The nitrogenous waste products are thus
                    deposited and stored up in the renal vesicles in place of being excreted from
                    the body. In other Ascidians the renal organ may differ from the above in its
                    position and structure; but in no case has it an excretory duct, unless the
                    subneural gland is to be regarded as a renal organ.</p>
                <p>The heart is an elongated fusiform tube placed on the ventral and posterior edge
                    of the stomach, in a space (the pericardium) which is part of the original
                    coelom or bodycavity, the rest of which exists merely in the form of lacunae and
                    of the cavities of the reproductive organs and renal vesicles in the adult
                    Ascidian. The wall of the heart is formed of a layer of epithelio-muscular
                    cells, the inner ends of which are cross-striated; and waves of contraction pass
                    along it from end to end, first for a certain number of beats in one direction
                    and then in the other, so as to reverse the course of circulation periodically.
                    At each end the heart is continued into a vessel (see fig. 9), a large sinus or
                    lacuna lined with a delicate endothelial layer. The sinus leaving the ventral
                    end of the heart is called the branchio-cardiac vessel,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On account of the periodic reversal of the
                    circulation none of the vessels can he called arteries or veins.</p></note> and
                    the heart itself is merely the differentiated posterior part of this sinus and
                    is therefore a ventral vessel. The branchio-cardiac vessel, after giving off a
                    branch which, along with a corresponding branch from the cardio-visceral vessel,
                    goes to the test, runs along the <pb break="no"

                    the endostyle, and communicates laterally with the ventral ends of all the
                    transverse vessels of the branchial sac. The sinus leaving the dorsal end of the
                    heart is called the cardio-visceral vessel, and this, after giving off to the
                    test the branch above mentioned, breaks up into a number of sinuses, which
                    ramify over the alimentary canal and the other viscera. These visceral lacunae
                    finally communicate with a third great sinus, the viscero-branchial vessel,
                    which runs forward along the dorsal edge of the branchial sac externally to the
                    dorsal lamina and joins the dorsal ends of all the transverse vessels of the
                    branchial sac. Besides these three chief systems there are numerous lacunae in
                    all parts of the body, by means of which anastomoses are established between the
                    different currents of blood. All these blood spaces and lacunae are to be
                    regarded as derived from the blastocoele of the embryo, and not, as has been
                    usually supposed, from the coelom (<hi rend="italic">30</hi>). When the heart
                    contracts ventro-dorsally, the course of the circulation is as follows: the
                    blood which is flowing through the vessels of the branchial sac is collected in
                    an oxygenated condition in the branchio-cardiac vessel, and, after receiving a
                    stream of blood from the test, enters the heart. It is then propelled from the
                    dorsal end of the heart into the cardio-</p>
                <p>visceral vessels, and so reaches the test and digestive and other organs; then,
                    after circulating in the visceral lacunae, it passes into the viscero-branchial
                    vessel in an impure condition, and is distributed to the branchial vessels to be
                    purified again. When the heart on the other hand contracts dorso-ventrally, this
                    course of circulation is reversed. As the test receives a branch from each end
                    of the heart, it follows that it has afferent and efferent vessels whichever way
                    the blood is flowing. In some Ascidians the vessels in the test become very
                    numerous and their end branches terminate in swollen bulbs close under the outer
                    surface of the test. In this way an accessory respiratory organ<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Herdman, <hi
                    rend="italic">Nature,</hi> vol. xxxi. p. 247.</p></note> is probably formed in
                    the superficial layer of the test. The blood corpuscles are chiefly colourless
                    and amoeboid; but in most if not all Ascidians there are also some pigmented
                    corpuscles in the blood. These are generally of an orange or reddish brown tint,
                    but may be opaque white, dark indigo-blue, or of intermediate colours. Precisely
                    similarly pigmented cells are found throughout the connective tissue of the
                    mantle and other parts of the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A. mentula</hi> is hermaphrodite, and the reproductive organs
                    lie, with the alimentary canal, on the left side of the body. The ovary is a
                    ramified gland which occupies the greater part of the intestinal loop (see fig.
                    4). It contains a cavity which, along with the cavities of the testis, is
                    derived from a part of the original coelom, and the ova are formed from its
                    walls and fall when mature into the cavity. The oviduct is continuous with the
                    cavity of the ovary and leads forwards alongside the rectum, finally opening
                    near the anus into the peribranchial cavity. The testis is composed of a great
                    number of delicate branched tubules, which ramify over the ovary and the
                    adjacent parts of the intestinal wall. Those tubules terminate in ovate
                    swellings. Near the commencement of the rectum the larger tubules unite to form
                    the vas deferens, a tube of considerable size, which runs forwards alongside the
                    rectum, and, like the oviduct, terminates by opening into the peri branchial
                    cavity close to the anus. The lumen of the tubules of the testis, like the
                    cavity of the ovary, is a part of the original coelom, and the spermatozoa are
                    formed from the cells lining the wall. In some Ascidians reproductive organs are
                    present on both sides of the body, and in others (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Polycarpa)</hi> there are many complete sets of both male and female systems,

                <p>In most Ascidians the eggs are fertilized in the peribranchial cavity, and
                    undergo most of their development before leaving the parent; in some cases,
                    however, the eggs are laid, and fertilization takes place in the surrounding
                    water. The segmentation is complete and regular (fig. 10, A) and results in the
                    formation of a spherical blastula, which then undergoes invagination (fig. 10,
                    B). The embryo elongates, and the blastopore or invagination opening comes to be
                    placed on the dorsal edge near the posterior end (fig. 10, C). The hypoblast
                    cells lining the archenteron are columnar in form, while the epiblast cells are
                    more cubical (fig. 10, B, C, D). The dorsal surface of the embryo now becomes
                    flattened and then depressed to form a longitudinal groove, extending forwards
                    from the blastopore to near the front of the body. This “medullary groove” now
                    becomes converted into a closed canal by its side walls growing up, arching
                    over, and coalescing in the median dorsal line (fig. 10, D). This union of the
                    <hi rend="italic">laminae dorsales</hi> to form the neural canal commences at
                    the posterior end behind the blastopore and gradually extends forwards.
                    Consequently the blastopore comes to open into the posterior end of the neural
                    canal (fig. 10,</p>
                <p>D), while the anterior end of that cavity remains open to the exterior. In this
                    way the archenteron communicates indirectly with the exterior. The short canal
                    leading from the neural canal to the archenteron is known as the neurenteric
                    canal (fig. 10, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n635/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0635-0614"/> D, <hi rend="italic">nec).</hi> Previous to this
                    stage some of the hypoblast cells at the front edge of the blastopore and
                    forming part of the dorsal wall of the archenteron (fig. 10, C, <hi
                    rend="italic">ch)</hi> have become separated off, and then arranged to form an
                    elongated band, two cells wide, underlying the posterior half of the neural
                    canal (fig. 10, D, E, <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>.). This is the origin of the
                    notochord. Outgrowths from the sides of the archenteron give rise to laterally
                    placed masses of cells, which are the origin of the mesoblast. These masses show
                    no trace of metameric segmentation. The cavities (reproductive and renal
                    vesicles) which are formed later in the mesoblast represent the coelom.
                    Consequently the body-cavity of the <hi rend="italic">Tunicata</hi> is a
                    modified form of enterocoele. The anterior part of the embryo, in front of the
                    notochord, now becomes enlarged to form the trunk, while the posterior part
                    elongates to form the tail (fig. 10, E). In the trunk the anterior part of the
                    archenteron dilates to form the mesenteron, the greater part of which becomes
                    the branchial sac; at the same time the anterior part of the neural canal
                    enlarges to form the cerebral vesicle, and the opening to the exterior at the
                    front end of the canal now closes. In the tail part of the embryo the neural
                    canal remains as a narrow tube, while the remains of the wall of the
                    archenteron—the dorsal part of which becomes the notochord—are converted into
                    lateral muscle bands (fig. 10, G) and a ventral cord of cells, which eventually
                    breaks up to form blood corpuscles. As the tail grows longer, it becomes bent
                    round the trunk of the embryo inside the egg-membrane. About this period the
                    epiblast cells begin to form the test as a cuticular deposit upon their outer
                    surface. The test is at first devoid of cells and forms a delicate gelatinous
                    investment, but it shortly afterwards becomes cellular by the migration into it
                    of test cells formed by proliferation from the epiblast.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some of the first test cells are also
                    probably derived from the epithelium of the egg follicle.</p></note></p>
                <p>The embryo is hatched about two or three days after fertilization, in the form of
                    a tadpole-like larva, which swims actively through the sea by vibrating its long
                    tail. The anterior end of the body is provided with three adhering papillae
                    (fig. 10, F, <hi rend="italic">adp)</hi> in the form of epiblastic thickenings.
                    In the free-swimming tailed larva the nervous system, formed from the walls of
                    the neural canal, becomes considerably differentiated. The anterior part of the
                    cerebral vesicle remains thin-walled (fig. 10, F), and two unpaired sense organs
                    develop from its wall and project into the cavity. These are a dorsally and
                    posteriorly placed optic organ, provided with retina, pigment layer, lens, and
                    cornea, and a ventrally placed auditory organ, consisting of a large spherical
                    partially pigmented otolith, attached by delicate hair-like processes to the
                    summit of a hollow <hi rend="italic">crista acoustica</hi> (fig. 10, F, <hi
                    rend="italic">au).</hi> The posterior part of the cerebral vesicle thickens to
                    form a solid ganglionic mass traversed by a narrow central canal. The wall of
                    the neural canal behind the cerebral vesicle becomes differentiated into an
                    anterior thicker region, placed in the posterior part of the trunk and having a
                    superficial layer of nerve fibres, and a posterior narrower part which traverses
                    the tail, lying on the dorsal surface of the notochord, and gives off several
                    pairs of nerves to the muscles of the tail. Just in front of the anterior end of
                    the nervous system a dorsal involution of the epiblast breaks through into the
                    upturned anterior end of the mesenteron and thus forms the mouth opening. Along
                    the ventral edge of the mesenteron, which becomes the branchial sac, the
                    endostyle is formed as a narrow groove with thickened side walls. It probably
                    corresponds to the median portion of the thyroid body of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi> A curved outgrowth from the posterior end of the mesenteron
                    forms the alimentary canal (oesophagus, stomach, and intestine), which at first
                    ends blindly. An anus is formed later by the intestine opening into the left of
                    two lateral epiblastic involutions (the atria), which rapidly become larger and
                    fuse dorsally to form the peribranchial cavity. Outgrowths from the wall of the
                    branchial sac meet these epiblastic involutions and fuse with them to give rise
                    to the first formed pair of stigmata, which thus come to open into the
                    peribranchial cavity; and these alone correspond to the gill clefts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphiοxus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>After a short free-swimming existence the fully developed tailed larva fixes
                    itself by its anterior adhering papillae to some foreign object, and then
                    undergoes a remarkable series of retrogressive changes, which convert it into
                    the adult Ascidian. The tail atrophies, until nothing is left but some fatty
                    cells in the posterior part of the trunk. The adhering papillae disappear and
                    are replaced functionally by a growth of the test over neighbouring objects. The
                    nervous system with its sense organs atrophies until it is reduced to the single
                    small ganglion, placed on the dorsal edge of the pharynx, and a slight nerve
                    cord running for some distance posteriorly (Van Beneden and Julin). Slight
                    changes in the shape of the body and a further growth and differentiation of the
                    branchial sac, peribranchial cavity, and other organs now produce gradually the
                    structure found in the adult Ascidian.</p>
                <p>The most important points in connexion with this process of development and
                    metamorphosis are the following. (1) In the Ascidian embryo all the more
                    important organs <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> notochord, neural canal,
                    archenteron) are formed in essentially the same manner as they are in <hi
                    rend="italic">Amphioxus</hi> and other <hi rend="italic">Chordata.</hi> (2) The
                    free-swimming tailed larva possesses the essential characters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chordata,</hi> inasmuch as it has a longitudinal skeletal axis
                    (the notochord) separating a dorsally placed nervous system (the neural canal)
                    from a ventral alimentary canal (the archenteron); and therefore during this
                    period of its life-history the animal belongs to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chordata.</hi> (3) The Chordate larva is more highly organized than the adult
                    Ascidian, and therefore the changes by which the latter is produced from the
                    former may be regarded as a process of degeneration (<hi rend="italic">31</hi>).
                    The important conclusion drawn from all this is that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata</hi> are the degenerate descendants of a group of the primitive <hi
                    rend="italic">Chordata</hi> (see below p. 618).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Classification and Characters of Groups.</hi></p>
                <p>Order I.—LARVACEA.</p>
                <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms provided with a large locomotory appendage (the
                    tail), in which there is a skeletal axis (the urochord).</p>
                <p>A relatively large test (the “Haus”) is formed with great rapidity as a secretion
                    from the ectoderm; it is merely a temporary structure, which is cast off and
                    replaced by another. The branchial sac is simply an enlarged pharnyx with two
                    ventral ciliated openings (stigmata) leading to the exterior. There is no
                    separate peribranchial cavity. The nervous system consists of a large dorsally
                    placed ganglion and a long nerve cord, which stretches backwards over the
                    alimentary canal to reach the tail, along which it runs on the left side of the
                    urochord. The anus opens ventrally on the surface of the body in front of the
                    stigmata. No reproduction by gemmation or metamorphosis is known in the
                    life-history.</p>
                <p>This is one of the most interesting groups of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> as it shows more completely than any of the rest the characters
                    of the original ancestral forms. It has undergone little or no degeneration, and
                    consequently corresponds more nearly to the tailed-larval condition than to the
                    adult forms of the other groups. The order includes a single family, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Appendiculariidae,</hi> all the members of which are minute and
                    free-swimming. They occur on the surface of the sea in most parts of the world.
                    They possess the power to form with great rapidity an enormously large investing
                    gelatinous layer (fig. 11), which corresponds to the test of other groups. This
                    was first described by Von Mertens and by him named “Haus.” It is only loosely
                    attached to the body and is frequently thrown off soon after its formation. The
                    tail in the <hi rend="italic">Appendiculariidae</hi> is attached to the ventral
                    surface of the body (fig. 12), and usually <pb break="no"

                    traces of metameric segmentation, having its muscle bands broken up into
                    myotomes, while the nerve cord presents a series of enlargements from which
                    distributary nerves are given off (fig. 12, <hi rend="italic">ng").</hi> Near
                    the base of the tail there is a distinct elongated ganglion (fig. 12, <hi
                    rend="italic">ng').</hi> The anterior (cerebral) ganglion has connected with it
                    an otocyst, a pigment spot, and a tubular process opening into the branchial sac
                    and representing the dorsal tubercle and associated parts of an ordinary
                    Ascidian. The branchial aperture or mouth leads into the branchial sac or
                    pharynx. There are no tentacles. The endostyle is short. There is no dorsal
                    lamina, and the peripharyngeal bands run dorsally and posteriorly. The wall of
                    the branchial sac has only two ciliated apertures. They are homologous with the
                    }&gt;rimary stigmata of the typical Ascidians and the gill clefts of
                    Vertebrates. They are placed far back on the ventral surface, one on each side
                    of the middle line, and lead into short funnel-shaped tubes which open on the
                    surface of the body behind the anus (fig. 12, <hi rend="italic">at).</hi> These
                    tubes correspond to the right and left atrial involutions which, in an ordinary
                    Ascidian, fuse to form the peribranchial cavity. The heart, according to
                    Lankester, is formed of two cells, which are placed at the opposite ends and
                    connected by delicate contractile protoplasmic fibrils. The large ovary and
                    testis are placed at the posterior end of the body. The remainder of the
                    structural details can be made out from fig. 12.</p>
                <p>The family <hi rend="italic">Appendiculariidae</hi> comprises the genera,— <hi
                    rend="italic">Oikopleura</hi> (Mertens), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appendicularia</hi> (Cham.), in both which the body is short and compact and

                    >Fritillaria</hi> (Q. and G.), in which the body is long and composed of
                    anterior and posterior regions, the tail relatively short, the endostyle

                    rend="italic">Kowalevskia</hi> (Fol), a remarkable form described by Fol (<hi
                    rend="italic">14),</hi> in which the heart, endostyle, and intestine are said to
                    be absent, while the branchial sac is provided with four rows of ciliated
                    tooth-like processes.</p>
                <p>Order II.—THALIACEA.</p>
                <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms which may be either simple or compound, and the adult
                    of which is never provided with a tail or a notochord. The test is permanent and
                    may be either well developed or very slight. The musculature of the mantle is in
                    the form of more or less complete circular bands, by the contraction of which
                    locomotion is effected. The branchial sac has either two large or many small
                    apertures, leading to a single peribranchial cavity, into which the anus opens.
                    Alternation of generations occurs in the lifehistory, and may be complicated by
                    polymorphism. The <hi rend="italic">Thaliacea</hi> comprises two groups, <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyclomyaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hemimyaria.</hi></p>
                <p>Sub-order 1.—Cyclomyaria.</p>
                <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms which exhibit alternation of generations in their
                    life-history but never form permanent colonies. The body is cask-shaped, with
                    the branchial and atrial apertures at the opposite ends. The test is more or
                    less well developed. The mantle has its musculature in the form of circular
                    bands surrounding the body. The branchial sac is fairly large, occupying the
                    anterior half or more of the body. Stigmata are usually present in its posterior
                    part only. The peribranchial cavity is mainly posterior to the branchial sac.
                    The alimentary canal is placed ventrally close to the posterior end of the
                    branchial sac. Hermaphrodite reproductive organs are placed ventrally near the
                    intestine.</p>
                <p>This group forms one family, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Doliolidae,</hi> including
                    two genera, <hi rend="italic">Doliohum</hi> (Quoy and Gaimard) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Anchinia</hi> (C. Vogt).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Doliolum,</hi> of which several species are known from various
                    seas, has a cask-shaped body, usually from 1 to 2 cm. in length. The terminal
                    branchial and atrial apertures (fig. 13) are lobed, and the lobes are provided
                    with sense organs. The test is very slightly developed and contains no cells.
                    The mantle has eight or nine circular muscle bands surrounding the body. The
                    most anterior and posterior of these form the branchial and atrial sphincters.
                    The wide branchial and atrial apertures lead into large branchial and
                    peribranchial cavities, separated by the posterior wall of the branchial sac,
                    which is pierced by stigmata; consequently there is a free passage for the water
                    through the body along its long axis, and the animal swims by contracting its
                    ringlike muscle-bands, so as to force out the contained water posteriorly.
                    Stigmata may also be found on the lateral walls of the branchial sac, and in
                    that case there are corresponding anteriorly directed diverticula of the
                    peribranchial cavity. There is a distinct endostyle on the ventral edge of the
                    branchial sac and a peripharyngeal band surrounding its anterior end, but there
                    is no representative of the dorsal lamina on its dorsal edge. The oesophagus
                    commences rather on the ventral edge of the posterior end of the branchial sac,
                    and runs backwards to open into the stomach, which is followed by a curved
                    intestine opening into the peribranchial cavity. The alimentary canal as a whole
                    is to the right of the middle line. The hermaphrodite reproductive organs are to
                    the left of the middle line alongside the alimentary canal. They open into the
                    peribranchial cavity. The ovary is nearly spherical, while the testis is
                    elongated, and may be continued anteriorly for a long distance. The heart is
                    placed in the middle line ventrally, between the posterior end of the endostyle
                    and the oesophageal aperture. The nerve ganglion lies about the middle of the
                    dorsal edge of the body, and gives off many nerves. Under it is placed the
                    subneural gland, the duct of which runs forward and opens into the anterior end
                    of the branchial sac by a simple aperture, surrounded by the spirally twisted
                    dorsal end of the peripharyngeal band (fig. 13, <hi rend="italic">dt).</hi></p>
                <p>The ova of the sexual generation produce tailed larvae; these develop into forms
                    known as “nurses” (blastozooids), which are asexual, and are characterized by
                    the possession of nine muscle bands, an auditory sac on the left side of the
                    body, a ventrally-placed stolon near the heart, upon which buds are produced,
                    and a dorsal outgrowth near the posterior end of the body. The buds give rise
                    eventually to the sexual generation, which is polymorphous, having three
                    distinct forms, in two of which the reproductive organs remain undeveloped. The
                    buds while still very young migrate from their place of origin on the stolon,
                    divide by fission, and become attached to the dorsal outgrowth of the body of
                    the nurse, where they develop. The three forms produced are as follows. (1)
                    Nutritive forms (trophozooids), which remain permanently attached to the nurse
                    and serve to provide it with food; they have the body elongated dorso-ventrally,
                    and the musculature is very slightly developed. (2) Foster forms (phorozooids),
                    which, like the preceding, do not become sexually mature, but, unlike them, are
                    set free as cask-shaped bodies with eight muscle bands and a ventral outgrowth,
                    which is formed of the stalk by which the body was formerly united to the nurse.
                    On this outgrowth the (3) forms (gonozooids) which become sexually mature are
                    attached while still young buds, and after the foster forms are set free these
                    reproductive forms gradually attain their complete development, and are
                    eventually set free and lose all trace of their connexion with the foster forms.
                    They resemble the foster forms in having a cask-shaped body with eight muscle
                    bands, but differ in having no outgrowth or process, and in having the
                    reproductive organs fully developed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    body of the unknown nurse. The body is elongated dorso-ventrally. The test is
                    well developed and contains branched cells. The musculature is not so well
                    developed as in <hi rend="italic">Doliolum.</hi> There are two circular bands at
                    the anterior end and two at the posterior, and two on the middle of the body.
                    The stigmata are confined to the obliquely placed posterior end of the branchial
                    sac. The alimentary canal forms a U-shaped curve. The reproductive organs are
                    placed on the right side of the body. The life-history is still imperfectly
                    known. As in the case of <hi rend="italic">Doliolum</hi> the sexual generation
                    is polymorphous, and has three forms, two of which remain in a rudimentary
                    condition so far as the reproductive organs are concerned. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anchinia,</hi> however, the three forms do not occur together on one stolon or
                    outgrowth, but are produced successively, the reproductive forms of the sexual

                <p>Free-swimming pelagic forms which exhibit alternation of generations in their

                    apertures nearly terminal. The test is well developed. The musculature of the

                    the interior of the body, opening externally by the branchial and atrial
                    apertures, and traversed obliquely from the dorsal and anterior end to the
                    ventral and posterior by a long narrow vascular band, which represents the

                    edge of the branchial sac of an ordinary Ascidian. The alimentary canal is
                    placed ventrally. It may either be stretched out so as to extend for some
                    distance anteriorly, or—as is more usual—be concentrated to form along with the
                    reproductive organs a rounded opaque mass near the posterior end of the body,
                    known as the visceral mass or “nucleus.” The embryonic development is direct, no

                <p>This sub-order contains two very distinct families, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Salpidae,</hi> which are the typical members, and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Octacnemidae,</hi> including a single very remarkable form <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Octacnemus bythius),</hi> which in some respects does not conform with the
                    characters given above.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Salpidae</hi> includes the single genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salpa</hi> (Forskål), which, however, may be divided into two well-marked
                    groups of species,—(1) those, such as <hi rend="italic">S. pinnata,</hi> in
                    which the alimentary canal is stretched out along the ventral surface of the
                    body, and (2) those, such as <hi rend="italic">S. fusiformis</hi> (fig. 14, A),
                    in which the alimentary canal forms a compact globular mass, the “nucleus,” near
                    the posterior end of the body. About fifteen species altogether are known; they
                    are all pelagic forms and are found in nearly all seas. Each species occurs in
                    two forms—the solitary asexual (<hi rend="italic">proles solitaria)</hi> and the
                    aggregated sexual <hi rend="italic">(proles gregaria)—</hi> which are usually
                    quite unlike one another. The solitary form (fig. 14, B) gives rise by internal
                    gemmation to a complex tubular stolon, which contains processes from all the
                    more important organs of the parent body and which becomes segmented into a
                    series of buds or embryos. As the stolon elongates, the embryos near the free
                    end which have become advanced in their development are set free in groups,
                    which remain attached together by processes of the test, each enclosing a
                    diverticulum from the mantle so as to form “chains” (fig. 15). Each member of
                    the chain is a <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi> of the sexual or aggregated form,
                    and when mature may—either still attached to its neighbours or separated from
                    them (fig. 14, A)— produce one or several embryos, which develop into the
                    solitary <hi rend="italic">Salpa.</hi> Thus the two forms alternate regularly.
                    The more important points in the structure of a typical <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salρa</hi> are shown in fig. 16. The branchial and atrial apertures are at
                    opposite ends of the body, and each leads into a large cavity, the branchial and
                    peribranchial sacs, which are in free communication at the sides of the
                    obliquely-running dorsal lamina or “gill.” The test is well developed and
                    adheres closely to the surface of the mantle. The muscle bands of the mantle do
                    not completely encircle the body. They are present dorsally and laterally, but
                    the majority do not reach the ventral surface. In many cases neighbouring bands
                    join in the median dorsal line, (fig. 14). The anterior end of the dorsal lamina
                    is prolonged to form a prominent tentacular organ, the languet, projecting into
                    the branchial sac. The nerve ganglion, subneural gland, dorsal lamina,
                    peripharyngeal bands, and endostyle are placed in the usual positions. A pigment
                    spot and an otocyst are found in connection with the ganglion. The large spaces
                    at the sides of the dorsal lamina (often called the gill or branchia of <hi
                    rend="italic">Salpa),</hi> by means of which the cavity of the branchial sac is
                    placed in free communication with the peribranchial cavity, are to be regarded
                    as gigantic stigmata formed by the suppression of the lateral walls of the
                    branchial sac. Fig. 16 represents an aggregated or sexual <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salpa</hi> which was once a member of a chain, since it shows a testis and a
                    developing embryo. The ova (always few in number, usually only one) appear at a
                    very early period in the developing chain <hi rend="italic">Salpa,</hi> while it
                    is still a part of the gemmiparous stolon in the body of the solitary <hi
                    rend="italic">Salpa.</hi> This gave rise to the view put forward by Brooks (<hi
                    rend="italic">25</hi>), that the ovary really belongs to the solitary <hi
                    rend="italic">Salρa,</hi> which is therefore a female producing a series of
                    males by asexual gemmation, and depositing in each of these an ovum, which will
                    afterwards, when fertilized, develop in the body of the male into a solitary or
                    female <hi rend="italic">Salpa.</hi> This idea would of course entirely destroy
                    the view that <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi> is an example of alternation of
                    generations. The sexual or chain <hi rend="italic">Salpa,</hi> although really
                    hermaphrodite, is always protogynous: <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., the female
                    elements or ova are produced at an earlier period than the male organ or testis.
                    This prevents self-fertilization. The ovum is fertilized by the spermatozoa of
                    an older <hi rend="italic">Salpa</hi> belonging to another chain, and the embryo
                    is far advanced in its development before the testis is formed. At an early
                    period in its development a part of the embryo becomes separated off, along with
                    a part of the wall of the cavity in which it lies, to form the “placenta,” in
                    which the embryonic and the maternal blood streams circulate in close proximity
                    (or actually coalesce during one period) and so allow of the passage of
                    nutriment to the developing embryo. At a somewhat later stage a number of cells
                    placed at the posterior end of the body alongside the future nucleus become
                    filled up with oil-globules to form a mass of nutrient material—the
                    elaeoblast—which is used up later on in the development. Many suggestions have
                    been made as to the homology of the elaeoblast. The most probable is that it -is
                    the disappearing rudiment of the tail found in the larval condition of most
                    Ascidians.</p>
                <p>The family <hi rend="italic">Octacnemidae</hi> includes the single remarkable
                    form <hi rend="italic">Octacnemus bythius,</hi> found during the “Challenger”
                    expedition, and first described by Moseley <hi rend="italic">(29).</hi> It is
                    apparently a deep-sea representative of the pelagic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salpidae,</hi> and may possibly be fixed. The body is somewhat discoid, with
                    its margin prolonged to form eight tapering processes, on to which the muscle
                    bands of the mantle are continued. The alimentary canal forms a compact nucleus
                    (fig. 17); the endostyle is very short; and the dorsal lamina is apparently
                    absent. The reproduction and life-history are entirely unknown.</p>
                <p>Order III.—ASCIDIACEA.</p>
                <p>Fixed or free-swimming Simple or Compound Ascidians which in the adult are never
                    provided with a tail and have no trace of a notochord. The free-swimming forms
                    are colonies, the Simple Ascidians being always fixed. The test is permanent and
                    well developed; as a rule it increases with the age of the individual. The
                    branchial sac is large and well developed. Its walls are perforated by numerous
                    slits (stigmata) opening into the peribranchial cavity, which communicates with
                    the exterior by the atrial aperture. Many of the forms reproduce by gemmation,
                    and in most of them the sexually-produced embryo develops into a tailed
                    larva.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ascidiacea</hi> includes three groups,—the Simple
                    Ascidians, the Compound Ascidians, and the free-swimming colonial <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrosoma.</hi></p>
                <p>Sub order 1.—Ascidiae Simplices.</p>
                <p>Fixed Ascidians which are solitary and very rarely reproduce by gemmation; if
                    colonies are formed, the members are not buried in a common investing mass, but
                    each has a distinct test of its own. No strict line of demarcation can be drawn
                    between the Simple and the Compound Ascidians, and one of the families of the
                    former group, the <hi rend="italic">Clavelinidae</hi> (the Social Ascidians),
                    forms a transition from the typical Simple forms, which never reproduce by
                    gemmation, to the Compound forms, which always do (see p. 618 below). The <hi

                    :—</p>

                    reproduce by gemmation to form small colonies in which each ascidiozooid has a

                <p>Buds formed on stolons which are vascular outgrowths from the posterior end of

                    four-lobed. Branchial sac longitudinally folded; stigmata straight; tentacles
                    simple or compound. This family is divided into three sections :—</p>
                <p>Sub-family 1.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Styelinae,</hi> not more than four folds on

                <p>Sub-family 3. — <hi rend="smallcaps">Bolteninae,</hi> more than eight folds in
                    branchial sac; tentacles compound; body pedunculated (fig.</p>
                <p>18, A). The chief genera are— <hi rend="italic">Boltenia</hi> (Savigny),
                    branchial aperture four-lobed, stigmata normal; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Culeohus</hi> (Herd-man), branchial aperture with less than four lobes,
                    stigmata absent or modified (fig. 18, B). This last is a deep-sea genus
                    discovered by the “Challenger” expedition (see z7).</p>
                <p>Family IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Molgulidae.</hi> Solitary Ascidians, sometimes
                    not fixed; branchial aperture six-lobed, atrial four-lobed. Test usually
                    incrusted with sand. Branchial sac longitudinally folded; stigmata more or less
                    curved, usually arranged in spirals; tentacles compound. The chief genera are—
                    <hi rend="italic">Molgula</hi> (Forbes), with distinct folds in the branchial
                    sac, and <hi rend="italic">Eugyra</hi> (Ald. and Hanc.), with no distinct folds,
                    but merely broad internal longitudinal bars in the branchial sac. In some of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Molgulidae</hi> (genus <hi rend="italic">Anurella,</hi>
                    Lacaze-Duthiers, <hi rend="italic">20)</hi> the embryo does not become converted
                    into a tailed larva, the development being direct, without metamorphosis. The
                    embryo when hatched assumes gradually the adult structure, and never shows the
                    features characteristic of larval Ascidians, such as the urochord and the median
                    sense-organs.</p>
                <p>Sub-order 2. —Ascidiae Compositae.</p>
                <p>Fixed Ascidians which reproduce by gemmation, so as to form colonies in which the
                    ascidiozooids are buried in a common investing mass and have no separate tests.
                    This is probably a somewhat artificial assemblage formed of two or three groups
                    of Ascidians which produce colonies in which the ascidiozooids are so intimately
                    united that they possess a common test or investing mass. This is the only
                    character which distinguishes them from the <hi rend="italic">Clavelinidae,</hi>
                    but the property of reproducing by gemmation separates them from the rest of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae Simplices.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae
                    Compositae</hi> may be divided into the following families :—</p>
                <p>Family I.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Distomidae.</hi> Ascidiozooids divided into two
                    regions, thorax and abdomen; testes numerous; vas deferens not spirally coiled.
                    The chief genera are— <hi rend="italic">Distoma</hi> (Gaertner); <hi
                    rend="italic">Distaplia</hi> (Della Valle); <hi rend="italic">Colella</hi>
                    (Herdman), forming a pedunculated colony (see fig.</p>
                <p>19, A) in which the ascidiozooids develop incubatory pouches, connected with the
                    peribranchial cavity, in which the embryos undergo their development (z7); and
                    <hi rend="italic">Chondrostachys</hi> (Macdonald).</p>
                <p>Family II.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Coelocormidae.</hi> Colony not fixed, having a
                    large axial cavity with a terminal aperture. Branchial apertures five-lobed.
                    This includes one species, <hi rend="italic">Coelocormus huxleyi</hi> (Herdman),
                    which is a transition form between the ordinary Compound Ascidians (<hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., Distomidae)</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae
                    Salpiformes (Pyrosoma).</hi></p>
                <p>Family III.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Didemnidae.</hi> Colony usually thin and
                    incrusting Test containing stellate calcareous spicules. Testis single, large;
                    vas deferens spirally coiled. The chief genera are— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Didemnum</hi> (Savigny), in which the colony is thick and fleshy and there are
                    only three rows of stigmata on each side of the branchial sac; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptoclinum</hi> (Milne-Edwards), in which the colony is thin and
                    incrusting (fig. 19, B) and there are four rows of stigmata on each side of the
                    branchial sac.</p>
                <p>Family IV.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Diplosomidae.</hi> Test reduced in amount,
                    rarely containing spicules. Vas deferens not spirally coiled. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Diplosoma</hi> (Macdonald), the most important genus, the larva is
                    gemmiparous.</p>
                <p>Family V.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Polyclinidae.</hi> Ascidiozooids divided into
                    three regions,—thorax, abdomen, and post-abdomen. Testes numerous; vas deferens
                    not spirally coiled. The chief genera are— <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pharyngo-dictyon</hi> (Herdman), with stigmata absent or modified, containing
                    one species, <hi rend="italic">Ph. mirabile</hi> (fig. 19, C), the only Compound
                    Ascidian known from a depth of 1000 fathoms; <hi rend="italic">Polyclinum</hi>
                    (Savigny), with a smooth-walled stomach; <hi rend="italic">Aplidium</hi>
                    (Savigny), with the stomach wall longitudinally folded; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amaroucium</hi> (Milne-Edwards), in which the ascidiozooid has a long
                    post-abdomen and a large atrial languet.</p>
                <p>Family VI.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Botryllidae.</hi> Ascidiozooids having the
                    intestine and reproductive organs alongside the branchial sac. Dorsal lamina
                    present; internal longitudinal bars present in branchial sac. The chief genera
                    are— <hi rend="italic">Botryllus</hi> (Gaertn. and Pall.), with simple stellate
                    systems (fig. 19, D), and <hi rend="italic">Botrylloides</hi> (Milne-Edwards),
                    with elongated or ramified systems.</p>
                <p>Family VII.— <hi rend="smallcaps">Polystyelidae.</hi> Ascidiozooids not grouped
                    in systems. Branchial and atrial apertures four-lobed. Branchial sac may be
                    folded; internal longitudinal bars present. The chief genera are— <hi
                    rend="italic">Thylacium</hi> (Carus), with ascidiozooids projecting above
                    general surface of colony; <hi rend="italic">Goodsiria</hi> (Cunningham), with
                    ascidiozooids completely imbedded in investing mass; and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chorizo-cormus</hi> (Herdman), with ascidiozooids united in little groups which
                    are connected by stolons. The last genus contains one species, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ch. reticulatus,</hi> a transition form between the other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polystyelidae</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Styelinae</hi> amongst Simple
                    Ascidians.</p>
                <p>The methods of reproduction by gemmation differ in their details in the various
                    groups of Compound Ascidians; but in all cases the process is essentially a
                    giving off from the parent body of groups of cells representing the ectoderm,
                    the mesoderm, and the endoderm, which develop into the corresponding layers of
                    the bud. The first ascidiozooid of the colony produced by the tailed larva does
                    not form sexual reproductive organs, but reproduces by gemmation so as to make a
                    colony. Thus there is alternation of generations in the lifehistory. In the most
                    completely formed colonies (<hi rend="italic">e.g., Botryllus)</hi> the
                    ascidiozooids are arranged in groups (systems or coenobii), and in each system
                    are placed with their atrial apertures towards one another, and all
                    communicating with a common cloacal cavity which opens to the exterior in the
                    centre of the system (fig. 19 D).</p>
                <p>Sub-order 3.—Ascidiae Salpiformes.</p>
                <p>Free-swimming pelagic colonies having the form of a hollow cylinder closed at one
                    end. The ascidiozooids forming the colony are imbedded in the common test in
                    such a manner that the branchial apertures open on the outer surface and the
                    atrial apertures on the inner surface next to the central cavity of the colony.
                    The ascidiozooids are produced by gemmation from a rudimentary larva (the
                    cyathozooid) developed sexually.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0639-0618"/>
                <p>This sub-order includes a single family, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pyrosomidae,</hi> containing one well-marked genus, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrosoma</hi> (Péron), with several species. They are found swimming near the
                    surface of the sea, chiefly in tropical latitudes, and are brilliantly
                    phosphorescent. A fully developed <hi rend="italic">Pyrosoma</hi> colony may be
                    from an inch or two to upwards of four feet in length. The shape of the colony
                    is seen in fig. 20. It tapers slightly towards the closed end, which is rounded.
                    The opening at the opposite end is reduced in size by the presence of a
                    membranous prolongation of the common test (fig. 20, B). The branchial apertures
                    of the ascidiozooids are placed upon short papillae projecting from the general
                    surface, and most of the ascidiozooids have long conical processes of the test
                    projecting outwards beyond their branchial apertures (figs. 20, 21, and 22).
                    There is only a single layer of ascidiozooids in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrosoma</hi> colony, as all the fully developed ascidiozooids are placed with
                    their anteroposterior axes at right angles to the surface and communicate by
                    their atrial apertures with the central cavity of the colony (fig. 21).</p>
                <p>Their dorsal surfaces are turned towards the open end of the colony. The more
                    important points in the structure of the ascidiozooid of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pyrosoma</hi> are shown in fig. 22. A circle of tentacles, of which one, placed
                    ventrally (fig. 22, <hi rend="italic">tn</hi>), is larger than the rest, is
                    found just inside the branchial aperture.</p>
                <p>From this point a wide cavity, with a few circularly-placed muscle bands running
                    round its walls, leads back to the large branchial sac, which occupies the
                    greater part of the body. The stigmata are elongated transversely and crossed by
                    internal longitudinal bars. The dorsal lamina is represented by a series of
                    eight languets (Z). The nerve ganglion (on which is placed a small pigmented
                    sense organ), the subneural gland, the dorsal tubercle, the peripharyngeal
                    bands, and the endostyle are placed in the usual positions. On each side of the
                    anterior end of the branchial sac, close to the peripharyngeal bands, is a mass
                    of rounded gland cells which are the source of the phosphorescence. The
                    alimentary canal is placed posteriorly to the branchial sac, and the anus opens
                    into a large peribranchial (or atrial) cavity, of which only the median
                    posterior part is shown <hi rend="italic">(pbr)</hi> in fig. 22. The
                    reproductive organs are developed in a diverticulum of the peribranchial cavity,
                    and consist of a lobed testis and a single ovum at a time. The development takes
                    place in a part of the peribranchial cavity (fig. 21, <hi rend="italic"
                    >em).</hi> The segmentation is meroblastic, and an elongated embryo is formed on
                    the surface of a mass of yolk. The embryo, after the formation of an alimentary
                    cavity, a tubular nervous system, and a pair of laterally placed atrial tubes,
                    divides into an anterior and a posterior part. The anterior part then segments
                    into four pieces, which afterwards develop into the first ascidiozooids of the
                    colony, while the posterior part remains in a rudimentary condition, and was
                    called by Huxley the “cyatho-zooid”; it eventually atrophies. As the four
                    ascidiozooids increase in size, they grow round the cyathozooid and soon
                    encircle it (fig. 21, <hi rend="italic">asc</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cy</hi>).
                    The cyathozooid absorbs the nourishing yolk upon which it lies, and distributes
                    it to the ascidiozooids by means of a heart and system of vessels which have
                    been meanwhile formed. When the cyathozooid atrophies and is absorbed, its
                    original atrial aperture remains and deepens to become the central cavity of the
                    young colony, which now consists of four ascidiozooids placed in a ring, around
                    where the cyathozooid was, and enveloped in a common test. The colony gradually
                    increases by the formation of buds from these four original ascidiozooids.</p>

                    offshoot from the ancestral forms which gave rise to the two lines of

                    ancestral process is repeated at the present day when the free-swimming larva of

                    >Proto-Ascidiacea,</hi> after the change, are probably most nearly represented
                    by the existing genus <hi rend="italic">Clavelina.</hi> They have given rise
                    directly or indirectly to the various groups of Simple and Compound Ascidians
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Pyrosomidae.</hi> These groups form two lines, which
                    appear to have diverged close to the position of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clavelinidae.</hi> The one line leads to the more typical Compound Ascidians,
                    and includes the <hi rend="italic">Polyclinidae, Distomidae, Didemnidae,
                    Diplosomidae, Coelocormidae,</hi> and finally the <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae

                    which are, therefore, not closely allied to the other Compound Ascidians. The

                    gemmation was retained by the <hi rend="italic">Clavelinidae</hi> and by the
                    typical Compound Ascidians <hi rend="italic">(Distomidae,</hi> &amp;c. ) derived
                    from them. The power of forming colonies by budding was lost, however, by the
                    primitive Simple Ascidians, and must, therefore, have been regained
                    independently by the ancestral forms of the <hi rend="italic">Botryllidae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Polystyelidae.</hi> If this is a correct
                    interpretation of the course of evolution of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tunicata,</hi> we arrive at the following important conclusions. (1) The <hi
                    rend="italic">Tunicata,</hi> as a whole, form a degenerate branch of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ProtoChordata;</hi> 2) the <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae Salpiformes
                    (Pyrosoma)</hi> are much more closely related to the typical Compound Ascidians
                    than to the other pelagic <hi rend="italic">Tunicata,</hi> viz., the <hi
                    rend="italic">Larvacea</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Thaliacea</hi>; and (3)
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ascidiae Compositae</hi> form a polyphyletic group, the
                    sections of which have arisen at several distinct points from the ancestral
                    Simple Ascidians.</p>
