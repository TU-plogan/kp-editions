                    celebrated canons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Equality of Taxation.—</hi> The subjoined passage from Adam
                    Smith contains the germs of several distinct theories of what constitutes just
                    or equal taxation:—</p>
                <p>“The subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of its
                    government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities,
                    that is, in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the
                    protection of the state. The expense of government to the individuals of a great
                    nation is like the expense of management to the joint tenants of a great estate,
                    who are all obliged to contribute in proportion to their respective interests in
                    the estate. In the observation or neglect of this maxim consists what is called
                    the equality or inequality of taxation. Every tax, it must be observed once for
                    all, which falls finally upon one only of the three sorts of revenue
                    above-mentioned [viz., rent, wages, profits] is necessarily unequal in so far as
                    it does not affect the other two. In the following examination of different
                    taxes I shall seldom take much further notice of this sort of inequality, but
                    shall in most cases confine my observations to that inequality which is
                    occasioned by a particular tax falling unequally upon that particular sort of
                    private revenue which is affected by it.” The first sentence implies (a) that
                    every Government has the <hi rend="italic">right</hi> to exact contributions for
                    its support from all its subjects. According to this view, the right of taxation
                    is derived directly from the conception of sovereignty. It was the determination
                    to insist on this principle which led to the retention of the 3d. per lb duty on
                    tea, that “figment of a tax, that peppercorn rent,” which lost the British their
                    American colonies. The Americans opposed to this absolute doctrine the maxim
                    that taxation ought to be coincident with <hi rend="italic"
                    >representation,—</hi> that only those who shared in the powers should have the
                    burdens of government. If the latter opinion is strictly construed it would
                    follow that all taxes on articles of universal consumption are unjust except in
                    a country where all who have the natural have also the legal capacity of voting.
                    The doctrine of sovereignty as the basis of taxation, pushed to its logical
                    extreme, results in the maxim that a Government should impose such taxes as are
                    “most easily assessed and collected, and are at the same time most conducive to
                    the public interests” (M <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Culloch). Just as a
                    general looks to the efficiency of his army as a whole, and is prepared to
                    sacrifice any portion if necessary, so, it may be said, the state should not
                    regard the particular interests of individuals, but should rather consider the
                    nation as an organism, or, to adopt older phraseology, a leviathan. So far as
                    the political <hi rend="italic">existence</hi> of a state is concerned, this
                    view seems to meet with general acquiescence even in modern times, when
                    patriotism is often classed amongst the doubtful virtues, but no ideal of a
                    perfect state has yet met with such acceptance in any nation as to render
                    popular a complete neglect of private interests.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, a second basis of taxation (6) is found in the expansion of the term
                    “abilities” used by Adam Smith, which leads to the position that taxes ought to
                    be levied so as to involve <hi rend="italic">equality of sacrifice</hi> on the
                    part of the contributors. This is the ideal of taxation which was advocated by
                    Mill and Fawcett. “Equality of taxation as a maxim of politics,” says the
                    former, “means equality of sacrifice. It means the apportioning the contribution
                    of each person towards the expenses of government, so that he shall feel neither
                    more nor less inconvenience from his share of the payment than every other
                    person experiences from his.” It is admitted that this standard cannot be
                    completely realized, but it is thought to furnish a proper foundation of
                    remission in some cases and of proportional increase of taxation in others. It
                    is generally on this ground that it is proposed to leave incomes below a certain
                    amount untaxed,—a plan which, so far as direct taxes are concerned, has been
                    adopted in the United Kingdom. It is clear, however, that any taxes on
                    commodities in general use must infringe this canon, whilst the distinction
                    between “necessaries” and “luxuries,” as Adam Smith pointed out, is difficult to
                    draw in communities advancing in civilization; and certainly a considerable
                    portion of the taxes on stimulants is, as a matter of fact, derived from persons
                    whose incomes are below what is generally considered a reasonable minimum for
                    the standard of comfort, and such persons would probably consider enforced
                    abstinence a greater sacrifice than the payment of a direct tax. It is also
                    principally on the ground of equality of sacrifice that the proposal for
                    graduated or progressive taxation rests. It is argued that a person with
                    &lt;£10,000 a year can pay 10 per cent, (for example) as easily as a person with
                    £1000 can pay 5 per cent. It is to be observed that the principle of equality of
                    sacrifice regards the payment of taxes as duty imposed on the subjects of a
                    state independently of the advantages they may derive individually from the
                    expenditure of the amount levied.</p>
                <p>A third basis of taxation, however, is found in the principle (c) that taxes
                    ought to be considered as <hi rend="italic">payment for valuable services</hi>
                    rendered by the state to individuals, and this seems to be the position Adam
                    Smith had in view <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n97/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0097-0086"/> in introducing the clause “under the protection
                    of the state,” and in comparing the individuals of a great nation to the joint
                    tenants of a great estate. It is easy to show, as Mill does, that, if protection
                    is taken in its narrowest signification, as a matter of fact the poor need more
                    protection than the rich, but the argument becomes more plausible, and more
                    consonant with the general teaching of Mill, if stress is laid on the protection
                    and assistance afforded by the state in the process of acquisition of individual
                    fortunes—a view of taxation sometimes called the <hi rend="italic">social
                    dividend theory (cf.</hi> Walker, Helferich). It is really on this ground that
                    Mill proposes that the “unearned increment” from land should be taken by the
                    state, and, as has often been pointed out, “unearned increments” are by no means
                    confined to land. Without much exaggeration the state may be regarded as a
                    partner in all industrial undertakings, and is therefore entitled to a share in
                    the proceeds. In a somewhat similar manner, poor rates, education rates,
                    &lt;tc., have been regarded as of the nature of insurance paid by the rich
                    against the carelessness of the poor. The principle under consideration has been
                    generally applied in cases in which the service rendered by the state and the
                    benefit accruing to individuals are easily discovered and estimated, especially
                    in connexion with local taxation.</p>
                <p>The object of taxation is in general to provide the state with an adequate
                    revenue, but in all cases the indirect effects are important, and sometimes
                    provision of revenue is considered of secondary importance. Accordingly it has
                    been maintained (&lt;7) that the state ought to use its powers of taxation for
                    the promotion of various <hi rend="italic">social ends.</hi> Adam Smith remarks
                    that “it has for some time past been the policy of Great Britain to discourage
                    the consumption of spirituous liquors, on account of their supposed tendency to
                    ruin the health and corrupt the morals of the common people,” and in our own
                    times the falling off in the revenue from alcoholic drinks often furnishes a
                    subject for apparent congratulation in “budget” speeches. German writers with
                    socialistic tendencies <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Wagner) have emphasized
                    this social point of taxation; and Mill, although disapproving of graduated
                    taxation of income, advocated the imposition of extremely heavy succession
                    duties, with the object of promoting a better distribution of national wealth
                    and compelling individuals to rely on themselves. Many nations again have
                    imposed duties on imports with the view of protecting and encouraging home
                    industries, and most of the import duties levied in England before the great
                    reforms of Peel were of this nature. Accordingly, both theoretically and
                    practically, the promotion of social or moral ends may be considered as a fourth
                    basis of taxation. It is worth noticing that in early times the fines received
                    in the courts of justice were an important source of revenue.</p>
                <p>V hatever basis of taxation be adopted, the elementary principle of justice
                    noticed in the conclusion of A. Smith’s first canon must be considered. If it is
                    just to tax A, it is just to tax B under precisely similar circumstances. Thus
                    stated, the principle seems almost formal, but for practical purposes small
                    differences in circumstances may be neglected, and it is clear that in any great
                    nation the taxpayers may be arranged in a limited number of groups, within each
                    of which the constituent individuals may be regarded as similarly situated. A
                    tax on rent, or wages, or profits would be obviously unequal if those in one
                    place or employment were taxed while those in another were left free. The
                    practical difficulty is to discover what cases may fairly be regarded as
                    similar, especially if equality of sacrifice be taken as the ideal.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, in every civilized community a complex system of taxation is
                    adopted, the different parts of which rest in different degrees upon the various
                    principles just noticed. Some taxes are justified on the grounds of their
                    convenience to the sovereign power, and others are increased or diminished in
                    certain cases in accordance with the principle of equality of sacrifice; some
                    are regarded as payments for services rendered by the state, others partake of
                    the nature of sumptuary regulations or are approved on various social or moral
                    grounds; and sometimes the imposition of one productive tax involves, on the
                    ground of simple equality, the adoption of similar taxes which are hardly worth
                    collecting.</p>
                <p>The remaining canons of Adam Smith are partly, like the first, ethical in
                    character partly purely economic. Of the second—the canon of <hi rend="italic"
                    >certainty—</hi> Adam Smith remarks :— “The time of payment, the manner of
                    payment, the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the
                    contributor and to every other person [on the ground of the otherwise arbitrary
                    powers which are given to the taxgatherer] .... The certainty of what each
                    individual ought to pay is in taxation a matter of so great importance that a
                    very considerable degree of inequality, it appears, I believe, from the
                    experience of all nations, is not near so great an evil as a very small, degree
                    of uncertainty.” Perhaps the best example of the infringement of this canon is
                    furnished by the taxes levied from the miserable provincials by their Roman
                    governors.</p>
                <p>The third rule—the canon of <hi rend="italic">convenience—</hi> which enjoins
                    that “every tax ought to be levied at the time or in the manner to which it is
                    most likely to be convenient for the contributor to pay it,” may be justified,
                    not merely on general grounds of good government, but also on the special
                    economic ground of the increase in the productiveness of taxes which satisfy the
                    condition. It has been found possible to raise a considerable revenue by taxes
                    on commodities, the payments of which by the consumers are made in insensible
                    portions, when it would have been impossible to collect the same amount by
                    direct taxation at comparatively long intervals. Taxation is in this respect
                    like bleeding.</p>
                <p>The fourth rule—the canon of <hi rend="italic">economy—</hi> states as its
                    general principle that “every tax ought to be so contrived as both to take out
                    and to keep out of the pockets of the people as little as possible over and
                    above what it brings into the public treasury of the state.” Taxes may,
                    according to Adam Smith, break this rule by requiring a large number of
                    officials for their collection, by restraint of trade and production, by
                    encouraging smuggling, and by causing unnecessary vexation; “and, though
                    vexation is not, strictly speaking, expense, it is certainly equivalent to the
                    expense at which every man would be willing to redeem himself from it.” On
                    smuggling Adam Smith elsewhere remarks that “to pretend to have any scruple
                    about buying smuggled goods would in most countries be regarded as one of those
                    pedantic pieces of hypocrisy which serve only to expose the person who affects
                    to practise them to the suspicion of being a greater knave than his neighbours.”
                    It may be observed that in practical politics it is generally taken for granted
                    that a tax which can be evaded will be evaded, and indirect methods of taxation
                    are to a great extent devices by which possibilities of evasion are
                    restricted.</p>
                <p>To these general rules of taxation explicitly given by Adam Smith, the following
                    may be added, most of which are implied in different passages of his treatment
                    of taxation, but have been expounded and emphasized by subsequent writers. A
                    convenient summary is given by Helferich in Schönberg’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Handbuch der Politischen Oekonomie</hi> (vol. ii. p. 138). (a) A given amount
                    of revenue is, as a rule, both from the point of view of the Government and its
                    subjects, more conveniently raised from a small number <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0098-0087"/> of very productive taxes than from a larger
                    number with smaller returns per unit. This was one of the principal financial
                    reforms advocated by Adam Smith with reference to the customs duties, and has
                    been carried out in the United Kingdom by Sir Robert Peel and his successors.
                    The inextricable confusion of the customs duties levied before these reforms
                    were effected can only be realized by those who study the details of the history
                    of taxation. À similar process of simplification has been partially applied to
                    the direct taxes, but in many cases (especially in local taxation) the rule is
                    more honoured in the breach than in the observance. (6) A good system of
                    taxation ought to provide for a self-acting increase in the revenue in
                    proportion as the population and the consequent demands for governmental
                    expenditure increase. It has been found by experience that an old tax causes
                    less inconvenience than a new tax of smaller amount, a fact which is so striking
                    in some cases as to have given rise to the saying that an old tax is no tax. (c)
                    Those taxes are best which yield a steady and calculable return, instead of a
                    return fluctuating in character and difficult to estimate. (&lt;7) Those taxes
                    are best which in case of need can be most conveniently increased in amount. It
                    is this characteristic of the income tax which renders it so popular with
                    chancellors of the exchequer, and it was partly on this ground that Mr Gladstone
                    substituted a tax on beer for the tax on malt, (&lt;?) Regard must always be
                    paid to the real incidence of taxation, and care taken that the real burden of
                    the tax falls on those aimed at by the legislature. No part of the theory or
                    practice of taxation has given rise to so much controversy as the incidence of
                    particular taxes, a subject indeed of so much difficulty and importance as to
                    occupy the greater portion of the treatment by systematic writers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Incidence of Taxation.</hi> —Taxes are generally divided
                    into <hi rend="italic">direct</hi> and <hi rend="italic">indirect.</hi> A direct
                    tax is defined by Mill as one “demanded from the very persons who it is intended
                    or desired should pay it.” Others <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Culloch) define it as a tax taken directly from
                    income or capital. In the former definition non-transferable taxes on
                    expenditure would be included <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> a tax on livery
                    servants), but not in the latter. Mill’s definition has been generally adopted
                    (e.&lt;7., by Wagner, in the German <hi rend="italic">Handbuch,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    152); but in any case the most important direct taxes practically are those
                    levied on income or capital directly, and the most important indirect the
                    customs and excise duties. In examining the incidence of taxation the order of
                    arrangement adopted by Adam Smith seems best. He discusses separately taxes on
                    the three great species of income,—rent, profits, and wages (appending to the
                    articles on the first two an examination of taxes upon the capital value of
                    land, houses, and stock), and taxes intended to fall indifferently upon every
                    species of revenue, viz., capitation taxes and taxes upon consumable
                    commodities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxes on Pent.—</hi> What is commonly known as rent consists in
                    general of two parts, which may be termed economic rent and profit rent.
                    Economic rent arises from the superiority of advantage of any source in the
                    production of a certain amount of utility over the least productive source which
                    the conditions of demand and supply (including transmission to market) render it
                    possible to employ. Thus, in the production of food, some lands have an
                    advantage in fertility or situation; again, in furnishing amenities of
                    accommodation or facilities for business, some houses have from their situation
                    a similar advantage; and again, different processes in the arts and manufactures
                    are superior to others (giving rise to patents). In all these cases where the
                    amount of the superior sources is limited (naturally or artificially), and
                    recourse must be made to inferior sources of supply, economic rent is paid for
                    the superior advantage. Any tax imposed on this species of revenue falls on the
                    owner. If levied in the first instance from the lessee, he will pay so much less
                    rent, and any new taxes imposed during the currency of leases ought, if intended
                    to fall on the owner, to be taken directly from him. It may be assumed that
                    every owner of a superior source has exacted the highest price obtainable for
                    its use, so that he cannot transfer the tax to the tenant, nor through the
                    tenant to the consumer. If, for example, a tax is imposed on the economic rent
                    of agricultural land, the landlord cannot exact it from the tenant (for if the
                    tenant could afford more rent, why under competition was he not forced to do so
                    before ?) nor from the consumer of the produce, for the price is obviously
                    determined independently of rent. Similarly a tax on the ground rent of houses,
                    if it be assumed that the land is useless for other purposes, must fall on the
                    owners; although a certain portion will be transferred to the occupier if the
                    landlord could use it otherwise and escape the tax <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi>
                    Mill, bk. v. ch. iii. § 6). Taxes on economic rent of various kinds, so heavy as
                    to absorb the whole amount, have been advocated by some theorists on grounds
                    noticed under Adam Smith’s first canon. It is said they would impose no burden
                    on the state as a whole, that they would not affect production or accumulation,
                    and even that the substitution of the state for private owners—who are simply
                    <hi rend="italic">nati consumere fruges—</hi> w ould really increase the wealth
                    and power of the nation by compelling these unproductive consumers to work, and
                    by lightening the pressure of taxation on industry. It is, however, obvious that
                    the confiscation of rent would, seeing that land has for generations been in the
                    circle of exchangeable commodities, strike at the roots of the institution of
                    private property. Apart from this general objection, there would in the case of
                    agricultural land be great difficulty in separating economic from profit rent,
                    and any exceptional tax on the latter would obviously tend to check agricultural
                    improvements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxes on Profits.—</hi> Profits, as commonly used, is a term
                    embracing three elements which, from an economic and financial point of view,
                    are quite distinct in character, viz., interest (pure and simple), insurance
                    against risk, and earnings of management. The interest on capital in any
                    industrial area, lent on the same security, tends to equality. If, then, a tax
                    is imposed on <hi rend="italic">interest in every form,</hi> the incidence in
                    the first place will be on the owners of capital. But two indirect consequences
                    will follow. (1) As Adam Smith remarks, “the proprietor of stock is properly a
                    citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.
                    He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious
                    inquisition in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his
                    stock to some other country, where he could either carry on his business or
                    enjoy his fortune more at his ease.” In this case the ultimate result would be
                    that the country in which the tax was imposed would possess less capital, and
                    thus would yield a higher rate of interest sufficient to counterbalance the
                    burden of the tax. (2) The tax would tend to check the accumulation of capital
                    within the country, so far as the interest received is a cause of accumulation,
                    with the same ultimate result as in the former case. It must, however, be
                    observed that the rate of interest is only one of the causes affecting the
                    accumulation of capital.</p>
                <p>A tax on some <hi rend="italic">particular form of interest</hi> (security still
                    being supposed perfect), for example on mortgages on land, would obviously fall
                    on the borrowers. In the same way a tax on that part of the profit rent of
                    houses which is interest on capital tends to fall on the occupier. In general,
                    however, the security is more or less imperfect, and the insurance against risk
                    is allowed for in the rate of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n99/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0099-0088"/> interest charged on borrowed capital. Thus a tax
                    which took equal percentages from all species of interest would be in part a tax
                    on insurance against risk, and the tendency must be for such a tax to fall on
                    the borrowers of capital. Suppose at any time a perfect security yields 3 per
                    cent, and one with greater risk 6 per cent., then 3 per cent, represents the
                    estimated value of the insurance against risk. A tax which reduces the net yield
                    on the first to 2 per cent, would reduce the net yield on the latter to 4 per
                    cent. In order, then, for the insurance against risk to remain the same, the
                    rate yielded by the latter must rise from 6 to 7∣ per cent. It follows, then,
                    that a tax levied on all forms of interest (no allowance being made for risk)
                    would tend to check investment in proportion as risk was involved, and would
                    thus check industrial enterprise. This result would follow even although the
                    rate of interest on perfect security, owing to the causes mentioned above, were
                    raised in proportion to the tax.</p>
                <p>A tax on that part of profits known as earnings of management would, if imposed
                    generally, fall in the first instance on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >entrepreneurs</hi> or employers of capital, and with similar indirect
                    consequences to those just noticed in regard to interest. Capital would tend to
                    flow abroad, and accumulation would be checked, since in general the employers
                    of capital are also to a large extent the owners. So far as profits, in this
                    sense, are of the nature of rent (a view recently advocated as regards all
                    profits by Prof. Walker), a tax on profits -would be analogous to a tax on rent.
                    If the differences in the net advantages of different methods of employing
                    capital are supposed to remain constant (according to Prof. Marshall’s view of
                    earnings of management), a proportional tax on profits must be in part
                    transferred to the consumers of the articles produced, in the same way as a tax
                    on interest with risk was shown to fall on the borrower. It will be seen from
                    this general survey that the incidence and effects of a tax on profits (taking
                    the term in its common acceptation without analysis) are extremely difficult to
                    determine, and the practical difficulty is still greater than the theoretical.
                    For, as M ’ Culloch and others have shown, profits are always fluctuating and
                    difficult to estimate. So great, for example, is this difficulty felt to be as
                    regards farmers’ profits that in the income tax it is assumed that such profits
                    bear a certain proportion to the rent paid for land on a purely empirical rule,
                    which may happen to hit the mark in a majority of cases, but is much more likely
                    to be unequal and unjust in its operation.</p>
                <p>A tax on some particular form of profits (as distinct from a general tax on
                    profits) will, it is generally said, fall on the consumer of the article
                    produced, on the ground of the tendency of profits to equality. This view will
                    be noticed below under taxes on consumable commodities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxes on Capital.—</hi> In early English history taxes upon
                    capital of a very simple kind played an important part. A grant, for example, of
                    certain fractional parts of movables, commencing with the famous Saladin tithe
                    (on both rent and movables) in 1188, and gradually settling down to a fifteenth
                    for the counties and a tenth for the towns, prevailed for more than three
                    centuries. In 1334 a fifteenth and tenth was fixed at a certain sum for each
                    township, and after this date a grant of one or more “fifteenths and tenths”
                    meant simply a grant according to the scale then fixed (Dowell, vol. iii. p.
                    75). But in our own times taxes on capital are levied principally when property
                    changes hands, and may be divided, as they are by Adam Smith, according as they
                    are levied when property passes (a) from the dead to the living, (6) from the
                    living to the living.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, as regards incidence, that taxes of the first class (a) are the
                    most direct of all taxes, in the sense that they cannot be transferred to other
                    persons by the beneficiaries. The principal difficulties connected with the
                    “death duties,” as they are often called, arise in connexion with the canon of
                    equality of taxation. Opinion is still divided on the proportions which ought to
                    be paid by personal and real estate respectively, as well as on the advisability
                    of the taxes being made progressive according to the value of the property, and
                    there are still greater difficulties in connexion with life interests in settled
                    property. Mill was strongly in favour of making the death duties very heavy and
                    also graduated. “I conceive,” he says <hi rend="italic">(Pol. Econ.,</hi> bk. v.
                    ch. ii. § 3), “that inheritances and legacies exceeding a certain amount are
                    highly proper subjects for taxation, and that the revenue from these should be
                    made as great as it can be made without giving rise to evasions by donation
                    during life, or concealment of property, such as it would be impossible
                    adequately to check. The principle of graduation, that is, of levying a larger
                    percentage on a larger sum, though its application to general taxation would be
                    in my opinion objectionable, seems to me both just and expedient as applied to
                    legacy and inheritance duties.” The principal objections urged against such
                    taxation are, that a stimulus would be given to personal extravagance and a
                    check placed on accumulation, and that in consequence indirect production would
                    be lessened, partly by want of capital and partly by the check placed on
                    production on a large scale. As regards the want of capital, apart from the
                    check placed on saving, there would be a tendency to send it abroad. A heavy tax
                    on large capitals at home will place a premium on investments abroad, in which
                    evasion would be easy. Perhaps, with the present rate of accumulation, the
                    objection may be made light of, as it is by Mill; but the second, if less
                    obvious, is more important. All our great staple manufactures are necessarily
                    conducted on a large scale, and in many respects also large agricultural
                    capitals are most productive. In manufactures, as a rule, the larger the scale
                    of operations the more extended will be the division of labour in production,
                    and the greater the facilities for ready sale in foreign markets. Of all the
                    causes which contribute to our commercial prosperity, perhaps the most important
                    is the large scale on which our operations are conducted. We are able to employ
                    machinery where the foreigner, working on a smaller scale, is obliged to use
                    manual labour. There can be little doubt that graduated taxation, even on the
                    modified form proposed by Mill, would tend to check production on a large scale.
                    Indirectly it might artificially foster joint-stock companies. (6) Taxes on the
                    transference of property from the living to the living cannot, as Adam Smith
                    points out, be very easily taken directly, as such transactions for the most
                    part actually are or might be secret. This has led to the invention of stamp and
                    registration duties. The penalty of invalidity attaching to unstamped documents
                    of various kinds has proved a very effective deterrent to evasion. A tax on
                    sales will vary in its incidence according to the nature of the commodity and
                    the degree of competition or monopoly <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> H. Sidgwick’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Principles of Pol. Econ.,</hi> bk. ii. ch. x.). The most
                    important case is that of taxes on the transfer of land. Theoretically it seems
                    that, just as the farmer who takes land on rent offers more or less rent
                    according to the burdens imposed on the land by rates, &amp;c., so the purchaser
                    of land will consider any expenses connected with its acquisition as part of the
                    capital value, and thus any taxes on transfer will really fall on the sellers.
                    If, however, the taxes are imposed in such a way as to fall less heavily on land
                    when sold in larger than in small <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0100-0089"/> quantities, it is clear that the tendency will be
                    tor the differential portion of the tax at least to fall on the purchaser of a
                    small amount; and practically at present this feature is characteristic of the
                    English system. A tax on the transfer of stocks and shares is generally held to
                    fall on the seller, as in case of repeal he would obtain so much more; but in
                    this case the same considerations apply as in the case of interest noticed
                    above. A curious example of legal evasion is furnished by time-bargains; and the
                    imposition of the tax directly on the contracts of sale, instead of as at
                    present on the actual transfer, has been strongly urged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxes on Wages.—</hi> It is clear that the treatment of taxes
                    on wages will depend on the general view taken of the determination of the rate
                    of wages. Adam Smith appears to lay undue stress on the price of provisions, and
                    to think that in most cases taxes on wages must fall on the employer of labour
                    (bk. v. ch. ii. art. iii.). There seems, however, to be no sufficient reason why
                    a tax on labour should be transferred to the employer, except in the case where
                    the wages are really at a minimum below which the supply of efficient labour
                    could not be kept up. Even in this case, as Prof. Walker shows, there would
                    probably be a degradation of labour before the rise in wages was effected.
                    Certainly no practical statesman at the present time w 0uld venture to propose a
                    direct tax on wages, under the idea that it would be transferred to the
                    employer. In Germany it was found necessary to abandon the system, owing to the
                    hardship inflicted on the poor. At any rate, in all cases in which the rate of
                    wages is above the “necessary” minimum, a tax on wages must fall on the
                    labourer. A differential tax on some particular species of employment would,
                    unless it partook of the nature of a monopoly, tend to fall on the consumer of
                    the article produced or the person who enjoys the service rendered. In every
                    case, speaking generally, the incidence of the tax will depend on the conditions
                    of the demand and supply of the labour in question, and no further analysis can
                    be given without entering into the general principles governing wages. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wages.</hi><hi rend="italic">Capitation taxes</hi> are chiefly
                    of interest historically, as illustrated in England by the poll-taxes imposed at
                    various times. The income tax as at present levied is in reality not a single
                    uniform tax, as might at first sight appear, but a tax on the various species of
                    rent, interest, profits, and wages. The anomalies which arise from practically
                    taking income as uniform have often been pointed out and acknowledged, but the
                    authority of Mr Gladstone may be quoted in support of the view that the
                    practical difficulties in the way of a readjustment more in accordance with
                    theoretical principles are insuperable. The objections noted above to a
                    graduated property tax apply, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis,</hi> to a
                    graduated income tax, which appears, however, to find increasing favour on the
                    Continent. A full discussion of the anomalies of the income tax would involve a
                    repetition of the analysis of the taxes on the various species of income.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Taxes on Commodities.—</hi> The general principles applicable
                    in this case are that, where production takes place under free competition, the
                    tax will, owing to the tendency of profits to equality, be transferred to the
                    consumer, but that, when the article is practically monopolized, a tax must fall
                    on the monopolist, on the assumption that he has already fixed such a price for
                    the article as will, considering the law of demand and the expenses of
                    production, yield him a maximum revenue. The practical difficulties connected
                    with the assumption of equality of profits have been well exposed by Cliffe
                    Leslie <hi rend="italic">{Financial Deform; Cobden Club Essays,</hi> 2d series,

                <p>The incidence of export and import duties is peculiarly difficult to ascertain
                    even theoretically. The prevailing opinion that an import duty necessarily falls
                    on the consumer of the import necessarily involves as its counterpart the
                    position that an export duty must fall on the consumer of the export. If the
                    latter view is upheld it is curious that export duties find such little favour
                    with practical statesmen. It is clear, however, that the real incidence of
                    export and import duties will depend partly on the conditions of production in
                    various countries, partly on the variations in demand due to changes in price,
                    partly on the indirect influence on the general balance of trade, and partly on
                    the possibility of using substitutes for the article taxed <hi rend="italic"

                    limits assigned to this article. In conclusion, it may be pointed out that a
                    thorough investigation of the general principles of taxation must presuppose the
                    principles of political philosophy, whilst a full inquiry into the incidence of
                    particular species of taxes must presuppose the principles of political economy.
