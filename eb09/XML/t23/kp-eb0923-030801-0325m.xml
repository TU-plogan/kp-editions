                    twelve apostles. The synoptical Gospels give only his name, associating him in
                    their lists with Matthew (Mat. x. 3; Mark iii. 18; Luke vi. 15); in Acts i. 13
                    he is coupled with Philip. In the Gospel of John (xi. 16; xiv. 5; xx. 24 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi>; xxi. 2) he appears in a characteristic light, full of
                    personal devotion and ready to die with his Master, but slow to grasp the true
                    significance of the redeeming death of Jesus, and incredulous of the
                    resurrection till direct evidence convinces him of its truth and at the same
                    time of the Divinity of his risen Lord. John translates the Aramaic name or
                    surname Thomas (K01K∏) by the Greek equivalent Didymus (twin). Tradition has it
                    that he was the twin brother of a sister Lysia (his parents being Diophanes and
                    Rhoa, and his birthplace Antioch; “XII. Apost. Patriae,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chron. Pasch.,</hi> ii. 142), or of a brother Elieser <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(∕∕oto.</hi><hi rend="italic">Clem.,</hi> ii. 1), or, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta Thomae</hi> (ed. Bonnet, pp. 11, 23), of Jesus Himself. The
                    last form of the tradition seems to be derived from the name Judas Thomas, which
                    he bears in Edessene legend <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Eusebius, <hi
                    rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> i. 13, 10), and implies the identification of Thomas
                    with Judas, the brother of the Lord. The most ancient tradition makes Thomas the
                    evangelist of Parthia (Eus., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> iii. 1, 1); and at
                    Edessa, which claimed to possess his bones, it was related that their missionary
                    Thaddaeus (Eus., <hi rend="italic">If. E.,</hi> i. 13, 10), or Addai <hi
                    rend="italic">{Doctrine of Addai,</hi> ed. Phillips, 1876, p. 5), was sent to
                    them by him. Later tradition, originating with the Gnostic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta Thomae,</hi> and accepted by catholic teachers from the middle of the 4th
                    century, makes him proceed to India and there suffer martyrdom. The Indian king
                    Gundaphorus of the <hi rend="italic">Acta</hi> is, however, certainly identical
                    with the historical Gondophares (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol.
                    xviii. p. 603), whose dynasty was Parthian, though his realm included regions
                    loosely reckoned to India. The Parthian and Indian missions of Thomas may
                    perhaps therefore be regarded as derived from a single tradition. Later authors,
                    but not the <hi rend="italic">Acta,</hi> give as the scene of his martyrdom the
                    city of Calamine, which the modern Christians of St Thomas (see below) identify
                    with Mylapur, but which Gutschmid would connect with the Calama of Nearchus, on
                    the coast of Gedrosia, which was under the sceptre of Gondophares. Other names
                    of historical persons and places can be traced with more or less probability in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Acta,</hi> but these do not alter the utterly apocryphal
                    character of the legend, which indeed is in many respects easier to understand
                    if we accept the bold hypothesis of Gutschmid, that it was borrowed by the
                    Gnostic author from a Buddhist story of the conversion of Arachosia (A <hi

                    unknown personage is to be thought of as a collector of Gnostic “Acts of
                    Apostles,” rather than as the first author. In spite of extensive catholic
                    revision, they form one of the most interesting monuments of early Gnosticism.
                    Internal evidence assigns them with great probability to the school of
                    Bardesanes, and the very ancient allegorical hymn about the soul which is
                    inserted in the Syriac text (p. 274 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> Eng. tr., p. 238

                    Jerusalem, who is said to have led a Christian colony to Malabar in 345 <hi

                    tradition, St Thomas went from Malabar to Mylapur, now a suburb of Madras, where
                    the shrine of his martyrdom, rebuilt by the Portιιguese in 1547, still stands on
                    Mount St Thomas, and where a miraculous cross is shown with a Pahlavi
                    inscription which may be as old as the end of the 7th century. We know from
                    Cosmas Indopleustes that there were Christian churches of Persian (East-Syrian)
                    origin, and doubtless of Nestorian creed, in Ceylon, in Malabar, and at Caliana
                    (north of Bombay) before the middle of the 6th century, and even then St Thomas,
                    the reputed apostle of Persia, may have been their special saint. The ancient
                    churches of southern India never died out or wholly lost their sense of
                    connexion with their mother church, for we find them sending deputies in 1490 to
                    the Nestorian patriarch Simeon, who furnished them with bishops (Assemani, <hi
                    rend="italic">Bib. Or.,</hi> iii. 1, 590 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi> Hard pressed by the Moslems, they welcomed the approach of
                    the Portuguese, but proved by no means tractable to efforts to bring them within
                    the Roman obedience. At length a formal union with Rome was carried through in
                    the synod of Diamper (1599). Syriac was to remain the ecclesiastical language,
                    but the service books were corrected and purified from error. A century and a
                    half of foreign Jesuit rule followed, but the love of independence was not lost.
                    A great schism took place in 1653, and of 200,000 Christians of St Thomas only
                    400 remained loyal to Rome, though many of their churches were soon won back by
                    the Carmelites. Those who remained independent fell under the influence of the
                    Jacobite Mar Gregorius, styled patriarch of Jerusalem, who reached Malabar in
                    1665 as an emissary from Ignatius, patriarch of Antioch. From his time the
                    independent Christians have been Jacobites, the counter-efforts of the
                    Nestorians under Mar Gabriel, bishop of Adharbaijan, having apparently come to
                    nothing after his death in 1730. Since the visit of Claudius Buchanan, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Christian Researches in Asia</hi> (1811) excited great interest,
                    much has been done for the Christians of South India by English missionary
                    effort, and Anglicans have cultivated friendly relations with the clergy of the
                    independent native church, while discouraging dependence on the Jacobite
                    patriarch of Antioch.</p>
