                <p><label type="entry">TRICYCLE</label>. Though velocipedes were made and used more
                    than one hundred years ago, none were practically successful until the brothers
                    Starley constructed in 1876 the Coventry tricycle. One of the earliest
                    descriptions of a cycle occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris</hi> of
                    17th July 1779. Somewhat later M. Richard invented a machine driven by mechanism
                    almost identical with that of the modern omnicycle, but without the expanding
                    segments. Early in the 19th century the cranked axle worked by treadles and
                    levers came into fashion; then the heavy four-wheelers were preferred. All these
                    machines, however, laboured under three fatal defects: it was almost impossible
                    to drive them up-hill, to check them in going down-hill, and to prevent their
                    overturning in rounding a corner.</p>
                <p>It was the success of the early bicycle (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bicycle)</hi>
                    which suggested the belief that a serviceable tricycle could be made. One of
                    these bicycles was specially constructed for ladies, the hind wheel being placed
                    well on one side; but, though it could be ridden, it was not a commercial
                    success. The brothers Starley, by putting a second small wheel in front of the
                    large driving wheel and on the same side as the small hind wheel, gave stability
                    to the machine: it was steered by turning the small wheels opposite ways, and
                    driven by the large wheel by means of cranks and connecting rods. The same
                    machine with chain driving —the Coventry rotary—is still very largely used. In
                    1877 James Starley, it is believed without any knowledge of the gear used by
                    Fowler for traction engines, re-invented the same differential gear for
                    tricycles. By this the same force is, under all circumstances, applied to each
                    of two equal driving wheels, and the evil effects of driving a single wheel are
                    done away with. This gear was used in the original Salvo tricycle, which is the
                    type of the surest machine at the present day. In the early days of the modern
                    tricycle other designs were carried out, which have now become practically
                    obsolete. In one form the hind wheel of a bicycle was replaced by a pair of
                    equal wheels, one on each side, but the instability of such a construction was
                    fatal. In another, the Challenge, the two wheels were placed in front of the
                    large driver and turned together to steer the machine; stability was obtained by
                    putting the rider in front of the large wheel and lower down, the power being
                    communicated by cranks and connecting rods. But the weight of this machine and
                    the small proportion of the load on the driving wheel were serious defects.</p>
                <p>Single-driving rear-steerers were at this time very common, and, though highly
                    objectionable, are still to be seen. Rear-steerers were improved by making both
                    front wheels drivers and allowing for the overrunning of one or the other by
                    clutch, as in the Cheylesmore, or by ratchet driving; but steering by the hind
                    wheel is essentially wrong, and these machines are avoided by experienced
                    riders. Rear-steerers have, however, lately been made with a through axle and
                    differential gear (Rover), the rider being placed further back so as to increase
                    the load on the steering wheel; but the evil of rear-steering is only reduced,
                    not removed. The clutch is also employed on some front-steerers; and, though in
                    certain respects it has an advantage over the differential gear, for general use
                    it is not so suitable. The differential gear is an essential feature of the
                    modern tricycle.</p>
                <p>In 1878 Messrs Doubleday and Humber patented the Humber machine, which is both
                    driven and steered by the two front wheels, the rider being seated on a trailing
                    backbone and hind wheel as in the bicycle. This machine requires skill to
                    manage: the steering is at first difficult to control and a spill over the
                    handles is quite possible; under a skilful rider, however, the Humber is
                    generally recognized as one of the fastest machines. It is steered by a cross
                    handle, like the bicycle, and this method of steering, in spite of the fact that
                    it boxes the rider into the machine, is becoming very general in front steerers
                    in place of the rack and pinion steering hitherto in use. The Gripper is a very
                    popular example. The brake is an important feature in roadster tricycles. It is
                    always made to act on the box of the differential gear where that is used; but
                    in clutch or single-driven machines one or two independent band-brakes or
                    spoon-brakes are used.</p>
                <p>In early days the steering wheel was made small to save weight; the drivers were
                    often 50 inches or more in diameter; and the machine was as short as possible.
                    Owing to the discomfort attending a small wheel and a short base the tendency at
                    present is to increase the size of the steering wheel and the length of the
                    base, and to diminish the diameter of the drivers,—two notable examples being
                    the Quadrant and the Crescent. It is usual, especially when small driving wheels
                    are used, to gear the machine up, just as in the old days they were commonly
                    geared down; that is, the chain wheel on the crank axle has more or fewer teeth
                    than that on the wheel axle, and thus the wheels turn faster or slower than the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n579/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0579-0560"/> cranks, or are equivalent to larger or smaller
                    wheels. Two-speed gears are becoming general, among which may be especially
                    mentioned the Cryptodynamic. By means of these it is possible to change the gear
                    of the machine so as to have a high gear under favourable conditions and a low
                    gear when mud, wind, or an ascent make travelling difficult. Although chain
                    gearing is used in nearly every machine made, connecting rods, wheels, or bands
                    are fitted instead to some machines. The necessity for such mechanism has been
                    avoided by making the wheel axle also the treadle axle; but great instability is
                    the result.</p>
                <p>Machines in which the arms instead of the legs supply the power are made, and are
                    of immense service to those who have lost the use of their legs.</p>
                <p>Owing to the inconvenience caused by doorways being often too narrow to allow a
                    tricycle to pass through, many machines are made to fold up into a narrower
                    space or to shut up like a telescope.</p>
                <p>It is important that the rider should be so placed that he can, without leaning
                    forward, put most of his weight on the treadles, and this is more than ever
                    needed as the steepness of an ascent increases, because the slope of the machine
                    has a contrary effect. Sliding seats were arranged for this purpose; but Mr
                    Warner Jones has made use of a swinging frame which the rider can lock in any
                    position he pleases. It is this same swinging frame which gives such comfort to
                    the rider of the Otto bicycle, placing him at all times in the position most
                    suitable for the occasion.</p>
                <p>Carrier tricycles, in which due provision is made for the proper distribution of
                    the load, are largely used by the post-office and by tradesmen in their
                    business. The “Coventry chair” is a kind of bath chair driven as a tricycle by a
                    rider behind. When invalids have overcome a certain prejudice as to the danger
                    of this kind of vehicle, it will no doubt be more generally used.</p>
                <p>In machines for two riders the riders sit side by side <hi rend="italic"
                    >{sociables)</hi> or one is placed before the other (<hi rend="italic"
                    >tandems).</hi> Sociable machines are both front-steering and rear-steering.
                    Rear-steerers with each rider driving the wheel on his side only are nearly as
                    objectionable as the single-driving rear-steerer. Front-steering sociables with
                    differential gear are safe and comfortable; but all sociables are slow machines.
                    For nearly every make of single tricycle there is a corresponding tandem. The
                    Coventry rotary in the tandem form suffers more from the single-side driving
                    than in the single form, the rear-steering machines not so much, owing to the
                    greater weight which the steering wheel has to bear. The Humber is less
                    sensitive in the steering, owing to the greater moment of inertia of the frame
                    and the front rider. The front-steerer cannot be made safer, but an excellent
                    tandem is formed by placing the rear-rider on a trailing tail as in the Humber.
                    Tandems have an advantage over sociables and perhaps over single tricycles in
                    the matter of speed; they are, however, not quite so safe, and their appearance
                    alone prevents many from riding them. Many sociables and tandems are convertible
                    into single machines with but little trouble.</p>

                    of 1886 (certified by the National Cyclists' Union) will show the comparative
                    value of the bicycle and tricycle as racing machines.</p>
