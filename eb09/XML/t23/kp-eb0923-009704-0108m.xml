                <p><label type="entry">TEA</label>. This important food auxiliary, now in daily use
                    as a beverage by probably one-half of the population of the world, is prepared
                    from the leaves of one or more plants belonging to the natural order <hi
                    rend="italic">TernstVomiaceee.</hi> The order includes the well-known ornamental
                    genus of shrubs <hi rend="italic">Camellia,</hi> to which indeed the tea-plants
                    are so closely allied that by many systematic writers they are included in the
                    same genus. The tea-plants have been cultivated in China for at least a thousand
                    years.</p>
                <p>As is commonly the case with plants which have been long under cultivation, there
                    is much doubt as to specific distinctions among the varieties of tea. Under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Tlιea sinensis,</hi> Linnaeus originally described tea
                    as a single species; but with fuller knowledge of the Chinese plants he
                    established two species, <hi rend="italic">Thea Bohea</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thea viridis,</hi> and it was assumed that the former was the source of black
                    teas, while <hi rend="italic">Thea viridis</hi> was held to yield the green
                    varieties. In 1843, however, Mr Robert Fortune found that, although the two
                    varieties of the plant exist in different parts of China, black and green tea
                    are made indifferently from the leaves of the same plant. The teaplant is
                    cultivated in China as an evergreen shrub, which grows to a height of from 3 to
                    5 feet. The stem is bushy, with numerous and very leafy branches; the leaves are
                    alternate, large elliptical, obtusely serrated, veined, and placed on short
                    channelled foot-stalks. The calyx is small, smooth, and divided into five obtuse
                    sepals. The flowers are white, axillary, and slightly fragrant,—often two or
                    three together on separate pedicels. The corolla has from five to nine petals,
                    cohering at the base. The filaments are short, numerous, and inserted at the
                    base of the corolla; the anthers are large and yellow, the style trifid, and the
                    capsules three-celled and three-seeded.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">virûlis</hi> varieties are hardier, and possess larger and
                    brighter green leaves than belong to the <hi rend="italic">Bohea</hi> variety.
                    No strictly wild tea-plants have been discovered in China, but an indigenous
                    tea-tree <hi rend="italic">(Thea assamica)</hi> is found in Assam, which
                    botanists now incline to regard as the parent species of all cultivated
                    varieties. It differs in many respects from the Chinese plants. The indigenous
                    Assam tea-plant is a tree attaining a height of from 15 to 20 feet, growing in
                    the midst of dense moist jungle and in shady sheltered situations. Its leaves
                    vary considerably in size, form, and venation, being usually smooth, thick, and
                    leathery, lanceolate, ovate lanceolate, or oblong lanceolate. They are variously
                    dotted with pellucid cells containing essential oil, and the number of such
                    cells shown by the leaf is held to be an indication of the quality of tea it
                    will yield. The leaf of the Chinese plant never exceeds 4 inches in length,
                    while that of the Assam tree reaches <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0109-0098"/> 9 inches and upwards. The Chinese plant is hardy,
                    and capable of thriving under many different conditions of climate and
                    situation; while the indigenous plant is tender and difficult of cultivation,
                    requiring for its success a close, hot, moist, and equable climate. The
                    characteristic venation of the leaf of the Chinese tea-plant is delineated in
                    fig. 2. In minute structure the leaf presents highly characteristic appearances.
                    The under side of the young leaf is densely covered with fine one-celled
                    thick-walled hairs, about 1 mm. in length and <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 015
                    mm. in thickness. These hairs entirely disappear with increasing age. The
                    structure of the epidermis of the under side of the leaf, with its contorted
                    cells, is represented ( × 160) in fig. 3. A further characteristic feature of
                    the cellular structure of the tea-leaf is the abundance, especially in grown
                    leaves, of large, branching, thickwalled, smooth cells (idioblasts), which,
                    although they occur in other leaves, are not found in such as are likely to be
                    confounded with or substituted for tea. The minute structure of the leaf in
                    section is illustrated in fig. 4.</p>
                <p>The cultivated varieties of tea, being comparatively hardy, possess an
                    adaptability to climate excelled among food plants only by the wheat. The limits
                    of actual tea cultivation extend from 39° N. lat. in Japan, through the tropics,
                    to Java, Australia, Natal, and Brazil in the southern hemisphere. The tea-plant
                    will even live in the open air in the south of England, and withstand some
                    amount of frost, when it receives sufficient summer heat to harden its wood. But
                    comparatively few regions are suited for practical tea-growing.</p>
                <p>A rich and exuberant growth of the plants is a first essential of successful tea
                    cultivation. This is only obtainable in warm, moist, and comparatively equable
                    climates, where rains are frequent and copious. The climate indeed which favours
                    tropical profusion of jungle growth—still steaming heat—is that most favourable
                    for the cultivation of tea, and such climate, unfortunately, is most prejudicial
                    to the health of Europeans. It was formerly supposed that comparatively
                    temperate latitudes and steep sloping ground afforded the most favourable
                    situations for teaplanting, and much of the disaster which attended the early
                    stages of the tea enterprise in India is traceable to this erroneous conception.
                    Tea thrives best in light friable soils of good depth, through which water
                    percolates freely, the plant being specially impatient of marshy situations and
                    stagnant water. Undulating well-watered tracts, where the rain escapes freely,
                    yet without washing away the soil, are the most valuable for tea gardens. As a
                    matter of fact, many of the Indian plantations are established on hill-sides,
                    after the example of known districts in China, where hill slopes and odd corners
                    are commonly occupied with tea-plants.</p>
                <p>According to Chinese legend, the virtues of tea <hi rend="italic">(cha,</hi>
                    pronounced in the Amoy dialect <hi rend="italic">te,</hi> whence the English
                    name) were discovered by the mythical emperor Chin-nung, 2737 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> to whom all agricultural and medicinal knowledge is
                    traced. It is doubtfully referred to in the book of ancient poems edited by
                    Confucius, all of which are previous in date to 550 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> A tradition exists in China that a knowledge of tea travelled
                    eastward to and in China, having been introduced 543 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> by Bodhidharma, an ascetic who came from India on a missionary
                    expedition, but that legend is also mixed with mythical and supernatural
                    details. But it is quite certain, from the historical narrative of Lo Yu, who
                    lived in the Tang· dynasty (618— 906 A.D.), that tea was already used as a
                    beverage in the 6th century, and that during the 8th century its use had become
                    so common that a tax was levied on its consumption in the 14th year of Tih Tsung
                    (793). The use of tea in China in the middle of the 9th century is known from
                    Arab sources (Reinaud, <hi rend="italic">Relation des Voyages,</hi> 1845, p.
                    40). From China a knowledge of tea was carried into Japan, and there the
                    cultivation was established about the beginning of the 13th century. Seed was
                    brought from China by the priest Miyoye, and planted first in the south island,
                    Kiushiu, whence the cultivation spread northwards till it reached the high limit
                    of 39° N. To the south tea cultivation also spread into Tong-king and Cochin
                    China, but the product in these regions is of inferior quality. Till well into
                    the 19th century it may be said that China and Japan were the only two
                    tea-producing countries, and that the product reached the Western markets only
                    through the narrowest channels and under most oppressive restrictions.</p>
                <p>In the year 1826 the Dutch succeeded in establishing tea gardens in Java. At an
                    early period the East India Company of Great Britain, as the principal trade
                    intermediary between China and Europe, became deeply interested in the question
                    of tea cultivation in their Eastern possessions. In 1788 Sir Joseph Banks, at
                    the request of the directors, drew up a memoir on the cultivation of economic
                    plants in Bengal, in which he gave special prominence to tea, pointing out the
                    regions most favourable for its cultivation. About the year 1820 Mr David Scott,
                    one of the Company’s servants, sent to Calcutta from the district of Kuch Behar
                    and Rangpur—the very district indicated by Sir Joseph Banks as favourable for
                    teagrowing—certain leaves, with a statement that they were said to belong to the
                    wild tea-plant. The leaves were submitted to Dr Wallich, Government botanist at
                    Calcutta, who pronounced them to belong to a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Camellia,</hi> and no result followed on Mr Scott’s communication. These very
                    leaves ultimately came into the herbarium of the Linnean Society of London, and
                    have authoritatively been pronounced to belong to the indigenous Assam teaplant.
                    Dr Wallich’s attribution of this and other specimens <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0110-0099"/> subsequently sent in to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Camellia,</hi> although scientifically defensible, unfortunately
                    diverted attention from the significance of the discovery. It was not till 1834
                    that, overcome by the insistance of Captain Francis Jenkins, who maintained and
                    proved that, called by the name <hi rend="italic">Camellia</hi> or not, the
                    leaves belonged to a tea-plant, Dr Wallich admitted “the fact of the genuine
                    tea-plant being a native of our territories in Upper Assam as incontrovertibly
                    proved.” In the meantime a committee had been formed by Lord William Bentinck,
                    the governorgeneral, for the introduction of tea culture into India, and an
                    official had already been sent to the tea districts of China to procure seed and
                    skilled Chinese workmen to conduct operations in the Himalayan regions. The
                    discovery and reports of Captain Jenkins led to the investigation of the
                    capacities of Assam as a tea-growing country by Lord William Bentinck’s
                    committee. Evidence of the abundant existence of the indigenous tea-tree was
                    obtained; and the directors of the East India Company resolved to institute an
                    experimental establishment in Assam for cultivating and manufacturing tea,
                    leaving the industry to be developed by private enterprise should its
                    practicability be demonstrated. In 1836 there was sent to London 1 lb of tea
                    made from indigenous leaves; in 1837 5 lb of Assam tea was sent; in 1838 the
                    quantity sent was twelve small boxes, and ninety-five boxes reached London in
                    1839. In January 1840 the Assam Company was formed, and thenceforward the
                    cultivation of tea in India was carried on as a private commercial undertaking.
                    The tea districts of India include, in the order of their priority, Assam, Dehra
                    Dun, Kumaun, Darjiling, Cachar, Kangra, Hazaribagh, Chittagong, Tarai, and the
                    Nilgiris (Madras).</p>
                <p>Attempts were repeatedly made to introduce tea culture in Ceylon, under both
                    Dutch and British authority. No permanent success was attained till about 1876,
                    when the disastrous effects of the coffee-leaf disease induced planters to give
                    serious attention to tea. Since that period the tea industry has developed in
                    Ceylon with marvellous rapidity, and it has every prospect of taking the first
                    rank among Singalese productions. Tea-planting has also been successfully
                    established in Natal. But beyond the regions above enumerated the industry has
                    never taken root. It has been tried in the West Indies, the Southern States of
                    America, Brazil, Australia, and the south of Europe; but cheap labour is a <hi
                    rend="italic">sine qua non</hi> of success. Tea can be picked in China and the
                    British East Indies for two or three pence a day of wages, and it is on such
                    exceedingly moderate outlay that the margin of profit depends.</p>
                <p>Tea is more or less cultivated for local consumption in all provinces of China
                    except the extreme north, but the regions from which it is exported are embraced
                    within the provinces in the south-east—Kwang-tung, Full-keen, Keang-se,
                    Che-keang, Keang-su, and Gan-hwuy. Black-tea manufacture belongs to the more
                    southerly portion of these regions, the green-tea country lying to the north.
                    The methods employed in cultivating the plants and in making tea in China differ
                    widely in various districts, and the teas retained for native use—especially the
                    high-class fancy teas which are never seen abroad, and would probably not bear
                    exportation—undergo special manipulation. The teas exported are of three
                    principal classes—black tea, green tea, and brick tea.</p>
                <p>In cultivation, the young plants are not ready for picking till they are three
                    years old, by which time they should be well established, throwing out young
                    shoots or “flushes” with vigour and profusion. It is these tender shoots, with
                    leaf-buds and expanding leaves, which alone are gathered for tea manufacture,
                    and the younger the leaf-bud the better is the quality of the tea. According to
                    Chinese statements there are four gatherings of leaves in the year. The first is
                    made early in April, when the young leaf-buds are just unfolding, and these,
                    covered below with their fine silky hairs, are taken for making pekoe or young
                    hyson. The second gathering takes place about the beginning of May, another in
                    July, and the fourth in August and September. On each succeeding occasion the
                    product is less fragrant and valuable, and the final gathering is said to
                    consist of large leaves of little value. These statements do not, however,
                    accord with Indian experience.</p>
                <p>The following brief outline of the Chinese tea-making processes is given by Mr
                    Ball <hi rend="italic">{Cultivation and Manufacture of Tea) :—</hi></p>
                <p>“The leaves of black tea are exposed to the sun and air on circular trays and
                    treated as hay, during which an incipient saccharine fermentation is supposed to
                    take place in conjunction with a volatile oil. Various modifications of flavour
                    are thus produced by the management of this fermentation; a loss of tannin takes
                    place by the conversion of part of the tannic acid into sugar. During this
                    change the leaves become flaccid, and slightly tinged or spotted with red or
                    brown colouring matter, and give out a peculiar odour, approximating to, or, as
                    some think, identical with, the odour of tea. A certain change in this odour is
                    carefully watched by the workmen, this being an indication that the roasting
                    must not be delayed. It is not necessary to wait till the leaves are spotted
                    with red. They are then roasted in an iron vessel, and afterwards rolled with
                    the hands, to express their juices. The roasting and rolling are repeated so
                    long as any juices can be expressed from the leaves in the act of rolling.
                    Finally, they are dried in sieves placed over a charcoal fire in drying tubes,
                    during which the leaves are occasionally taken from the fire, and turned until
                    completely dried. It is in this last stage of the process that the leaves turn
                    black, though this change of colour is mainly due to the process of manipulation
                    previously to roasting, and not to the action of heat.”</p>
                <p>“The leaves of green tea are roasted also in an iron vessel, but as soon as
                    gathered, without any previous manipulation, all heating or fermentation of the
                    leaves being studiously avoided; they are then rolled as black tea, and finally
                    dried in the same vessel in which they have been roasted, by constantly stirring
                    and moving them about. They are also fanned to hasten evaporation, and the
                    drying and formation of the peculiar characteristic colour of this tea, which it
                    gradually acquires in this process, and which resembles the bloom on some
                    fruits."</p>
                <p>The colour of genuine green tea is entirely due to the rapid drying of the fresh
                    leaves, which prevents the chlorophyll from undergoing any alteration. The green
                    tea sent out of China is almost invariably faced or glazed with artificial
                    colouring matter, principally with a powdered mixture of gypsum and Prussian
                    blue.</p>
                <p>The names distinguishing commercial qualities of tea are almost entirely of
                    Chinese origin. In general they indicate a gradation of qualities from the fine
                    and delicate product of the young leafbud up to the hard and woody expanded and
                    partly-grown leaf. The following list represents the ordinary series of
                    qualities, beginning with the finest :—</p>

                    teas of special qualities or districts, such as oolong (black dragon) and
                    twankay, from the district of that name in the province of Keang-su. Scented
                    teas also form a special class of Chinese produce. In scenting the finished tea,
                    either black or green is intimately intermixed with odoriferous flowers and left
                    in a heap till the tea is fully impregnated with the odour, when the two
                    substances are separated by sifting, and the tea so scented is immediately
                    packed and excluded from the air.</p>
                <p>Brick tea is the special form in which tea is prepared for use throughout the
                    vast tracts of Central Asia. It is made principally from broken leaves, stalks,
                    and fragments of large leaves, compressed into blocks of various sizes. The
                    bricks are of various degrees of compression, some being lightly squeezed into a
                    loose mass and sewed up in cowhide bags, while others form compact resonant
                    cakes, in which all trace of the original leaf structure is lost, with gilt
                    characters impressed in their surface. Brick tea is much in demand over an area
                    greater than the whole of Europe, and by many tribes it is stewed with milk,
                    salt, and butter or other fat and eaten as a vegetable. The Russian factors
                    established in Hoo-pih prepare two sizes of brick tea, which they send off in
                    great quantities through the Kalgan Gate of the Great Wall.</p>
                <p>Under European supervision the cultivation and especially the manufacture of tea
                    have in India undergone remarkable improvements. Indeed, the traditional and
                    empirical teaching and processes of China proved a most serious stumblingblock
                    to the progress of the tea industry under Western auspices. The tea-plants now
                    cultivated in India are of three principal classes—the indigenous Assam, the
                    Chinese, and a hybrid between the two. By much crossing and intermixture the
                    gradations from one extreme to the other are almost imperceptible. The best
                    qualities of black teas are made from indigenous and high-class hybrid plants,
                    but these are comparatively tender and require a close humid climate. The
                    hardiness of the Chinese plants is their most important character, for,
                    favourably situated, the Assam plant gives a larger yield of delicate young leaf
                    during the season than any other.</p>
                <p>In favourable circumstances the tea-plant “flushes” or sends forth a fresh crop
                    of tender young shoots from twenty to twenty-five times in the course of its
                    growing and picking season of about nine months. The average annual yield per
                    plant is very variable, but may be stated at about one-fifth of a lb of finished
                    tea; and, as each acre of a garden holds 1500 to 1600 mature plants, the yield
                    per acre may be from 300 to 350 lb per annum. The diagram (fig. 5) from Col.

                    the points at uhιch the shoot may be picked, and it is important that the lowest
                    leaf taken should be so nipped off as to leave the bud in its axil uninjured on
                    the branch, as from it the next flush will then develop. The three leaves at the
                    growing point («, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> c) yield pekoe, and the whole shoot
                    down to and including <hi rend="italic">f</hi> gives pekoe souchong. In the
                    order of their age, the individual leaves manufacture into <hi rend="italic"

                    souchong, and /congou. Were the flush further developed another leaf might be
                    taken, which would be classed as bohea, but that is not a quality recognized by
                    Indian growers. It is not, however, the practice to pick or treat leaves
                    separately, the whole flush being manipulated together, and the tea is only
                    separated into qualities by sifting after the manufacturing processes have been
                    completed.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of black tea is found to be an essentially simple matter. Many of
                    the processes employed by the Chinese are quite superfluous, and several of the
                    manual operations which bulk largely in the Chinese manufacture, it is found,
                    can with advantage be supplanted by mechanical agency. The whole object of the
                    black-tea manufacturer is to ferment, roll, and dry the leaf, and for that
                    purpose the leaves undergo—(1) withering, (2) rolling, (3) fermenting, and (4)
                    firing or dholing. Between the fermenting and the firing operations it is
                    desirable to expose the leaves to the direct sunlight for an hour or thereby.
                    This cannot always be done, as it is impossible to keep the fermented leaves
                    after they have attained their proper state; nevertheless the best result is
                    always attained in bright weather, when it is possible to expose the fermented
                    leaves to the sun.</p>
                <p>The fresh leaves from the garden, as they are brought in to the factory, are
                    withered by being spread evenly over square wickerwork trays—leaf
                    challanies—thickly or thinly as the weather is hot or cool. Thus they are left
                    exposed to the air till they become quite soft and flaccid, folding together
                    when pressed in the hand into a clammy mass without crackling or rebound. In
                    cloudy or rainy weather it becomes necessary to w ither by machine, acting on
                    the leaves with artificially dried and heated air. Withering is a preliminary to
                    rolling, in which the flaccid and velvety leaves are kneaded, twisted, and
                    rolled back and forward over a table till the whole comes into a mashy condition
                    by the exudation of juice. While in Chinese tea-making that juice is squeezed
                    out of the leaves, in India it is most carefully lapped up and absorbed in the
                    spongy mass. In hand-rolling as much as can be worked between two hands is
                    operated on, and passed from man to man along the table till fully worked, when
                    it is made up into a compressed ball and so put aside for fermenting. This
                    process is the distinguishing feature of black-tea making, and on its sufficient
                    accomplishment depends much of the character and quality of the tea made. The
                    progress of the fermentation must be carefully watched, and at the point when by
                    the colour it is known to be sufficiently advanced the tea is in favourable
                    weather sunned by exposure, thinly spread out to the sunlight for about an hour.
                    It is immediately thereafter fired, either by the fumes of burning charcoal or
                    by a current of dried and heated air from one of the numerous machines now in
                    use. With this single firing the process is completed, and the tea so finished
                    is sifted by machinery into commercial qualities according to the size of the
                    leaf.</p>
                <p>F or the entire range of manufacturing operations numerous forms of machinery and
                    mechanical devices have been adapted and introduced in Indian gardens, so that,
                    apart from picking the leaves, tea-making has become practically a factory
                    industry.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of green tea is comparatively little prosecuted in India. In
                    Europe the demand has greatly fallen away, and, though the consumption is
                    considerable in the United States, thé supply is principally drawn from Japan,
                    where its preparation is</p>
                <p>212° F. In a range of thirty-five samples the average moisture was equal to 7 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 67 per cent., the lowest—in a Chinese young hyson—
                    being 4'84, while in several congous it exceeded 10 per cent. The ash in
                    sixty-seven specimens of ordinary and special (undried) teas he found to average
                    5 ’ 78 per cent., the maximum being 7 ’ 02 and the minimum 5'17; and of that ash
                    54 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 50 per cent, was soluble in water. The
                    proportion of extractive substances in twenty-four teas varied from 26 ’ 15 in a
                    congou to 44 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 85 in Moyune young hyson. The total
                    average nitrogen from sixty green teas, slightly faced, was 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 76, from sixty black teas 3 <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,</hi> 26, from six Assam teas 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 64, and from
                    exhausted leaves 3 ’ 80 per cent.</p>
                <p>So long as the Western world remained almost exclusively extensively practised.
                    The manufacture as carried on in the NorthWestern Provinces resolves itself into
                    a rapid rolling and drying of the leaf. Without permitting the leaves to wither
                    after gathering, they are, if free from moisture, at once by exposure to a brisk
                    heat sweated and softened for rolling. They are then without delay rolled as in
                    black-tea manufacture, next spread out in the sun till they take a blackish
                    tinge, then again rolled, and this rolling and exposure may be repeated yet a
                    third time. When the rolling is completed the tea is placed in a highly heated
                    pan, in which it is stirred about briskly till the whole mass becomes too hot to
                    be worked by hand. Then it is tightly packed in a strong canvas bag, in which it
                    is beaten by a heavy flat stick to consolidate it, and in this condition left
                    for a night. Next day it is fired off in a pan, beginning with a high heat,
                    which is gradually reduced during the nine hours or thereby of the operation, an
                    incessant stirring and tossing being kept up the whole time. During this firing
                    off the green colour of the tea is developed; and Indian green tea never owes
                    any of its colour to “facing” with foreign substances.</p>
                <p>The qualities of a sample of tea and its commercial value can only with accuracy
                    be determined by actual infusion and trial by a skilled tea-taster. Certain
                    general and external appearances which indicate the class of a tea are obvious
                    enough; but, although a pekoe may be readily distinguished from a souchong, the
                    souchong of certain planters or districts may be more valuable than other
                    pekoes. While it is impossible to define the conditions which determine the
                    commercial value of an ordinary black tea, Col. Money lays down the following
                    rales: the darker the liquor the stronger the tea, and the nearer the approach
                    of the infused leaf to a uniform salmony brown the purer the flavour. Black tea
                    of good quality should in infusion yield a clear bright brown liquor emitting a
                    subdued fragrance, and in taste it should be mild, bland, and sweetish, with an
                    agreeable astringency. Green tea yields a light-coloured liquor of high
                    fragrance, but thin, sharp, aud somewhat rasping in taste as compared with black
                    tea.</p>
                <p>The chemical components of tea leaves are essential oil, theine, tannin, boheic
                    acid, quercetin, quercitannic acid, gallic acid, oxalic acid, gum, chlorophyll,
                    resin, wax, albuminoids, colouring matters, cellulose, and mineral ash. Of these
                    the first three—essential oil, theine, and tannin—are of importance in the
                    infused beverage. The essential oil, on which the flavour of tea depends, is
                    present to the extent of from 0’6 to 1 per cent. Theine (C <hi rend="subscript">
                    8</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> N <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> 0 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) is an alkaloid identical with the caffeine obtained
                    from coffee, and it is remarkable that the same substance is yielded by the maté
                    or Paraguayan tea and the guarana of South America, and by the kola nut of
                    Central Africa. The theobromine of cocoa is also closely allied to theine, and
                    the characteristic components of the extract of meat similarly show certain
                    points of contact with these stimulant bodies. To the tannin of tea infusions is
                    due what is known as the strength of the tea. Prof. Dittmar has recently
                    examined a number of China and Indian teas in regard to the proportions of
                    theine and tannin in their infusions and to the dependence of these proportions
                    on the time of infusion. The general result was that Chinese tea yields more
                    theine and less tannin than Indian tea, and that in both cases 10 minutes’
                    infusion extracts practically all the theine. Longer infusion adds only to the
                    tannin that passes into the solution, and, as excess of tannin impedes
                    digestion, prolonged infusion is hurtful and ought to be avoided.</p>
                <p>The quantitative composition of tea is of course subject to great variation. The
                    analyses by Mulder given in the accompanying table furnish a general idea of the
                    proportion of constituents.</p>
                <p>A series of investigations into a large number of teas has been carried out by Mr
                    G. W. Wigner <hi rend="italic">{Pharm. Jour,,</hi> 3d series, vi. 261, 281,
                    402). In tea as imported he found large proportions of moisture which could be

                <p>dependent on China for its tea supply, adulteration was rampant and multiform in
                    the trade. Especially among green and fancy teas there was scarcely such a thing
                    as an unsophisticated sample to be obtained. The Chinese were also expert in
                    fabricating an artificial gunpowder—appropriately known as “lie tea,”—which
                    consisted of the sweepings of tea warehouses artfully made up with a paste of
                    rice water. Paddy husks and many kinds of leaves faced with China clay,
                    soapstone, catechu, and black lead also found their way abundantly into tea. On
                    the European side, exhausted leaves were again dried, impregnated with catechu
                    and gum, and faced up to do duty as fresh tea, and the leaves of numerous plants
                    —sloe-thorn, hawthorn, willow, beech, plane, <hi rend="italic">Epilobium
                    angusti∙ folium,</hi> &amp;c.—were freely worked up as tea. Adulterated tea is
                    now, however, comparatively rare, largely owing to the watchfulness of the
                    customs authorities. Moreover, as it is nearly as cheap to make tea from the
                    leaves of the tea-plant as from those of any other herb, there is not much
                    incentive to substitute the false for the real.</p>
                <p>At a very early period in the European history of tea the probable effects of its
                    use on the health and morals of the population attracted jealous attention, and
                    a great deal was written, mostly in a hostile sense, on the subject. In 1678 we
                    find Mr Heury Savile writing to his uncle, Mr Secretary Coventry, in sharp
                    reproof of certain friends of his “who call for tea, instead of pipes and
                    bottles after dinner,—a base unworthy Indian practice, which I must ever admire
                    your most Christian family for not admitting.” And he adds, with an audible
                    sigh, “the truth is, all nations are growing so wicked as to have some of these
                    filthy customs !” Some of the writers, however, although resolute for its
                    banishment from the caddy, were willing to give it a place in the medicine
                    chest. “Among many other novelties,” says a medical writer in 1722, “there is
                    one which seems to be particularly the cause of the hypochondriac disorders, and
                    is generally known by the name of thea, or tea. It is a drug which of late years
                    has very much insinuated itself, as well into our diet as regales and
                    entertainments, though its occupation is not less destructive to the animal
                    economy than opium, or some other drugs which we have at present learned to
                    avoid.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    reasonable and scientific account of the plant; but even he let the fear of its
                    abuse run away with his judgment, asserting that “the first rise of this
                    pernicious custom [that of drinking spirits to excess] is often owing to the
                    weakness and debility of the system brought on by the daily habit of drinking
                    tea; the trembling hand seeks a temporary relief in some cordial, in order to
                    refresh and excite again the enfeebled system, whereby such persons almost
                    necessarily fall into a habit of intemperance.”<note anchored="true"

                    have lost their stature and comeliness, and women their beauty What Shakespeare
                    ascribes to the concealment of love is in this age more frequently occasioned by
                    the use of tea.” To these complaints echoes were not wanting, but after a while
                    the tea-drinkers had it all their own way. In the meantime, however, tea was not
                    without its apologists. To say nothing of ouι ’ own familiar poets and
                    essayists, its praises have been sung by Herrichen and by Franchis in Greek
                    verses, by Pechlin in Latin epigrams, by Pierre Petit in a Latin poem of five
                    hundred lines, and by a German versifier, who celebrates, in a fashion of his
                    own, its “burial and happy resurrection.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    infusion of this fascinating plant; whose kettle had scarcely time to cool; who
                    with tea amused the evening, with tea solaced the midnight, and with tea

                <p>Authorities are not yet by any means agreed as to the exact physiological
                    influence and value of tea. The very striking fact that theine is precisely the
                    characteristic constituent of coffee, maté, guarana, and the kola nut, all
                    substances eagerly sought after in different quarters of the globe, serves to
                    show that the alkaloid satisfies some craving of the human system, although what
                    its effect is has not yet been certainly determined. The quantity of theine
                    consumed even by the most hardened tea-drinker is exceedingly minute, and there
                    are not wanting authorities who assert that it is practically inert, an
                    assertion surely contradicted by the general instinct of the race. What is
                    indisputable about tea drinking is that it forms an agreeable means of imbibing
                    the proportion of water necessary in human nutrition, which, being taken hot,
                    com municates to the system a diffused warm glow. Further, as used by Western
                    communities, it is a medium of taking, in the form of sugar and cream, no
                    inconsiderable amount of real nutriment. The other effects of tea are more a
                    matter of general impression than of ascertained scientific reality. Its virtues
                    have nowhere been better summarized than by the earliest Chinese writer on the
                    subject, the above-mentioned Lo Yu, who says, “It tempers the spirits and
                    harmonizes the mind, dispels lassitude and relieves fatigue, awakens thought and
                    prevents drowsiness, lightens or refreshes the body, and clears the perceptive
                    faculties.” The gentle exhilaration which accompanies the moderate use of tea is
                    not followed by the depression which succeeds the use of alcoholic stimuli.
                    Experience has proved that it sustains the frame under severe muscular or mental
                    exercise without causing subsequent exhaustion and collapse. Tea is frequently
                    found to be beneficial to sufferers from nervous headache, and it counteracts to
                    some extent the effects of alcohol and of opiates. Taken in excess it produces
                    cerebral excitement, sleeplessness, and general nervous irritability. The tannin
                    contained in its infusions also interferes with the flow of the saliva,
                    diminishes the digestive activity of the stomach, and impedes the action of the
                    bowels. In this view the large quantity of strong tea used by the poor—and
                    especially by the sedentary poor,—while serving to blunt the keen tooth of
                    hunger, must work incalculable havoc with the digestive and nervous systems of
                    the consumers.</p>
                <p>It is a remarkable fact that no mention of tea is made by Marco Polo, and that no
                    knowledge of the substance appears to have reached Europe till after the
                    establishment of intercourse between Portugal and China in 1517. The Portuguese,
                    however, did little towards the introduction of the herb into Europe, and it was
                    not till the Dutch established themselves at Bantam early in the 17th century
                    that these adventurers learned from the Chinese the habit of tea drinking and
                    brought it to Europe.</p>
                <p>The earliest mention of tea by an Englishman is probably that contained in a
                    letter from Mr Wickham, an agent of the East India Company, written from Firando
                    in Japan, on the 27th June 1615, to Mr Eaton, another officer of the company,
                    resident at Macao, and asking for “a pot of the best sort of <hi rend="italic"
                    >chaw.”</hi> How the commission was executed does not appear, but in Mr Eaton’s
                    subsequent accounts of expenditure occurs this item—“three silver porringers to
                    drink chaw in.”</p>
                <p>It was not till the middle of the century that the English began to use tea, and
                    they also received their supplies from Java till in 1686 they were driven out of
                    the island by the Dutch. At first the price of tea in England ranged from £6 to
                    £10 per lb. In the <hi rend="italic">Mercurius Politicus,</hi> No. 435, of
                    September 1658, the following advertisement occurs:—“That excellent and by all
                    Physitians approved Ch⅛a Drink called by the Chineans <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tcha,</hi> by other nations <hi rend="italic">Tag, alias Tee,</hi> is sold at
                    the Sultaness Head, a cophee-house in Sweetings Rents, by the Royal Exchange,
                    London.” Thomas Garway, the first English tea dealer, and founder of the
                    well-known coffee-house, “Garraway’s,” in a curious broadsheet, <hi
                    rend="italic">An Exact Description of the Growth, Quality, and Virtues of the
                    Leaf Tea,</hi> issued in 1659 or 1660, writes, “in respect of its scarceness and
                    dearness, it hath been only used as a regalia in high treatments and
                    entertainments, and presents made thereof to princes and grandees.” In that year
                    he purchased a quantity of the rare and much-prized commodity, and offered it to
                    the public, in the leaf, at fixed prices varying from 15s. to 50s. the lb,
                    according to quality, and also in the infusion, “made according to the
                    directions of the most knowing merchants and travellers into those eastern
                    countries.” In 1660 an Act of the first parliament of the Restoration imposed a
                    tax on “every gallon of chocolate, sherbet, and tea, made and sold, to be paid
                    by the maker thereof, eightpence” (12 Car. II. c. 23).</p>
                <p>Pepys’s often-quoted mention of the fact that on the 25th September 1660, “I did
                    send for a cup of tee, a China drink, of which I never had drunk before,” proves
                    the novelty of tea in England at that date. In 1664 we find that the East India
                    Company presented the king with 2 lb and 2 oz. of “thea,” which cost 40s. per
                    lb, and two years afterwards with another parcel containing 221 lb, for which
                    the directors paid 50s. per lb. Both parcels appear to have been purchased on
                    the Continent. Not until 1677 is the Company recorded to have taken any steps
                    for the importation of tea. The order then given to their agents was for “teas
                    of the best kind to the amount of 100 dollars.” But their instructions were
                    considerably exceeded, for the quantity imported in 1678 was 4713 lb, a quantity
                    which seems to have glutted the market for several years. The annals of the
                    Company record that, in February 1684, the directors wrote thus to Madras:—“In
                    regard thea is grown to be a commodity here, and we have occasion to make
                    presents therein to our great friends at court, we would have you to send us
                    yearly five or six canisters of the very best and freshest thea.” Until the
                    Revolution no duty was laid on tea other than that levied on the infusion as
                    sold in the coffee-houses. By 1 William and Mary c. 6, a duty of 5s. per lb and
                    5 per cent, on the value was imposed. For several years the quantities imported
                    were very small, and consisted exclusively of the finer sorts. The first direct
                    purchase in China was made at Amoy, the teas <pb break="no"

                    having been purchased in Madras and Surat, whither it was brought by Chinese
                    junks after the expulsion of the British from Java. During the closing years of
                    the century the amount brought over seems to have been, on the average, about
                    20,000 lb a year. The instructions of 1700 directed the supercargoes to send
                    home 300 tubs of the finer green teas and 80 tubs of bohea. In 1703 orders were
                    given for “75,000 lb. Singlo (green), 10,000 lb imperial, and 20,000 lb bohea.”
                    The average price of tea at this period was 16s. per lb.</p>
                <p>During the 100 years from 1710 to 1810 the aggregate sale of tea by the East
                    India Company amounted to 750,219,016 lb, worth £129,804,595, of which
                    116,470,675 lb was re-exported. The duties during that century (excepting a
                    period of eleven years, 1784-95, when they were only 12⅜ per cent. ) were
                    excessive, amounting to about 200 per cent, on the value of common teas. The
                    results of so enormous a tax were the creation of a gigantic smuggling trade,
                    extensive adulteration of imported teas, and much fabrication of counterfeit tea
                    within the country. Probably the duty-paid tea did not represent more than half
                    what was consumed under the name of tea. The following table exhibits the
                    principal facts connected with the trade during the period of the Company’s
                    monopoly, which terminated on the 22d of April 1834, when the trade was thrown
                    open to all, the prices quoted being those of good qualities in the Company’s
                    warehouse or in bond :—</p>

                <p>Next to the United Kingdom, the greatest tea-importing nation is the United
                    States. Notwithstanding that tea has from 1873 been duty free (duty 25 cents per
                    lb in 1870, 17∙72 in 1871, and 15 in 1872), the habit of tea drinking does not
                    grow in America as it is found to do in the British Isles, as is shown by the
                    accompanying table. Of the 72,104,956 lb of tea imported into the United States

                <p>The progressive increase in the consumption of tea in the United Kingdom during
                    50 years from 1836 till 1886 is instructively shown in the accompanying diagram
                    constructed by Messrs J. C. Sillar and Co., of London. The dotted line
                    represents the average monthly consumption in each year; the fluctuations in
                    price of good sound congou are traced by the black line; and the years in which
                    reduced customs duty came into operation are indicated along the base. From 1860
                    onwards the amount of Indian tea entered for home consumption is shown in
                    monthly average by a black column. This column brings out the remarkable fact
                    that the Indian tea consumed in the United Kingdom in a year now exceeds the
                    total</p>
                <p>Next to the English, the Dutch are the greatest consumers of tea outside of
                    China; and the only other considerable tea-using nation is Russia. The following
                    table gives the amount of tea imported in the year 1884 by the principal
                    tea-drinking countries :—</p>

                <p>By this table the Australian colonists come out as the most inveterate
                    tea-drinkers in the world. The quantity received by Holland in 1884 was
                    2,250,000 lb less than the imports of 1883, but the average of recent times has
                    been 4,500,000 lb.</p>
                <p>The quantity consumed in China has been estimated as high as 2000 millions of
                    pounds annually, being at the rate of a little more than 5 lb per head of the
                    population; and, considering the teadrinking habits of the people, the estimate
                    is by no means extravagant. In this light it may be safe to affirm that the
                    amount of tea used yearly throughout the world reaches the gigantic total of
                    2500 millions of pounds.</p>
