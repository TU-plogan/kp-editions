                    Uigurs and Tatars, we mean tribes who style themselves Turks and really are
                    such. It is only by the aid of historical and linguistical evidence that we can
                    determine the true limits of the Turkish name.</p>
                <p>The national Turkish traditions, preserved by the Persian historians Rashid
                    ed-Dīn and Jowaini from Uigurian books which are now lost, point to the region
                    watered by the river Selenga and its affluents, the Orkhon and the Tugila, as
                    the primitive seat of the Turkish people. Rashīd ed-Dīn combines this tradition
                    with that of the Mohammedan descendants of Oghuz, who, in accordance with Moslem
                    traditions, derive the whole Turkish stock from Japhet, the son of Noah, or more
                    accurately from Turk, the son of the former (Yafiz-oglan), and pretend that he
                    pitched his tents in the vicinity of Lake Issyk-kul (in Semiryetchensk). But,
                    though Turkish tribes did wander so far to the west, and even farther, in remote
                    antiquity, it seems pretty certain that the Uigurian tradition has preserved the
                    memory of the true origin of the race, that Turks and Mongols were originally
                    different stems of a single people, and that these two members of the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ural-Altaic (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> family were
                    more closely related to each other than to any other member of the same family
                    (Finno-Ugrians, Samoyedes, Tungus-Manchus). The evidence for this rests, not on
                    the ethnological system of Rashīd ed-Dīn, though it affords a secondary
                    argument, but on the indubitable affinity of the Mongolian and Turkish languages
                    and the similarity of the ethnological characters of the two races. Here, of
                    course, we do not argue from the Osmanlis, who have lost all their original
                    race-characters and have become “Caucasians” of the best type, but rather, for
                    instance, from the Kirghiz, who are considered as the typical Turks of the
                    present day, and are described by Ujfalvy as being midway between the Mongol and
                    the Caucasian. We must now turn our attention to the wanderings of the Turks and
                    their subsequent fate,—a rather difficult task, <pb break="no"

                            Uisuns, a division of the Great Horde of the Kirghiz. At the time of
                            Alexander the Great’s expeditions against the Scythians beyond the
                            Jaxartes, we find in that region certain traces of the Turkish language
                            in names of places and persons (cp. vol. xviii. p. 582, note 4). It is
                            therefore certain that long before the age of the Hiong-nu Turkish
                            tribes had spread to the borders of the Jaxartes, and even along the
                            northern coast of the Caspian to the rivers Ural and Volga. But the
                            ethnical denominations of antiquity—Scythians, Parthians, Massagetae,
                            Sacae, &amp;c. —do not convey to our mind clear ethnical distinctions,
                            so that the true nationality of these peoples has been much debated.
                            Neither are the pre-Semitic culture of Babylonia and the supposed
                            “Turanian” origin of the Accads facts of such character that from them
                            we can infer the presence of Turks in these regions in remote
                            antiquity.</p></note> The Hiong-nu were identified by Deguignes with the
                    Huns, this denomination being used in a political or collective sense, and
                    including, besides the Huns proper, the Ephthalites or White Huns, Avars,
                    Bulgars, Magyars, Khazars, and Petchenegs, who are styled by several scholars
                    Hunnic or Scythian peoples,—a term of no scientific value whatever, as the main
                    body of these peoples consisted really of Mongol-Turks or Finno-Ugrians. As,
                    however, separate articles have been devoted to most of these ethnical names, we
                    abstain from further details, as also from discussion of the question of the
                    Turkish origin of the Magyars and the Khazars, though that of the former seems
                    to us as improbable as that of the latter is certain.<note anchored="true"

                    Be this as it may, the Hiong-nu are, so to speak, protoTurks, and the history of
                    the Turks proper begins with the Tu-kiu, the Chinese equivalent of the word
                    Turk. Originally a division of the Hiong-nu, almost extirpated by wars, but
                    miraculously saved from complete destruction, the Tu-kiu settled south of the
                    Kin-Shan (Altai ?) Mountains, and were miners and iron-smelters in the service

                    masters and founded a mighty empire under princes who took the title of Ili
                    khan. In these Tu-kiu Deguignes recognized the Turks who entered into friendly
                    relations with Byzantium, and to whom Justin II. sent two ambassadors,
                    —Zemarchus (568) and Valentinus (575). The narratives of these ambassadors are
                    preserved in the fragments of Menander Protector; and (comparing the variations
                    of the corrupt text with the record of Tabari) from him we learn that at the
                    first date the reigning prince was Sinjibulus (Arabic Sinjibu).<note

                    Khosrau I., the Oxus becoming the frontier between Iran and Turān. The memory of
                    the empire of Sinjibu and of its political strength has been preserved by the
                    Arabic authors Ibn Khordādbeh and Mas'udī, who inform us that the Turkish tribe
                    of the Karluks, settled in the provinces of Ferghana and Shāsh (Tashkend), were
                    of old the mightiest of all the Turks, and that their sovereign, the khakān of
                    khakāns, was obeyed by all the neighbouring princes. To them they reckon the

                    another division of the same tribe, the On-Ugur or “Ten Ugurs.” In the time of
                    Ibn Khordādbeh and Mas'udī these Turks had gained the supremacy amongst their
                    brethren, and had their residence at Kushān, which has been identified with the
                    Kiao-chang of the Chinese. According to their accounts, the Kiao-chang form the
                    southern division of the Hui-khe (Hoei-ke of Deguignes), and were settled before
                    the Christian era south and east of the Tian-Shan up to the Pamir plateau and
                    the Kuen-Lun. The Arabic authors make them adherents of Manichaeism; but, as the
                    original Turkish Shamanism has developed into a dualistic system, this statement
                    may rest on a partial misapprehension. It seems, however, certain that Buddhism
                    reached these Turks on its way towards China, for we know that this religion
                    spread in the 2d century B.c. throughout the adjacent kingdom of Bactria, and
                    was still flourishing when Hwen-T’sang visited (7th century) those regions. Thus
                    we can understand why the old Ural-Altaic religion bears a Sanskrit name. The
                    northern division of the Hui-khe, which remained unknown to the Arabs, wandered
                    from the Selenga region to the sources of the Yenisei, vanquished the Tu-kiu
                    (745), and founded an empire from the Selenga to Lake Balkash, till they were
                    overthrown (841) by the Ha-kas (identified with the Kirghiz). These northern
                    Uigurs are called by the Chinese Kao-che, Chi-le, Di-li, and Te-le. The history
                    of the southern branch is unknown, for the chronological data of Rashīd ed-Dīn
                    and Abu-’l-Ghāzi are contradictory and useless, though their statements that the

                    tells us, settled about the lower Ural and Volga, but were driven thence
                    (894-899) by the Ghuzz (Ouzoi). A part of them returned afterwards to their
                    ancient abode, but the great majority wandered westward and settled on both
                    sides of the Dnieper, driving the Hungarians before them to the Carpathians.
                    Here they annoyed the neighbouring peoples by their raids, and engaged readily

                    Byzantine court incorporated large numbers of them with its own armies,
                    sometimes with fatal result, as was experienced by Romanus Diogenes, when these
                    auxiliaries passed to the camp of his antagonist Alp Arslan. At the period of
                    the first crusade the Christian armies met with them on their march through
                    Servia and Bulgaria; but the Petchenegs are not mentioned after the 13th
                    century. The learning of Orientalists has discovered faint traces of the

                    Ghuzz and Petchenegs. Oriental authors know much more of their neighbours to the
                    east, the Kipchaks, a very common name of Turkish clans down to the present day.
                    Sometimes both names are combined: Rubruquis speaks of the Coman Kipchaks. Anna
                    Comnena informs us that the Comans spoke the same dialect as the Petchenegs, a

                    regions, the Kipchaks suffered great hardships, and large numbers of them were
                    sold as slaves throughout the Mohammedan world. From them sprang the Bahrite
                    Mameluke sultans of Egypt (1250-1380). The Comans sought refuge amongst the
                    Hungarians and became Christians; but their arrival, causing internal
                    dissensions in Hungary, greatly favoured the advance of the Mongolian arms. The

                    southern Russia under Mongolian rule (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mongols),</hi>
                    whilst others became merged with the Hungarians.</p>
                <p>The Ghuzz dwelt originally in the far East amongst the Toguz-Ugur, but migrated
                    in the reign of the caliph Al-Mahdí (775-785) to Transoxiana, where they adhered
                    to the cause of the famous Al-Mokanna', not from religious predilection, but to
                    satisfy their love of war and plunder. In the same manner they afterwards served
                    every warlike prince in their neighbourhood, and entered like other Turks into
                    the service of the caliphs. The main body of the life-guard of the 'Abbāsids
                    consisted of Turks, and some individuals rose very soon to high commands.
                    Entrusted with the administration of distant provinces, they founded independent
                    princely houses, such as those of the Tulunids and Ikhshids in <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Egypt</hi> (vol. vii. p. 750) and the Ghaznavids (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Ghazni).</hi> In the meantime fresh bands of the Ghuzz
                    poured from the east and the north into Turkestan, the region becoming
                    overstocked with a nomadic population. Some of them sought and found an outlet
                    to the west by occupying the territory of the Petchenegs and joining the Turkish
                    population of southern Russia; but the great majority, seeing the ruined state
                    of the empire of the caliphs, crossed the Oxus and overran the northern and
                    eastern provinces of Persia. How these loose desultory bands were guided to
                    subsequent victories, and moulded with the peoples amongst whom they settled
                    into regular political bodies, has been already narrated under <hi

                <p>Meanwhile they underwent a great change in their outward appearance, habits,
                    &amp;c., as Rashīd ed-Dīn relates, owing to the influence of the air and the
                    water, and, we may add, to frequent intermarriage with the inhabitants of the
                    countries invaded by them. After some generations the change was great enough to
                    strike their Iranian neighbours, who called them Turkmans (Turcomans),<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The term “Turkman” occurs
                            in Arabic chronicles of the Seljukian period, and even in Mokaddasí, p.
                            274. Rashid ed-Dīn therefore exaggerates in stating that it only came
                            into use in his lifetime. But Vambéry’s statement that it was applied of
                            old to the descendants of Oghuz is contradicted by the genuine Persian
                            text of Rashīd ed-Dīn and the unanimous testimony of history. His
                            objections against the popular etymology mentioned above are, however,
                            not quite unfounded.</p></note> a term implying resemblance to Turks. It
                    is therefore quite natural that the modern Osmanlis should have become
                    Caucasians; for, if Rashid ed-Dīn in the 13th century noticed the difference
                    between a Turkman and a genuine Turk, the six centuries which have elapsed since
                    amply suffice to have obliterated all original Ural-Altaic characteristics. The
                    old name Ghuzz, originally, as it seems, the Turkish Oghuz (an eponymous hero of
                    whom Turkish chronicles tell many fables) was wholly superseded by the new name
                    Turkman and by other political names.</p>
                <p>During the Seljukian period there arose in Transoxiana the empire of the Khārizm
                    shahs, founded by Mohammed b. Anushtegīn, upon whom the government of Khārizm
                    (Khiva),—which down to 995 had belonged to princes of Iranian descent—was
                    conferred (1097) by the Seljuk prince Barkiyārok. His son Atsiz became
                    independent (1138), but his empire seemed destined to early ruin by the arrival
                    of the Kara-Chitai, who defeated the Seljuk prince Sinjar (1141) and became for
                    a time supreme masters of Turkestan. Nevertheless the Kharizmian dynasty held
                    its place as a tributary sovereignty, and developed great power under the
                    princes Takash and Mohammed his son. The former defeated and killed (1194) the
                    last Seljuk prince of 'Irak, and the latter extended his dominion from the
                    Caspian to the Indus and from the Jaxartes to the coast of 'Omān. His cunning
                    antagonist, the 'Abbasid caliph An-Nāsir, invoked the aid of Jenghiz Khān, who
                    scarcely required this invitation to attack Mohammed. The sack of Bokhara was
                    followed in the same year (1220) by that of the other principal cities of
                    Transoxiana and by the persecution of the unhappy prince, who died in a
                    forgotten island of the Caspian. His son Jelāl-ed-Dīn was driven towards India,
                    but by a change of fortune ascended once more the throne of his fathers, till
                    the new Mongol khān, Ogdai, sent fresh armies against him and forced him to seek
                    refuge in the Kurdish Mountains, where he was murdered (1231). The fate of the
                    Turks of Transoxiana was shared by their brethren in Asia and Europe, and new
                    Mongol-Turkish empires arose, of which an outline has been given under <hi

                    in Persia and on the frontiers of Asia Minor the Turkman dynasties of the Ak
                    Koyun-lu, the Kara Koyun-lu, the Zu’l-kadria, and the Ramazān Oglu, whose
                    history is closely connected either with that of the rise of the Ottoman power

                    Afghanistan. In religion the great majority are Mohammedans; a few tribes in
                    Russia are baptized Christians; and some others adhere to the original
                    Shamanism, which has also influenced the religious conceptions of the Christian
                    and Mohammedan Turks. The principal Turkish peoples are the following. (I.) By a
                    popular distinction the Turks of Siberia and Russia, with some colonies in
                    Turkey, are styled Tatars (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tartars),</hi> though the
                    Yakuts of northern Siberia are not usually included in this term. The Yakuts,
                    who are perhaps a mixture of Turkish and Tungus tribes, deviating from the
                    ordinary course of Turkish wanderings, are settled about the lower Lena, and
                    number probably 200,000 (Rittig, 80,000; Lansdell, 210,000).<note

                    as a separate tribe, really form a subdivision of the Kazīk-Kirghiz, and are
                    perhaps akin to the Kitai-Kipchaks, who are reckoned to the Uzbegs. (III.) Uzbeg
                    is a political, not an ethnological denomination, originating from Uzbeg Khan of
                    the Golden Horde (1312-1340). It was used to distinguish the followers of
                    Shaibāni Khān (16th century) from his antagonists, and became finally the name
                    of the ruling Turks in the khanates as opposed to the Sarts, Tajiks, and such
                    Turks as entered those regions at a later date and are known to be Kirghiz,
                    Kara-Kalpaks, or Taranjis. The Uzbegs are therefore a mixed race of different
                    Turkish tribes. According to Kostenko,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    provinces of Sir-Daria, Ferghana, Zerafshan, and Amu-Daria, and Vambéry
                    conjectures that there are 1,000,000 more in Bokhara, 700,000 in Khiva, and
                    200,000 under Afghan supremacy, giving a total number of about 2,000,000. They
                    are agriculturists or inhabit the cities; a few are semi-nomads. (IV.) The
                    eastern Turks on the southern slopes of the Tian-Shan Mountains at Kashgar,
                    Ust-turfan, Ak-su, Sairam, Kutcha, Yarkand, Khotan, &amp;c., are the remnants of
                    the ancient Uigurs; and of the same origin are the Taranjis ( = agriculturists),
                    settled in the Ili valley and elsewhere. The number of the latter is given as
                    about 50,000; that of the former may be estimated from the statements of
                        Forsyth<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    majority being Turks and the rest Mohammedan Chinese (Sungans). (V.) The
                    Turcomans (properly Turkmans) inhabit the steppe east of the Caspian and south
                    of the Oxus from Astrabad to the Paropamisus. The term is sometimes taken to
                    include their brethren in Persia and Asia Minor, who will be treated separately.
                    The following are the principal tribes:—(1) the Tchaudors and Imrailis, in the
                    northwestern part of the Ust-Urt to the Gulf of Karaboghaz; (2) the Yomuts,
                    extending from Khiva across the Ust-Urt to the Caspian, and along the sea-board
                    to Persia; (3) the Göklen, on Persian territory, between the upper Görgen and
                    Atrek; (4) the Tekkes, the most numerous tribe at the present day, divided into
                    the Akhal Tekkes and the Merv Tekkes, so named after the centres where their
                    greatest numbers are found; (5) the Sakars, on the left bank of the Oxus, to the
                    east of Tcharjui, considered by Vambéry as a division of the Tekkes; (6) the
                    Sariks, at Penjdeh and Yul-utan on the north-western slopes of the Paropamisus;
                    (7) the Salors, one of the oldest Turkman tribes, who suffered greatly from the
                    Tekkes, till they finally migrated (1857) to Zurabād in Persia, and left their
                    former districts to the Tekkes and Sariks; (8) the Ersaris, on the Oxus about
                    Khoja Salih; and (9) the Ali-elis, about Andkhui. Their total number, inclusive
                    of some Turkmans who do not belong to any of these tribes, and are scattered
                    throughout the provinces of Syr-Daria, Amu-Daria, Zerafshan, and Astrakhan
                    (about 16,000), is estimated by Vambéry at about 1,000,000, and by Grodekoff at
                    1,170,000. The Turkmans are, with few exceptions, nomads, and were formerly the
                    terror of their neighbours, who feared them as the “man-stealing Turks”; but
                    since Merv has been annexed to Russia (1884) they have been compelled to abandon
                    their predatory habits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    nomads scattered throughout Persia are partly the descendants of the Ghuzz
                    tribes that invaded the country at the Seljukian period; others have migrated
                    thither in the following centuries. They are known by the name of liât or Iliyāt
                    (meaning tribes or peoples) and consist of several tribes, having each its own
                    chieftain, the Ilkhānī, appointed by the shah. An accurate list of the names of
                    these tribes does not exist; but the most powerful and most numerous are the
                    following. (1) The Kajars, who dwelt in Transcaucasia down to the time of Abbas
                    the Great, by whom one division of them was compelled to settle at the
                    south-east corner of the Caspian near Astrabad. To this division belongs the
                    present dynasty of Persia. (2) The Afshars or Aushars, a very numerous tribe, in
                    the province of Adarbaijān (Azerbijan). A division is also settled in the
                    mountainous regions of the Anti-taurus; its members are nominally subjects of
                    the Ottoman empire but really independent. (3) The Shekakis and Shah-sewen. The
                    latter is not a tribal, but a political name, meaning those who love the shah,
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., partisans of the Safawī dynasty (1499-1736) and
                    the Shi'ite faith. (4) The Kara Koyun-lu, near the town of Khoi, the remnants of
                    the once powerful tribe named above. Besides these, many other names are
                    recorded of tribes wandering in the Transcaucasian regions and in the provinces
                    of Adarbaijān and Mazenderan, but many of them are very uncertain. All these
                    Turks are comprehended under the general denomination of Adarbaijāni Turks; they
                    are nomads or semi-nomads and speak a peculiar Turkish dialect, the Turk Azeri
                    or Adarbaijāni Turkish. Some specimens of it have been published by Chodzko,
                    Bergé, Melgunoff, and Barbier de Meynard. In the southern provinces of Persia
                    are settled the (5) Kashkais, (6) Abul-werdis, (7) Kara - Gözlüs, (8) Bahar-lu,
                    and (9) Inan-lu. To the first named are reckoned by some the Khalaches,<note

                    Ottomans proper, though they did not enter the country till after the downfall
                    of the Kharizmian empire. The Mongolian invasion drove the obscure ancestors of
                    this the most illustrious Turkish dynasty to Asia Minor, whence they gradually
                    spread to the province of Khodawendikyār (Bithynia).</p>
                <p>(2) Tatars scattered amongst the rest of the population, but forming a large
                    colony in the Dobrudja. In part they occupied their present settlements before
                    the conquest of Constantinople; but others have immigrated into Asia Minor
                    during the last two centuries from the Crimea and Caucasus, since the Russian
                    conquests of those regions. They have fared very badly under Turkish rule, as is
                    attested by Captain Wilson. That tribes of Turkish origin were settled in Europe
                    long before the rise of the Ottoman power is known from the Byzantine authors,
                    who mention a colony of them (about 30,000) as early as the 10th century in the
                    Vardar valley in Macedonia.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>(3) The so-called Kizil-bashis or “Red Heads,” a nickname of the Shi'itic Turkish
                    immigrants from Persia, who are found chiefly in the plains from Kara-hissar
                    along Tokat and Amasia to Angora. During the Avars with Persia the Turkish
                    sultans forced them to settle here. They are agriculturists and highly praised
                    by several travellers for their honesty and laborious habits. (4) Turkmenian
                    tribes—Yuruks and Götchebes (words meaning “nomads” and characteristic of their
                    most distinctive quality),—who occupy the mountains in summer and descend into
                    the plains in winter, though some are settled in the plains of Cilicia near
                    Tarsus and Adana, the rest being semi-nomads. Reclus estimates the total number
                    of Turks in Europe at 1,500,000 and 35,000 Tatars. For Asia Minor statistics are
                    wanting; but P. de Tchihatchef, the chief authority for matters relating to this
                    peninsula, thinks that 6,000,000 is a failestimate for the total population,
                    including Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, &amp;c., but excluding the islands. It
                    appears therefore necessary to reduce the already moderate number of Osmanlis
                    given by Vambéry (10,000,000) to about 6,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Language.</hi></p>
                <p>The Turkish, or, as some prefer to say, the Turco-Tatar language, is a member of
                    the Ural-Altaic family (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ural-Altaic)</hi> and
                    comprehends many dialects, which differ considerably in their vocabulary and in
                    a less degree also in their grammar. The study of these dialects has made great
                    advances during the 19th century. Abel Rémusat in 1820 knew only of four, viz.,
                    the Uigurian, Jagatai, Tatar, and Osmanli. Béresine in 1848 distinguished
                    nineteen, grouped round three types, viz., (1) Jagatai dialects (Uigur, Coman,
                    Jagatai, Uzbegian, Turkmani, Kazani literary language); (2) Tatar dialects
                    (Kirghizian, Bashkiri, Nogai, Kumi, Karatchai, Kara-Kalpaki, Meshtcheryaki, and
                    Siberian); (3) Turki dialects (Derbendi, Adarbaijāni, Krimmi, Anadoli, and
                    Rumili). Böhtlingk (1851) added the Yakuti, and Shaw (1877) the Eastern Turki.
                    Radloff (1882) subdivided the one Siberian dialect of Béresine into more than a
                    dozen different dialects. On phonetic principles the last-named proposes the
                    following classification, which seems, however, not quite satisfactory: (1)
                    Oriental dialects (Altai, Baraba, Lebed, Tuba, Abakan, Küärik, Soyon, Karagass
                    dialects, and Uigur); (2) Occidental (Kirghizi, Irtish, Bashkir, and Volga
                    dialects, with numerous subdivisions); (5) Central-Asiatic (Taranji, Jagatai,
                    &amp;c.); and (4) southern (Turkmani, Adarbaijāni, Caucasian, Anadoli, Krimmi,
                    and Osmanli). It would be premature to criticise this system till the author
                    publishes the second part of his grammar, which will treat of the real
                    etymological phenomena of the north Turkish dialects.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0687-0662"/>
                <p>On the phonetical characteristics of each of these dialects ample information is
                    given in his <hi rend="italic">Phonetik der nördlichen Türk. Sprachen.</hi></p>
                <p>These great dialectical varieties are easily accounted for by the want of a
                    common Turkish literary language understood everywhere. The most developed and
                    refined Turkish tongue, that of the Osmanlis, which is very rich in literary
                    monuments, has admitted too many Arabic and Persian words, grammatical forms,
                    and even whole sentences, and has been too much spoiled by the precepts of
                    Persian rhetoric, to produce a popular literature. With the exception of some
                    tales and novels, this literature has remained an exotic production,
                    unintelligible even to the people who are supposed to speak the same language
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turkey,</hi> p. 656 above). The Jagatai and Uzbegian
                    dialects would have answered the purpose better, and present the best type of a
                    (hypothetical) general Turkish language, of which the most prominent features
                    may be here given.</p>
                <p>The Arabic alphabet is in general use, though some tribes in Russia make use of
                    Russian and others in Asia Minor of Armenian and Greek characters. But the
                    oldest Turkish alphabet, the Uigurian, is a direct transformation of the Syriac,
                    and has fourteen characters. When and by whom it was invented is uncertain; the
                    Arabic author of the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi> does not mention it, and the
                    Uigurian MSS. which we possess date for the most part from the 15th century. It
                    is commonly supposed to be the work of Nestorian missionaries, who may have
                    preached the Gospel amongst the Turks as early as the 6th or 7th century.<note

                    of Sinjibu the Turks seem to have used the Sogdian characters in their political
                    intercourse with Byzantium; but as a rule they remained illiterate till their
                    conversion to Islam. As the Semitic languages are characterized by the
                    three-radical system and the constancy of the consonants, all Ural-Altaic
                    languages are dominated by the law of vowel harmony and agglutination. We have
                    therefore in Turkish a double range of vowels, commonly eight in number, of
                    which <hi rend="italic">a, i, o, u</hi> denote the hard or guttural and <hi
                        rend="italic">ä, ï, ö, ü</hi> the soft or palatal vowels, the vowels in
                    every separate word being of the same range. The <hi rend="italic">i</hi> only
                    is in most dialects indifferent. The law of agglutination is derived from the
                    same principle, but has regard, not only to the vowels, but also to the
                    consonants and the syllables; it is an abuse of the term if it is taken to mean
                    that in Turkish no real etymology exists, but only an agglutination of themes
                    and roots.</p>
                <p>As regards the etymology we observe the absence of gender, of a separate form for
                    the dual, and of the nominative in the nouns. There are commonly five oblique
                    cases—genitive, dative, accusative, commorative, and ablative—though Böhtlingk
                    has shown that in the Yakut dialect, which distinguishes ten cases, the genitive
                    is wanting. The adjective, unless used as substantive, is uninflected both as
                    attribute and as predicate; the comparative is formed by the suffix <hi
                        rend="italic">-rak</hi> (<hi rend="italic">-rek</hi>), and takes the
                    compared noun in the ablative; the superlative has no specific form, though a
                    peculiar intensive is formed by prefixing to the adjective (though in writing
                    always as two words) a syllable beginning with the same consonant, and ending in
                    a labial <hi rend="italic">p</hi> or <hi rend="italic">m</hi>: for instance, <hi
                        rend="italic">kap kara,</hi> “intensely black”; <hi rend="italic">kip
                        kizil,</hi> “intensely red.” The decimal system has prevailed over an
                    original septimal system. The article does not exist. The relative pronoun has
                    been borrowed from the Persian in many dialects; it is absent in the original
                    Turkish. The theme of the verb is seen in the imperative, from which are derived
                    various participles and gerunds, used either separately or combined with
                    pronominal suffixes. These combinations supply the forms of the simple tenses
                    and moods, though different dialects use different forms of participle and
                    gerund for this purpose. Compound tenses and moods are expressed by means of
                    auxiliary verbs. The theme of the imperative may, by the addition of a simple
                    consonant, vowel, or syllable, be modified into a negative, passive, reflexive,
                    reciprocal, impossible, causative, or doubly causative form, which are
                    conjugated in the same manner as the original form. The causative forms again
                    admit of a passive negative, &amp;c., so that in fact the number of possible
                    verbal forms derived from a single theme has been calculated by Shaw at 29,000.
                    There are no prepositions, only postpositions.</p>
                <p>In syntax the order of the words and clauses of a period is almost the inverse of
                    what seems natural to us, the subject and its predicate being placed at the end,
                    while all hypothetical, causal, prohibitive,—in short all subordinate—clauses
                    come first. In the simple style of illiterate peasants, and in popular romances
                    and tales, this method presents no inconvenience as regards easy understanding,
                    but in the artificial, often excessively long periods of an Osmanli stylist, it
                    presents serious difficulties to a European reader.</p>
