                    But, although this lecture and Reis’s subsequent work received considerable
                    notice, little progress was made until the subject was taken up between 1874 and
                    1876 by Alexander Graham Bell, a native of Edinburgh, then resident in Boston,
                    Mass. Bell, like Reis, employed electricity for the reproduction of sounds; but
                    he attacked the problem in a totally different manner. This will be better
                    understood if we consider shortly on what the chief characteristics of sound
                    depend (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics).</hi></p>
                <p>The sensation of sound is produced by rapid fluctuations in the pressure of the
                    atmosphere on the tympanum of the ear. If the fluctuations are irregular and
                    non-periodic, the sound is called a noise; if they are cyclic and follow a
                    regular and sufficiently rapid periodic law, the sound is musical. In connexion
                    with the present subject it is important to notice the three characteristics of
                    a musical sound, namely, <hi rend="italic">pitch, loudness,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">quality.</hi> The pitch of a musical sound depends on the number
                    of cycles passed through by the fluctuations of the pressure per unit of time;
                    the loudness depends on the amount or the amplitude of the fluctuation in each
                    cycle; the quality depends on the form or the nature of the fluctuation in each
                    cycle. The necessary condition for a successful system of telephony is the
                    ability to reproduce these characteristics.</p>

                    sounding-boards of two musical instruments are connected together by a rod of
                    pine wood, a tune played on one will be faithfully reproduced by the other. This
                    only answers, however, for telephoning musical sounds to short distances.
                    Another and somewhat similar example is furnished by what has been variously
                    designated as the “string,” “toy,” “lovers,”and “mechanical” telephone. Two
                    disks of thin metal, or two stretched membranes, each furnished with a
                    mouthpiece, are connected together by a thin string or wire attached at each end
                    to the centres of the membranes. A good example may be made with two cylindrical
                    tin cups; the bottoms form the membranes and the cups the mouthpieces. When the
                    connecting string is held taut and sounds, such as those of ordinary speech, are
                    produced in front of one of the membranes, pulses corresponding to the
                    fluctuations of the atmospheric pressure are transmitted along the string and
                    communicated to the other membrane, which in its turn communicates them to the
                    air, thus reproducing the sound. In both these examples all the three
                    characteristics—pitch, relative intensity, and quality—of sound are
                    reproduced.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to the development of the application of electricity to
                    telephony. In July 1837 Dr C. G. Page of Salem, Mass., drew attention to the
                    sound given out by an electromagnet at the instant when the electric circuit is
                    closed or broken, and in October of the same year he discussed, in a short
                    article <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> entitled “Galvanic Music,” the musical
                    note produced by rapidly revolving the armature of an electromagnet in front of
                    the poles. Experiments bearing on this subject were subsequently made by a great
                    number of investigators. <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Page’s discovery is of
                    considerable importance in connexion with the theory of action of various forms
                    of telephone, and was a very important feature in the early attempts by Reis to
                    transmit music and speech. On <pb break="no"

                    writer recommended the use of a flexible plate at the source of sound, which
                    would vibrate in response to the varying pressure of the air, and thus open and
                    close an electric circuit, and of a similar plate at the receiving station,
                    which would be acted on electromagnetically and thus give out as many pulsations
                    as there are breaks in the current. These suggestions were to some extent an
                    anticipation of the work of Reis; but the conditions to be fulfilled before the
                    sounds given out at the receiving station can be similar in pitch, quality, and
                    relative intensity to those produced at the transmitting station are not stated,

                    previous to Bell’s introduction of the electric telephone as a competitor with
                    the electric telegraph. Reis caused a membrane to open and close an electric
                    circuit at each vibration, thus transmitting as many electric pulses through the
                    circuit as there were vibrations in the sound. These electric pulses were made
                    to act on an electromagnet at the receiving station, which, in accordance with
                    Page’s discovery, gave out a sound of a pitch corresponding to the number of
                    times it was magnetized or demagnetized per second. Reis’s object was to
                    reproduce at a distance not only music but also human speech; but that he did
                    not wholly succeed is clear from the following extract from his lecture:
                    “Hitherto it has not been possible to reproduce human speech with sufficient
                    distinctness. The consonants are for the most part reproduced pretty distinctly,
                    but not the vowels as yet in an equal degree.” Considering the time at which he
                    wrote, Reis seems to have understood very well the nature of the vibrations he
                    had to reproduce, but he failed to comprehend how they could be reproduced by
                    electricity. His fundamental idea—the interruption of the current—was a fatal
                    mistake, which was not at the time properly understood. The suggestion of
                    Bourseul and the experiments of Reis are founded on the idea that a succession
                    of currents, corresponding in number to the successive undulations of the
                    pressure on the membrane of the transmitting instrument, could reproduce at the
                    receiving station sounds of the same character as those produced at the sending
                    station. Neither of them seemed to recognize anything as important except pitch
                    and amplitude, and Reis thought the amplitude was to some extent obtained by the
                    varying length of contact in the transmitting instrument. This might possibly be
                    to a small extent true; but, considering the small capacity of the circuits he
                    used and the nature of his receiving instrument, it is hardly probable that
                    duration of contact sensibly influenced the result. The quality of the sounds
                    was to some extent also reproduced; but, judging from the results of recent
                    telephone investigation, it is highly probable that this was due, not to the
                    varying duration, but to the varying firmness of the contact. Since the effect
                    of the degree of contact has, through the researches of Bell, Berliner, Edison,
                    Hughes, Elisha Gray, and others, become generally understood, it has become easy
                    to make instruments very similar to those of Reis; and even his instruments,
                    with slight modification, can be made to speak fairly well. The accidental
                    transmission of words by Reis, the occasional recognition of the voice of a
                    singer, and other instances of the transmission of quality were no doubt due to
                    this element, the existence of or the necessity for which was never, so far as
                    the present writer knows, hinted at by Reis.</p>
                <p>The next worker at the telephone, and the one to whom the present great
                    commercial importance of the instrument is due, was Bell. His aim was the
                    production, by means of the undulations of pressure on a membrane caused by
                    sound, of an electric current the strength of which should at every instant vary
                    directly as the pressure varied.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    >iτιJourn. Soc. Tel. Eng.,</hi> 31st October 1877.</p></note> His first idea
                    seems to have been to employ the vibrations of the current in an electric
                    circuit, produced by moving the armature of an electromagnet included in the
                    circuit nearer to or farther from the poles of the magnet. He proposed to make
                    the armature partake of the vibrations of the atmosphere either by converting it
                    into a suitable vibrator or by controlling its vibrations by a stretched
                    membrane of parchment. In the early trials the armature had the form of a hinged
                    lever of iron carrying a stud at one end, which pressed against the centre of a
                    stretched membrane. The experiments with this form were not successful, and,
                    with the view of making the moving parts as light as possible, he substituted
                    for the comparatively heavy lever armature a small piece of clock spring, about
                    the size of a sixpence, glued to the centre of the diaphragm. The magnet was
                    mounted with its end carrying the coil opposite, and very close to, the centre
                    of the piece of clock spring. This answered sufficiently well to prove the
                    feasibility of the plan, and subsequent experiments were directed to the
                    discovery of the best form and arrangement of the parts. An increase in the size
                    of the iron disk attached to the membrane augmented both the loudness and the
                    distinctness of the sounds, and this finally led to the adoption of the thin
                    iron disk now in use, which is supported round its edge, and acts as both
                    membrane and armature. Again, the form of the opening or mouthpiece in front of
                    the membrane exercised considerable influence on the efficiency of the
                    instrument, and it was ultimately ascertained that a small central opening, with
                    a thin air space extending across the face of the membrane, was best. It was
                    also found that comparatively small magnets -were sufficient, and that there was
                    no particular virtue in the closed circuit and electromagnet, but that a small
                    permanent magnet having one pole in contact with the end of the core of a short
                    electromagnet, the coil of which was in circuit with the line, but which had no
                    permanent current flowing through it, answered the purpose quite as well.<note

                    keeping a permanent current flowing through the line and the coils of the
                    electromagnet was to keep the core of the electro-magnet magnetized. This seems
                    to have been almost simultaneously pointed out by Bell and others who were
                    working in conjunction with him and by Professor Dolbear. Many experiments were
                    made for ascertaining the best length of wire to use in the coil of the
                    transmitting and the receiving instrument; but this is clearly a question

                <p>A telephone transmitter and a receiver on a novel plan were patented in July 1877
                    by Edison, shortly after the introduction of Bell’s instruments. The receiver
                    was based on the change of friction produced by the passage of an electric
                    current through the point of contact of certain substances in relative motion.
                    In one form a drum, mounted on an axis and covered by a band of paper soaked in
                    a solution of caustic potash, is turned under a spring the end of which is in
                    contact through a platinum point with the paper. The spring is attached to the
                    centre of a diaphragm in such a way that, when the drum is turned, the friction
                    between the point of the spring and the paper deflects the diaphragm. The
                    current from the line is made to pass through the spring and paper to the
                    cylinder. Now it had been previously shown by Edison that, when a current is
                    made to pass through an arrangement like that just described, the friction
                    between the paper and the spring is greatly diminished. Hence, when the
                    undulating telephonic currents are made to pass through the apparatus, the
                    constant variation of the friction of the spring causes the deflexions of the
                    diaphragm to vary in unison with the variation of the electric currents, and
                    sounds are given out corresponding in pitch, and also to some extent in quality,
                    with the sounds produced at the transmitting station. A cylinder of chalk was
                    used in some of Edison’s later experiments with this receiver. The transmitter
                    is illustrated (see fig. 10) and described (p. 132) below.</p>
                <p>Experiments very similar to these of Edison were made by Elisha Gray of Boston,
                    Mass., and described by him in papers communicated to the American Electrical
                    Society in 1875 and 1878. In these experiments the electric current passed
                    through the fingers of the operator’s hand, which thus took the place of the
                    spring in Edison’s apparatus. The diaphragm was itself used as the rubbing
                    surface, and it was either mounted and rotated or the fingers were moved over
                    it. When the current passed, the friction was felt to increase, and the effect
                    of sending a rapidly undulating current through the arrangement was to produce a
                    sound. The application of this apparatus to the transmission of music is
                    described by Gray.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    by Cromwell F. Varley, who proposed to make use of it in a telegraphic receiving
                    instrument.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    instrument one plate of a condenser is a flexible diaphragm, connected with the
                    telephone line in such a way that the varying electric potential produced by the
                    action of the transmitting telephone causes an increased or diminished charge in
                    the condenser. This alteration of charge causes a corresponding change in the
                    mutual attraction of the plates of the condenser; hence the flexible plate is
                    made to copy the vibrations of the diaphragm of the transmitter. It is obvious
                    that this apparatus may be used either as a transmitter or as a receiver, but
                    that the effects must under ordinary circumstances be in either case extremely
                    feeble.</p>
                <p>In the Reis instruments the transmitter and receiver are separate parts, which
                    are not interchangeable. The Bell telephone can be used either as a transmitter
                    or as a receiver. The Edison receiver and the Dolbear condenser were only
                    intended to be used as receiving instruments.</p>
                <p>It was very early recognized—and, indeed, is mentioned in the first patents of
                    Bell, and in a caveat filed by Elisha Gray in the United States patent office
                    only some two hours after Bell’s application for a patent—that sounds and spoken
                    words might be transmitted to a distance by causing the vibrations of a
                    diaphragm to vary the resistance in the circuit. Both Bell and Gray proposed to
                    do this by introducing a column of liquid into the circuit, the length or the
                    resistance of which could be varied by causing the vibrations of the diaphragm
                    to vary the depth of immersion of a light rod fixed to it and dipping into the
                    liquid (see figs. 8, 9 below). This idea has been perhaps the most fruitful of
                    any modification of telephonic apparatus introduced.</p>
                <p>On 4th April 1877 Mr Emile Berliner filed a caveat in the United States patent
                    office, in which he stated that, on the principle of the variation with pressure
                    of the resistance at the contact of two conductors, he had made an instrument
                    which could be used as a telephone transmitter, and that, in consequence of the
                    mutual forces between the two parts of the current on the two sides of the point
                    of contact, the instrument was capable of acting as a receiver. The caveat was
                    illustrated by a sketch showing a diaphragm with a metal patch in the centre,
                    against which a metal knob was lightly pressed by an adjusting screw. This seems
                    to have been the first transmitter in which it was proposed to use the
                    resistance at the contact of two conductors.</p>
                <p>Almost simultaneously with Berliner, Edison conceived the idea of using a
                    variable resistance transmitter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to introduce into the circuit a cell containing carbon powder, the pressure on
                    which could be varied by the vibrations of a diaphragm. He sometimes held the
                    carbon powder against the diaphragm in a small shallow cell (from a quarter to
                    half an inch in diameter and about an eighth of an inch deep), and sometimes he
                    used what he describes as a <hi rend="italic">fuff,</hi> that is, a little brush
                    of silk fibre with plumbago rubbed into it. In another form the plumbago powder
                    was worked into a button cemented together with syrup and other substances. In
                    the specification of the patent applied for on 21st July 1877 he showed a sketch
                    of an instrument which consisted of a diaphragm, with a small platinum patch in
                    the centre for an electrode, against which a hard point, made of plumbago powder
                    cemented together with india-rubber and vulcanized, was pressed by a long
                    spring, the pressure of the carbon against the platinum disk being adjusted by a
                    straining screw near the base of the spring. Subsequently he filed an
                    application for a patent in which various forms of springs and weights assisted
                    in maintaining the contacts and otherwise improved the instrument.</p>
                <p>In the early part of 1878 Professor Hughes, while engaged in experiments upon a
                    Bell telephone in an electric circuit, discovered that a peculiar noise was
                    produced whenever two hard electrodes, such as two wires, were drawn across each
                    other, or were made to touch each other with a variable degree of firmness.
                    Acting upon this discovery, he constructed an instrument which he called a
                    microphone,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This term
                    was used by Wheatstone in 1827 for an acoustic apparatus intended to convert

                    Papers,</hi> p. 32.</p></note> and which consisted essentially (see fig. 11) of
                    two hard carbon electrodes placed in contact, with a current passing through the
                    point of contact and a telephone included in the same circuit. One of the
                    electrodes was attached to a sounding board capable of being vibrated by
                    soundwaves, and the other was held either by springs or weights of these
                    modifications, see Du Moncel, “Le Téléphone,” in <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque

                <p>in delicate contact with it. "When the sounding board was spoken to or subjected
                    to sound-waves, the mechanical resistance of the loose electrode, due to its
                    weight, or the spring, or both, served to vary the pressure at the contact, and
                    this gave to the current a <hi rend="italic">form</hi> corresponding to the
                    sound-waves, and it was therefore capable of being used as a speaking-telephone

                    Hughes’s apparatus. A microphonie apparatus very similar to it is described in
                    the specification of a German patent taken out by Robert Lutdge on 12th January
                    1878. In this patent the action of the microphone is also described.<note

                    prior to Hughes’s publications, it does not follow that the descriptions were
                    filed before these.</p></note></p>
                <p>The next transmitter of note, introduced by Mr Francis Blake, U.S. (see fig. 13
                    below), although it does not, like the first microphones, embody anything
                    intrinsically new, is one of the most perfect and convenient forms of
                    microphone. It is at present almost universally used in the United States.</p>
                <p>It appears to be pretty well established that carbon in one form or another is
                    the best material for one or both of the contacts of a microphone transmitter.
                    When both the contacts are of carbon and the surfaces have considerable area,
                    say from a quarter to half an inch in diameter, the sounds are loud, but have a
                    tendency to harshness. "When, as in the Blake transmitter, one of the contacts
                    is a piece of polished gas carbon and the other a small sphere of platinum about
                    the twentieth of an inch in diameter, the articulation is clear, but less loud.
                    F or most purposes, however, the increased clearness more than compensates for
                    the diminished loudness. Many transmitters in actual use—as, for instance, the
                    “Gower,” largely employed in the United Kingdom—have a number of contacts. Some
                    of these when properly adjusted are both loud and clear in their action.
                    Although the Blake instrument is most in vogue in America, in the United Kingdom
                    and on the Continent multiple contact microphones have found more favour. Carbon
                    powder instruments have been to some extent used, and in one or two cases—as,
                    for example, the Hunnings transmitter—with considerable success. The fault in
                    most of them is the tendency of the powder to “pack,” which causes the
                    instrument to rapidly lose sensibility. In the Hunnings transmitter this
                    difficulty is to a large extent overcome by the use of a coarse granular powder
                    in a somewhat large cell (about an inch in diameter and from one-eighth to
                    one-fourth of an inch deep). The front face of the cell is a piece of platinum
                    foil, which serves both as an electrode and as a diaphragm. The cell is placed
                    either on edge or in an inclined position when in use, the action being
                    precisely similar to that in other transmitters. In addition to its freedom from
                    packing, the carbon, in consequence of the inclined position of the cell, is
                    also less liable to fall away from the electrode and break the circuit. Some
                    packing of the powder, however, does occur, and several modifications have been
                    proposed by Blake and others for making the sound vibrations stir the powder and
                    keep it loose. Good results appear to have been got by placing the cell mouth
                    downwards, the carbon powder lying on the platinum foil, and by forming the
                    upper electrode either of wire gauze or of a perforated plate completely
                    immersed in the powder. The sound vibrations are conveyed to the bottom of the
                    cell by a bent tube communicating with a mouthpiece. Instruments of this class
                    are very loud-speaking, and therefore very serviceable for long or disturbed
                    circuits.</p>
                <p>The radiophone is an instrument proposed by A. G. Bell and Sumner Tainter in 1880
                    for utilizing radiant energy, such as light or radiant heat, for the
                    transmission of sound. The apparatus forms a telephone transmitter of a
                    particularly interesting kind. In the earlier papers describing it and the
                    experiments which led to its invention it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >phatophone,</hi> because at that time the effects were supposed to be wholly
                    due to light. Afterwards, in order to avoid ambiguity, Bell changed the name to
                    <hi rend="italic">radiophone</hi> and suggested that, to distinguish between
                    instruments depending on the different kinds of radiation, the names <hi

                    proposed the name <hi rend="italic">spectrophone</hi> for an application of this

                    that, if a beam of light proceeding from one station could be made to fall on a
                    selenium plate at another station, and if its intensity could be varied by the
                    voice of a speaker, then by connecting a telephone and a battery in circuit with
                    the selenium plate the words spoken at the distant station would be heard in the
                    telephone. This was found to be the case. At first, to vary the intensity of the
                    beam, it was passed through a small opening, the width of which could be varied
                    by the vibrations of a diaphragm against which the speech was directed. But
                    better results were afterwards obtained when the diaplft·agm formed a mirror
                    from which the beam of light was reflected. The spreading of the beam, due to
                    the vibrations of the mirror diaphragm, served to vary its intensity (see fig.
                    18 below).</p>
                <p>Edison’s phonograph (see fig. 19 below) is an instrument whose action somewhat
                    resembles that of a telephone transmitter and which has been much talked of in
                    regard to its possible applications in telephony. It was invented shortly after
                    the introduction of the telephone for the purpose of recording sounds, and was
                    included in some of Edison’s telephone patents as a means of working a telephone
                    transmitter, and thus telephoning sounds which had been previously recorded on
                    the phonograph sheets.</p>

                    with the terminal <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The receiver consists of an
                    electromagnet made up of a magnetizing coil H, with a stout knitting needle for
                    a core. When in use these two instruments are joined in circuit with a battery
                    B, so that under ordinary circumstances a continuous current is flowing through
                    the line. Suppose a sound is then produced in front of the mouthpiece M, the
                    successive variations in the pressure of the air are communicated to the inside
                    of the box, and cause the membrane to vibrate in unison with the sound. Reis’s
                    theory of the action of the instrument was that at each outward impulse of the
                    membrane the point <hi rend="italic">g</hi> would be thrown out of contact with
                    the plate underneath it and would thus break the circuit. There would
                    consequently result as many breaks in the circuit as there were vibrations in
                    the sound, and, in conformity with Page’s discovery, the electromagnetic
                    receiver would give out a rapid succession of beats, which would together form a
                    continuous sound of the same pitch as that to which the transmitter was
                    subjected.</p>
                <p>Fig. 2 shows the first telephone made by Bell for transmitting speech. It
                    consisted of a wooden frame F, to one side of which a tube T was fixed; over the
                    end of the tube a membrane M was stretched taut by a stretching ring R. To the
                    opposite side of the frame and with its axis in line with that of the tube T was
                    fixed an electromagnet H, and between the membrane M and the end of the
                    electromagnet a hinged armature A was arranged in such a way that its motions
                    would be controlled by the membrane. The instrument was joined in circuit with a
                    battery and another similar instrument placed at a distance. A continuous
                    current was made to flow through the circuit, which kept the electromagnet
                    magnetized. Bell reasoned thus: when words are spoken in front of the tube T the
                    membrane will be set in vibration and with it the armature A, and the vibration
                    of the armature in front of the electromagnet will induce variations in the line
                    current; their magnitude will be proportional to the amplitude, and their
                    frequency to the frequency, of the vibrations of the armature; in fact, the
                    difference between the actual and the average current in the circuit will be at
                    each instant proportional to the rate of motion of the armature. It follows from
                    this that the armature and membrane of the distant instrument should have
                    induced in them a motion precisely similar to that of the membrane of the
                    transmitter. This telephone was made in June 1875, but was put aside after trial
                    as unsatisfactory on account of the feebleness of the sounds it produced; since
                    then, however, a successful telephone has been made on precisely the same plan
                    as that here indicated.</p>
                <p>The next form tried is shown in fig. 3. It is very similar except in constructive
                    details to the first; the hinged armature, however, is omitted, its place being
                    taken by a small iron disk A fixed to the centre of the diaphragm D. The
                    electromagnet H is, as before, placed so as to have the centre of the soft iron
                    core C opposite to the centre of the disk, and the theory according to which it
                    was expected to act is the same. The results obtained with this instrument were
                    much more satisfactory; indeed it was with one precisely like that shown in the
                    figure that the remarkable results of the Philadelphia exhibition in 1876 were
                    obtained. A perspective and a sectional view of the receiving instrument used
                    along with that shown in fig.</p>

                    through the axis of which a rod of soft iron C was passed to form the core of an
                    electromagnet, having the magnetizing helix H wound on the upper half of its
                    length. Across the top of the box a thin disk D of soft iron was fixed, the core
                    C being just clear of the disk when the strongest current is flowing through the
                    helix. In the perspective view the disk is removed, showing the end of the core.
                    These instruments are interesting, not only because they may be considered the
                    first really successful speaking telephones, but because they are of the same
                    form as those brought to Great Britain in 1876 by Sir W. Thomson, and exhibited
                    before the British Association at Glasgow in that year.</p>
                <p>Fig. 6 shows one of the earliest forms brought into commercial use. On each pole
                    of a somewhat large horse-shoe permanent magnet</p>
                <p>M a short coil E with a soft iron core was fixed. This is one of the early forms
                    of permanent magnet telephones, of which there were at that time several,
                    including a hand telephone very similar to that shown in fig. 7. In another
                    form, introduced about the end of 1877, the small magnetizing coils and soft
                    iron cores were fixed on the side and opposite the poles of the horse-shoe
                    magnet, and the diaphragm was placed with its plane parallel to that of the
                    magnet. The diaphragm in these telephones was of thin sheet iron and a little
                    over <hi rend="italic">4</hi> inches in diameter.</p>
                <p>The form of telephone now almost universally in use is shown in fig. 7. It was
                    introduced in December 1877 and consists of a compound permanent <hi
                    rend="underline">g⅞g¾</hi> magnet M, fitted into the centre of a tube of
                    vulcanite or “hard rubber” and carrying at one end a short electromagnet, the
                    coil of which through its terminals <hi rend="italic">t, t</hi> is included in
                    the circuit when the instrument is in use. In front of the electromagnet, with
                    its plane normal to the axis of the magnet, is fixed a thin soft iron disk about
                    11 inches in diameter, which has its corer cut to a convenient shape to form a
                    mouthpiece. This telephone acts well either as a transmitter or as a receiver;
                    but for the former purpose it is now seldom used on account of the great
                    advances which have been made in “microphone” transmitters.</p>
                <p>It has been stated that Bell and Elisha Gray almost simultaneously suggested the
                    use of a column of liquid to vary the resistance in the circuit. The form of
                    instrument proposed by the former and said to have been exhibited at the
                    Philadelphia exhibition is shown in fig. 8. It consists of a speaking tube or
                    mouthpiece M, across the lower end of which a membrane D is stretched. To the
                    centre of the membrane a light rod R, made of metal or of carbon, is fixed with
                    its length at right angles to the plane of the membrane. Under the lower end of
                    R a small metallic vessel C is supported on a threaded rod, working in a nut
                    fixed to the sole F, so that its height may be readily adjusted. Suppose C to be
                    filled with water or any other conducting liquid, and the rod R to be of metal.
                    C is raised until the liquid just touches the point of the rod, when advantage
                    is taken of the change of contact resistance with the greater or less immersion
                    of R during the vibration of D. Good results were obtained with mercury as the
                    liquid and with a rod of carbon.</p>
                <p>The arrangement proposed by Elisha Gray is almost identical in form with Bell’s.
                    The only difference seems to be that Gray intended the rod R (fig. 9) to reach
                    near to the bottom of the vessel B or to the end of another rod, a prolongation
                    of <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> projecting up from the bottom. The variation of the
                    current was produced by the variation of the distance between the ends of the
                    rod caused by the vibrations of the diaphragm. This plan was not tried until
                    after the success of Bell’s experiments was known, and when it was <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n143/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0143-0132"/> tried the results did not prove encouraging.
                    Indeed the variations of the resistance which can be produced in this way must
                    be excessively small, unless the liquid has a very high specific resistance, the
                    distance between the ends is very small, and the sides of the rods are prevented
                    by an insulating covering from interfering with the results. Neither of these
                    transmitters has any great merit as such, but they show that both Bell and Gray
                    clearly recognized the principle on which successful transmission of the
                    different forms of sound, including speech, could be accomplished.</p>
                <p>The first successful microphone transmitter was Edison’s. An early form of it
                    (fig. 10) somewhat resembles Bell’s hand tele phone in external form. A</p>
                <p>cell of insulating material has at its bottom a flat-headed platinum screw G; on
                    the top of G is a layer of carbon powder C, on the top of that a thin platinum
                    disk</p>
                <p>D, and above that, forming the cover of the cell, a disk of ivory B, held in
                    position by a ring E. Resting on the centre of this disk is a small piece of
                    rubber tubing, which is lightly pressed by the diaphragm A, and this, as in the
                    hand telephone, is held in positionbythemouthpiece</p>
                <p>Μ. The varying pressure on A, when a sound is produced near it, causes
                    corresponding variations in the pressure on the carbon powder, and this produces
                    similar variations in its electrical resistance. Thus, when the instrument is
                    ineluded in an electric circuit through which a current is flowing, undulations
                    in the pressure on the diaphragm produce corresponding undulations in the
                    current.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the best known forms of the microphone are those introduced by Prof.
                    Hughes. One of the commonest is shown in fig. 11. It consists of two rectangular
                    pieces of wood, B and D, fixed to gether with their planes at right angles to
                    each other. D forms the base, and to B two small blocks of carbon C, C are
                    attached. Between these a light rod A of the same material is supported on small
                    cups formed in C, C. To the blockstwo electrodes are connected for the pur-pose
                    of inserting the instrument in an electric circuit. The material which Hughes
                    found most suitable for the carbon blocks and rod was wood charcoal metallized
                    by heating it to redness and plunging it while hot into mercury. If this
                    microphone is joined in circuit with a telephone and a small battery, say one or
                    two small Daniell cells, the vibration produced by a fly walking on the base D
                    can be distinctly heard in the telephone. The same apparatus will also act as a
                    microphone transmitter, but the sounds are apt to be harsh. A better form for
                    this purpose is shown in fig. 12. In this a light pencil of carbon M pivoted at
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and has one end resting on two blocks of carbon c, c,
                    the lower one being fixed to the base.</p>
                <p>The pressure of M on the carbon block is regulated by a spring <hi rend="italic"
                    >s.</hi> This arrangement is enclosed in a box of thin wood, against which the
                    sound is directed. It is capable of acting well as a transmitter, and especially
                    in a modified form used by Hughes as a microphone receiver. The lower block c is
                    then attached to the centre of a vertical diaphragm and against it the sounds
                    are directed.</p>
                <p>The Blake transmitter, which is perhaps most widely used of all, is a simple
                    modification of the Hughes instrument last described. It consists (fig. 13) of a
                    frame F, to which is attached a diaphragm D of thin sheet iron; in front of this
                    is a cover Μ, M provided with a suitable cavity for directing the sound-waves
                    against the diaphragm. The microphonie arrangement consists of a spring S, about
                    the hundredth of an inch thick and the eighth of an inch broad, fixed at one end
                    to a lever L, and carrying at its free extremity a brass block W. In one side of
                    W a small disk C of gas carbon is inserted, resting on the hemispherical end of
                    a small platinum pin K, about the twentieth of an inch in diameter, held in
                    position by a thin spring A. The pressure of the carbon on the platinum point
                    can be adjusted by the screw N, which turns the lever about the flexible joint
                    G. The electrical connexions of the instrument as arranged for actual use are
                    also illustrated in the figure. The current circuit goes through S, W, C, K, A,
                    and the primary circuit of the induction coil I to the battery B, and thence to
                    S again. This forms a local circuit at the transmitting station. The line of
                    circuit passes through the secondary of the induction coil I to the line, from
                    that to the telephone T at the receiving station, and then either to earth or
                    back to the induction coil by a return line of wire.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Telephonic Circuits.</hi></p>
                <p>The lines used for telephone purposes are, generally speaking, so far as
                    erection, mode of insulation, and so on ate concerned, much the same as those
                    used for ordinary telegraphs. In towns where a very large number of wires
                    radiate from one centre or exchange, as it is called, where thick wires are
                    unsightly, and where it is often necessary to provide for long spans, a
                    comparatively thin wire of strong material is employed. For this reason various
                    bronzes, such as silicon, aluminium, &amp;c., have come to be extensively used
                    for making wires for telephone lines. They are made from about the twentieth to
                    the thirtieth of an inch in diameter, and are found to wear well in the somewhat
                    mixed atmosphere of a town; and owing to their lightness and considerable
                    tensile strength it is comparatively easy to erect them and keep them in order.
                    The main objection to them is the high electrical resistance they oppose to the
                    current. The lines on a town exchange system are not, however, as a rale, so
                    long as to make this objection of great importance. But long lines, such as
                    those extending between towns some miles apart, should be made of pure copper
                    wire hard drawn. It has lately been found possible to draw copper so hard as to
                    be almost equal to bronze in strength, and yet to retain about three times the
                    electric conductivity of that substance. Copper and bronze wires possess great
                    advantages for telephonic purposes over the iron wires employed in telegraph
                    lines, in that they offer a much lower effective resistance to the rapidly
                    undulating and intermittent currents produced by telephonic transmitters. The
                    electric resistance opposed by a wire to the passage of such a current is always
                    greater than that opposed to a steady current, and this difference is much more
                    marked when the wire is of magnetic material like iron. This increased
                    resistance rises in proportion to the rapidity of the undulations of the
                    current; consequently high notes are more resisted than low notes. Besides this
                    variable resistance, telephony has to contend with “self-induction” (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 76 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>)
                    of the current on itself, and this is by no means unimportant, especially on
                    long circuits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    circuits is plainly shown by the fact that Rysselberg and others have spoken
                    clearly to a distance of over 1000 miles through a copper wire insulated on
                    poles, whereas Preece could not work a similar line of iron wire between London
                    and Manchester.</p>
                <p>The electrostatic capacity of the line (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Telegraph,</hi>
                    p. 115 above) is also diminished by the use of thin wires of highly conducting
                    material. They should all if possible be erected on poles at a considerable
                    height above the earth. It is not practicable to work an ordinary underground

                    100 miles may in the present state of science be put down as an
                    impossibility.</p>

                    attended to in ordinary telegraph circuits, is the induction from one line to
                    another (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> vol. viii. p. 76 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.</hi>). When two lines having, as in ordinary telegraphy, an
                    earth connexion at each end run for any great distance, say a mile or more,
                    parallel to each other on the same supports, a conversation which is being
                    earned on through one of them can be overheard by means of the telephones on the
                    other. This is due to the fact that, when a current is suddenly set up in one
                    closed circuit, it induces an instantaneous current in any other closed circuit
                    which is near to it. This induced current not only destroys the privacy of the
                    circuit in question but also lowers its efficiency. The mischief is even greater
                    when telegraph and telephone lines run along the same route supported on the
                    same poles, because the strong intermittent currents sent through telegraph
                    wires, and the irregular manner in which the intermittences follow each other,
                    induce a series of such powerful secondary currents in the telephone lines that
                    the noise heard in the telephone is often sufficient, when the line is a mile or
                    two long, to drown all speech. In the case of parallel telephone lines the best,
                    if not the only, cure is to use return wires, and arrange them so that the
                    currents induced in the outgoing wire shall be neutralized by the corresponding
                    current induced in the incoming wire. For mixed telegraph and telephone circuits
                    various methods have been proposed; but the most generally approved plan is to
                    have return wires. For circuits worked wholly on the return principle the main
                    thing to be attended to is the symmetrical arrangement of the wires, so that the
                    outgoing and incoming wires may be subjected to the same influence. This is
                    nearly provided for by running them in such a way that they may be all supposed
                    to lie on the surface of a cylinder in lines parallel to its axis, the two wires
                    at the opposite ends of a diameter being always used for the same circuit. When
                    more than four wires form the group complete compensation is not obtained in
                    this way, because the current is always stronger near the transmitting end of
                    the line than near the receiving end, on account of the very sensible effect of
                    the capacity and the leakage of the line. It is therefore best to arrange the
                    wires in groups of four —that is, in pairs of circuits—and run them so as to
                    form spiral lines round an axial line equidistant from each of the four wires.
                    Any pair of λvires forming a circuit which runs parallel to other wires can be
                    aιτanged so as to be very nearly free from induction by interchanging their
                    position relatively to the other wires at short distances along the line. Care
                    must, however, be taken, when more than one group of four or when more than one
                    pair are run, that the compensation produced by the twisted arrangement of one
                    set, or of the interchanges of the wires in the different pairs, is not spoiled
                    by the twisting or interchanging of another set or pair. Telephone lines running
                    parallel to telegraph lines should be formed into one or more groups, each being
                    ran on the twist plan so as to eliminate as completely as possible the effect of
                    the telegraph signals; the small residual effect of the telephone signals is of
                    comparatively little importance in such a case. A twisted cable of telephone
                    wire may, when each circuit is formed by diametrically opposite wires, be placed
                    in the same tube with similar cables employed for telegraph purposes. The
                    central wire of the cable may be used either as a telegraph line or as a
                    telephone line having an earth return. Another method is to use powerful
                    telephone transmitters and insensitive receivers; that is to say, make the
                    telephone currents so powerful that the telegraphic induced currents will be
                    small in comparison, and use receivers so insensitive as to suit such currents.
                    One of the main obstacles in the way of this method at present is the difficulty
                    of getting strong telephonic currents, for even the best transmitters are not
                    yet sufficiently powerful, and there is, besides, a decided tendency towards a
                    loss of quality in the sound when the transmitter is made powerful. A third
                    method is to render the telegraphic current comparatively harmless by taking
                    away the suddenness of the intermittences. This is quite possible because the
                    number of currents sent per second, even on fast working circuits, is not such
                    as to produce a high musical note. If, then, the currents be made in some way to
                    rise slowly to their full strength and fall again slowly to zero the diaphragm
                    of the receiving instrument, instead of showing the sudden rise and sudden fall
                    as at present, would move so slowly backwards and forwards that the ear would
                    not be disturbed by the sound. Perhaps the simplest way to accomplish this is to
                    place an electromagnet in the circuit of the telegraph line at the sending
                    station, for the self-induction of the magnet coil prevents the current assuming
                    its strength suddenly. But on telegraph circuits where speed is of great
                    importance this method cannot be followed owing to the retardation of the
                    telegraph signals and the consequent loss of speed thereby occasioned.</p>
                <p>An ingenious application of the method of compensation just indicated has been
                    made by Rysselberg, who has used not only wires carried on the same poles as the
                    telegraph but even the telegraph lines themselves for telephone purposes. The
                    arrangement of his system is shown in fig. 14, where L and L <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> represent two telegraph lines. Between these, at each
                    end, are inserted two condensers C <hi rend="subscript"> υ</hi> C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and a telephone T, together with transmitters, &amp;c.,
                    so that, supposing the telegraph instruments removed, the two wires would be an
                    ordinary telephone circuit worked through condensers. The telegraph apparatus
                    consists of an ordinary receiver R, sending battery B, and key K, together with
                    a condenser C, inserted between the earth and the line terminal of the key, and
                    two electromagnetic. inductors E. F.'.</p>
                <p>When the key is depressed the current is retarded by the electromagnet E and the
                    condenser C, which has to be charged, giving in fact additional electrostatic
                    capacity at the sending end of the line. The current is still further retarded
                    by the electromagnet E'; hence the condenser C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    becomes charged so gradually that very little disturbance is noticeable in the
                    telephone T. The condensers C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> prevent leakage from one line to the other, but have
                    sufficient capacity to allow the telephone to act as if it were in a metallic
                    circuit.</p>
                <p>7‰ <hi rend="italic">Working of Telephone Circuits.</hi></p>
                <p>The method first employed for working a telephone line was extremely simple. A
                    single line of wire, like an ordinary telegraph line, had a Bell telephone
                    included in it at each end and the ends were put to earth. Words spoken to the
                    telephone at one end could be heard by holding the telephone to the ear at the
                    other. To obviate the inconvenience of placing the telephone to the mouth and
                    the ear alternately, two telephones were commonly used at each end, joined
                    either parallel to each other or in series. The contrivance most generally
                    adopted for calling attention is the call bell, rung either by a small
                    magneto-electric machine or by a battery. The telephone was switched out of
                    circuit when not in use and the bell put in its place, an ordinary key being
                    used for putting the battery in circuit to make the signal. This arrangement is
                    still employed, a hook being attached to the switch lever so that the mere
                    hanging up of the telephone puts the bell in circuit. In some cases, when the
                    bell is rung by a magneto machine, the coil of the machine is automatically cut
                    out of circuit when it is not in action, but the turning of the handle moves a
                    centrifugal arrangement by which it is thrown in.</p>
                <p>At first it was usual to employ the same instrument both as transmitter and as
                    receiver, and to join it in the direct circuit. But it was soon found that the
                    microphone transmitter could only be used to advantage in this way when the
                    total resistance of the circuit, exclusive of the microphone, was small compared
                    with the resistance of the microphone,—that is, on very short lines worked with
                    low resistance telephones. The transmitter on long and high resistance lines
                    worked better by joining indirectly in a local circuit, in the manner shown in
                    fig. 13, the microphone, a battery, and the primary of an induction coil, and
                    putting the line in circuit with the secondary of the induction coil, which
                    acted as the transmitter. The resistance of the microphone can thus be made a
                    large fraction of the total resistance of the circuit in which it is placed;
                    hence, by using considerable currents, small variations in its resistance can be
                    made to induce somewhat powerful currents in the line wire. The requisite energy
                    is derived from the battery. If there are other resistances in the circuit it
                    is, in some cases, better to join it as a shunt to the primary circuit of the
                    induction coil. It may even prove advantageous to insert resistances in the
                    circuit, increase the battery power, and join the microphone as here indicated,
                    because in this way powerful currents can be obtained in the line without the
                    harshness which is apt to be produced by the variations of a strong current
                    passing through the microphone.</p>
                <p>Translation from one fine to another, or from one section to another of the same
                    line, is effected by putting the primary of an induction coil in the place of
                    the receiving telephone, the secondary being in circuit with the second line or
                    section. This plan is useful where the same message is to be sent to different
                    places at once (distributed), and is sometimes used for translating from a
                    double wire to a single wire system. Probably a better plan is to work a
                    microphone by the membrane of the receiving telephone, and retransmit the
                    message, taking new energy from a second battery.<note anchored="true"

                    suit the circuits, so that either coil may be used as primary, according to the
                    end from which the message is sent. Everything else being similar, the
                    resistances of the coils should be in nearly the same ratio as the resistances
                    of the lines in which they are placed.</p>
                <p>In a large town it is neither practicable nor desirable to connect each
                    subscriber directly with all the other subscribers, hence a system of
                    “exchanges” has been adopted. An exchange is a central station to which wires
                    are brought from the different subscribers, any two of whom can be put in
                    telephonic communication with each otheι when the proper pairs of wires are
                    joined together in the exchange<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n145/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0145-0134"/>. The arrangement is illustrated in fig. 15, where
                    C represents an exchange from which wires radiate to the points α, <hi
                    rend="italic">b, c, d, . . .</hi> Suppose <hi rend="italic">a</hi> wishes to
                    speak to <hi rend="italic">d</hi>; he communicates his wish to an attendant at
                    C, who first calls <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and then connects 6 to 1, making
                    the circuit continuous from <hi rend="italic">α</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >d.</hi> The arrangements at the exchange for facilitating connexions vary
                    considerably, but are similar in principle to the switch boards used in
                    telegraphy. Each of the wires is first brought to an indicator and then to a set
                    of terminals arranged in an orderly manner on a board, the number of the
                    terminal for any one wire being the same as the number under the shutter of the
                    indicator in that wire circuit. In many cases the terminals take the form of
                    spring clips, which connect the line to earth, and under which a thin piece of
                    metal, covered with insulating material on one side and called a “jack,” can be
                    readily inserted for connecting that circuit with any other. A piece of flexible
                    wire cord, carrying a jack at each end, forms a ready and common medium of
                    connexion; but in many cases the switch board is arranged with cross strips of
                    metal so that by inserting a jack into the terminals of the two wires they can
                    be both connected to the same strip of metal and therefore together. In large
                    exchanges one switch board of moderate size is not sufficient, and so a number
                    are fitted, being connected together by several conductors, in order that no
                    interruption may ensue in consequence of these being all occupied. A line on one
                    board is connected with one on another board by joining the terminal of the
                    first to one of the conductors connecting the two boards by a jack-cord, and
                    then by another jack-cord connecting that conductor to the terminal of the other
                    line. Thus different switch boards may be looked upon as separate exchanges,
                    connected together by a number of trunk wires after the manner described
                    below.</p>
                <p>In a large system it is much more convenient and economical to have exchanges in
                    the various districts, and connect these with a central exchange by a sufficient
                    number of trunk lines. A subscriber in one district wishing to speak to a
                    subscriber in another calls the exchange in his own district and is put in
                    communication by the attendant stationed there with the central exchange. The
                    attendant at the central exchange puts the subscriber in communication with the
                    district he requires, and the attendant there calls the other subscriber and
                    joins the two subscribers’ lines together. In some cases neighbouring district
                    exchanges have, besides a common means of communication through the central
                    exchange, an independent connexion. These arrangements are diagrammatically
                    illustrated in fig. 16, where 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 represent district exchanges and
                    C the central exchange; districts 3 and 4 and 4 and 5 are supposed to have
                    independent connexions.</p>
                <p>An arrangement was proposed about two years ago by Mr D. Sinclair of the Glasgow
                    telephone exchange for allowing small district exchanges to be worked by the
                    attendants at the central exchange.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">Proc. Phil. Soc. of Glasgow,</hi> vol.
                    xvii. p. 39.</p></note> The two exchanges are connected by a tπιnk line and from
                    the district exchange wires are led to the different subscribers. These wires
                    are in the normal state of matters connected with contact plates, over which an
                    arm joined to the trunk wire can be made to travel. Suppose the central exchange
                    wishes to speak to any one of the subscribers, the arm is made to travel round,
                    by currents sent from the exchange through an electromagnetic step by step
                    arrangement, until it comes in contact with the proper plate, after which the
                    subscriber is called in the ordinary way. When one subscriber belonging to the
                    district exchange wishes to speak to another in the same district, he rings the
                    bell in the ordinary way, and this operation disconnects all other subscribers
                    and puts him in connexion through the trunk line with the central ex change. The
                    attendant there ascertains to whom it is that he wishes to speak, and by moving
                    round the contact arm puts the two subscribers’ lines in contact.</p>
                <p>The indicator, or annunciator as it is sometimes called, is shown in fig. 17. It
                    consists of an electromagnet M, which on a current being sent through it pulls
                    down the armature <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> relieves the catch <hi rend="italic"
                    >c,</hi> and allows the shutter <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to fall down, exposing
                    a plate <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> on the front of which the number of the
                    subscriber is printed. When the exchange is called, the shutter <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> is dropped, the attendant connects the line leading to the
                    exchange table with the terminal corresponding to the indicator, and finds who
                    is wanted; then he calls that subscriber, makes the through connexion, and puts
                    up the shutter. When the subscribers have finished, both call the exchange or,
                    as it is commonly put, “ring off”; this drops both shutters and serves as the
                    signal that they have finished speaking.</p>
                <p>The principle of transmitting sound by the radiophone will be understood from
                    fig. 18. M represents a mirror, from which a beam of light is reflected through
                    the lens <hi rend="italic">l</hi> to a second mirror <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> forms a diaphragm against the back of which the
                    sound vibrations sent through the tube <hi rend="italic">t</hi> are made to
                    impinge. The beam of light, after being reflected from <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>
                    passes through the lower lens <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and thence as a nearly
                    parallel beam to the parabolic reflector R. A photophonic receiver P, supposed
                    in this case to be a spiral of selenium wire wound on the surface of a cylinder,
                    is placed at the focus of the reflector so that the beam of light from <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> is concentrated on it. In circuit with the receiver P a
                    battery B and a telephone T are included and through the circuit a feeble
                    electric current flows continuously. The photophonic receiver should be placed
                    so as to receive as little light as possible from any other source than the
                    mirror <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> Words spoken through the tube <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> make the mirror <hi rend="italic">m</hi> vibrate, so that the beam of
                    light reflected from it becomes more or less spread. The lens <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> is then unable to bring the beam into parallelism, and the intensity of
                    the reflexions from R to P is varied, therefore also the current through the
                    coil of the telephone, which in consequence gives out a sound. The amount of
                    spreading of the beam being proportional to the intensity of the vibrations of
                    rn, and this again proportional to the intensity of the sounds, the sounds heard
                    in the telephone are similar to those produced at the end of <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> Theoretically the receiver may be at any distance from the transmitter,
                    but considerable difficulty arises if the distance is great.</p>
                <p>One of the simplest forms of the phonograph is shown in fig. 19. It consists of a
                    rigid spindle S screwed for about one-third of its length, and fitted to work
                    smoothly but tightly in the frame <hi rend="italic">f, f</hi> which is securely
                    attached to a sole plate P. On the spindle a drum D is fixed, the axis of which
                    coincides accurately with that of the spindle. On the surface of the drum a
                    screw is cut of precisely the same pitch as that on the spindle. A fly-wheel W
                    is fixed to one end of the spindle, and is provided with a handle H, by which
                    the spindle and drum can be conveniently turned. One of the bearings has either
                    a screw thread cut along it, or is fitted with one or more studs which work
                    easily, but without shake, in the screw thread. When the spindle is turned, it
                    receives a transverse motion, and a point fixed relatively to the sole plate P
                    and touching the drum traces out a spiral on its surface, exactly coinciding
                    with the screw thread cut on it. A mouthpiece M, like that of a telephone
                    transmitter, provided with a diaphragm of parchment or similar substance, is
                    mounted on a lever, which is pivoted at <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and provided
                    with a set screw <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> A blunt needle point is either fixed
                    to the centre of the diaphragm or carried by a light spring in such a way as to
                    press on the centre of the diaphragm with the needle point projecting outwards.
                    To use the instrument, the drum D is covered with a sheet of somewhat stiff
                    tinfoil, and the mouthpiece is adjusted as shown in the figure, with the needle
                    point over the hollow part of the tinfoil, and fixed by the set screw to make a
                    slight indentation in it. The drum is then turned and words spoken in a somewhat
                    loud and clear tone in front of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n146/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0146-0135"/> mouthpiece. The vibrations of the diaphragm cause
                    the needle point to make indentations more or less deep, according to the
                    intensity of the sound, in the surface of the tinfoil. If the mouthpiece is then
                    raised, the drum turned back to its original position, the mouthpiece lowered so
                    that the point rests on the groove which it previously made, and the drum again
                    turned, the diaphragm, acted on by the needle point passing over the
                    indentation, will give out the same words which were spoken to it. (T. GR. )</p>
