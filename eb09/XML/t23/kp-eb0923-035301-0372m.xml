                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="italic">Definition of Tide.</hi></p>
                <p>WHEN, as occasionally happens, a ship in the open sea meets a short succession of
                    waves of very unusua! magnitude, we hear of tidal waves; and the large wave
                    caused by an earthquake is commonly so described. The use of the term “tide” in
                    this connexion is certainly incorrect, but it has perhaps been fostered by the
                    fact that such waves impress their records on automatic tide-gauges, as, for
                    example, when the wave due to the volcanic outbreak at Krakatoa was thus
                    distinctly traceable in South Africa, and perhaps even faintly at Brest. We can
                    only adequately define a tide by reference to the cause which produces it. A
                    tide then is a rise and fall of the water of the sea produced by the attraction
                    of the sun and moon. A rise and fall of the sea produced by a regular
                    alternation of day and night breezes, by regular rainfall and evaporation, or by
                    any influence which the moon may have on the weather cannot strictly be called a
                    tide. Such alternations may, it is true, be inextricably involved with the rise
                    and fall of the true astronomical tide, but we shall here distinguish them as
                    meteorological· tides. These movements are the result of the action of the sun,
                    as a radiating body, on the earth. Tides in the atmosphere would be shown by a
                    regular rise and fall in the barometer, but such tides are undoubtedly very
                    minute, and we shall not discuss them in this article, merely referring the
                    reader to the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste</hi> of
                    Laplace, bks. i. and xiii. There are, however, very strongly marked diurnal and
                    semi-diurnal inequalities of the barometer due to atmospheric meteorological
                    tides. Sir William Thomson in an interesting speculation<note anchored="true"

                    shows that the interaction of these quasi-tides with the sun is that of a
                    thermodynamic engine, whereby there is caused a minute secular acceleration of
                    the earth’s rotation. This matter is, however, beyond the scope of the present
                    article. We shall here extend the term “tide” to denote an elastic or viscous
                    periodic deformation of a solid or viscous globe under the action of
                    tide-generating forces. In the technical part of the article by the term “a
                    simple tide” we shall denote a spherical harmonic deformation of the water on
                    the surface of the globe, or of the solid globe itself, multiplied by a simple
                    harmonic function of the time.</p>

                <p>If we live by the sea or on an estuary, we see that the water rises and falls
                    nearly twice a day; speaking more exactly, the average interval from high water
                    to high water is about 12 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 25 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi>, so that the average retardation from day to day is
                    about 50 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>. The times of high water are then found
                    to bear an intimate relation with the moon’s position. Thus at Ipswich high
                    water occurs when the moon is nearly south, at London Bridge when it is
                    southwest, and at Bristol when it is east-south-east. For a very rough
                    determination of the time of high water it is sufficient to add the solar time
                    of high water on the days of new and full moon (called the “establishment of the
                    port”) to the time of the moon’s passage over the meridian, either visibly above
                    or invisibly below the horizon. The interval between the moon’s passage over the
                    meridian and high water varies sensibly with the moon’s age. From new moon to
                    first quarter, and from full moon to third quarter (or rather from and to a day
                    later than each of these phases), the interval diminishes from its average to a
                    mini mum, and then increases again to the average; and in the other two quarters
                    it increases from the average to a maximum, and then diminishes again to the
                    average.</p>
                <p>The range of the rise and fall of water is also subject to great variability. On
                    the days after new and full moon the range of tide is at its maximum, and on the
                    day after the first and third quarter at its minimum. The maximum is called
                    “spring tide” and the minimum “neap tide,” and the range of spring tide is
                    usually between two and three times as great as that of neap tide. At many
                    ports, however, especially non-European ones, two successive high waters are of
                    unequal heights, and the law of variability of the difference is somewhat
                    complex; a statement of that law will be easier when we come to consider tidal
                    theories. In considering any tide we find, especially in estuaries, that the
                    interval from high to low water is longer than that from low to high water, and
                    the difference between the intervals is greater at spring than at neap.</p>
                <p>In a river the current continues to run up stream for some considerable time
                    after high water is attained and to run down similarly after low water. Much
                    confusion has been occasioned by the indiscriminate use of the term “tide” to
                    denote a tidal current and a rise of water, and it has often been incorrectly
                    inferred that high water must have been attained at the moment of cessation of
                    the upward current. The distinction between “rising and falling” and “flowing
                    and ebbing” must be carefully maintained in rivers, whilst it vanishes at the
                    seaboard. If we examine the progress of the tide-wave up a river, we find that
                    high water occurs at the sea earlier than higher up. If, for instance, on a
                    certain day it is high water at Margate at noon, it is high water at Gravesend
                    at a quarter past two, and at London Bridge a few minutes before three. The
                    interval from low to high water diminishes also as we go up the river; and at
                    some distance up certain rivers—as, for example, the Severn—the rising water
                    spreads over the flat sands in a roaring surf and travels up the rivpr almost
                    like a wall of water. This kind of sudden rise is called a “bore.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See a series of papers
                    bearing on this kind of wave by Sir W. Thomson, in <hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Μαg.,</hi> 1886-87.</p></note> In other cases where the difference between the
                    periods of rising and falling is considerable, there are, in each high water,
                    two or three rises and falls. A double high water exists at Southampton.</p>
                <p>When an estuary contracts considerably, the range of tide becomes largely
                    magnified as it narrows; for example, at the entrance of the Bristol Channel the
                    range of spring tides is about 18 feet, and at Chepstow about 50 feet. This
                    augmentation of the height of the tide-wave is due to the concentration of the
                    energy of motion of a large mass of water into a narrow space. At oceanic ports
                    the tidal phenomena are much less marked, the range of tide being usually only 2
                    or 3 feet, and the interval from high to low water sensibly equal to that from
                    low to high water. The changes from spring to neap tide and the relation of the
                    time of high water to the moon’s transit remain, however, the same as in the
                    case of the river tides.</p>
                <p>In long and narrow seas, such as the English Channel, the tide in mid-channel
                    follows the same law as at a station near the mouth of a river, rising and
                    falling in equal times; the current runs in the direction analogous to up stream
                    for three hours before and after high water, and down stream for the same period
                    before and after low water. But near the sides of channels and near the mouths
                    of bays the changes of the currents are very complex; and near the headlands
                    separating two bays there is usually at certain times a very swift current,
                    termed a “race.”</p>

                <p>In inland seas, such as the Mediterranean, the tides are nearly insensible except
                    at the ends of long bays. Thus at Malta the tides are not noticed by the
                    ordinary observer, whilst at Venice they are conspicuous.</p>
                <p>The effect of a strong wind on the height of tide is generally supposed to be
                    very marked, especially in estuaries. In the case of an exceptional gale, when
                    the wind veered round appropriately, Airy states<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Airy, “Tides and Waves.”</p></note> that the
                    water has been known to depart from its predicted height at London by as much as
                    5 feet. The effect of wind will certainly be different at each port. The
                    discrepancy of opinion on this subject appears to be great,—so much so that we
                    hear of some observers concluding that the effect of the wind is insensible.
                    Variations in barometric pressure also cause departures from the predicted
                    height of water, high barometer corresponding to decrease of height of water.
                    Roughly speaking, an inch of the mercury column will correspond to something
                    less than a foot of water, but the effect seems to vary much at different
                    ports.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Airy, <hi

                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">General Explanation of the Cause of Tides.</hi></p>
                <p>The moon attracts every particle of the earth and ocean, and by the law of
                    gravitation the force acting on any particle is directed towards the moon’s
                    centre, and is jointly proportional to the masses of the particle and of the
                    moon, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the
                    particle and the moon’s centre. If we imagine the earth and ocean subdivided
                    into a number of small portions or particles of equal mass, then the average,
                    both as to direction and intensity, of the forces acting on these particles is
                    equal to the force acting on that particle which is at the earth’s centre. For
                    there is symmetry about the line joining the centres of the two bodies, and, if
                    we divide the earth into two portions by an ideal spherical surface passing
                    through the earth’s centre and having its centre at the moon, the portion remote
                    from the moon is a little larger than the portion towards the moon, but the
                    nearer portion is under the action of forces which are a little stronger than
                    those acting on the further portion, and the resultant of the weaker forces on
                    the larger portion is exactly equal to the resultant of the stronger forces on
                    the smaller. If every particle of the earth and ocean were being urged by equal
                    and parallel forces, there would be no cause for relative motion between the
                    ocean and the earth. Hence it is the departure of the force acting on any
                    particle from the average which constitutes the tidegenerating force. Now it is
                    obvious that on the side of the earth towards the moon the departure from the
                    average is a small force directed towards the moon; and on the side of the earth
                    away from the m∞n the departure is a small force directed away from the moon.
                    Also these two departures are very nearly equal to one another, that on the near
                    side being so little greater than that on the other that we may neglect the
                    excess. All round the sides of the earth along a great circle perpendicular to
                    the line joining the moon and earth, the departure is a force directed inwards
                    towards the earth’s centre. Thus we see that the tidal forces tend to pull the
                    water towards and away from the moon, and to depress the water at right angles
                    to that direction. If we could neglect the rotations of the bodies, and could
                    consider the system as at rest, we should find that the water was in equilibrium
                    when elongated into a prolate ellipsoid with its long axis directed towards and
                    away from the moon.</p>
                <p>But it must not be assumed that this would be the case when there is motion. For,
                    suppose that the ocean consisted of a canal round the equator, and that an
                    earthquake or any other cause were to generate a great wave in the canal, this
                    wave would travel along it with a velocity de pendent on the depth. If the canal
                    were about 13 miles deep, the velocity of the wave would be about 1000 miles an
                    hour, and with depth about equal to the depth of our seas the velocity of the
                    wave would be about half as great. We may conceive the moon’s tide-generating
                    force as making a wave in the canal and continually outstripping the wave it
                    generates, for the moon travels along the equator at the rate of about 1000
                    miles an hour, and the sea is less than 13 miles deep. The resultant oscillation
                    of the ocean must therefore be the summation of a series of partial waves
                    generated at each instant by the moon and always falling behind her, and the
                    aggregate wave, being the same at each instant, must travel 1000 miles an hour
                    so as to keep up with the moon.</p>
                <p>Now it is a general law of frictionless oscillation that, if a slowly varying
                    periodic force acts on a system which would oscillate quickly if left to itself,
                    the maximum excursion on one side of the equilibrium position occurs
                    simultaneously with the maximum force in the direction of the excursion; but, if
                    a quickly varying periodic force acts on a system which would oscillate slowly
                    if left to itself, the maximum excursion on one side of the equilibrium position
                    occurs simultaneously with the maximum force in the direction opposite to that
                    of the excursion. An example of the first is a ball hanging by a short string,
                    which we push slowly to and fro; the ball will never quit contact with the hand,
                    and will agree with its excursions. If, however, the ball is hanging by a long
                    string we can play at battledore and shuttlecock with it, and it always meets
                    our blows. The latter is the analogue of the tides, for a free wave in our
                    shallow canal goes slowly, whilst the moon’s tide-generating action goes
                    quickly. Hence, when the system is left to settle into steady oscillation, it is
                    low water under and opposite to the moon, whilst the forces are such as to make
                    it high water at those times.</p>
                <p>If we consider the moon as revolving round the earth, the water assumes nearly
                    the shape of an oblate spheroid with the minor axis pointed to the moon. The
                    rotation of the earth in the actual case introduces a complexity which it is not
                    easy to unravel by general reasoning. We can see, however, that if water moves
                    from a lower to a higher latitude it arrives at the higher latitude with more
                    velocity from west to east than is appropriate to its latitude, and it will move
                    accordingly on the earth’s surface. Following out this conception, we see that
                    an oscillation of the water to and fro between south and north must be
                    accompanied by an eddy. Laplace’s solution of the difficult problem involved in
                    working out this idea will be given below.</p>
                <p>The conclusion at which we have arrived about the tides of an equatorial canal is
                    probably more nearly true of the tides of a globe partially covered with land
                    than if we were to suppose the ocean at each moment to assume the prolate figure
                    of equilibrium. In fact, observation shows that it is more nearly low water than
                    high water when the moon is on the meridian. If we consider how the oscillation
                    of the water would appear to an observer carried round with the earth, we see
                    that he will have low water twice in the lunar day, somewhere about the time
                    when the moon is on the meridian, either above or below the horizon, and high
                    water half way between the low waters.</p>
                <p>If the sun be now introduced, we have another similar tide of about half the
                    height, and this depends on solar time, giving low water somewhere about noon
                    and midnight. The superposition of the two, modified by friction and by the
                    interference of land, gives the actually observed aggregate tide, and it is
                    clear that about new and full moon we must have spring tides and at quarter
                    moons neap tides, and that (the sum of the lunar and solar tidegenerating forces
                    being about three times their difference) <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0374-0355"/> the range of spring tide will be about three
                    times that of neap tide.</p>
                <p>So far we have supposed the luminaries to move on the equator; now let us
                    consider the case where the moon is not on the equator. It is clear in this case
                    that at any place the moon’s zenith distance at the upper transit is different
                    from her nadir distance at the lower transit. But the tide-generating force is
                    greater the smaller the zenith or nadir distance, and therefore the forces are
                    different at successive transits. This was not the case when the moon was deemed
                    to move on the equator. Thus there is a tendency for two successive lunar tides
                    to be of unequal heights, and the resulting inequality of height is called a
                    “diurnal tide.” This tendency vanishes when the moon is on the equator; and, as
                    this occurs each fortnight, the lunar diurnal tide is evanescent once a
                    fortnight. Similarly in summer and winter the successive solar tides are
                    generally of unequal height, whilst in spring and autumn this difference is
                    inconspicuous.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable conclusions of Laplace’s theory of the tides, on a
                    globe covered with ocean to a uniform depth, is that the diurnal tide is
                    everywhere nonexistent. But this hypothesis differs much from the reality, and
                    in fact at some ports the diurnal tide is so large that during two portions of
                    each lunation there is only one great high water and one great low water in each
                    twenty-four hours, whilst in other parts of the lunation the usual semi-diurnal
                    tide is observed.</p>

                <p>In 1687 Newton laid the foundation for all that has since been added to the
                    theory of the tides when he brought his grand generalization of universal
                    gravitation to bear on the subject. Kepler had indeed at an earlier date
                    recognized the tendency of the water of the ocean to move towards the centres of
                    the sun and moon, but he was unable to submit his theory to calculation. Galileo
                    expresses his regret that so acute a man as Kepler should have produced a theory
                    -which appeared to him to reintroduce the occult qualities of the ancient
                    philosophers. His own explanation referred the phenomenon to the rotation and
                    orbital motion of the earth, and he considered that it afforded a principal
                    proof of the Copernican system.</p>
                <p>In the 19th corollary of the 66th proposition of book i. of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principia,</hi> Newton introduces the conception of a canal circling the earth,
                    and he considers the influence of a satellite on the water in the canal. He
                    remarks that the movement of each molecule of fluid must be accelerated in the
                    conjunction and opposition of the satellite with the molecule, and retarded in
                    the quadratures, so that the fluid must undergo a tidal oscillation. It is,
                    however, in propositions 26 and 27 of book iii. that he first determines the
                    tidal force due to the sun and moon. The sea is here supposed to cover the whole
                    earth, and to assume at each instant a figure of equilibrium, and the
                    tide-generating bodies are supposed to move in the equator. Considering only the
                    action of the sun, he assumes that the figure is an ellipsoid of revolution with
                    its major axis directed towards the sun, and he determines the ellipticity of
                    such an ellipsoid. High solar tide then occurs at noon and midnight, and low
                    tide at sunrise and sunset. The action of the moon produces a similar ellipsoid,
                    but of greater ellipticity. The superposition of these ellipsoids gives the
                    principal variations of tide. He then proceeds to consider the influence of
                    latitude on the height of tide, and to discuss other peculiarities of the
                    phenomenon. Observation shows, however, that spring tides occur a day and a half
                    after syzygies, and Newton falsely attributed this to the fact that the
                    oscillations would last for some time if the attractions of the two bodies were
                    to cease.</p>
                <p>The Newtonian hypothesis, although it fails in the form which he gave to it, may
                    still be made to represent the tides, if the lunar and solar ellipsoids have
                    their major axes always directed towards a fictitious moon and sun, which are
                    respectively at constant distances from the true bodies; these distances are
                    such that the syzygies of the fictitious planets occur about a day or a day and
                    a half later than the true syzygies. In fact, the actual tides may be supposed
                    to be generated directly by the action of the real sun and m∞n, and the wave may
                    be imagined to take a day and a half to arrive at the port of observation. This
                    period has accordingly been called “the age of the tide.” In what precedes the
                    planets have been supposed to move in the equator; but the theory of the two
                    ellipsoids cannot be reconciled with the truth when they move in orbits inclined
                    to the equator. At equatorial ports the theory of the ellipsoids would at spring
                    tides give morning and evening high waters of nearly equal height, whatever the
                    declinations of the bodies. But at a port in any other latitude these high
                    waters would be of very different heights, and at Brest, for example, when the
                    declinations of the bodies are equal to the obliquity of the elliptic, the
                    evening tide would be eight times as great as the morning tide. Now observation
                    shows that at this port the two tides are nearly equal to one another, and that
                    their greatest difference is not a thirtieth of their sum.</p>
                <p>Newton here also offered an erroneous explanation of the phenomenon. In fact, we
                    shall see that by Laplace’s dynamical theory the diurnal tide is evanescent when
                    the ocean is of uniform depth over the earth. At many nonEuropean ports,
                    however, the diurnal tide is very important, and thus as an actual means of
                    prediction the dynamical theory, where the ocean is treated as of uniform depth,
                    may be hardly better than the equilibrium theory.</p>
                <p>In 1738 the Academy of Sciences of Paris offered, as a subject for a prize, the
                    theory of the tides. The authors of four essays received prizes, viz., Daniel
                    Bernoulli, Euler, Maclaurin, and Cavalieri. The first three adopted not only the
                    theory of gravitation but also Newton’s method of the superposition of the two
                    ellipsoids. Bernoulli’s essay contained an extended development of the
                    conception of the two ellipsoids, and, under the name of the equilibrium theory,
                    it is commonly associated with his name. Laplace gives an account and critique
                    of the essays of Bernoulli and Euler in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Celeste.</hi> The essay of Maclaurin presented little that was new
                    in tidal theory, but is notable as containing those theorems concerning the
                    attraction of ellipsoids which we now know by his name. In 1746 D’Alembert wrote
                    a paper in which he treated the tides of the atmosphere; but this work, like
                    Maclaurin’s, is chiefly remarkable for the importance of collateral points.</p>
                <p>The theory of the tidal movements of an ocean was therefore, as Laplace remarks,
                    almost untouched when in 1774 he first undertook the subject. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste</hi> he gives an interesting account of ⅛e
                    manner in which he was led to attack the problem. We shall give below the
                    investigation of the tides of an ocean covering the whole earth; the theory is
                    substantially Laplace’s, although presented in a somewhat different form. This
                    theory, although very wide, is far from representing the tides of our ports.
                    Observation shows, in fact, that the irregular distribution of land and water
                    and the variable depth of the ocean produce an irregularity in the oscillations
                    of the sea of such complexity that the rigorous solution of the problem is
                    altogether beyond the power of analysis. Laplace, however, rested his discussion
                    of tidal observation on this principle— <hi rend="italic">The state of
                    oscillation of a system of bodies in which the primitive conditions of

                    disappeared through friction is coperiodic νηth the forces acting on the
                    system.</hi> Hence, if the sea is solicited by a periodic force expressed as a
                    coefficient multiplied by the cosine of an angle which increases proportionately
                    with the time, there results a partial tide, also expressed by the cosine of an
                    angle which increases at the same rate; but the phase of the angle and the
                    coefficient of the cosine in the expression for the height may be very different
                    from those occurring in the corresponding term of the equilibrium theory. The
                    coefficients and the constants or epochs of the angles in the expressions for
                    the tide are only derivable from observation. The action of the sun and moon is
                    expressible in a converging series of similar cosines; whence there arise as
                    many partial tides, which by the principle of superposition may be added
                    together to give the total tide at any port. In order to unite the several
                    constants of the partial tides Laplace considers each tide as being produced by
                    a fictitious satellite moving uniformly on the equator. Sir W. Thomson and
                    others have followed Laplace in this conception; but in the present article we
                    shall not do so. The difference of treatment is in reality only a matter of
                    phraseology, and the proper motion of each one of Laplace’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >astres fictifs</hi> is at once derivable from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >argument</hi> (or angle under the sign of cosine), which we shall here
                    associate with the partial tides.</p>
                <p>Subsequently to Laplace the most important workers in this field were Sir John
                    Lubbock (senior), Whewell, and Airy. The work of Lubbock and Whewell (see § 34
                    below) is chiefly remarkable for the coordination and analysis of enormous
                    masses of data at various ports, and the construction of trustworthy tide-tables
                    and of cotidal maps. Airy contributed an important review of the whole tidal
                    theory. He also studied profoundly the theory of waves in canals, and explained
                    the effects of frictional resistances on the progress of tidal and other waves.
                    Of other authors whose work is of great importance we shall speak below.</p>
                <p>Amongst all the grand work which has been bestowed on this difficult subject,
                    Newton, notwithstanding his errors, stands out first, and next to him we must
                    rank Laplace. However original any future contribution to the science of the
                    tides may be, it would seem as though it must perforce be based on the work of
                    these two.</p>
                <p>A complete list of works bearing on the <hi rend="italic">theory</hi> of the

                    existence of any catalogue of works on practical observation, reduction of
                    observations, prediction, and tidal instruments. References are, however, given
                    below to several works on these points.</p>

                <p>We have already given a general explanation of the nature of tide-generating
                    forces; we now proceed to a rigorous investigation.</p>
                <p>If a planet is attended by a single satellite, the motion of any body relatively
                    to the planet’s surface is found by the process described as reducing the
                    planet’s centre to rest. The planet’s centre will be at rest if every body in
                    the system has impressed on it a velocity equal and opposite to that of the
                    planet’s centre; and this is accomplished by impressing on every body an
                    acceleration equal and opposite to that of the planet’s centre.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">M,</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the masses of the planet
                    and the satellite; <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius vector of the satellite,
                    measured from the planet’s centre; <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> the radius vector,
                    measured fronr the same point, of the particle whose motion we wish to
                    determine; and <hi rend="italic">z</hi> the angle between <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> The satellite moves in an elliptic orbit
                    about the planet, and the acceleration relatively to the planet’s centre of the
                    satellite is <hi rend="italic">{M+m)</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3,</hi> towards the planet
                    along the radius vector <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> Now the centre of inertia of
                    the planet and satellite remains fixed in space, and the centre of the planet
                    describes an orbit round that centre of inertia similar to that described by the
                    satellite round the planet, but with linear dimensions reduced in the proportion
                    of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi rend="italic">M+m.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence the acceleration of the planet’s centre is <hi rend="italic">nιft</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">∙</hi> towards the centre of
                    inertia of the two bodies. Thus, in order to reduce the planet’s centre to rest,
                    we apply to every particle of the system an acceleration τn∕r <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> parallel to <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and directed
                    from satellite to planet.</p>
                <p>Now take a set of rectangular axes fixed in the planet, and let M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> r, M <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> r, <hi

                    and let <hi rend="italic">ξρ, ηp, ζp</hi> be the coordinates of the particle <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi> whose radius is <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> Then the

                <p>Now let us consider the other forces acting on the particle. The Slanet is
                    spheroidal, and therefore does not attract equally in all irections; but in this
                    investigation we may make abstraction of the ellipticity of the planet and of
                    the ellipticity of the ocean due to the planetary rotation. This, which we set
                    aside, is considered in the theories of gravity and of the figures of planets.
                    Outside of its body, then, the planet contributes forces of which the potential
                    is <hi rend="italic">M/p.</hi> Next the direct attraction of the satellite
                    contnbutes forces of which the potential is the mass of the satellite divided by

                <p>In many mathematical works the tide-generating force is presented as being due to
                    an artificial statical system, which produces nearly the same force as the
                    dynamical system considered above. This statical system is as follows. Stopping
                    all the rotations, we divide the satellite into two equal parts, and place them
                    diametrically opposite to one another in the orbit. Then it is clear that,
                    instead of the term <hi rend="italic">rn m</hi></p>

                <p>The first term is the same as before; hence the statical system produces
                    approximately the same tide-generating force as the true system. The “moon” and
                    “anti-moon,” however, produce rigorously the same force on each side of the
                    planet, whereas the true system only satisfies this condition
                    approximately.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Form of Equilibrium.</hi></p>
                <p>Let us consider the shape assumed by a layer of fluid of density <hi
                    rend="italic">σ,</hi> lying on a globe of mass <hi rend="italic">Μ,</hi> when
                    acted on by disturbing forces whose potential is Γ= g&gt;(cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- ⅛) (3).</p>
                <p>Suppose the layer to be very thin, and that the mean radius of the layer is α,
                    and let the equation to the boundary of the fluid be ρ=α[l + e(cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ≡- ⅜)] (4).</p>
                <p>We assume this form, because the theory of harmonic analysis tells us that the
                    departure from sphericity must be represented by a function of the form cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- ⅜. That theory also
                    gives us as the potential of a layer of matter of depth rα(cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> s- ⅜), and density <hi rend="italic">σ,</hi> at an
                    external point the value</p>

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-l).</p>
                <p>Hence the whole potential, outside of and up to the fluid layer, is y + f^P <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (<hi rend="superscript"> co</hi> ≡ <hi

                <p>The first term of (5) is the potential of the globe, the second that of the
                    disturbing force, and the third the potential due to departure from
                    sphericity.</p>
                <p>Now the fluid must stand in a level surface; hence, if we equate this potential
                    to a constant, we must get back to the equation (4), which was assumed to be
                    that of the surface. In other words, if we put p = α[l + t(cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> s-⅜)] in (5), the result must be constant, provided
                    the departure from sphericity is small. In effecting the substitution for <hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> we may put <hi rend="italic">ρ=a</hi> in the small terms,
                    but in the first term of (5) we put</p>
                <p>^=⅛-ε(cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> z-⅛)]∙ <hi rend="italic">p CL</hi></p>
                <p>The whole potential (5) can only be constant if, after this substitution, the
                    coefficient of cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> z — ⅛ vanishes. Thus we must
                    have <hi rend="italic">Μ Zma? . .</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi></p>

                <p>it follows that, when the form of equilibrium is <hi rend="italic">p=</hi> α[l +

                <p>More generally, if we neglect the attraction of the fluid on itself, so that σ∕δ
                    is treated as small, and if p=α(l + s) be the equation to the surface òf the
                    fluid, where s is a function of latitude and longitude, then the potential of

                <p>It thus appears that we may specify any tide-generating forces by means of the
                    figure of equilibrium which the fluid would assume under them, and in the theory
                    of the tides it has been found practically convenient to specify the forces in
                    this way.</p>
                <p>By means of the principle of “forced vibrations” referred to in the historical
                    sketch, we shall pass from the equilibrium form to the actual oscillations of
                    the sea.</p>

                <p>The westward component is made up of two periodic terms, one going through its
                    variations twice and the other once a day. The southward component has also two
                    similar terms; but it has a third term, which does not oscillate about a zero
                    value. If Δ be a declination such that the mean value of sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> δ is equal to sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> ∆,
                    then, to determine the southward component so that it shall be a truly periodic
                    function, we must subtract from the above sin 2λ(l - 3 sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Δ), and the last term then becomes</p>

                <p>In the case of the moon, Δ varies a little according to the position of the
                    moon’s node, but its mean value is about 16° 31'.</p>
                <p>The constant portion of the southward component of force has its effect in
                    causing a constant heaping up of the water at the equator; or, in other words,
                    the moon’s attraction has the effect of causing a small permanent ellipticity of
                    the earth’s mean figure. This augmentation of ellipticity is of course very
                    small, but it is necessary to mention it in order that the meaning to be
                    attributed to lunar deflexion of gravity may be clearly defined.</p>
                <p>If we consider the motion of a pendulum-bob during any one day, we see that, in
                    consequence of the semi-diurnal changes of level, it twice describes an ellipse

                    pendulum failed on account of incessant variability of level occurring in the

                    done, therefore, was of no avail for the purposes for which it was instituted,
                    but remained as a contribution to an interesting subject now beginning to be
                    studied, viz., the small changes which are always taking place on the upper
                    strata of the earth.</p>
                <p>§ 9. <hi rend="italic">Correction to Equilibrium Theory for Continents.</hi></p>
                <p>In the equilibrium theory as worked out by Newton and Bernoulli it is assumed
                    that the figure of the ocean is at each instant one of equilibrium under the
                    action of gravity and of the tidegenerating forces. Sir W. Thomson has, however,
                    reasserted<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thomson and
                    Tait, <hi rend="italic">Nat. Phil.,</hi> § 807.</p></note> a point which was
                    known to Bernoulli, but has since been overlooked, namely, that this law of rise
                    and fall of water cannot, when portions of the globe are continents, be
                    satisfied by a constant volume of water in the ocean. The law would still hold
                    if water were appropriately supplied to and exhausted from the ocean; and, if in
                    any configuration of the tide-generating body we imagine water to be
                    instantaneously so supplied or exhausted, the level will everywhere rise or fall
                    by the same height. Now the amount of that rise or fall depends on the position
                    of the tide-generating body with reference to the continents, and is different
                    for each such position. Conversely, when the volume of the ocean remains
                    constant, we have to correct Bernoulli’s simple equilibrium theory by an amount
                    which is constant all over the globe at any instant, but which changes in time.
                    Thomson’s solution of this problem has since been reduced to a form which is
                    easier to grasp intelligently than in the shape in which he gave it, and the
                    results have also been reduced to numbers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Darwin and Turner, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi>
                    1886.</p></note> It appears that there are four points on the earth’s surface at
                    which in the corrected theory the semidiurnal tide is evanescent, and four
                    others where it is doubled. A similar statement holds for the diurnal tide. As
                    to the tides of long period, there are two parallele of latitude of evanescent
                    and two of doubled tide.</p>
                <p>Now in Bernoulli’s theory the semi-diurnal tide vanishes at the poles, the
                    diurnal tide at the poles and the equator, and the tides of long period in
                    latitudes 35° 16' north and south. The numerical solution of the corrected
                    theory shows that the points and lines of doubling and evanescence in every case
                    fall close to the points and lines where in the uncorrected theory there is
                    evanescence. When in passing from the uncorrected to the corrected theory we
                    speak of a doubled tide, the tide doubled may be itself <hi rend="italic"
                    >nil,</hi> so that the result may still be <hi rend="italic">nil.</hi> The
                    conclusion, therefore, is that Thomson’s correction, although theoretically
                    interesting, is practically so small that it may be left out of
                    consideration.</p>

                <p>The problem of tidal oscillation is essentially a dynamical one. Even when the
                    ocean is taken as covering the whole earth, it presents formidable difficulties,
                    and this is the only case in which it has been hitherto solved.<note

                <p>With regard to the first equation of (16), we observe that the time has
                    disappeared, and that <hi rend="italic">R</hi> has exactly the same form as if
                    the system were rendered statical by introducing a potential ⅜n <hi

                    inertia plays no sensible part radially, it follows that, if we apply these
                    expressions to the formation of equations of motion for the ocean, the radial
                    motion need not he considered. We are left, therefore, with only the last two
                    equations of (16).</p>
                <p>We now have to consider the forces by which an element of the ocean is urged in
                    the direction of co-latitude and longitude. These forces are those due to the
                    external disturbing forces and to the pressure of the surrounding fluid, the
                    attraction of the fluid on itself being supposed negligible. We have seen in (9)
                    that, if fluid on a sphere of radius <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be under the
                    action of disturbing forces whose potential is <hi rend="italic">Ur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and if <hi

                    the potential of the disturbing force is <hi rend="italic">gv</hi><hi

                <p>It remains to find the equation of continuity. This maybe deduced geometrically

                <p>§ 12. <hi rend="italic">Adaptation to Forced Oscillations.</hi></p>
                <p>Since we may suppose that the free oscillations are annulled by friction, the
                    solution required is that corresponding to forced oscillations. Now we have seen
                    from (13) that ε (which is proportional to <hi rend="italic">V)</hi> has terms
                    of three kinds, the first depending on twice the moon’s (or sun’s) hour-angle,
                    the second on the hour-angle, and the third independent thereof. The
                    coefficients of the first and second terms vary slowly, and the whole of the
                    third varies slowly. Hence c has a semi-diurnal, a diurnal, and a long period
                    term. We shall see later that these terms may be expanded in a series of
                    approximately semi-diurnal, diurnal, and slowly varying terms, each of which is
                    a strictly harmonic function of the time. Thus we may assume for c a form e cos
                    (2n∕Z + <hi rend="italic">kφ</hi> + a), where <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> are numbers, and where e is only a function of co-latitude
                    and of the elements of the orbit of the disturbing body. According to the usual
                    method of treating oscillating systems, we may therefore make the following
                    assumption for the form of solution</p>
                <p>í=e cos <hi rend="italic">(2nft + kφ</hi> + α) 1</p>

                <p>§ 13. <hi rend="italic">Preparation for Solution.</hi></p>
                <p>The ocean which is considered in this case is not like that on the earth’s
                    surface, and therefore it does not seem desirable to pursue the integration of
                    (24) except in certain typical cases.</p>
                <p>In (13) we have the expansion of the disturbing potential and implicitly of the
                    disturbing forces in three terms, the first of which is variable in half a day,
                    the second in a day, and the third in half the period of revolution of the
                    tide-raising body. Forestalling the results of chapter iv.—each of these terms
                    may be expressed as the sum of a series of strictly harmonic functions of the
                    time; the first set of these have all approximately semi-diurnal periods, the
                    second approximately diurnal periods, and the third vary slowly in dependence on
                    the periodic time of the tide-generating body. The first set involve twice the
                    terrestrial longitude, the second the longitude, and the third set are
                    independent of the longitude of the place of observation. From these statements
                    compared with (13) we see that in the semi-diurnal terms <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> is approximately unity, <hi rend="italic">k=2,</hi> and e=E sin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0; in the diurnal terms <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is
                    approximately ⅜, ⅛=1, and i = E sin 0 cos 0; in the terms of long period <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> is a small fraction (for the fortnightly tide about ⅛), <hi
                    rend="italic">k=Q,</hi> e=E(⅛ - cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0). The
                    departure from exactness in the relation ∕=1 for the semi-diurnal, and ∕=⅛ for
                    the diurnal terms is generally (except for certain critical depths of ocean) not
                    such as to greatly change the nature of the results from those obtained when ∕=1
                    and ⅜ rigorously. Hence the integration of (24) will be pursued on these three
                    hypotheses, giving Laplace’s three kinds of oscillation. The hypothesis which
                    wall be made with regard to <hi rend="italic">y</hi> is that <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> Z(l - <hi rend="italic">q</hi> cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> 0), and in the case of the semi-diurnal tides we
                    shall be compelled by mathematical difficulties to suppose <hi rend="italic"
                    >q</hi> to be either unity or zero. The tides of zonal seas may be worked out,
                    and more complex laws of depth may be assumed; but for the discussion of such
                    cases the reader is referred to Thomson’s papers in <hi rend="italic">Phil.

                <p>There might be reason to conjecture that the form of u would be similar to that

                <p>It appears, therefore, that the tide is “inverted,” giving low water where the

                    satisfied if Z=α∕1156. Hence in a sea 3000 fathoms deep at the equator, and
                    shallowing to the poles, we have inverted semi-diurnal tides of the equilibrium
                    height.</p>

                <p>The method of development used above, w here we proceed by powers of the depth of

                <p>The negative sign in the first case shows that the tide is inverted at the
                    equator, giving low water when the disturbing body is on the meridian. Near the
                    pole, however, that is, for small values of <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> the tides
                    are direct. In latitude 18° (approximately) there is a nodal line of evanescent
                    semi-diurnal tide. In the second and third cases the tides are everywhere
                    direct, increasing in magnitude from pole to equator. As /3 diminishes the tides
                    tend to assume their equilibrium value, because all the terms, save the first,
                    become evanescent. When /3=1 (depth <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛ of radius)
                    the tide at the equator still exceeds its equilibrium value by 11 per cent As /3
                    diminishes from 40 to 10 the nodal line of evanescent tide contracts round the
                    Çjle, and when it is infinitely small the tides are infinitely great, he
                    particular value of /3 for which this occurs is that where the free oscillation
                    of the ocean has the same period as the forced oscillation. The values chosen by
                    Laplace were not well adapted for the illustration of the results, because in
                    the cases of /3=40 and /3 = 10 the depth of the ocean is not much different from
                    that value which would give infinite semi-diurnal tide. For values of <hi
                    rend="italic">ß</hi> greater than 40 we should find other nodal lines dividing
                    the sphere into regions of direct and inverted tides. We refer the reader to Sir
                    W. Thomson’s papers for further details on this interesting point.</p>
                <p>§ 17. <hi rend="italic">Tides of Long Period; Laplace's Argιιment from
                    Friction.</hi></p>
                <p>In treating these oscillations ‰place remarks that a very small amount of
                    friction will be sufficient to cause the surface of the ocean to assume at each
                    instant its form of equilibrium, and he adduces in proof of his conclusion the
                    considerations given below. The friction here contemplated is such that the
                    integral effect is represented by a retarding force proportional to-the velocity
                    of the water relatively to the bottom. Although proportionality to the square of
                    the velocity would probably be nearer to the truth, yet Laplace’s hypothesis
                    suffices for the present discussion.</p>
                <p>In oscillations of this class the water moves for half a period north, and then
                    for half a period south. In oscillating systems, where the resistances are
                    proportional to the velocities, it is usual to specify the resistance by a
                    modulus of decay, namely, that period in which a velocity is reduced to e^^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of its initial value by friction. Now the friction
                    contemplated by Laplace is such that the modulus of decay is short compared with
                    the semi-period of oscillation. The quickest of the important tides of long
                    period is the fortnightly (see chapter iv.); hence, for the applicability of
                    Laplace’s conclusion, the modulus of decay must be short compared with a week.
                    Now it seems practically certain that the friction of the bed of the ocean would
                    not materially affect the velocity of a slow ocean current in a day or two.
                    Hence we cannot accept Laplace’s discussion as satisfactory. However this may
                    be, we now give λvhat is substantially his argument.</p>
                <p>Let us write <hi rend="italic">S</hi> for the reciprocal of the modulus of decay.
                    Then the frictional forces introduced on the left-hand side of (17) are <hi

                    rend="italic">dt</hi> in the second. Laplace’s hypothesis with regard to the
                    magnitude of the frictional forces enables us to neglect the terms <hi

                <p>§ 19. <hi rend="italic">Stability of the Ocean.</hi></p>
                <p>Imagine a globe of density <hi rend="italic">δ,</hi> surrounded by a spherical
                    layer of water of density <hi rend="italic">&lt;r.</hi> Then, still maintaining
                    the spherical figure, and with water still covering the nucleus, let the layer
                    be displaced sideways. The force on any part of the water distant <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi> from the centre of the water and r from the centre of the
                    nucleus is ⅜ιrσr ’ towards the centre of the fluid sphere and ⅜π(δ - σ)r towards
                    the centre of the nucleus. If δ be greater than <hi rend="italic">σ</hi> there
                    is a force tending to carry the water from places where it is deeper to places
                    where it is shallower; and therefore the equilibrium, thus arbitrarily
                    disturbed, is stable. If, however, δ is less than &lt;r (or the nucleus lighter
                    than water) the force is such that it tends to carry the water from where it is
                    shallower to where it is deeper, and therefore the equilibrium of a layer of
                    fluid distributed over a nucleus lighter than itself is unstable. As Sir William
                    Thomson has remarked,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Thomson and Tait, <hi rend="italic">Nat. Phil.,</hi> § 816.</p></note> if
                    the nucleus is lighter than the ocean, it will float in the ocean with part of
                    its surface dry. Suppose, again, that the fluid layer be disturbed, so that its
                    equation is r=α(l +s <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>), where <hi rend="italic"
                    >s</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> is a surface harmonic of degree <hi

                <p>If, therefore, σ∕(2i + l) is greater than ⅛δ, the potential of the forces due to
                    deformation is greater than that due to the nucleus. But we have seen that a
                    deformation tends to increase itself by mutual attraction, and therefore the
                    forces are such as to increase the deformation. If, therefore, o∙=∣(2t + l)δ,
                    all the deformations up to the zth are unstable, but the ï + lth is stable.<note

                <p>§ 20. <hi rend="italic">Precession and Nutation.</hi></p>
                <p>Suppose we have a planet covered with a shallow ocean <hi rend="subscript">
                    t</hi> and that the ocean is set into oscillation. Then, if there are no
                    external disturbing forces, so that the oscillations are “free,” not “forced,”
                    the resultant moment of momentum of the planet and ocean remains constant. And,
                    since each particle of the ocean executes periodic oscillations about a mean
                    position, it follows that the oscillation of the ocean imparts to the solid
                    earth oscillations such that the resultant moment of momentum of the whole
                    system remains constant. But the mass of the ocean being very small compared
                    with that of the planet, the component angular velocities of the planet
                    necessary to counterbalance the moment of momentum of the oscillations of the
                    sea are very small compared with the component angular velocities of the sea,
                    and therefore the disturbance of planetary rotation due to oceanic reaction is
                    negligible. If now an externa! disturbing force, such as that of the moon, acts
                    on the system, the resultant moment of momentum of sea and earth is unaffected
                    by the interaction between them, and the processional and nutational couples are
                    the same as if sea and earth were rigidly connected together. Therefore the
                    additions to these couples on account of tidal oscillation are the couples due
                    to the attraction of the moon on the excess or deficiency of λvater above or
                    below mean sea-level. The tidal oscillations are very small in height compared
                    with the equatorial protuberance of the earth, and the density of water is
                    ⁴∕₁₁ths of that of surface rock; hence the additional couples are very small
                    compared with the couples due to the moon’s action on the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0381-0362"/> solid equatorial protuberance. Therefore
                    precession and nutation take place sensibly as though the sea were congealed in
                    its mean position. If the ocean be regarded as frictionless, the principles of
                    energy show us that these insensible additional couples must be periodic in
                    time, and thus the corrections to nutation must consist of semi-diurnal,
                    diurnal, and fortnightly nutations of absolutely insensible magnitude. We shall
                    have much to say below on the results of the introduction of friction into the
                    conception of tidal oscillations as a branch of speculative astronomy.</p>
                <p>§ 21. <hi rend="italic">Some Phenomena of Tides in Rivers.</hi></p>
                <p>In § 2 we have given a description of some of the phenomena of the tide-wave in
                    rivers. As a considerable part of our practical knowledge of tides is derived
                    from observations in estuaries and rivers, we give an investigation of two of
                    the most important features of the tide-wave in these cases. It must be premised
                    that when the profile of a wave does not present the simple harmonic form it is
                    convenient to analyse its shape into a series of partial waves superposed on a
                    fundamental wave; and generally the principle of harmonic analysis is adopted,
                    in which the actual wave is regarded as the sum of a number of simple harmonic
                    waves.</p>
                <p>The tide-wave in a river is a “long” wave in which the vertical motion of the
                    water is very small compared with the horizontal, the river very shallow
                    compared with the wave-length, and the water which is at any moment in a
                    vertical plane always remains so throughout the oscillation.</p>
                <p>Suppose that the water is contained in a straight and shallow canal of uniform
                    depth; then take an origin of coordinates at the bottom, with the <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> axis horizontal in the direction of the canal, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> axis vertical; let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the
                    undisturbed depth of water; let <hi rend="italic">h + η</hi> be the ordinate of

                    the canal of finite length, and supposing that, where the canal debouches into a
                    second basin, a second appropriate forced oscillation is maintained. The length
                    of the canal remains arbitrary, save that the second term of (58) shall still be

                    over-tide; and by further approximation we can get the second, third, &amp;c.
                    The over-tide travels up the river at the same rate as the fundamental, but it

                <p>Thus 15 miles up the river the quater-diurnal tide (in § 24 below, called MS) has
                    a semi-range of an inch. But the luni-solar fortnightly tide (called MSf in §
                    24) would have a semi-range, of √ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch.
                    Where the two interacting tides are of nearly equal speed, the summation
                    compound tide is very large compared with the differential tide. As before, when
                    the river shallows gradually this formula will still hold.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to note the kind of effect produced by these compound tides.
                    When the primary tides are in the same phase n <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    &lt;=n <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Z + e.</p>

                <p>Hence the front slope of the tide-wave is steeper at spring than at neap tide,
                    and the compound tide shows itself in the form of an augmentation of the first
                    over-tide; and the converse statements hold of neap tide. Also mean-water mark
                    is lower and higher alternately up the river at spring tide, and higher and
                    lower alternately at neap tide, by a small amount which depends on the
                    differential tide. With the river which we were considering, the alternation
                    would be so long that it would in actuality be either all lower or all
                    higher.</p>

                <p>§ 22. <hi rend="italic">Methods of applying Theory to Practice.</hi></p>
                <p>The comparison between tidal observations and tidal theories, and the formation
                    of tables predicting the tidal oscillations of the sea, have been carried out in
                    two different ways, which may be called the “synthetic” and the “analytic.”</p>
                <p>The semi-diurnal rise and fall of tide with the weekly alternation of spring and
                    neap would naturally suggest to the investigator to make his formula conform to
                    the apparent simplicity of the phenomenon. He would seek to represent the height
                    of water by either one or two periodic functions with a variable amplitude; such
                    a representation is the aim of the synthetic method. That method has been
                    followed by all the great investigators of the past, —Newton, Bernoulli,
                    Maclaurin, Laplace, Lubbock, Whewell, Airy. Since at European ports the two
                    tides which follow one another on any one day are nearly equal, or, in other
                    words, there is scarcely a sensible diurnal tide, these investigators bestowed
                    comparatively little attention to the diurnal tides. If these are neglected, the
                    synthetic method is simple, for a single function suffices to represent the
                    tide. In non-European ports, however, the diurnal tide is sometimes so large as
                    to mask the semi-diurnal, and to make only a single instead of a double high
                    water in twenty-four hours. To represent this diurnal tide in the synthetic
                    method we are compelled to introduce at least one more function. There should
                    also be a third function representing the tides of long period; but until the
                    last few years these tides have scarcely been considered, and therefore we shall
                    have little to say of them in explaining the synthetic method. The expression
                    for the tide-generating forces due to either sun or moon consists of three
                    terms, involving the declinations and hour-angles of the planet. One of these
                    terms for each goes through its period approximately twice a day, a second once
                    a day, and the third varies slowly (§ 7). The mathematical basis of the
                    synthetic method consists of a synthesis of the mathematical formulae. The
                    semi-diurnal term for the moon is fused with that for the sun, and the same
                    process is carried out for the diurnal and slowly varying terms. A mass of tidal
                    observation at a place where the diurnal tide is small, even if, as in all the
                    older observations, it consists merely of heights and times of high and low
                    water, soon shows that the fusion of two simple harmonic or periodic functions
                    is insufficient to represent the state of tide; and the height and time of high
                    water are found to need corrections for the variations of declination, of motion
                    in right ascension, and of the parallaxes of both bodies.</p>
                <p>But when continuous tide-gauges were set up far more extended data than those of
                    the older observations became accessible to the investigator, and more and more
                    corrections were found to be expedient to adapt the formulae to the facts. A
                    systematic method of utilizing all the data became also a desideratum. This
                    state of matters led. Sir W. Thomson to suggest the analytic method.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Airy, and after him
                    Chazallon, appear to have been amongst the first to use a kind of harmonic
                    analysis for reducing tidal observations; but, as A,iry did not emancipate
                    himself from the use of hour-angles, declinations, &amp;c., his work can hardly
                    be considered as an example of the analytic method; see his “Tides and waves,”
                    and Hatt’s <hi rend="italic">Phénomène des Marées,</hi> Paris, 1885.</p></note>
                    It is true that the dynamical foundations of that method have always lain below
                    the surface of the synthetic method, and have constantly been appealed to for
                    the theoretical determination of corrections; nevertheless, we must regard the
                    explicit adoption of the analytic method as a great advance. In this method we
                    conceive the tidal forces or potential due to each disturbing body to be
                    developed into a series of terms each consisting of a constant (determined by
                    the elements of the planet’s orbit and the obliquity of the ecliptic) multiplied
                    by a simple harmonic function of the time. Thus in place of the terms of the
                    synthetic method for the three classes of tides we have an indefinitely long
                    series of terms for each of the three classes. The loss of simplicity in the
                    expression for the forces is far more than counterbalanced by the gain of
                    facility for the discussion of the oscillations of the water. This facility
                    arises from the great dynamical principle of forced oscillations, which we have
                    explained in the historical sketch. Applying this principle, we see that each
                    individual term of the harmonic development of the tidegenerating forces
                    corresponds to an oscillation of the sea of the same period, but the amplitude
                    and phase of that oscillation must depend on a network of causes of almost
                    inextricable complication. The analytic method, then, represents the tide at any
                    port by a series of simple harmonic terms whose period is determined from
                    theoretical considerations, but whose amplitude and phase are found from
                    observation. Fortunately the series representing the tidal forces converges with
                    sufficient rapidity to permit us to consider only a moderate number of harmonic
                    terms in the series.</p>
                <p>Now it seems likely that the corrections which have been applied in the use of
                    the synthetic method might have been clothed in a more satisfactory and succinct
                    mathematical form had investigators first carried out the harmonic development.
                    In this article we shall therefore invert history and come back on the synthetic
                    method from the analytic, and shall show how the formulae of correction stated
                    in harmonic language may be made comparable with them in synthetic language. One
                    explanation is expedient before proceeding with the harmonic development. There
                    are certain terms in the tide-generating forces of the moon, depending on the
                    longitude of the moon’s nodes, which complete their revolution in 18’6 years.
                    Now it has been found practically convenient, in the application of the harmonic
                    method, to follow the synthetic plan to the extent of classifying together terms
                    whose speed differs only in consequence of the movement of the moon’s node, and
                    at the same time to conceive that there is a small variability in the intensity
                    of the generating forces.</p>

                <p>Corresponding to the definition of a simple tide given in § 1, the expression for
                    each term of the tide-generating potential should consist of a solid spherical
                    harmonic, multiplied by a simple timeharmonic. In (71) p¾, p <hi

                    order to complete the expression for V it is necessary to develop the five
                    functions of X, Y, Z in a series of simple timeharmonics. But (71) may be
                    simplified in such a way that the five functions are reduced to three. The axes
                    fixed in the earth may be taken, as in § 7, to have their extremities as follows
                    :—the axis C the north pole, the axis B 90° E. of A on the equator, and the axis
                    A on the equator in the meridian of the place of observation. Thus, if λ be the

                <p>The process of developing the three functions of X, Y, Z consists in the
                    introduction of the formulae of elliptic motion into (66) and (70), the
                    subsequent development of the X-Y-Z functions in a series of trigonometrical
                    terms, and the rejection of terms which appear numerically to be negligible. The
                    terms depending on the principal lunar inequalities—evection and variation— are
                    also introduced. Finally, the three X-Y-Z functions are obtained as a series of
                    simple time-harmonics, with the arguments of the sines and cosines linear
                    functions of the earth’s rotation, the moon’s mean motion, and the longitude of
                    the moon’s perigee. The next step is to pass, according to the principle of
                    forced oscillations, from the potential to the height of tide generated by the
                    forces corresponding to that potential The X-Y-Z functions being simple
                    time-harmonics, the principle of forced vibrations allows us to conclude that
                    the forces corresponding to V in (71a) will generate oscillations in the ocean
                    of the same periods and types as the terms in <hi rend="italic">N,</hi> but of

                    conveniently written 1^")% where JZis the earth’s mass. It has been so chosen
                    that, if the equilibrium theory of tides were fulfilled, with water covering the
                    whole earth, the numerical factors in the J-g-Z functions would be each unity
                    and the alterations of phase would be zero. The terms in ⅛(≡ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + g <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>- 22 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>) require special consideration. The function of the
                    latitude being ⅜-sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> λ, it follows that, when in
                    the northern hemisphere it is high water north of a certain critical latitude,
                    it is low water on the opposite side of that parallel; and the same is true of
                    the southern hemisphere. It is best to adopt a uniform system for the whole
                    earth, and to regard high tide and high water as consentaneous in the equatorial
                    belt, and of opposite meanings outside of the critical latitudes. We here
                    conceive the function always to be written ⅜ - sin <hi rend="superscript">
                    2</hi> λ, so that outside of the critical latitudes high tide is low water. We
                    may in continuing the development write the X-g-2í functions in the form
                    appropriate to the equilibrium theory, with water covering the whole earth; for
                    the actual case it is only then necessary to multiply by the reducing factor,
                    and to subtract the phase alteration <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> As these are
                    unknown constants for each place, they would only occur in the development as
                    symbols of quantities to be deduced from observation. It will be understood,
                    therefore, that in the following schedules the “argument” is that part of the
                    argument which is derived from theory, the true complete argument being the
                    “argument” - <hi rend="italic">κ,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is derived
                    from observation.</p>
                <p>Up to this point we have supposed the moon’s longitude and the earth’s position
                    to be measured from the intersection; but in order to pass to the ordinary
                    astronomical formulae we must measure the longitude and the earth’s position
                    from the vernal equinox. Hence we determine the longitude and right ascension of
                    the intersection in terms of the longitude of the moon’s node and the
                    inclination of the lunar orbit, and introduce them into our formulae for the
                    ï-g-Z functions. The expressions for the functions corresponding to solar tides
                    may be written down by symmetry, and in this case the intersection is actually
                    the vernal equinox.</p>
                <p>The final result of the process sketched is to obtain a series of terms each of
                    which is a function of the elements of the moon’s or sun’s orbit, and a function
                    of the terrestrial latitude of the place of observation, multiplied by the
                    cosine of an angle which increases uniformly with the time. We shall now write
                    down the result in the form of a schedule; but we must first state the notation
                    employed :— <hi rend="italic">e, e</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi> =
                    eccentricities of lunar and solar orbits; Z, <hi rend="italic">ω=</hi>

                    of lunar and solar perigees; σ,σ, = hourly increments of <hi rend="italic">p,
                    p</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">; s, h—</hi> moon’s
                    and sun’s mean longitudes; <hi rend="italic">σ, ∙η=</hi> hourly increments of
                    <hi rend="italic">s, h; t=</hi> local mean solar time reduced to angle; y - <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> = 15° per hour; λ = latitude of place of observation; <hi
                    rend="italic">ξ, v</hi> =longitude in lunar orbit, and R.A. of the intersection;
                    <hi rend="italic">N=</hi> longitude of moon’s node; <hi rend="italic">i=</hi>
                    inclination of lunar orbit. The speed of any tide is defined as the rate of
                    increase of its -argument, and is expressible, therefore, as a linear function
                    of γ, <hi rend="italic">η, σ,</hi> σ; for wé may neglect σ, as being very
                    small.</p>
                <p>The following schedules, then, give h the height of tide. The arrangement is as
                    follows. First, there is a universal coefficient which multiplies every term of
                    all the schedules. Secondly, there are general coefficients, one for each
                    schedule, viz., cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> λ for the semi-diurnal terms,
                    sin 2λ for the diurnal, and ⅜ - ⅜ sin <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> λ for the
                    terms of long period. In each schedule the third column, headed “coefficient,”
                    gives the functions of Zand <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (and in two cases also of
                    <hi rend="italic">p).</hi> In the fourth column is given the mean semi-range of
                    the corresponding term in numbers, which is approximately the value of the
                    coefficient in the first column when Z=ω; but we pass over the explanation of
                    the mode of computing the values. The fifth column contains arguments, linear
                    functions of <hi rend="italic">t, h, s,p, v, ξ.</hi> In [A, i.] <hi
                    rend="italic">2t + 2(h-v')</hi> and in [A, ii.] <hi rend="italic">t + (h-v)</hi>
                    are common to all the arguments. The arguments are grouped in a manner
                    convenient for subsequent computation. Lastly, the sixth is a column of speeds,
                    being the hourly increase of the arguments in the preceding column, estimated in
                    degrees per hour. It has been found practically convenient to denote each of
                    these partial tides by an initial letter, arbitrarily chosen. In the first
                    column we give a descriptive name for the tide, and in the second the
                    arbitrarily chosen initial. In some cases no initial has been chosen, and here
                    we indicate the tide by the analytical expression for its speed, or hourly
                    increase of argument.</p>
                <p>The schedule for the solar tides is drawn up in precisely the same manner, the
                    only difference being that the coefficients are absolute constants. The
                    eccentricity of the solar orbit is so small that the elliptic tides may be
                    omitted, except the larger elliptic semidiurnal tide. In order that the
                    comparison of the importance of the solar tides with the lunar may be complete,
                    the same universal coefficient <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is retained, and the
                    special coefficient for each term is made to involve the factor —. Here τ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> z</hi> =⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">m τ</hi> 2Ί7226</p>
                <p>To write down any term, take the universal coefficient, the general coefficient
                    for the class of tides, the special coefficient, and multiply by the cosine of
                    the argument. The result, taken with the positive sign, is a term in the
                    equilibrium tide, with water covering the whole earth. The transition to the
                    actual case by the introduction of a factor and a delay of phase (to be derived
                    from observation) has been already explained. The sum of all the terms is the
                    complete expression for the height of tide h.</p>

                    Tides.</hi></p>
                <p>All tides whose period is an exact multiple or submultiple of a mean solar day,
                    or of a tropical year, are affected by meteorological conditions. Thus all the
                    tides of the principal solar astronomical series S, with speeds γ-17, 2(γ-τ∕),
                    8(7-17), &amp;c., are subject to more or less meteorological perturbation. An
                    annual inequality in the diurnal meteorological tide S <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> will also give rise to a tide*γ - <hi rend="italic">2η,</hi> and this
                    will be fused with and indistinguishable from the astronomical P; it will also
                    give rise to a tide with speed 7, which will be indistinguishable from the
                    astronomical part of K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Similarly the astronomical
                    tide K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> may be perturbed by a semi-annual inequality
                    in the semi-diurnal astronomical tide of speed 2(7-17). Although the diurnal
                    elliptic tide S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> or 7 -17 and the semi-annual and
                    annual tides of speeds <hi rend="italic">2η</hi> and 17 are all probably quite
                    insensible as arising from astronomical causes, yet they have been found of
                    sufficient importance to be considered. The annual and semiannual tides are of
                    enormous importance in some rivers, representing in fact the yearly flooding in
                    the rainy season. In the reduction of these tides the arguments of the S series
                    are <hi rend="italic">t, 2t,</hi> 3f, &amp;c., and of the annual, semi-annual,
                    ter-annual tides <hi rend="italic">h, 2h, Sh.</hi> As far as can be foreseen,
                    the magnitudes of these tides are constant from year to year.</p>
                <p>We have in § 21 considered the dynamical theory of over-tides. The only tides of
                    this kind in which it has hitherto been thought necessary to represent the
                    change of form in shallow water belong to the principal lunar and principal
                    solar series. Thus, besides the fundamental astronomical tides M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the over-tides M
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, M <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi>, M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, and S <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi> have been deduced by harmonic analysis. The height of
                    the fundamental tide M <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> varies from year to year,
                    according to the variation in the obliquity of the lunar orbit, and this
                    variability is represented by the coefficient cos <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>
                    ⅜Z. It is probable that the variability of M <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, M <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> will be represented by
                    the square, cube, and fourth power of that coefficient, and theory (§ 21)
                    indicates that we should make the argument of the over-tide a multiple of the
                    argument of the fundamental, with a constant subtracted.</p>
                <p>Compound tides have been also considered dynamically in § 21. By combining the
                    speeds of the important tides, it will be found that there is in many cases a
                    compound tide which has itself a speed identical with that of an astronomical or
                    meteorological tide. We thus find that the tides 0, K <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, Mm, P, M <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, Mf, Q, M <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, L are liable to perturbation in shallow water. If either or both the
                    component tides are of lunar origin, the height of the compound tide will change
                    from year to year, and will probably vary proportionally to the product of the
                    coefficients of the component tides. For the purpose of properly reducing the
                    numerical value of the compound tides, we require not merely the speed, but also
                    the argument. The following schedule gives the adopted initials, argument, and
                    speed of the principal compound tides. The coefficients are the products of
                    those of the two tides to be compounded.</p>

                    continuous observation, then the immediate result of harmonic analysis is to

                <p>R cos (<hi rend="italic">nt - ζ).</hi></p>
                <p>In this form R is the semi-range of the tide in British feet, and <hi

                    particular tide. It is obvious that <hi rend="italic">ζ</hi> may have any value
                    from 0 <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> to 360°, and that the results of the
                    analysis of successive years of observation will not be comparable with one
                    another when presented in this form.</p>
                <p>But let us suppose that the results of the analysis are presented in a number of
                    terms of the form fHcos(<hi rend="italic">V+u-κ),</hi> where <hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi> is a linear function of the moon’s and sun’s mean longitudes, the mean
                    longitude of the moon’s and sun’s perigees, and the local mean solar time at the
                    place of observation, reduced to angle at 15° per hour. <hi rend="italic">V</hi>
                    increases uniformly with the time, and its rate of increase per mean solar hour
                    is the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> of the first method, and is called the speed of
                    the tide. It is supposed that <hi rend="italic">u</hi> stands for a certain
                    function of the longitude of the node of the lunar orbit at an epoch half a year
                    later than 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> of the first day. Strictly speaking,
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> should be taken as the same function of the longitude
                    of the moon’s node, varying as the node moves; but, as the variation is but
                    small in the course of a year, <hi rend="italic">u</hi> may be treated as a
                    constant and put equal to an average value for the year, which average value is
                    taken as the true value of <hi rend="italic">u</hi> at exactly mid year.
                    Together <hi rend="italic">V+ u</hi> constitute that function which has been
                    tabulated as the “argument” in the schedules of § 23. Since <hi rend="italic">V+
                    u</hi> are together the whole argument according to the equilibrium theory of
                    tides, with sea covering the whole earth, it follows that <hi rend="italic"
                    >κ∕n</hi> is the lagging of the tide which arises from kinetic action, friction
                    of the water, imperfect elasticity of the earth, and the distribution of land.
                    It is supposed that H is the mean value in British feet of the semi-range of the
                    particular tide in question; f is a numerical factor of augmentation or
                    diminution, due to the variability of the obliquity of the lunar orbit. The
                    value of f is the ratio of the “coefficient” in the third column of the
                    preceding schedules to the mean value of the same term. For example, for all the
                    solar tides f is unity, and for the principal lunar tide M <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> it is equal to cos <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜Z÷cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜ω cos <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜i; for the
                    mean value of this term has a coefficient cos <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜ω
                    cos <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜i. It is obvious, then, that, if the tidal
                    observations are consistent from year to year, H and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi>
                    should come out the same from each year’s reductions. It is only when the
                    results are presented in such a form as this that it will be possible to judge
                    whether the harmonic analysis is yielding satisfactory results. This mode of
                    giving the tidal results is also essential for the use of a tide-predicting
                    machine (see § 38).</p>
                <p>We must now show how to determine H and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> from R and <hi
                    rend="italic">ζ.</hi> It is clear that H = R∕f, and the determination of f from
                    the schedules depends on the evaluation of the mean value of each of the terms
                    in the schedules, into which we shall not enter. If <hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> o</hi> be the value of <hi rend="italic">V</hi> at 0
                    <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> of the first day, then clearly <hi rend="italic"
                    >~ζ=</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">+u-κ,</hi> so that <hi rend="italic">κ=ζ+ V</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic">+u.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the rule for the determination of <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> is: <hi
                    rend="italic">Add to the value of</hi> f the <hi rend="italic">value of

                    rend="italic">of the first day.</hi></p>
                <p>The results of harmonic analysis are usually tabulated by giving Η, <hi
                    rend="italic">κ</hi> under the initial letter of each tide; the results are thus
                    comparable from year to year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    be reversed, with the difference that the instant of time to which to refer the

                    rend="italic">κ</hi> of any tide are known its height may be computed for any
                    instant. The sum of the heights for all the principal tides of course gives the

                <p>§ 26. <hi rend="italic">Numerical Harmonic Analysis for Tides of Short
                    Period.</hi></p>
                <p>The tide-gauge (described below, § 36) furnishes us with a continuous graphical
                    record of the height of the water above some known datum mark for every instant
                    of time. The first operation performed on the tidal record is the measurement in
                    feet and decimals of the height of water above the datum at every mean solar
                    hour. The period chosen for analysis is about one year and the first measurement
                    corresponds to noon.</p>
                <p>If T be the period of any one of the diurnal tides, or the double period of any
                    one of the semi-diurnal tides, it approximates more or less nearly to 24 m. s.
                    hours, and, if we divide it into twenty-four equal parts, we may speak of each
                    as a T-hour. We shall for brevity refer to mean solar time as S-time. Suppose,
                    now, that we have two clocks, each marked with 360°, or 24 hours, and that the
                    hand of the first, or S-clock, goes round once in 24 S-hours, and that of the
                    second, or T-clock, goes round once in twenty-four T-hours, and suppose that the
                    two clocks are started at 0° or 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> at noon of the
                    initial day. For the sake of distinctness, let us imagine that a T-hour is
                    longer than an S-hour, so that the T-clock goes slower than the S-clock. The
                    measurements of the tide curve give us the height of water exactly at each
                    S-hour; and it is required from these data to determine the height of water at
                    each T-hour. For this end we are, in fact, instructed to count T-time, but are
                    only allowed to do so by reference to S-time, and, moreover, the time is always
                    to be specified as an integral number of hours. Commencing with 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> of the first day, we begin counting 0, 1, 2, &amp;c.,
                    as the T-hand comes up to its hour-marks. But, as the S-hand gains on the
                    T-hand, there will come a time when, the T-hand being exactly at the <hi
                    rend="italic">p</hi> hour-mark, the S-hand is nearly as far as <hi rend="italic"
                    >p + ⅛.</hi> When, however, the T-hand has advanced to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >p+</hi> 1 hour-mark, the S-hand will be a little beyond <hi rend="italic"
                    >p</hi> +1 + ⅜,—that is to say, a little less than half an hour before <hi
                    rend="italic">p + 2.</hi> Counting, then, in T-time by reference to S-time, we
                    jump from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p + 2.</hi> The counting
                    will go on continuously for a number of hours nearly equal to 2jo, and then
                    another number will be dropped, and so on throughout the whole year. If it had
                    been the T-hand which went faster than the S-hand, it is obvious that one number
                    would be repeated at two successive hours instead of one being dropped. We may
                    describe each such process as a “change.”</p>
                <p>Now, if we have a sheet marked for entry of heights of water according to T-hours
                    from results measured at S-hours, we must enter the S-measurements continuously
                    up to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and we then come to a change; dropping one of
                    the S-series, we go on again continuously until another change, when another is
                    dropped; and so on. Since a change occurs at the time when a T-hour falls almost
                    exactly half-way between two S-hours, it will be more accurate at a change to
                    insert the two S-entries which fall on each side of the truth. If this be done
                    the whole of the S series of measurements is entered on the T-sheet. Similarly,
                    if it be the T-hand which goes faster than the S-hand, we may leave a gap in the
                    T-series instead of duplicating an entry. For the analysis of the T-tide there
                    is therefore prepared a sheet arranged in rows and columns; each row corresponds
                    to one T-day, and the columns are marked 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>, l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi>,... 23 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>; the 0’s may be
                    called T-noons. A dot is put in each space for entry, and where there is a
                    change two dots are put if there is to be a double entry, and a bar if there is
                    to be no entry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A sample
                    page is given in the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> to the Brit. Assoc.,

                    then divided, each by the proper divisor for its column, and thus the mean value
                    for that column is obtained. In this way 24 numbers are found which give the
                    mean height of water at each of the 24 special hours. It is obvious that if this
                    process were continued over a very long time we should in the end extract the
                    tide under analysis from amongst all the others; but, as the process only
                    extends over about a year, the elimination of the others is not quite complete.
                    The elimination of the effects of the other tides may be improved by choosing
                    the period for analysis not exactly equal to one year.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to our general notation, and consider the 24 mean values, each
                    pertaining to the 24 T-hours. We suppose that all the tides except the T-tide
                    are adequately eliminated, and, in fact, a computation of the necessary
                    corrections for the absence of complete elimination, which is given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tidal Report</hi> to the British Association in 1872, shows that
                    this is the case. It is <pb break="no"

                    >24</hi> values does not give the true height of the T-tide at that T-hour, but
                    gives the average height of the water, as due to the T-tide, estimated over half
                    a T-hour before and naif a T-hour after that hour. A consideration of this point
                    shows that certain augmenting factors, differing slightly from unity, must be
                    applied. In the reduction of the S-series of tides, the numbers treated are the
                    actual heights of the water exactly at the S-hours, and therefore no augmenting
                    factor is requisite.</p>
                <p>We must now explain how the harmonic analysis, which the use of these factors
                    presupposes, is carried out</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">t</hi> denotes T-time expressed in T-hours, and <hi

                <p>Since <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is 15° and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is an integer,
                    it follows that all the cosines and sines involved in these series are equal to
                    one of the following, viz., 0, ÷sin 15°, ±sin 30°, ÷sin 45°, ÷sin 60°, ±sin 75°,
                    ±1. It is found convenient to denote these sines by 0, ±S <hi rend="subscript">

                    of the 24 h’s by the various S’s and the subsequent additions may be arranged in
                    a very neat tabular form, like that given in a <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> to
                    the British Association in 1883. The A’s and B’s having been thus deduced, we
                    have R= √(A <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + B <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>).
                    R must then be multiplied by the augmenting factor. We thus have the augmented
                    R. Next the angle whose tangent is B/A gives <hi rend="italic">ζ.</hi> The

                    H. The reduction is then complete. An actual numerical example of harmonic
                    analysis is given in the <hi rend="italic">Admiralty Scientific Manual</hi>
                    (1886) In the article “Tides”; but the process there employed is slightly
                    different from the above, because the series of observations is supposed to be a
                    short one.</p>
                <p>§ 27. <hi rend="italic">Harmonic Analysis for Tides of Long Period.</hi></p>
                <p>For the purpose of determining the tides of long period we have to eliminate the
                    oscillations of water-level arising from the tides of short period. As the
                    quickest of these tides has a period of many days, the height of mean water at
                    one instant for each day gives sufficient data. Thus there will in a year’s
                    observations be 365 heights to be submitted to harmonic analysis. To find the
                    daily mean for any day we take the arithmetic mean of 24 consecutive hourly
                    values, beginning with the height at noon. This height will then apply to the
                    middle instant of the period from 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> to 23 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi>, —that is to say, to ll <hi rend="superscript">
                    h</hi> 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> at night. The formation of a daily mean
                    does not obliterate the tidal oscillations of short period, because none of the
                    tides, except those of the principal solar series, have commensurable periods in
                    mean solar time. A small correction, or “clearance of the daily mean,” has
                    therefore to be applied for all the important tides of short period, except for
                    the solar tides. Passing by this clearance, we next take the 365 daily means,
                    and find their mean value. This gives the mean height of water for the year. We
                    next subtract the mean height from each of the 365 values, and find 365
                    quantities δh, giving the daily height of water above the mean height. These
                    quantities are to be the subject of the harmonic analysis, and the tides chosen
                    for evaluation are those which have been denoted above as Mm, Mf, MSf, Sa,
                    Ssa.</p>
                <p>Let δh = A cos (&lt;r-σ)i + B sin (σ∙-σ)U</p>
                <p>+ C cos <hi rend="italic">2σt</hi> + D sin <hi rend="italic">2σt</hi></p>
                <p>+ C'cos2(ff-ι∕)i + D'sin2(&lt;r-i7)i (73),</p>
                <p>+ E cos <hi rend="italic">ηt</hi> + F sin <hi rend="italic">∙ηt</hi></p>
                <p>+ G cos <hi rend="italic">2∙ηt</hi> +H sin2τ∕i where <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is
                    time measured from the first ll <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi>. If we multiply the 365 δh ’ s by 365 values of cos
                    (&lt;r - <hi rend="italic">τs)t</hi> and effect the summation, the coefficients
                    of B,C,D, &amp;c., are very small, and that of A is nearly 182⅜. Similarly,
                    multiplying by sin (&lt;τ - σ)i, cos <hi rend="italic">2σt,</hi> &amp;c., we
                    obtain 10 equations for A,B,C, &amp;c., in each of which one coefficient is
                    nearly 182⅜ and the rest small. These equations are easily solved by successive
                    approximation. In this way A,B,C, &amp;c., are found, and afterwards the
                    clearance to which we have alluded is applied. Finally the cleared A,B,C,
                    &amp;c., are treated exactly as were the components of the tides of short
                    period. Special forms and tables have been prepared for facilitating these
                    operations.</p>

                <p>§ 28. On <hi rend="italic">the Method and Notation.</hi></p>
                <p>The general nature of the synthetic method has been already explained; we now
                    propose to develop the expressions for the tide from the result as expressed in
                    the harmonic notation. If it should be desired to make a comparison of the
                    results of tidal observation as expressed in the synthetic method with those of
                    the harmonic method, or the converse, or to compute a tide-table from the
                    harmonic constants by reference to the moon’s transits and from the declinations
                    and parallaxes of sun and moon, the analytical expressions of the following
                    sections are necessary.</p>
                <p>In chapter iv. the mean semi-range and angle of retardation or lag of any one of
                    the tides have been denoted by H and <hi rend="italic">κ.</hi> We shall here,
                    however, require to introduce several of the H’s and <hi rend="italic">κ's</hi>
                    into the same expression, and they must therefore be distinguished from one
                    another. This may in general be conveniently done by writing as a subscript
                    letter the initial of the corresponding tide; for example H <hi rend="subscript"
                    > wι</hi>, <hi rend="italic">κ</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> m</hi> will be
                    taken to denote the H and <hi rend="italic">κ</hi> of the principal lunar tide M
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. This notation does not suit the K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> tides, and we shall
                    therefore write H", <hi rend="italic">κ"</hi> for the semi-diurnal K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and H', <hi rend="italic">κ'</hi> for the diurnal K
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> tide. These two tides proceed according to sidereal
                    time and arise from the sun and moon jointly, and a synthesis of the two parts
                    of each is effected in the harmonic method, although that synthesis is not
                    explained in chapter iv. The ratio of the solar to the lunar part of the total K
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> tide is ∙46407; hence ’ 683 H" is the lunar portion
                    of the total K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. There will be no occasion to
                    separate the two portions of K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and we shall retain
                    the synthesis which is effected in the harmonic method.</p>
                <p>§ 29. <hi rend="italic">Semi-Diurnal Tides.</hi></p>
                <p>The process adopted is to replace the mean longitudes and elements of the orbit
                    in each term of the harmonic development of the schedules of § 23 by

                <p>From (74) and (75) we have approximately <hi rend="italic">a=s+(v</hi>- £) + 2e

                    Again, if Τ’ be the ratio of the J’s parallax to her mean parallax, the equation

                <p>Now it appears in schedule A of § 23 that the arguments of all the lunar

                    therefore, that the cosines of such angles may by the relations (76), (78), (79)
                    be expressed in terms of hour-angles, declinations, and parallaxes. Also by
                    means of (77) we may introduce Δ in place of <hi rend="italic">I</hi> in the
                    coefficients of each term. An approximate formula for Δ is 16°'51 + 3°∙44 cos

                    the processes indicated are given.</p>
                <p>Before giving the formula it must be remarked that the result is expressed more
                    succinctly by the introduction of the symbol δ' to denote the J’s declination at
                    a time earlier than that of observation by an interval which may be called the
                    “age of the declina-tional inequality,” and is computed from the formula tan
                    (κ"- κ <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi>)∕2&lt;τ or 52 <hi rend="superscript">

                    denote the value of P at a time earlier than that of observation by the “age of
                    the parallactic inequality,” to be computed from tan (κ <hi rend="subscript">

                <p>The similar series of transformations when applied to the solar tides leads to
                    simpler results, because Δ, is a constant, being 16°∙33, and the “ages” may be
                    treated as zero; besides the terms depending on <hi rend="italic">dδjdt</hi> and

                <p>If the equilibrium theory of tides were true, each H would be proportional to the
                    corresponding term in the harmonically developed potential. This proportionality
                    holds nearly between tides of almost the same speed; hence, using the
                    expressions in the column of coefficients in schedule [B, L], § 23 (with the
                    additional tide R there omitted, but having a coefficient (τ,∕τ)⅜.⅜e, cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ⅜ω, found by symmetry with the lunar tide L), and
                    introducing Δ, in place of ω in the solar tides, we may assume the truth of the

                <p>This is the law which we should have derived directly from the equilibrium
                    theory, with the hypothesis that all solar semi-diurnal tides suffer nearly
                    equal retardation. Save for meteorological influences, this must certainly be
                    true.</p>
                <p>. A similar synthesis of Μ cannot be carried out, because the considerable
                    diversity of speed amongst the lunar tides makes a similar appeal to the
                    equilibrium theory incorrect. It may be seen, however, that it would be more
                    correct to write cos <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> δ' instead of cos <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Δ in the coefficient of the parallactic terms in Μ
                    and 2/4.</p>
                <p>The three terms of Μ in (82) give the height of lunar tide with its declinational
                    and parallactic corrections, and similarly the formula for <hi rend="italic"
                    >μ</hi> in (82) gives its value and corrections.</p>
                <p>If now τ denotes the mean solar time elapsing since the moon’s upper transit and
                    γ the angular velocity of the earth’s rotation, it is clear that the moon’s
                    hour-angle <hi rend="italic">ψ=(y-dajdt}r',</hi> and, since Mcos2(¾i'-μ) is a

                <p>Spring tide obviously occurs when <hi rend="italic">A=μ</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">μ,</hi> are ⅜κ <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi>, ⅜κ,, it follows that
                    the mean value of the period elapsing after full moon and change of moon up to

                    >if).</hi> The association of spring tide with full and change is obvious, and a
                    fiction has been adopted by which it is held that spring tide is generated in
                    those configurations of the moon and sun, but takes some time to reach the port
                    of observation. Accordingly (κ, - κ <hi rend="subscript"> m</hi>)∕2(&lt;r - <hi
                    rend="italic">if)</hi> has been called the “age of the tide.” The average age is
                    about 36 hours as far as observations have yet been made. The age of the tide
                    appears not in general to differ veιy much from the ages of the declinational
                    and parallactic inequalities.</p>
                <p>In computing a tide-table it is found practically convenient not to use A, which
                    is the difference of R. A.’s at the unknown time of high water, but to refer the
                    tide to A <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi>, the difference of R·A.’s at the time of
                    the moon’s transit. It is clear that A <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> is the
                    apparent time of the moon’s transit reduced to angle at 15° per hour. We have
                    already remarked that <hi rend="italic">φfiy - da</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣</hi><hi rend="italic">dt}</hi> is the interval from transit to high water,
                    and hence at high water</p>
                <p>- w.</p>
                <p>As an approximation we may attribute to all the quantities in the second term
                    their mean values, and we then have <hi rend="italic">σ-n</hi></p>
                <p>A = A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> + -A</p>

                <p>This approximate formula (90) may be used in computing from (88) the fortnightly
                    inequality in the “height” and “interval.”</p>
                <p>In this investigation we have supposed that the declinational and parallactic
                    corrections are applied to the lunar and solar tides before their synthesis; but
                    it is obvious that the process might be reversed, and that we may form a table
                    of the fortnightly inequality based on mean values H <hi rend="subscript">
                    m</hi> and H <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>, and afterwards apply corrections.
                    Tlιis is the process usually adopted, but it is less exact. The labour of
                    computing the fortnightly inequality, especially by graphical methods, is not
                    great, and the plan here suggested seems preferable.</p>

                <p>These tides have not been usually treated with completeness in the synthetic
                    method. In the tide-tables of the British Admiralty we find that the tides at
                    some ports are “affected by diurnal inequality”; such a statement may be
                    interpreted as meaning that the tides are not to be predicted by the information
                    given in the so-called tide-table. The diurnal tides are indeed complex, and do
                    not lend themselves easily to a complete synthesis. In the harmonic notation the
                    three important tides are K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,O,P, and the lunar
                    portion of K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is nearly equal to O in height, whilst
                    the solar portion is nearly equal to P. A complete synthesis may be carried out
                    on the lines adopted in treating the semi-diurnal tides, but the advantage of
                    the plan is lost in consequence of large oscillations of the amplitude through
                    the value zero, so that the tide is often represented by a negative quantity
                    multiplied by a circular function. It is best, then, only to attempt a partial
                    synthesis, and to admit the existence of two diurnal tides.</p>
                <p>We see from schedules [A, ii.] and [B, L], § 23, that the principal diurnal tides
                    are those lettered O, P, K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. Of these K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> occurs both for the moon and the sun. The synthesis of
                    the two parts of K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is effected without difficulty,
                    and the result is a formula for the total K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> tide
                    like that in [A, ii.], but with the <hi rend="italic">v</hi> which occurs in the
                    argument replaced by a different angle denoted as v'. If, then, we write</p>

                <p>the three tides 0,K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>,P are written as follows :—</p>

                <p>The last two tides have very nearly the same speed, so that we may assume <hi

                    in the equilibrium theory. Now, in schedules [A, ii.], [B, ii.], § 23, the
                    coefficient of K <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>, viz., H' (the sum of the lunar
                    and solar parts), is •26522, and the coefficient of P, viz., H <hi

                <p>If, therefore, we put</p>

                <p>It is clear that <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> and R' have a semi-annual inequality,
                    and therefore for several weeks together R' and <hi rend="italic">ψ</hi> may be
                    treated as constant.</p>
                <p>Now suppose that we compute V <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> and V' at the
                    epoch—that is, at the initial noon of the period during which we wish to predict
                    the tides—and with these values put f <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> =κ <hi

                <p>Then the speed of Y <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> is γ-2&lt;r, or 13° <hi

                    9856 per day. Hence, if t be the mean solar time on the (n+l)th day since the

                <p>If we substitute for t the time of high or low water as computed simply from the
                    semi-diurnal tide, it is clear that the sum of these two expressions will give
                    the diumal correction for height of tide at high or low water, provided the
                    diurnal tides are not very large. If we consider the maximum of a function</p>

                <p>The practice of the British Admiralty is to refer their soundings and tide-tables
                    to “mean low-water mark of ordinary spring tides.” This datum is found by taking
                    the mean of the low-water marks of such observations at spring tide as are
                    available, or, if the observations are very extensive, by excluding from the
                    mean such spring tides as appear to be abnormal, owing to the largeness of the
                    moon’s parallax at the time or any other cause. The Admiralty datum is not,
                    then, susceptible of exact scientific definition; but, when it has once been
                    fixed with reference to a bench mark ashore, it is expedient to adhere to it, by
                    whatever process it was first fixed.</p>
                <p>It is now proposed to adopt for any new Indian tidal stations a low-water datum

                <p>A continuous register of the tide or observation at fixed intervals of time, such
                    as each hour, is certainly the best; but for the adequate use of such a record
                    some plan analogous to harmonic analysis is necessary. Observations of high and
                    low water only have, at least until recently, been more usual. Some care has to
                    be taken with respect to these observations, for about high and low water an
                    irregularity in the rise and fall becomes very noticeable, especially if the

                    every five or ten minutes for half an hour or an hour, embracing the time of
                    high and low water. The time and height of high and low water should then be
                    found by plotting down a curve of heights, and by taking as the true tide-curve
                    a line which presents a sweeping curvature and smoothes away the minor
                    irregularities. A similar but less elaborate process would render hourly
                    observations more perfect. In the reduction the immediate object is to connect
                    the times and heights of high and low water with the moon’s transits by means of
                    the establishment, age, and fortnightly inequality in the interval and height.
                    The reference of the tide -to the establishment is not, however, scientifically
                    desirable, and it is better to determine the mean establishment, which is the
                    mean interval from the moon’s transit to high water at spring tide, and the age
                    of the tide, which is the mean period from full moon and change of moon to

                    in the order V, VI, . . ., XII, I . . . ∏∏. Then each interval of time from
                    transit to high water is set off as an ordinate above the corresponding
                    time-of-clock of the moon’s transit. A sweeping curve is drawn nearly through

                    curve may be constructed for the low waters. In this case, however, the hours of
                    the clock are repeated twice over, so that the morning and evening tides occur
                    in different halves of the figure, and the hours are not hours of the moon’s
                    transit, but the actual times of high water. It is obvious that the separation
                    of the morning and evening tides prevents the occurrence of the zigzags referred
                    to.</p></note> In the curve of high-water intervals the ordinate corresponding
                    to XII is the establishment, since it gives the time of high water at full moon
                    and change of moon. That ordinate of high-water intervals which is coincident
                    with the greatest ordinate of high-water heights gives the mean establishment.
                    Since the moon’s transit falls about fifty minutes later on each day, in setting
                    off a fortnight’s observations there will be about five days for each four
                    times-of-clock of the upper transit. Hence in these figures we may regard each
                    division of the time-scale I to II, II to III, &amp;c., as representing
                    twenty-five hours instead of one hour. Then the distance from the greatest
                    ordinate of high-water heights to XII is called the age of the tide. From these
                    two figures the times and heights of high and low water may in general be

                    improved the method of Laplace by taking into account all the observed tides,
                    and not merely those appertaining to certain configurations. He divided the
                    observations into a number of classes. First, the tides are separated into
                    parcels, one for each month; then each parcel is sorted according to the hour of
                    the moon’s transit. Another classification is made according to declination;
                    another according to parallax; and a last for the diurnal inequalities. This
                    plan was followed in treating the tides of London, Brest, St Helena, Plymouth,
                    Portsmouth, and Sheemess. Whewell <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1834 <hi

                    form, and made a highly important advance by the introduction of graphical
                    methods by means of curves. The method explained above is due to him. Airy

                    reduction of new observations that we have ever seen.”</p>

                <p>Practical tidal work is divisible into the three stages of observa-vation,
                    reduction of observations, and prediction.</p>
                <p>The simplest observation is that of the height of water on a fair approximation.
                    We find the time-of-clock of the moon’s upper or lower transit on the day,
                    correct by the equation of time, read off the corresponding heights of high and
                    low water from the figures, and the intervals being also read off are added to
                    the time of the moon’s transit and give the times of high and low water. At all
                    ports there is, however, an irregularity of heights and intervals between
                    successive tides, and in consequence of this the curves present more or less of
                    a zigzag appearance. Where the zigzag is perceptible to the eye, the curves must
                    be smoothed by drawing them so as to bisect the zigzags, because these diurnal
                    inequalities will not present themselves similarly in the future. When, as in
                    some equatorial ports, the diurnal tides are large, this method of tidal
                    prediction fails.</p>
                <p>This method of working out observations of high and low water was not the
                    earliest. In the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic">Celeste,</hi>
                    bks. i and v., Laplace treats a large mass of tidal observations by dividing
                    them into classes depending on the configurations of the tide-generating bodies.
                    Thus he separates the two syzygial tides at full moon and change of moon and
                    divides them into equinoctial and solstitial tides. He takes into consideration
                    the tides of several days embracing these configurations. He goes through the
                    tides at quadratures on the same general plan. The effects of declination and
                    parallax and the diurnal inequalities are similarly treated. Lubbocκ <hi

                    as is possible made for wave-motion. It is far better, however, to sink a tube
                    into the sea, into which the water penetrates through small holes. The
                    wave-motion is thus annulled. In this calm water there lies a float, to which is
                    attached a cord passing over a pulley and counterpoised at the end. The motion
                    of the counterpoise against a scale is observed. In either case the observations
                    may be made every hour, which is preferable, or the times and heights of high
                    and low water may be noted. We have explained in § 34 the methods of reducing
                    the latter kind of observation. Although more appropriate for rough
                    observations, this method is susceptible of great accuracy when carefully used.
                    It has been largely superseded by the harmonic method, but is still adhered to
                    by the British Admiralty. In more careful observations than those of which we
                    are speaking the tidal record is automatic and continuous; the reduction may be,
                    and probably at some future time will be, mechanical; and the prediction is so
                    already. We shall therefore devote some space to general descriptions of the
                    three classes of instrument. The harmonic reductions are at present (1887)
                    actually done numerically, and in chapter iv. we have indicated the nature of
                    the arithmetical processes.</p>

                <p>The site for the erection of a tide-gauge depenαs on local circumstances. It
                    should be placed so as to present a fair representation of the tidal
                    oscillations of the surrounding area. A tank is generally provided,
                    communicating by a channel with the sea at about 10 feet (more or less according
                    to the prevalent surf) below the lowest low-water mark. In many cases on open
                    coasts and frequently<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0390-0371"/> in estuaries the tank may be dispensed with. At
                    any rate we suppose that water is provided rising and falling with the tide,
                    without much wave-motion. The nature of the installation depends entirely on the
                    circumstances of the case. A vertical pipe is fixed in the water in such a way
                    as to admit it only through holes small enough to annul wave-motion and large
                    enough to make no sensible retardation of its rise and fall in the pipe. The
                    diameter of the pipe differs greatly in different instruments: sometimes that
                    which we have described as the tank serves as the pipe, and sometimes the pipe
                    alone dips into the sea. A cylindrical float, usually a hollow metallic box or a
                    block of green-heart wood, hangs and floats in the pipe, and is of such density
                    as just to sink without support. In Sir W. Thomson’s gauge the float hangs by a
                    fine platinum wire, in Newman’s (used in India) by a metallic ribbon. In the
                    latter a chain hangs at the bottom of the float of such weight that, whether the
                    water be high or low, there is the same upward force on the float. It is
                    necessary that the pull on the float should be constant, otherwise a systematic
                    error is introduced between rising and falling water. The suspension wire is
                    wrapped round a wheel, and imparts to it rotation proportional to the rise and
                    fall of tide. By a simple gearing this wheel drives another, by which the range
                    is reduced to any convenient extent. A fine wire wound on the final wheel of the
                    train drags a pencil or pen up and down or to and fro proportionately to the
                    tidal oscillations. The pencil is lightly pressed against a drum, which is
                    driven by clockwork so as to make one revolution per day. The pen leaves its
                    trace or tide-curve on paper wrapped round the drum. Generally, however, the
                    paper is fixed to the drum, and the record of a fortnight may be taken without
                    change of paper. An example of a tide-curve for Apollo Bunder, Bombay, from 1st
                    to 15th January 1884, is shown in fig. 3. Sometimes the paper is in a long band,
                    which the drum picks off from one coil and delivers on to another. The contact
                    of the pen must be such that the work done in dragging it over the paper is
                    small, otherwise a varying tension is thrown on to the float wire. Hence, if the
                    friction is considerable, the float must be large.</p>
                <p>The conditions necessary for a good tide-gauge appear to be better satisfied by
                    Sir W. Thomson’s than by any other; but, as his instrument is recent, other
                    forms have been much more extensively used, and have worked well. The
                    peculiarity of Thomson’s tidegauge is that, by giving the drum an inclination to
                    the vertical, the pressure of the pen on the paper and on its guides is very
                    delicately regulated to the minimum necessary for effecting the purpose. In
                    other gauges the drum has been either vertical or horizontal, and the amount of
                    friction has necessarily been considerably greater.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Thus a machine which will effect these integrations will give A and B. Such a
                    machine has been invented by Prof. James Thomson and perfected by Sir W.
                    Thomson. In fig. 4 let TT' be a circular table, capable of rotation about the
                    inclined shaft <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> Let S be a sphere touching the table
                    anywhere along its horizontal diameter. Let C be a cylinder, of somewhat smaller
                    diameter than the sphere, capable of rotation about a horizontal axis parallel
                    to the table, and touching the sphere so that CS is parallel to TT'. Suppose
                    that the point of contact of the sphere with the table is distant <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> from the centre of the table, and nearer to us than the
                    shaft; then, when the shaft s and the table TT' turn in such a direction that T
                    rises from the paper and T' goes below it, the sphere will turn in the direction
                    of its arrow. If the radius of the sphere is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and that
                    of the cylinder <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then, when the table turns through a
                    small angle <hi rend="italic">δθ,</hi> the sphere turns through <hi
                    rend="italic">xδθ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> and the
                    cylinder through <hi rend="italic">xbθ</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> This angle vanishes if S touches the table at the centre,
                    and is reversed if the sphere be moved across to the other side of the centre.
                    Also whilst the table is turning the sphere may be rolled backwards and forwards
                    without rubbing, and thus transmits motion from the table to the cylinder
                    without slipping. Now suppose the turning of the table is so constrained that
                    <hi rend="italic">5θ=kcosψdψ,</hi> whilst <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    constrained to be equal to the arbitrarily varying quantity H. Then the total
                    angle turned through by the cylinder, as the machine runs, is proportional to/H
                    <hi rend="italic">cosfdψ.</hi> If we impart to the table a simple harmonic
                    oscillatory motion, with a period proportional to the lunar half-day, whilst the
                    sphere moves, relatively to the centre of the table, proportionately to the
                    tide-heights on the same time-scale, then, at the end of a sufficient number of
                    lunar days, we shall find that the total angle turned through by the cylinder is
                    proportional to either the A or B component of the lunar semi-diurnal tide. An
                    index, which points to a dial, may be fixed to the cylinder, so that the
                    required result may be read off.</p>
                <p>In the harmonic analyser the tide-curve diagram is wrapped on a drum, which is
                    turned by one hand, whilst with the other a pointer is guided to follow the
                    tide-curve. As the drum turns proportionately to mean solar time, appropriate
                    gearing causes two tables to execute harmonic oscillations in phases at right
                    angles, with lunar semi-diurnal period. At the same time a fork attached to the
                    pointer guides the two spheres so that their distances from the centres of their
                    tables are equal to the tide-height in the diagram. The indexes attached to the
                    two cylinders give the two components of the lunar semi-diurnal tide, and the
                    approximation improves the longer the tide-curve which is passed through the
                    machine. Corresponding to each of the principal lunar and solar tides there are
                    a pair of tables, spheres with guiding forks, and cylinders similarly geared,
                    and there is another sphere and another table, which last always turns the same
                    way and at the same rate as the drum, from which the mean height of water is
                    determined. Such an instrument has been constructed under the supervision of Sir
                    W. Thomson, but has not yet been put into practical use, so that we cannot say
                    how it will compete with the arithmetical harmonic analysis. A similar, but less
                    complex machine for the analysis of meteorological observations is in constant
                    use in the Meteorological· Office in London, and is found to work well.<note

                <p>§ 38. <hi rend="italic">The Tide-Predicting Instrument.</hi></p>
                <p>The first suggestion for instrumental prediction of tides was given, we believe,
                    by Sir W. Thomson in 1872, and the instruments since made have been founded on
                    the principles which he then laid down. Mr Edward Roberts bore a very important
                    part in the first practical realization of such a machine, and a tide-predicter
                    was constructed by Légé for the Indian Government under his direction. Thomson’s
                    is the only instrument in Europe as yet in regular practical use for
                    navigational purposes. It requires much skill and care in manipulation, and it
                    has been ably worked by Mr Roberts for the production of the Indian tide-tables
                    ever since its completion. We refer the reader to Sir W. Thomson’s paper on
                    “Tidal Instruments,” in <hi rend="italic">Inst. C.E.,</hi> vol. lxv., and to the
                    subsequent discussion, for a full account of the several instruments, and for
                    details of the share borne by the various persons concerned in the realization
                    of the idea.</p>
                <p>Fig. 5 illustrates diagrammatically the nature of the instrument. A cord passes
                    over and under a succession of pulleys, being fixed at one end and having at the
                    other a pen which touches a revolving drum. If all the pulleys but one be fixed,
                    and if that one executes a simple harmonic motion up and down, the pen will
                    execute the same motion with half amplitude. If a second pulley be now given an
                    harmonic motion, the pen takes it up also with half amplitude. The same is true
                    if all the pulleys are in harmonic motion. Thus the pen sums them all up, and
                    leaves a trace on the revolving drum. When the drum and pulleys are so geared
                    that the angular motion of the drum is proportional to mean solar time, whilst
                    the harmonic motions of the pulleys correspond in range and phase to all the
                    important lunar and solar tides, the trace on the drum is a tide-curve, from
                    which a tide-table may be constructed. The harmonic motion of the pulley is
                    given by an arrangement indicated only in the case of the lower pulley in the
                    figure. The pulley frame has attached to its vertical portion a horizontal slot,
                    in which slides a pin fixed to a wheel. Suppose that whilst the drum turns
                    through 15" the wheel turns through 28° ’ 984. Now a lunar day is 24'842 mean
                    solar hours; hence as the drum turns through 15° × 24’842 the wheel turns
                    through 24'842 × 28° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 984 or 720°. Thus, if the
                    drum turns with an angular velocity proportional to solar time, the wheel turns
                    with twice the angular velocity proportional to lunar time, and the pulley
                    geared to the wheel executes lunar semi-diurnal harmonic oscillations. When the
                    throw of the pin and its angular position on its wheel are adjusted so as to
                    correspond with the range and phase of the observed lunar semidiurnal tide, the
                    oscillation of the pulley remains rigorously accurate for that tide for all
                    future time, if the gearing be rigorously accurate, and with all needful
                    accuracy for some ten years of tide <pb break="no"

                    upper pulleys have to be carefully counterpoised as indicated. It has not been
                    found that any appreciable disturbance is caused by the inertia of the moving
                    parts, even when the speed of working is high, lhe pre-dicter of the India
                    Office takes about four hours to run off a year’s tides, but greater speed seems
                    attainable by modification in the gearing. The Indian instrument, in the store
                    department at Lambeth, has pulleys for the following tides (see chap, iv.) :—M

                <p>In chapter iv. we have discussed the application of the numerical harmonic method
                    to a long series of hourly observations. An actual numerical example of this
                    analysis, with modifications to render it applicable to a short series, such as
                    a fortnight, is given in the <hi rend="italic">Admiralty Scientific Manual,</hi>
                    1886, where also an example of the numerical and graphical prediction of the
                    tides may be found. The formulae used are those given in chapter v.</p>

                <p>Sufficient tidal data would of course give the state of the tide at everv part of
                    the world at the same instant of time, and if we were where μ is in degrees.
                    Therefore, if we draw over the ocean a succession of lines defined by
                    equidistant integral values of the Greenwich time of high water, and if we
                    neglect the separation of the moon from the sun in longitude in twelve hours,
                    the successive lines will give the motion of the semi-diurnal tide-wave in one
                    hour.</p>
                <p>§ 41. <hi rend="italic">Cotidal Lines of the World.</hi></p>
                <p>No recent révisai of cotidal lines has been made with the aid of the great mass
                    of tidal data which is now being accumulated, and we therefore reproduce (fig.
                    6) the chart of the world prepared by Sir George Airy for his article on “Tides
                    and Waves.” The parts of the world for which data are wanting are omitted. The
                    Roman numerals upon the cotidal lines denote the hour in Greenwich time of high
                    water on the day of new or full moon. Airy remarks (§§ 575-584) that the cotidal
                    lines of the North Atlantic are accurately drawn, that those of the South
                    Atlantic are doubtful, and in the Pacific east of New Zealand are almost
                    conjectural. The embodiment of recent observations in a cotidal chart would
                    necessitate some modification of these statements.</p>
                <p>When a free wave runs into shallow water it travels with less velocity and its
                    height is increased. This is observable in the flexure and crowding of the
                    cotidal lines near continents and oceanic islands, as, for example, about the
                    Azores, the Bermudas, and the coast of South America. The velocity of the
                    tide-wave gives good information as to the depth of the sea. In the North Sea it
                    appears to travel at about 45 miles an hour, which corresponds to a depth to
                    follow the successive changes we should be able to picture mentally the motion
                    of the wave over the ocean and the successive changes" in its height. The data
                    are, however, as yet very incomplete and only a rough scheme is possible. A map
                    purporting to give the progress of the tide-wave is called a map of cotidal
                    lines. For a perfect representation three series of maps would be required, one
                    for the semi-diurnal tides, a second for the diurnal tides, and. a third for the
                    tides of long period. Each class of map would then show the progress of the wave
                    for each configuration of the tidegenerators. But as yet the only cotidal maps
                    made are those for the mean semi-diurnal tide, and only for the configuration of
                    new and full moon. The knowledge of the tides is not very accurate throughout
                    the world, and therefore in the maps which we give it is assumed that the same
                    interval elapses at all places between new and full moon and spring tide.</p>
                <p>At spring tide, as we have seen in (87) and (88), h <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    =(M+M,) cos 2 <hi rend="italic">(ψ-</hi><hi rend="italic">μ),</hi> since A - μ,
                    becomes then equal to - μ. As a rough approximation spring tide occurs when the
                    moon’s transit is at one o’clock at night or in the day. We only assume,
                    however, that it occurs simultaneously everywhere. Now let τ be the Greenwich
                    mean time of high water, and <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the E. long, in hours of
                    the place of observation, then, the local time of high water being the time of
                    the moon’s transit plus the interval, and local time being Greenwich time plus
                    E. long., we have τ=μ∕(γ-σ)-Z=- <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> ⅛μ-Z + l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi>, of 140 feet, and we know that the depth along the
                    deeper channel is greater and along the sides less than this. In the Atlantic
                    the wave passes over 90° of latitude, from the southern to the northern one
                    o’clock line, in twelve hours, that is at the rate of 520 miles an hour. If the
                    Atlantic tide could be considered as a free wave generated by the Pacific tide,
                    this velocity would correspond to a depth of 18,000 feet. Airy considers,
                    however, that the Atlantic forms too large a basin to permit the neglect of the
                    direct tidal action, and thinks that the tides of this ocean derive extremely
                    little of their character from the Pacific.</p>
                <p>“There is another consideration,” he says, “which must not be left out of sight.
                    It is that, supposing the cotidal lines to be accurately what they profess to
                    be—namely, the lines connecting all the points at which high water is
                    simultaneous—they may, nevertheless, with a compound series of tide-waves, not
                    at all represent the ridge of the tide-wave which actually runs over the ocean.
                    Thus an eye at a great distance, capable of observing the swells of the
                    tide-waves, might see one huge longitudinal ridge extending from the mouth of
                    the Amazon to the sea beyond Iceland, making high water at one time from Cape de
                    Verde to the North Cape, and at another time from Florida to Greenland, and
                    another ridge transversal to the former, travelling from the coast of Guiana to
                    the northern sea; and the cotidal lines which we have traced may depend simply
                    on the combination of these waves. It does not appear likely that we can ever
                    ascertain whether it is so or not; but it is certainly possible that the
                    original waves may have these or similar forms; <pb break="no"

                <p>He sums up the discussion of the chart by saying :—</p>
                <p>“Upon the whole, therefore, we are driven to the conclusion that we cannot at all
                    explain the cause of the form of the cotidal lines in the ocean, so far as they
                    have been traced with any probability. And, supposing us to know with tolerable
                    certainty those corresponding to the semi-diurnal tide, we cannot at all predict
                    those which should hold for the diurnal tide.”</p>
                <p>§ 42. <hi rend="italic">Cotidal Lines of the British Seas.</hi></p>
                <p>Fig. 7 shows the cotidal lines in the seas surrounding the British Islands. Here
                    the lines refer to full moon and change of moon and not to spring tide. The
                    small figures along different parts of the coast denote the extreme range of the
                    tide in yards. This figure is from the same source as the preceding one, and we
                    again reproduce a portion of Airy’s remarks.</p>
                <p>“The tides in the English Channel claim notice as having been the subject of
                    careful examination by many persons, English and</p>
                <p>French. It appears that in the upper part of the Channel the water flows up the
                    Channel nearly three hours after high water and runs down nearly three hours
                    after low water (this continuance of the current after high water, if it last
                    three hours, is called by sailors <hi rend="italic">tide-aηd-half-tide</hi>; if
                    it last one hour and a half, it is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >lide-and-quarter-ticle).</hi> On the English side of the Channel, especially
                    opposite the entrance of bays, the directions of the currents turn in twelve
                    hours in the same direction as the hands of a watch; on the French side they
                    turn in the opposite direction. This is entirely in conformity with theory. The
                    same laws are recognized as holding in the British [Bristol ?] Channel, and in
                    the German or North Sea near the Scotch and English coasts.</p>
                <p>“With regard to the Irish Channel we have only to remark that there is a very
                    great difference in the height of the tide on the different sides, the tide on
                    the east side being considerably the greater. They are also greater in the
                    northern part (north of Wicklow on one side, and of Bardsey Island on the other
                    side) than in the southern part. Between Wexford and Wicklow they are γery
                    small.</p>
                <p>“The tides of the German Sea present a very remarkable peculiarity. Along the
                    eastern coast of England, as far as the mouth of the Thames, the tide-wave,
                    coming from the Atlantic round the Orkney Islands, flows towards the south.
                    Thus, on a certain day, it is high water in the Murray [Moray] Firth at eleven
                    o’clock, at Berwick at two o’clock, at Flamborough Head at five o’clock, and so
                    on to the entrance of the Thames. But on the Belgian and Dutch coasts
                    immediately opposite, the tide-wave flows from the south towards the north.
                    Thus, on the day that we have supposed, it will be high water off the Thames at
                    eleven o’clock (the tide having travelled in twelve hours from the Murray Firth)
                    and at Calais nearly at the same time; but at Ostend it will be at twelve, off
                    The Hague at two, off the Helder at six, and so on.</p>
                <p>“We believe that a complete explanation may be found in the arrangement of the
                    great shoals of the North Sea. It must be remarked that (except within a very
                    small distance of Norway) the North Sea is considerably deeper on the English
                    side than on the German side; so much so that the tide-wave coming from the
                    north runs into a deep bay of deep water, bounded on the west side by the Scotch
                    and English coasts as far as Newcastle, and on the east side by the great Dogger
                    Bank. As far as the latitude of Hull, the English side is still the deep one;
                    and, though a species of channel through the shoal there allows an opening to
                    the east, yet immediately on the south of it is the Wells Bank, which again
                    contracts the deep channel to the English side. After this (that is, in the
                    latitude of Yarmouth) the deep channel expands equally to both sides. It seems
                    reasonable to conclude from this that the great set of north tide is on the
                    English side of the North Sea, both between the Dogger Bank and England and
                    between the Wells Bank and England (a branch stream of tide having been given
                    off to the east between these two banks), and that any passage of tidewave over
                    these banks may be neglected. Now this view is supported in a remarkable degree
                    by the tidal observations on two dangerous shoals called the Ower and Leman,
                    lying between Cromer and the Wells Bank, but nearer to the latter. It appears
                    that on these shoals the direction of the tide-current revolves in the same
                    manner as the hands of a watch, proving conclusively that the Ower and Leman are
                    on the left hand of the main stream of tide (supposing the face turned in the
                    direction in which the tide proceeds), or are on its eastern border, and
                    therefore that the central stream is still nearer to the coast of Norfolk. From
                    a point not far south of this we may suppose the tide to diverge in a fan-shaped
                    form over the uniformly deep Belgian Sea. Along the English coast the wave will
                    flow to the south; but it will reach the whole of the Belgian and Dutch coast at
                    the same instant; and, if this tide alone existed, we doubt not that the time of
                    high water would be sensibly the same along the whole of that coast.</p>
                <p>“But there is another tide of great magnitude, namely, that which comes from the
                    English Channel through the Straits of Dover. This also diverges, we conceive,
                    in a fan form, affecting the whole Belgian Sea: the western part turns into the
                    estuary of the Thames; the eastern part runs along the Dutch coast, producing at
                    successive times high water (even as combined with the North Sea tide) along
                    successive points of that coast from Calais towards the Helder. And this we
                    believe to be the complete explanation of the apparently opposite tide-currents.
                    The branch tide of the North Sea running between the Dogger Bank and the Wells
                    Bank will assist in propagating the tide along the German coast from the Helder
                    towards the mouth of the Elbe. We have gone into some detail in this explanation
                    for the purpose of showing the importance of considering the form of the bottom
                    in explanations of specific tides.</p>
                <p>“A set of observations has been made by Captain Hewett (at the point A, fig. 7)
                    on the depth and motion of the water at a strictly definite point a few miles
                    south of the Wells Bank, near the middle of the Belgian Sea. The result was that
                    the change of elevation of the surface was insensible, but that there was a
                    considerable stream of tide alternately north-east and south-west (magnetic).
                    The point in question corresponds pretty well to the intersection of the cotidal
                    lines of nine o’clock of the North Sea tide and three o’clock of the English
                    Channel tide (ordinary establishment), and these tides would therefore wholly or
                    partially destroy each other as regards elevation. As regards the compound
                    tide-stream, the greatest positive current from one tide will be combined with
                    the greatest negative current of the other, and this will produce a stream whose
                    direction agrees well with observation. At 3 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> on
                    the day of new moon, the North Sea tide would be running north (magnetic), and
                    the English Channel tide would be running east, and therefore the compound
                    current would be running north-east; at 9 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> it
                    would be running south-west. Both currents, and consequently the compound
                    current, would cease at about 0 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>, 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi>, &amp;c., on the day of new moon; and, as the
                    observations were made rather more than a day before new moon, the slack water
                    would occur an hour or more before noon. The whole of this agrees well with the
                    observations.”</p>

                <p>The tide-generating potential varies as the square of the distance from the
                    earth’s centre, and the corresponding forces act at every point throughout its
                    mass. No solid matter possesses the property of absolute rigidity, and we must
                    therefore admit the probable existence of tidal elastic deformation of the solid
                    earth. The problem of finding the state of strain of an elastic sphere under

                <p>In most solids the bulk modulus is considerably larger than the rigidity modulus,

                <p>Now suppose the sphere to be endued with the power of gravitation, and write <hi

                    ellipticity would be given by e=τ∕g, and without gravitation bye=τ∕r. And it may
                    be proved in several ways that, gravity and elasticity co-operating, e=—=-∙-A-

                <p>If <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be the rigidity of steel, and if the globe have the
                    size and mean density of the earth, r∕g=2, and with the rigidity of glass r∕g=⅞.
                    Hence the ellipticity of an earth of steel under tide-generating force would be
                    ⅜ of that of a fluid earth, and the similar fraction for glass would be ⅝. If an
                    ocean be superposed on the globe, then, if the globe rises and falls with the
                    tide as though it were fluid, there will obviously be no tide visible to an
                    observer carried up and down with the solid; and with any degree of rigidity the
                    visible tide will be the excess of the fluid tide above the solid tide. Hence on
                    an earth with rigidity of steel the oceanic tides would be reduced to ⅜, and
                    with rigidity of glass to ⅜ of the tides on a rigid earth.</p>
                <p>§ 44. <hi rend="italic">Rigidity of the Earth.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the computation of oceanic tides is as yet impossible, it cannot be
                    admitted that perfect rigidity in the earth would augment the tides in the
                    proportion of 5 to 2, although they might perhaps be augmented in the proportion
                    4 to 3. Thus Thomson concludes that the earth’s mass must have an effective
                    rigidity at least as great as that of steel. If it were true, as was held until
                    recently, that the earth is a fluid ball coated with a crust, that crust must be
                    of fabulous rigidity to resist the tidal surgings of subjacent fluid. Hence we
                    are led to the conclusion that far the larger portion of the earth’s mass, if
                    not all of it, is a solid of great rigidity. Up to the present time the argument
                    by which the tides of long period were proved to have approximately their
                    equilibrium height has generally been accepted without much doubt, but we have
                    (§ 17) shown good cause for rejecting Laplace’s argument, at least for a
                    fortnightly tide. It appeared formerly that, from numerical data as to the
                    heights of the tides of long period, we should be able to compute the actual
                    effective rigidity of the earth’s mass. But from § 18 we see that, although
                    these tides remain incalculable, yet with such oceans as ours the tides of long
                    period must conform much more nearly to the equilibrium laws than do the tides
                    of short period. Thus a comparison of the observed heights of the tides of long
                    period with the equilibrium law still remains of interest, although the
                    evaluation of the earth’s rigidity appears with present data unattainable.
                    Acting on the old belief, Mr G. H. Darwin has compared the lunar fortnightly and
                    monthly tides, as observed for thirty-three years at various Indian and European
                    ports, with the equilibrium theory, and has found that the tideheights were
                    about two-thirds of the equilibrium height.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    effective rigidity of the earth was as great as that of steel. Whilst, then,

                    the great effective rigidity of the earth. When extensive and accurate knowledge
                    of the tides has been attained, the attempted evaluation of the rigidity may
                    conceivably be possible, because there is a minute tide with a period of 18 <hi

                    height of the tide at the equator only amounts to one-third of an inch, and a
                    preliminary inquiry seems to show that there are other relatively considerable

                <p>§ 46. <hi rend="italic">General Explanation.</hi></p>
                <p>The investigation of the tides of a viscous sphere has led us to the
                    consideration of a frictionally retarded tide. The effects of tidal friction are
                    of such general interest that we give a sketch of the principal results without
                    the aid of mathematical symbols. In fig. 8 the paper is supposed to be the plane
                    of the orbit of a satellite Μ revolving in the direction of the arrow about the
                    planet C, which rotates in the direction of the arrow about an axis
                    perpendicular to the paper. The rotation of the planet is supposed to be more
                    rapid than that of the satellite, so that the day is shorter than the month. Let
                    us suppose that the planet is either entirely fluid, or has an ocean of such
                    depth that it is high water under or nearly under the satellite. When there is
                    no friction, with the satellite at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the planet is
                    elongated into the ellipsoidal shape shown, cutting the mean sphere, which is
                    dotted. But, when there is friction in the fluid motion, the tide is retarded,
                    and high tide occurs after the satellite has passed the meridian. Then, if we
                    keep the same figure to represent the tidal elongation, the satellite must be at
                    Μ, instead of at <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> If we number the four quadrants as
                    shown, the satellite must be in quadrant 1. The protuberance P is nearer to the
                    satellite than P ’, and the deficiency Q is further away than the deficiency <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n394/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0394-0375"/> Q'. Hence the resultant action of the planet on
                    the satellite must be in some such direction as MN. The action of the satellite
                    on the planet is equal and opposite, and the force in NM, not being through the
                    planet’s centre, must produce a retarding couple on the planet’s rotation, the
                    magnitude of which depends on the length of the arm CN. This tidal frictional
                    couple varies as the height of the tide, and also depends on the satellite’s
                    distance; its intensity in fact varies as the square of the tide-generating
                    force, and therefore as the inverse sixth power of the satellite’s distance.
                    Thus tidal friction must retard the planetary rotation. Let us now consider its
                    effect on the satellite. If the force acting on Μ be resolved along and
                    perpendicular to the direction CM, the perpendicular component tends to
                    accelerate the satellite’s velocity. It alone would carry the satellite further
                    from C than it would be dragged back by the central force towards C. The
                    satellite would describe a spiral, the coils of which would be very nearly
                    circular and very nearly coincident. If now we resolve the central component
                    force along CM tangentially and perpendicular to the spiral, the tangential
                    component tends to retard the velocity of the satellite, whereas the disturbing
                    force, already considered, tends to accelerate it. With the gravitational law of
                    force between the two bodies the retardation must prevail over the
                    acceleration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This way
                    of presenting the action of tidal friction is due to Professor
                    Stokes.</p></note> The moment of momentum of the whole system remains unchanged,
                    and that of the planetary rotation diminishes, so that the orbital moment of
                    momentum must increase; now orbital moment of momentum increases with increasing
                    distance and diminishing linear and angular velocity of the satellite. The
                    action of tidal friction may appear somewhat paradoxical, but it is the exact
                    converse of the acceleration of the linear and angular velocity and the
                    diminution of distance of a satellite moving through a resisting medium. The
                    latter result is generally more familiar than the action of tidal friction, and
                    it may help the reader to realize the result in the present case. Tidal friction
                    then diminishes planetary rotation, increases the satellite’s distance, and
                    diminishes the orbital angular velocity. The comparative rate of diminution of
                    the two angular velocities is generally very different. If the satellite be
                    close to the planet the rate, of increase of the satellite’s periodic time or
                    month is large compared with the rate of increase of the period of planetary
                    rotation or day; but if the satellite is far off the converse is true. Hence, if
                    the satellite starts very near the planet, with the month a little longer than
                    the day, as the satellite recedes the month soon increases, so that it contains
                    many days. The number of days in the month attains a maximum and then
                    diminishes. Finally the two angular velocities subside to a second identity, the
                    day and month being identical and both very long.</p>
                <p>We have supposed that the ocean is of such depth that the tides are direct; if,
                    however, they are inverted, with low water under or nearly under the satellite,
                    friction, instead of retarding, accelerates the tide; and it would be easy by
                    drawing another figure to see that the whole of the above conclusions hold
                    equally true with inverted tides.</p>

                    Friction.</hi></p>
                <p>The general conclusions of the last section are of such wide interest that we
                    proceed to a rigorous discussion of the principal effects of tidal friction in
                    the elementary case of the circular orbit. In order, however, to abridge the
                    investigation we shall only consider the case when the planetary rotation is
                    more rapid than the satellite’s orbital motion.</p>
                <p>Suppose an attractive particle or satellite of mass <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to
                    be moving in a circular orbit, with an angular velocity Ω, round a planet of
                    mass <hi rend="italic">Μ,</hi> and suppose the planet to be rotating about an
                    axis perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, with an angular velocity <hi
                    rend="italic">n;</hi> suppose, also, the mass of the planet to be partially or
                    wholly imperfectly elastic or viscous, or that there are oceans on the surface
                    of the planet; then the attraction of the satellite must produce a relative
                    motion in the parts of the planet, and that motion must be subject to friction,
                    or, in other words, there must be frictional tides of some sort or other. The
                    system must accordingly be losing energy by friction, and its configuration must
                    change in such a way that its whole energy diminishes. Such a system does not
                    differ much from those of actual planets and satellites, and, therefore, the
                    results deduced in this hypothetical case must agree pretty closely with the
                    actual course of evolution, provided that time enough has been and will be given
                    for such changes. Let <hi rend="italic">C</hi> be the moment of inertia of the
                    planet about its axis of rotation, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the distance of the
                    satellite from the centre of the planet, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the resultant

                    energy, both kinetic and potential, of the system. It is assumed that the figure
                    of the planet and the distribution of its internal density are such that the
                    attraction of the satellite causes no couple about any axis perpendicular to
                    that of rotation. A special system of units of mass, length, and time will now
                    be adopted such that the analytical results are reduced to their simplest forms.

                    centre of inertia, when distant 7 apart from one another. This condition gives

                <p>Since the moon’s present radius vector is 11'454, it follows that the orbital

                    If the two rotations be of opposite kinds, it is clear that we may start the

                    quartic may be derived from quite a different consideration, viz., by finding
                    the condition under which the satellite may move round the planet so that the
                    planet shall always show the same face to the satellite,—in fact, so that they
                    move as parts of one rigid body. The condition is simply that the satellite’s
                    orbital angular velocity Ω = n, the planet’s angular velocity of rotation, or
                    <hi rend="italic">y=</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∣</hi><hi rend="italic">x</hi><hi

                <p>At present we have only obtained one result, viz., that, if with given moment of
                    momentum it is possible to set the satellite and planet moving as a rigid body,
                    it is possible to do so in two ways, and one of these ways requires a maximum
                    amount of energy and the other a minimum; from this it is clear that one must be
                    a rapid rotation with the satellite near the planet and the other a slow one
                    with the satellite remote from the planet. In the three equations <hi
                    rend="italic">h=y+x</hi> (107),</p>
                <p>K=(A-x) <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>-l∕x <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> (108),
                    se <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> y=l (109),</p>
                <p>(107) is the equation of momentum, (108) that of energy, and (109) may be called
                    the equation of rigidity, since it indicates that the two bodies move as though
                    parts of one rigid body. To illustrate these equations geometrically, we may
                    take as abscissa <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> which is the moment of momentum of
                    orbital motion, so that the axis of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be called the
                    axis of orbital momentum. Also, for equations (107) and (109) we may take as
                    ordinate <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> which is the moment of momentum of the
                    planet’s rotation, so that the axis of <hi rend="italic">y</hi> may be called
                    the axis of rotational momentum. For (108) we may take as ordinate <hi
                    rend="italic">Y,</hi> which is twice the energy of the system, so that the axis
                    of <hi rend="italic">Y</hi> may be called the axis of energy. Then, as it will
                    be convenient to exhibit all three curves in the same figure, with a parallel
                    axis of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> we must have the axis of energy identical with
                    that of rotational momentum. It will not be necessary to consider the case where
                    the resultant moment of momentum <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is negative, because
                    this would only be equivalent to reversing all the rotations; <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> is therefore to be taken as essentially positive. Then the line of
                    momentum whose equation is (107) is a straight line inclined at 45’ to either
                    axis, having positive intercepts on both axes. The curve of rigidity whose
                    equation is (109) is clearly of the same nature as a rectangular hyperbola, but
                    it has a much more rapid rate of approach to the axis of orbital momentum than
                    to that of rotational momentum. The intersections (if any) of the curve of
                    rigidity with the line of momentum have abscissae which are the two roots of the
                    quartic ae <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>- <hi rend="italic">ha?</hi> +1 = 0.
                    The quartic has, therefore, two real roots or all imaginary roots. Then, since
                    <hi rend="italic">x=</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">Jr,</hi> the
                    intersection which is more remote from the origin indicates a configuration
                    where the satellite is remote from the planet; the other gives the configuration
                    where the satellite is closer to the planet. We have already learnt that these
                    two correspond respectively to minimum and maximum energy. When <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> is very large, the equation to the curve of energy is <hi
                    rend="italic">Y=(hx)</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >,</hi> which is the equation to a parabola with a vertical axis parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">Y</hi> and distant <hi rend="italic">h</hi> from the origin, so
                    that the axis of the parabola passes through the intersection of the line of
                    momentum with the axis of orbital momentum. When <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is
                    very small, the equation becomes <hi rend="italic">Y=-l/a?.</hi> Hence the axis
                    of Vis asymptotic on both sides to the curve of energy. Then, if the line of
                    momentum intersects the curve of rigidity, the curve of energy has a maximum
                    vertically underneath the point of intersection nearer the origin and a minimum
                    underneath the point more remote. But, if there are no intersections, it has no
                    maximum or minimum.</p>
                <p>Fig. 9 shows these curves when drawn to scale for the case of the earth and moon,
                    that is to say, with Ae=4. The points <hi rend="italic">α</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> which are the maximum and minimum of the curve of energy,
                    are supposed to be on the same ordinates as A and B, the intersections of the
                    curve of rigidity with the line of momentum. The intersection of the line of
                    momentum with the axis of orbital momentum is denoted bv D. but in a fierure of
                    this size it neces sarily remains indistinguishable from B. As the zero of
                    energy is quite arbitrary, the origin for the energy curve is displaced
                    downwards, and this prevents the two curves from crossing one another in a
                    confusing manner. On account of the limitation imposed we neglect the case where
                    the quartic has no real roots. Every point of the line of momentum gives by its
                    abscissa and ordinate the square root of the satellite’s distance and the
                    rotation of the planet, and the ordinate of the energy curve gives the energy
                    corresponding to each distance of the satellite. Part of the figure has no
                    physical meaning, for it is impossible for the satellite to move round the
                    planet at a distance less than the sum of the radii of the planet and satellite.
                    For example, the moon’s diameter being about 2200 miles, and the earth’s about
                    8000, the moon’s distance cannot be less than 5100 miles. Accordingly a strip is
                    marked off and shaded on each side of the vertical axis within which the figure
                    has no physical meaning. The point <hi rend="italic">P</hi> indicates the
                    present configuration of the earth and moon. The curve of rigidity a¾=l is the
                    same for all values of <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and by moving the line of
                    momentum parallel to itself nearer to or further from the origin, we may
                    represent all possible moments of momentum of the whole system. The smallest
                    amount of moment of momentum with which it is possible to set the system moving
                    as a rigid body, with centrifugal force enough to balance the mutual attraction,
                    is when the line of momentum touches the curve of rigidity. The condition for
                    this is clearly that the equation <hi rend="italic">a? - ha?</hi> + 1 = 0 should
                    have equal roots. If it has equal roots, each root must be ∣ <hi rend="italic"
                    >h,</hi> and therefore</p>
                <p>(t⅛) <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>-½(tA) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> + l = 0,
                    whence ^ <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> =4 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ∕3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi> or Λ = 4∕3^=l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75. The
                    actual value of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> for the moon and earth is about 4;
                    hence, if the moon-earth system were started with less than ⅛ of its actual
                    moment of momentum, it would not be possible for the two bodies to move so that
                    the earth should always show the same face to the moon. Again, if we travel
                    along the line of momentum, there must be some point for which <hi rend="italic"
                    >ya?</hi> is a maximum, and since <hi rend="italic">ya?=n!O,</hi> there must be
                    some point for which the number of planetary rotations is greatest during one
                    revolution of the satellite; or, shortly, there must be some configuration for
                    which there is a maximum number of days in the month. Now <hi rend="italic"
                    >ya?</hi> is equal to <hi rend="italic">a?fh-x'),</hi> and this is a maximum
                    when <hi rend="italic">x=⅜h</hi> and the maximum number of days in the month is
                    (∣A) <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> (A-fΛ) or 3 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> A
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ∕4 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi>; if <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> is equal to 4, as is nearly the case for the earth and
                    moon, this becomes 27. Hence it follows that we now have very nearly the maximum
                    number of days in the month. A more accurate investigation in a paper on the
                    “Precession of a Viscous Spheroid” in <hi rend="italic">Phil,. Trans.,</hi> part
                    i., 1879, showed that, taking account of solar tidal friction and of the
                    obliquity to the ecliptic, the maximum number of days is about 29, and that we
                    have already passed through the phase of maximum. We will now consider the
                    physical meaning of the figure. It is assumed that the resultant moment of
                    momentum of the whole system corresponds to a positive rotation. Now imagine two
                    points -with the same abscissa, one on the momentum line and the other on the
                    energy curve, and suppose the one on the energy curve to guide that on the
                    momentum line. Then, since we are supposing frictional tides to be raised on the
                    planet, the energy must degrade, and however the two points are set initially
                    the point on the energy curve must always slide down a slope, carrying with it
                    the other point. Looking at the figure, we see that there are four slopes in the
                    energy curve, two running down to the planet and two down to the minimum. There
                    are therefore four ways in which the system may degrade, according to the way it
                    was started; but we shall only consider one, that corresponding to the portion
                    ABδα of the figure. For the part of the line of momentum AB the month is longer
                    than the day, and this is the case with all known satellites except the nearer
                    one of Mars. Now, if a satellite be placed in the condition A—that is to say,
                    moving rapidly round a planet which always shows the same face to the
                    satellite—the condition is clearly dynamically unstable, for the least
                    disturbance will determine whether the system shall degrade down the slopes <hi
                    rend="italic">ac</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> that
                    is to say, whether it falls into or recedes from the planet. If the equilibrium
                    breaks down by the satellite receding, the recession will <hi rend="italic"
                    >go</hi> on until the system has reached the state corresponding to B. It is
                    clear that, if the intersection of the edge of the shaded strip with the line of
                    momentum be identical with the point A, which indicates that the satellite is
                    just touching the planet, then the two bodies are in effect parts of a single
                    body in an unstable configuration. If, therefore, the moon was originally part
                    of the earth, we should expect to find this identity. Now in fig. 9, drawn to
                    scale to represent the earth and moon, there is so close an approach between the
                    edge of the shaded band and the intersection of the line of momentum and curve
                    of rigidity that it would be scarcely possible to distinguish them. Hence, there
                    seems a probability that the two bodies once formed parts of a single one, which
                    broke up in consequence of some kina of instability. This view is confirmed by
                    the more detailed consideration of the case in the paper on the “Precession of a
                    Viscous Spheroid,” already referred to, and subsequent papers, in the <hi

                <p>With respect to the actual amount of retardation of the earth’s rotation, we
                    quote the following from Thomson and Tait’s <hi rend="italic">Nat. Phil.</hi>
                    (1883), § 830.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See also

                <p>“In observational astronomy the earth’s rotation serves as a timekeeper, and thus
                    a retardation of terrestrial rotation will appear astronomically as an
                    acceleration of the motion of the heavenly bodies. It is only in the case of the
                    moon’s motion that such an apparent acceleration can be possibly detected. Now,
                    as Laplace first pointed out, there must be a slow variation in the moon’s mean
                    motion arising from the secular changes in the eccentricity of the earth’s orbit
                    around the sun. At the present time, and for several thousand years in the
                    future, the variation in the moon’s motion is and will be an acceleration.
                    Laplace’s theoretical calculation of the amount of that acceleration appeared to
                    agree well with the results which were in his day accepted as representing the
                    facts of observation. But in 1853 Adams showed that Laplace’s reasoning was at
                    fault, and that the numerical results of Damoiseau’s and Plana’s theories with
                    reference to it consequently require to be sensibly altered. Hansen’s theory of
                    the secular acceleration is vitiated by an error of principle similar to that
                    which affects the theories of Damoiseau and Plana; but, the mathematical process
                    which he followed being different from theirs, he arrived at somewhat different
                    results. From the erroneous theory Hansen found the value of 12" <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 18 for the coefficient of the term in the moon’s mean
                    longitude depending on the square of the time, the unit of time being a century;
                    in a later computation given in his <hi rend="italic">Darlegung</hi> he found
                    the coefficient to be 12"∙56.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“It appears not unusual for physical astronomers to use an
                    abbreviated phraseology, for specifying accelerations, which needs explanation.
                    Thus, when they speak of the secular acceleration being, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> ‘12"’56 in a century,’ they mean by ‘acceleration’ what is more
                    properly ‘the effect of the acceleration on the moon’s mean longitude.’ The
                    correct unabbreviated statement is ‘the acceleration is 25" <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> T2 per century per century.’ Thus Hansen’s result is
                    that in each century the mean motion of the moon is augmented by an angular
                    velocity of 25"∙12 per century, so that at the end of a century the mean
                    longitude is greater by J of 25"∙12 than it would have been had the moon’s mean
                    motion remained the same as it was at the beginning of the century. Considering
                    how absurd it would be to speak of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> falling body as
                    experiencing an acceleration of 16 feet in a second, or of 64 feet in two
                    seconds, and how false and inconvenient it is to speak of a watch being 20
                    seconds fast when it is 20 seconds in advance of where it ought to be, we
                    venture to suggest that, to attain clearness and correctness without sacrifice
                    of brevity, ‘advance’ be substituted for ‘acceleration' in the ordinary
                    astronomical phraseology.”</p></note></p>
                <p>“In 1859 Adams communicated to Delaunay his final result, namely, that the
                    coefficient of this term appears from a correctly conducted investigation to be
                    5" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7, so that at the end of a century the moon is
                    5" ’ 7 before the position it would have had at the same time if its mean
                    angular velocity had remained the same as at the beginning of the century.
                    Delaunay verified this result, and added some further small terms which
                    increased the coefficient from 5" <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 to 6"1.</p>
                <p>“Now, according to Airy, Hansen’s value of the ‘advance’ represents very well the
                    circumstances of the eclipses of Agathocles, Larissa, and Thales, but is if
                    anything too small. Newcomb, on the other hand, is inclined from an elaborate
                    discussion of the ancient eclipses to believe Hansen’s value to be too large,
                    and gives two competing values, viz., 8"'4 and 10" ’ 9.<note anchored="true"

                    the Moon,</hi> Washington, 1878.</p></note></p>
                <p>“In any case it follows that the value of the advance as theoretically deduced
                    from all the causes, known up to the present time to be operative, is smaller
                    than that which agrees with observation. In what follows 12" is taken as the
                    observational value of the advance, and 6" as the explained part of this
                    phenomenon. About the beginning of 1866 Delaunay suggested that the true
                    explanation of the discrepancy might be a retardation of the earth’s rotation by
                    tidal friction. Using this hypothesis, and allowing for the consequent
                    retardation of the moon’s mean motion by tidal reaction, Adams, in an estimate
                    which he has communicated to us, founded on the rough assumption that the parts
                    of the earth’s retardation due to solar and lunar tides are as the squares of
                    the respective tide-generating forces, finds 22 sec. as the error by which the
                    earth, regarded as a time-keeper, would in a century get behind a perfect clock
                    rated at the beginning of the century. Thus at the end of a century a meridian
                    of the earth is 330° behind the position in which it would have been if the
                    earth had continued to rotate with the same angular velocity which it had at the
                    beginning of the century. . . .</p>
                <p>“Whatever be the value of the retardation of the earth’s rotation it is
                    necessarily the result of several causes, of which tidal friction is almost
                    certainly preponderant. If we accept Adams’s estimate as applicable to the
                    outcome of the various concurring causes, then, if the rate of retardation
                    giving the integral effect were uniform, the earth as a time-keeper would be
                    going slower by ’ 22 of a second per year in the middle, and by ’ 44 of a second
                    per year at the end, than at the beginning of the century. The latter is ¹∕₇₁.₇
                    ₓ ₁₀⁶ of the present angular velocity; and, if the rate of retardation had been
                    uniform during ten million centuries past, the earth must have been rotating
                    faster by about one-seventh than at present, and the centri fugal force must
                    have been greater in the proportion of 817 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> to 717
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> or of 67 to 51. If the consolidation took place
                    then or earlier, the ellipticity of the upper layers must have been ∙⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> y</hi> instead of about 3⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi>, as it
                    is at present. It must necessarily remain uncertain whether the earth would from
                    time to time adjust itself completely to a figure of equilibrium adapted to the
                    rotation. But it is clear that a want of complete adjustment would leave traces
                    in a preponderance of land in equatorial regions. The existence of large
                    continents and the great effective rigidity of the earth’s mass render it
                    improbable that the adjustments, if any, to the appropriate figure of
                    equilibrium would be complete. The fact then that the continents are arranged
                    along meridians rather than in an equatorial belt affords some degree of proof
                    that the consolidation of the earth took place at a time when the diurnal
                    rotation differed but little from its present value. It is probable, therefore,
                    that the date of consolidation is considerably more recent than a thousand
                    million years ago. It is proper, however, to add that Adams lays but little
                    stress on the actual numerical values which have been used in this computation,
                    and is of opinion that the amount of tidal retardation of the earth’s rotation
                    is quite uncertain.”</p>

                    Orbit and on the Earth’s Rotation.</hi></p>
                <p>It would be impossible within the limits of the present article to discuss
                    completely the effects of tidal friction; we therefore confine ourselves to
                    certain general considerations which throw light on the nature of those effects.
                    We have in the preceding sections supposed that the planet’s axis is
                    perpendicular to the orbit of the satellite, and that the latter is circular; we
                    shall now suppose the orbit to be oblique to the equator and eccentric, and
                    shall also consider some of the effects of the solar perturbation of the
                    moonearth system. For the sake of brevity the planet will be called the earth,
                    and the satellite the moon. The complete investigation was carried out on the
                    hypothesis that the planet was a viscous spheroid, because this was the only
                    theory of frictionally resisted tides which had been worked out. Although the
                    results would be practically the same for any system of frictionally resisted
                    tides, we shall speak below of the planet or earth as a viscous body.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These explanations, together
                    with other remarks, are to be found in the abstracts of Mr G. H. Darwin’s
                    memoirs in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> 1878 to 1881.</p></note></p>
                <p>We shall show that if the tidal retardation be small the obliquity of the
                    ecliptic increases, the earth’s rotation is retarded, and the moon’s distance
                    and periodic time are increased. Fig. 10 represents the earth as seen from above
                    the south pole, so that S is the pole and the outer circle the equator. The
                    earth’s rotation is in the direction of the curved arrow at S. The half of the
                    inner circle which is drawn with a full line is a semi-small-circle of south
                    latitude, and the dotted semicircle is a semi-small-circle in the same north
                    latitude. Generally dotted lines indicate parts of the figure which are below
                    the plane of the paper. It will make the explanation somewhat simpler if we
                    suppose the tides to be raised by a moon and anti-moon diametrically opposite to
                    one another. Let Μ and Μ' be the projections of the moon and anti-moon on to the
                    terrestrial sphere. If the fluid in which the tides are raised were perfectly
                    frictionless,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We here
                    suppose the tides not to be inverted. If they are inverted the conclusion is
                    precisely the same.</p></note> or if the earth were a perfect fluid or perfectly
                    elastic, the apices of the tidal spheroid would be at Μ and M'. If, however,
                    there is internal friction, due to any sort of viscosity, the tides will lag,
                    and we may suppose the tidal apices to be at T and T ’. Now suppose the tidal
                    protuberances to be replaced by two equal heavy particles at T and T', which are
                    instantaneously rigidly connected with the earth. Then the attraction of the
                    moon on T is greater than on T', and that of the antimoon on T' is greater than
                    on T. The resultant of these forces is clearly a pair of forces acting on the
                    earth in the direction TM, T ’ M'. These forces clearly cause a couple about the
                    axis in the equator, which lies in the same meridian as the moon and antimoon.
                    The direction of the couple is shown by the curved arrows at L,L'. If the
                    effects of this couple be compounded with the existing rotation of the earth
                    according to the principle of the gyroscope, the south pole S tends to approach
                    Μ and the north pole to approach M'. Hence, supposing the moon to move in the
                    ecliptic, the inclination of the earth’s axis to the ecliptic diminishes, or the
                    obliquity increases. Next the forces TM, T'M' clearly produce, as in the simpler
                    case considered above, a couple about the earth’s polar axis, which tends to
                    retard the diurnal rotation.</p>
                <p>This general explanation remains a fair representation of the state of the case
                    so long as the different harmonic constituents of the aggregate tide-wave do not
                    suffer very different amounts of retardation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n397/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0397-0378"/>; and this is the case so long as the viscosity is
                    not great. The rigorous result for a viscous planet shows that in general the
                    obliquity will increase, and it appears that, with small viscosity of the
                    planet, if the period of the satellite be longer than two periods of rotation of
                    the planet, the obliquity increases, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi>
                    Hence zero obliquity is only dynamically stable when the period of the satellite
                    is less than two periods of the planet’s rotation.</p>
                <p>Suppose the motions of the planet and of its solitary satellite to be referred to
                    the invariable plane of the system. The axis of resultant moment of momentum is
                    normal to this plane, and the component rotations are that of the planet about
                    its axis of figure and the orbital motion of the planet and satellite round
                    their com- . mon centre of inertia; the axis of this latter rotation is clearly
                    the normal to the satellite’s orbit. Hence the normal to the orbit, the axis of
                    resultant moment of momentum, and the planet’s axis of rotation must always lie
                    in one plane. From this it follows that the orbit and the planet’s equator must
                    necessarily have a common node on the invariable plane. If either of the
                    component rotations alters in amount or direction, a corresponding change must
                    take place in the other, such as will keep the resultant moment of momentum
                    constant in direction and magnitude. It has been shown that the effect of tidal
                    friction is to increase the distance of the satellite from the planet, and to
                    transfer moment of momentum from that of planetary rotation to that of orbital
                    motion. If, then, the direction of the planet’s axis of rotation does not
                    change, it follows that the normal to the lunar orbit must approach the axis of
                    resultant moment of momentum. By drawing a series of parallelograms on the same
                    diameter and keeping one side constant in direction, this may be easily seen to
                    be true. This is equivalent to saying that the inclination of the satellite’s
                    orbit will decrease. But this decrease of inclination does not always
                    necessarily take place, for the previous investigations show that another effect
                    of tidal friction may be to increase the obliquity of the planet’s equator to
                    the invariable plane, or, in other words, to increase the inclination of the
                    planet’s axis to the axis of resultant moment of momentum. Now, if a
                    parallelogram be drawn with a constant diameter, it is seen that by increasing
                    the inclination of one of the sides to the diameter (and even decreasing its
                    length) the inclination of the other side to the diameter may also be increased.
                    The most favourable case for such a change is when the side whose inclination is
                    increased is nearly as long as the diameter. From this it follows that the
                    inclination of the satellite’s orbit to the invariable plane may increase, and
                    that it is most likely to increase, when the moment of momentum of planetary
                    rotation is large compared with that of the orbital motion. The analytical
                    solution of the problem agrees with these results, for it shows that if the
                    viscosity of the planet be small the inclination of the orbit always diminishes,
                    but if the viscosity be large, and if the satellite moves with a short periodic
                    time (as estimated in rotations of the planet), the inclination of the orbit
                    will increase. These results convey some idea of the physical causes which may
                    have given rise to the present inclination of the lunar orbit to the ecliptic.
                    For the analytical investigation shows that the inclination of the lunar orbit
                    to a certain plane, which replaces the invariable plane when the solar
                    attraction is introduced, was initially small, that it then increased to a
                    maximum, and that it finally diminished and is still diminishing.</p>
                <p>But the laws above referred to would, by themselves, afford a very unsatisfactory
                    explanation of the inclination of the lunar orbit, because the sun’s attraction
                    is a matter of much importance. It has been found that, if the viscosity of the
                    planet be small, the inclination of the orbit of the solitary satellite to the
                    invariable plane will always diminish; but, when solar influence is introduced,
                    the corresponding statement is not true with regard to the inclination of the
                    lunar orbit to the proper plane, for during one part of the moon’s history the
                    inclination to the proper plane would have increased even if the viscosity of
                    the earth had been small.</p>
                <p>Consider a satellite revolving about a planet in an elliptic orbit, with a
                    periodic time which is long compared with the period of rotation of the planet;
                    and suppose that frictional tides are raised on the planet. The major axis of
                    the tidal spheroid always points in advance of the satellite, and exercises on
                    it a force which tends to accelerate its linear velocity. When the satellite is
                    in perigee the tides are higher, and this disturbing force is greater than when
                    the satellite is in apogee. The disturbing force may therefore be represented as
                    a constant force, always tending to accelerate the motion of the satellite, and
                    as a periodic force which accelerates in perigee and retards in apogee. The
                    constant force causes a secular increase of the satellite’s mean distance and a
                    retardation of its mean motion. The accelerating force in perigee causes the
                    satellite to swing out further than it would otherwise have done, so that when
                    it comes round to apogee it is more remote from the planet. The retarding force
                    in apogee acts exactly inversely, and diminishes the perigean distance. Thus,
                    the apogean distance increases and the perigean distance diminishes, or, in
                    other words, the eccentricity of the orbit increases. Now consider another case,
                    and suppose the satellite’s periodic time to be identical with that of the
                    planet’s rotation.</p>
                <p>Then, when the satellite is in perigee, it is moving faster than the planet
                    rotates, and when in apogee it is moving slower; hence at apogee the tides lag,
                    and at perigee they are accelerated. Now the lagging apogean tides give rise to
                    an accelerating force on the satellite, and increase the perigean distance,
                    whilst the accelerated perigean tides give rise to a retarding force, and
                    decrease the apogean distance. Hence in this case the eccentricity of the orbit
                    will diminish. It follows from these two results that there must be some
                    intermediate periodic time of the satellite for which the eccentricity does not
                    tend to vary.</p>
                <p>But the preceding general explanation is in reality somewhat less satisfactory
                    than it seems, because it does not make clear the existence of certain
                    antagonistic influences, to which, however, we shall not refer. The rigorous
                    result, for a viscous planet, shows that in general the eccentricity of the
                    orbit will increase; but, if the obliquity of the planet’s equator be nearly
                    90°, or if the viscosity be so great as to approach perfect rigidity, or if the
                    periodic time of the satellite (measured in rotations of'the planet) be short,
                    the eccentricity will slowly diminish. When the viscosity is small the law of
                    variation of eccentricity is very simple: if eleven periods of the satellite
                    occupy a longer time than eighteen rotations of the planet, the eccentricity
                    increases, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Hence in the case of small
                    viscosity a circular orbit is only dynamically stable if the eleven periods are
                    shorter than the eighteen rotations.</p>

                <p>We shall not attempt to discuss the mathematical methods by which the complete
                    history of a planet, attended by one or more satellites, is to be traced. The
                    laws indicated in the preceding sections show that there is such a problem, and
                    that it may be solved, and we refer to Mr Darwin’s papers for details <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1879-81). It may be interesting, however, to
                    give the various results of the investigation in the form of a sketch of the
                    possible evolution of the earth and moon, followed by remarks on the other
                    planetary systems and on the solar system as a whole.</p>
                <p>We begin with a planet not very much more than 8000 miles in diameter, and
                    probably partly solid, partly fluid, and partly gaseous. It is rotating about an
                    axis inclined at about 11° or 12° to the normal to the ecliptic, with a period
                    of from two to four hours, and is revolving about the sun with a period not much
                    shorter than our present year. The rapidity of the planet’s rotation causes so
                    great a compression of its figure that it cannot continue to exist in an
                    ellipsoidal form with stability; or else it is so nearly unstable that complete
                    instability is induced by the solar tides. The planet then separates into two
                    masses, the larger being the earth and the smaller the moon. It is not attempted
                    to define the mode of separation, or to say whether the moon was initially a
                    chain of meteorites. At any rate it must be assumed that the smaller mass became
                    more or less conglomerated and finally fused into a spheroid, perhaps in
                    consequence of impacts between its constituent meteorites, which were once part
                    of the primeval planet. Up to this point the history is largely speculative, for
                    the conditions of instability of a rotating mass of fluid have not yet been
                    fully investigated. We now have the earth and moon nearly in contact with one
                    another, and rotating nearly as though they were parts of one rigid body.<note

                    <hi rend="italic">Genesis of Moon,</hi> Melbourne, 1885; also <hi rend="italic"

                    subject of dynamical investigation. As the two masses are not rigid, the
                    attraction of each distorts the other; and, if they do not move rigorously with
                    the same periodic time, each raises a tide in the other. Also the sun raises
                    tides in both. In consequence of the frictional resistance to these tidal
                    motions, such a system is dynamically unstable. If the moon had moved orbitally
                    a little faster than the earth rotated, she must have fallen back into the
                    earth; thus the existence of the moon compels us to believe that the equilibrium
                    broke down by the moon revolving orbitally a little slower than the earth
                    rotates. In consequence of the tidal friction the periodic times both of the
                    moon (or the month) and of the earth’s rotation (or the day) increase; but the
                    month increases in length at a much greater rate than the day. At some early
                    stage in the history of the system the moon was conglomerated into a spheroidal
                    form, and acquired a rotation about an axis nearly parallel to that of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>The axial rotation of the moon is retarded by the attraction of the earth on the
                    tides raised in the moon, and this retardation takes place at a far greater rate
                    than the similar retardation of the earth’s rotation. As soon as the moon
                    rotates round her axis with twice the angular velocity with which she revolves
                    in her orbit, the position of her axis of rotation (parallel with the earth’s
                    axis) becomes dynamically unstable. The obliquity of the lunar equator to the
                    plane of the orbit increases, attains a maximum, and then diminishes. Meanwhile
                    the lunar axial rotation is being reduced towards identity with the orbital
                    motion. Finally, her equator is nearly coincident with the plane of the orbit,
                    and the attraction of the earth on a tide, which degenerates into a permanent
                    ellipticity <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0398-0379"/> of the lunar equator, causes her always to show
                    the same face to the earth.</p>
                <p>All this must have taken place early in the history of the earth, to which we now
                    return. As the month increases in length the lunar orbit becomes eccentric, and
                    the eccentricity reaches a maximum when the month occupies about a rotation and
                    a half of the earth. The maximum of eccentricity is probably not large. After
                    this the eccentricity diminishes. The plane of the lunar orbit is at first
                    practically identical with the earth’s equator, but as the moon recedes from the
                    earth the sun’s attraction begins to make itself felt. We must therefore
                    introduce the conception of two ideal planes (here called the proper planes), to
                    which the motion of the earth and moon must be referred. The lunar proper plane
                    is at first inclined at a very small angle to the earth’s proper plane, and the
                    orbit and equator coincide with their respective proper planes. As soon as the
                    earth rotates with twice the angular velocity with which the moon revolves in
                    her orbit, a new instability sets in. The month is then about twelve of our
                    present hours, and the day about six such hours in length. The inclinations of
                    the lunar orbit and of the equator to their respective proper planes increase.
                    That of the lunar orbit to its proper plane increases to a maximum of 6° or 7°,
                    and ever after diminishes, that of the equator to its proper plane increases to
                    a maximum of about 2 <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> 45', and ever after
                    diminishes. The maximum inclination of the lunar orbit to its proper plane takes
                    place when the day is a little less than nine of our present hours, and the
                    month a little less than six of our present days. The maximum inclination of the
                    equator to its proper plane takes place earlier than this. Whilst these changes
                    have been going on the proper planes have been themselves changing in their
                    positions relatively to one another and to the ecliptic. At first they were
                    nearly coincident with one another and with the earth’s equator, but they then
                    open out, and the inclination of the lunar proper plane to the ecliptic
                    continually diminishes, whilst that of the terrestrial proper plane continually
                    increases. At some stage the earth became more rigid, and oceans were formed, so
                    that oceanic tidal friction probably came to play a more important part than
                    bodily tidal friction. If this be the case, the eccentricity of the orbit, after
                    passing through a stationary phase, begins to increase again. We have now traced
                    the system to a state in which the day and month are increasing, but at unequal
                    rates, the inclination of the lunar proper plane to the ecliptic and of the
                    orbit to the proper plane are diminishing, the inclination of the terrestrial
                    proper plane to the ecliptic is increasing and of the equator to its proper
                    plane is diminishing, and the eccentricity of the orbit is increasing. No new
                    phase now supervenes and at length we have the system in its present
                    configuration. The minimum time in which the changes from first to last can have
                    taken place is 54,000,000 years.</p>
                <p>There are other collateral results which must arise from a supposed primitive
                    viscosity or plasticity of the earth’s mass. For during this course of evolution
                    the earth’s mass must have suffered a screwing motion, so that the polar regions
                    have travelled a little from west to east relatively to the equator. This
                    affords a possible explanation of the north and south trend of our great
                    continents. Also a large amount of heat has been generated by friction deep down
                    in the earth; and some very small part of the observed increase of temperature
                    in underground borings may be attributable to this cause. The preceding history
                    might vary a little in detail according to the degree of viscosity which we
                    attribute to the earth’s mass, and according as oceanic tidal friction is or is
                    not, now and in the more recent past, a more powerful cause of change than
                    bodily tidal friction. The argument reposes on the imperfect rigidity of solids
                    and on the internal friction of semi-solids and fluids; these are <hi
                    rend="italic">verae causae.</hi> Thus changes of the kind here discussed must be
                    going on, and must have gone on in the past. And for this history of the earth
                    and moon to be true throughout, it is only necessary to postulate a sufficient
                    lapse of time, and that there is not enough matter diffused through space to
                    materially resist the motions of the moon and earth in perhaps 200,000,000
                    years. It seems hardly too much to say that, granting these two postulates, and
                    the existence of a primeval planet, such as that above described, a system would
                    necessarily be developed which would bear a strong resemblance to our own. A
                    theory, reposing on <hi rend="italic">verae causae,</hi> which brings into
                    quantitative correlation the lengths of the present day and month, the obliquity
                    of the ecliptic, and the inclination and eccentricity of the lunar orbit should
                    have claims to acceptance.</p>
                <p>§ 51. <hi rend="italic">The Other Planetary Subsystems.</hi></p>
                <p>If this has been the evolution of the earth and moon, a similar process must have
                    been going on elsewhere. So far we have only considered a single satellite and
                    the sun, but the theory may of course be extended, with modifications, to
                    planets attended by several satellites. We will now, therefore, consider some of
                    the other members of the solar system. A large planet has much more energy of
                    rotation to be destroyed, and moment of momentum to be redistributed, than a
                    small one, and therefore a large planet ought to proceed in its evolution more
                    slowly than a small one.</p>
                <p>Therefore we ought to find the larger planets less advanced than the smaller
                    ones. The masses of such of the planets as have satellites are, in terms of the
                    earth’s mass, as follows:—Mars = f; Jupiter=340; Saturn = 100; Uranus = 17j
                    Neptune = 20.</p>
                <p>Mars should therefore be furthest advanced in its evolution, and it is here alone
                    in the whole system that we find a satellite moving orbitally faster than the
                    planet rotates. This will also be the ultimate fate of our moon, because, after
                    its orbital motion has been reduced to identity with that of the earth’s
                    rotation, solar tidal friction will further reduce the earth’s angular velocity;
                    the tidal reaction on the moon will then be reversed, and the moon’s orbital
                    velocity will increase and her distance from the earth diminish. But, since the
                    moon’s mass is very large, she must recede to an enormous distance from the
                    earth before this reversal takes place. Now the satellites of Mars are very
                    small, and therefore they need only recede a very short distance from the planet
                    before the reversal of tidal reaction. The periodic time of the satellite Deimos
                    is 30 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 18 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>, and, as
                    the period of rotation of Mars is 24 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 37 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi>, Deimos must be still receding from Mars, but very
                    slowly. The periodic time of the satellite Phobos is 7 <hi rend="superscript">
                    h</hi> 39 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>; therefore it must be approaching Mars.
                    It does not seem likely that it has ever been remote from the planet.<note

                    inapplicable to the case of Mars; see <hi rend="italic">nature,</hi> 29th July
                    1886.</p></note> The eccentricities of the orbits of both satellites are small:
                    that of Deimos is <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 0057 and that of Phobos Ό066.
                    If the viscosity of the planet be small, or if oceanic tidal friction be the
                    principal cause of change, both eccentricities are diminishing; but, if the
                    viscosity be large, both are increasing. As we have no means of knowing whether
                    the eccentricities are increasing or diminishing, the larger eccentricity of the
                    orbit of Phobos cannot be a fact of much importance either for or against the
                    present views. But it must be admitted that it is a slightly unfavourable
                    indication. The position of the proper plane of a satellite is determined by the
                    periodic time of the satellite, the oblateness of the planet, and the sun’s
                    distance. The inclination of the orbit of a satellite to the proper plane is not
                    determined by anything in the system. Hence it is only the inclination of the
                    orbit which can afford any argument for or against the theory. The proper planes
                    of both satellites are necessarily nearly coincident with the equator of the
                    planet; but it is in accordance with the theory that the inclinations of the
                    orbits to their respective proper planes should be small. Any change in the
                    obliquity of the equator of Mars to the plane of his orbit must be entirely due
                    to solar tides. The present obliquity is about 30°, and this points also to an
                    advanced stage of evolution, at least if the axis of the planet was primitively
                    at all nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic.</p>
                <p>We now come to the system of Jupiter. Thi⅛ enormous planet is still rotating in
                    about ten hours; its axis is nearly perpendicular to the ecliptic; and three of
                    its satellites revolve in seven days or less, whilst the fourth has a period of
                    16 <hi rend="superscript"> d</hi> 16 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi>. This system
                    is obviously far less advanced than our own. The inclinations of the proper
                    planes to Jupiter’s equator are necessarily small, but the inclinations of the
                    orbits to the proper planes appear to be very interesting from a theoretical
                    point of view. They are in the case of the first satellite 0° 0' 0", in the case
                    of the second 0° 27' 50", in that of the third 0° 12' 20", and in that of the
                    fourth 0° 14' 58". We have shown above that the orbit of a satellite is first
                    coincident with its proper plane, and that the inclination afterwards rises to a
                    maximum and finally declines. If then we may assume, as seems reasonable, that
                    the satellites are in stages of evolution corresponding to their distances from
                    the planet, these inclinations accord well with the theory. The eccentricities
                    of the orbits of the two inner satellites are insensible, those of the outer two
                    small. This does not tell strongly either for or against the theory, because the
                    history of the eccentricity depends considerably on the nature of the friction
                    to which the tides are subject. Yet it on the whole agrees with the theory that
                    the eccentricity should be greater in the more remote satellites. It appears
                    that the satellites of Jupiter always present the same face to the planet, just
                    as does our moon. This was to be expected.</p>
                <p>The case of Saturn is not altogether so favourable to the theory. The extremely
                    rapid rotation, the ring, and the short periodic time of the inner satellites
                    point to an early stage of development; whilst the longer periodic time of the
                    three outer satellites and the high obliquity of the equator indicate a later
                    stage. Perhaps both views may be more or less correct, for successive shedding
                    of satellites would impart a modern appearance to the system. It has probably
                    been previously remarked that the Saturnian system bears a strong analogy to the
                    solar system, Titan being analogous to Jupiter, Hyperion and Iapetus to Uranus
                    and Neptune, and the inner satellites to the inner planets. Thus anything which
                    aids us in forming a theory of the one system will throw light on the other. The
                    details of the Saturnian system seem to be more or less favourable to the
                    theory. The proper planes of the orbits (except that of Iapetus) are nearly in
                    the plane of the ring, and the inclinations of all the orbits thereto annear not
                    to be large. As the result of <pb break="no"

                <p>Concerning Uranus and Neptune there is not much to be said, as their systems are
                    very little known; but their masses are much larger than that of the earth, and
                    their satellites revolve with a short periodic time. The retrograde motion and
                    high inclination of the satellites of Uranus are very remarkable. The theory of
                    the inclination of the orbit has been based on an assumed smallness of
                    inclination, and it is not very easy to see to what results investigation might
                    lead if the inclination were large. It must be admitted, however, that the
                    Uranian system points to the probability of the existence of a primitive planet,
                    with retrograde rotation, or at least with a very large obliquity of
                    equator.</p>
                <p>It appears from this review that the other members of the solar system present
                    some phenomena which are strikingly favourable to the tidal theory of evolution,
                    and none which are absolutely condemnatory. We shall show in the following
                    section that there are reasons why the tidal friction arising in the planetary
                    systems cannot have had so much effect as in the case of the earth and moon.
                    That the indications which we have just noted were not more marked, but yet
                    seemed to exist, agrees well with this conclusion.</p>
                <p>§ 52. <hi rend="italic">Influence of Tidal Friction on the Evolution of the Solar
                    System.</hi></p>
                <p>According to the nebular hypothesis, the planets and the satellites are portions
                    detached from contracting nebulous masses. In the following discussion that
                    hypothesis will be accepted in its main outline, and we shall examine what
                    modifications are necessitated by the influence of tidal friction. It may be
                    shown that the reaction of the tides raised in the sun by the planets must have
                    had a very small influence in changing the dimensions of the planetary orbits
                    round the sun. From a consideration of numerical data with regard to the solar
                    system and the planetary subsystems, it appears improbable that the planetary
                    orbits have been sensibly enlarged by tidal friction since the origin of the
                    several planets. But it is possible that some very small part of the
                    eccentricities of the planetary orbits is due to this cause. From arguments
                    similar to those advanced with regard to the solar system as a whole, it appears
                    unlikely that the satellites of Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn originated very much
                    nearer the present surfaces of the planets than we now observe them. But, the
                    data being insufficient, we cannot feel sure that the alteration in the
                    dimensions of the orbits of these satellites has not been considerable. It
                    remains, however, nearly certain that they cannot have first originated almost
                    in contact with the present surfaces of the planets, in the same way as in the
                    preceding sketch (§ 50) has been shown to be probable with regard to the moon
                    and earth. Numerical data concerning the distribution of moment of momentum in
                    the several planetary sub-systems exhibit so striking a difference between the
                    terrestrial system and those of the other planets that we should from this alone
                    have grounds for believing that the modes of evolution have been considerably
                    different. The difference appears to lie in the genesis of the moon close to the
                    present surface of the planet, and we shall see below that solar tidal friction
                    may be assigned as a reason to explain how it has happened that the terrestrial
                    planet had contracted to nearly its present dimensions before the genesis of a
                    satellite, but that this was not the case with the exterior planets. The
                    efficiency of solar tidal friction is very much greater in its action on the
                    nearer planets than on the further ones. The time, however, during which solar
                    tidal friction has been operating on the external planets is probably much
                    longer than the period of its efficiency for the interior ones, and a series of
                    numbers proportional to the total amount of rotation destroyed in the several
                    planets would present a far less rapid decrease as we recede from the sun than
                    numbers simply expressive of the efficiency of tidal friction at the several
                    planets. Nevertheless it must be admitted that the effect produced by solar
                    tidal friction on Jupiter and Saturn has not been nearly so great as on the
                    interior planets. And, as already stated, it is very improbable that so large an
                    amount of momentum should have been destroyed as to materially affect the orbits
                    of the planets round the sun.</p>
                <p>We will now examine how the differences of distance from the sun would be likely
                    to affect the histories of the several planetary masses. According to the
                    nebular hypothesis, a planetary nebula contracts, and rotates quicker as it
                    contracts. The rapidity of the revolution causes it to become unstable, or
                    perhaps an equatorial belt gradually detaches itself; it is immaterial which of
                    these two really takes place. In either case the separation of that part of the
                    mass which before the change had the greatest angular momentum permits the
                    central portion to resume a planetary shape. The contraction and the increase of
                    rotation proceed continually until another portion is detached, and so on. There
                    thus recur at intervals a series of epochs of instability or of abnormal change.
                    Now tidal friction must diminish the rate of increase of rotation due to
                    contraction, and therefore if tidal friction and contraction are at work
                    together the epochs of instability must recur more rarely than if contraction
                    alone acted. If the tidal retardation is sufficiently great, the increase of
                    rotation due to contraction will be so far counteracted as never to permit an
                    epoch of instability to occur. Since the rate of retardation due to solar tidal
                    friction decreases rapidly as we recede from the sun, these considerations
                    accord with what we observe in the solar system. For Mercury and Venus have no
                    satellites, and there is a progressive increase in the number of satellites as
                    we recede from the sun. Moreover, the number of satellites is not directly
                    connected with the mass of the planet, for Venus has nearly the same mass as the
                    earth and has no satellite, and the earth has relatively by far the largest
                    satellite of the whole system. Whether this be the true cause of the observed
                    distribution of satellites amongst the planets or not, it is remarkable that the
                    same cause also affords an explanation, as we shall now show, of that difference
                    between the earth with the moon and the other planets with their satellites
                    which has caused tidal friction to be the principal agent of change with the
                    former but not with the latter. In the case of the contracting terrestrial mass
                    we may suppose that there was for a long time nearly a balance between the
                    retardation due to solar tidal friction and the acceleration due to contraction,
                    and that it was not until the planetary mass had contracted to nearly its
                    present dimensions that an-epoch of instability could occur. It may also be
                    noted that if there be two equal planetary masses which generate satellites, but
                    under very different conditions as to the degree of condensation of the masses,
                    the two satellites will be likely to differ in mass; we cannot of course tell
                    which of the two planets would generate the larger satellite. Thus, if the
                    genesis of the moon was deferred until a late epoch in the history of the
                    terrestrial mass, the mass of the moon relatively to the earth would be likely
                    to differ from the mass of other satellites relatively to their planets. If the
                    contraction of the planetary mass be almost completed before the genesis of the
                    satellite, tidal friction, due jointly to the satellite and to the sun, will
                    thereafter be the great cause of change in the system; and thus the hypothesis
                    that it is the sole cause of change will give an approximately accurate
                    explanation of the motion of the planet and satellite at any subsequent time. We
                    have already seen that the theory that tidal friction has been the ruling power
                    in the evolution of the earth and moon coordinates the present motions of the
                    two bodies and carries us back to an initial state when the moon first had a
                    separate existence as a satellite; and the initial configuration of the two
                    bodies is such that we are led to believe that the moon is a portion of the
                    primitive earth detached by rapid rotation or other causes. There seems to be
                    some reason to suppose that the earliest form in which the moon had a separate
                    existence was as a ring or chain of meteorites; but this condition precedes that
                    to which the dynamical investigation leads back.</p>
                <p>Let us now turn to the other planetary sub-systems. The satellites of the larger
                    planets revolve with short periodic times; this admits of a simple explanation,
                    for the smallness of their masses would have prevented tidal friction from being
                    a very efficient cause of change in the dimensions of their orbits, and the
                    largeness of the planet’s masses would have caused them to proceed slowly in
                    their evolution. If the planets be formed from chains of meteorites or of
                    nebulous matter, their rotation has arisen from the excess of orbital momentum
                    of the exterior over that of the interior matter. As we have no means of knowing
                    how broad the chain may have been in any case, nor how much it may have closed
                    in on the sun in course of concentration, we are unable to compute the primitive
                    angular momentum of a planet. A rigorous method of comparison of the primitive
                    rotations of the several planets is thus wanting. If, however, the planets were
                    formed under similar conditions, then we should expect to find the exterior
                    planets now rotating more rapidly than the interior ones. On making allowance
                    for the different degrees of concentration of the planets, this is the case.
                    That the inner satellite of Mars revolves with a period of less than a third of
                    the planet’s rotation is perhaps the most remarkable fact in the solar system.
                    The theory of tidal friction explains this perfectly; and this will be the
                    ultimate fate of all satellites, because the solar tidal friction retards the
                    planetary rotation without directly affecting the satellite’s orbital motion.
                    Numerical comparison shows that the efficiency of solar tidal friction in
                    retarding the terrestrial and martian rotations is of about the same degree of
                    importance, notwithstanding the much greater distance of the planet Mars. In the
                    above discussion it will have been apparent that the earth and moon do actually
                    differ from the other planets to such an extent as to permit tidal friction to
                    have been the most important factor in their history.</p>
                <p>By an examination of the probable effects of solar tidal friction on a
                    contracting planetary mass, we have been led to assign a cause for the observed
                    distribution of satellites in the solar system, and this again has itself
                    afforded an explanation of how it happened that the moon so originated that the
                    tidal friction of the lunar tides in the earth should have been able to exercise
                    so large an <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0400-0381"/> influence. We have endeavoured not only to set
                    forth the influence which tidal friction may have, and probably has, had in the
                    history of the system, if sufficient time be granted, but also to point out what
                    effects it cannot have produced. These investigations afford no grounds for the
                    rejection of the nebular hypothesis; but, while they present evidence in favour
                    of the main outlines of that theory, they introduce modifications of
                    considerable importance. Tidal friction is a cause of change of which Laplace’s
                    theory took no account; and, although the activity of that cause may be regarded
                    as mainly belonging to a later period than the events described in the nebular
                    hypothesis, yet it seems that its influence has been of great, and in one
                    instance of even paramount importance in determining the present condition of
                    the planets and their satellites. Throughout the whole of this discussion it has
                    been supposed that sufficient time is at our disposal; Sir W. Thomson and others
                    have, however, adduced reasoning which goes to show that the history of the
                    solar system must be comprised within a period considerably less than a hundred
                    million years.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thomson

                    this as the final and definite conclusion of science. If, however, it be
                    confirmed, we shall only be permitted to accept the doctrine that tidal friction
                    has effected considerable modification in the configuration of the moon and
                    earth, and must reject the earlier portion of the history sketched above. (G. H.
