                <p><label type="entry">TRIGONOMETRY</label> is primarily the science which is
                    concerned with the measurement of plane and spherical triangles, that is, with
                    the determination of three of the parts of such triangles when the numerical
                    values of the other three parts are given. Since any plane triangle can be
                    divided into right-angled triangles, the solution of all plane triangles can be
                    reduced to that of right-angled triangles; moreover, according to the theory of
                    similar triangles, the ratios between pairs of sides of a right-angled triangle
                    depend only upon the magnitude of the acute angles of the triangle, and may
                    therefore be regarded as functions of either of these angles. The primary object
                    of trigonometry, therefore, requires a classification and numerical tabulation
                    of these functions of an angular magnitude; the science is, however, now
                    understood to include the complete investigation not only of such of the
                    properties of these functions as are necessary for the theoretical and practical
                    solution of triangles but also of all their analytical properties. It appears
                    that the solution of spherical triangles is effected by means of the same
                    functions as are required in the case of plane triangles. The trigonometrical
                    functions are employed in many branches of mathematical and physical science not
                    directly concerned with the measurement of angles, and hence arises the
                    importance of analytical trigonometry. The solution of triangles of which the
                    sides are geodesic lines on a spheroidal surface requires the introduction of
                    other functions than those required for the solution of triangles on a plane or
                    spherical surface, and therefore gives rise to a new branch of science, which is
                    from analogy frequently called spheroidal trigonometry. Every new class of
                    surfaces which may be considered would have in this extended sense a
                    trigonometry of its own, which would consist in an investigation of the nature
                    and properties of the functions necessary for the measurement of the sides and
                    angles of triangles bounded by geodesics drawn on such surfaces.</p>

                <p>The Indians, who were much more apt calculators than the Greeks, availed
                    themselves of the Greek geometry which came from Alexandria, and made it the
                    basis of trigonometrical calculations. The principal improvement which they
                    introduced consists in the formation of tables of half-chords or sines instead
                    of chords. Like the Greeks, they divided the circumference of the circle into
                    360 degrees or 21,600 minutes, and they found the length in minutes of the arc
                    which can be straightened out into the radius to be 3438'. The value of the
                    ratio of the circumference of the circle to the diameter used to make this
                    determination is 62832 :20000, or π = 3∙1416, which value was given by the
                    astronomer Âryabhata (476-550; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanskrit,</hi> vol. xxi.
                    p. 294) in a work called <hi rend="italic">Ârya-bhatîya,</hi> written in verse,
                    which was republished<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    relations between the sines and cosines of the same and of complementary arcs
                    were known, and the formula sin ½ <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = √1719(3438 - cos a)
                    was applied to the determination of the sine of a half angle when the sine and
                    cosine of the whole angle were known. In the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sûrya-Siddhânta,</hi> an astronomical treatise which has been translated by
                    Ebenezer Bourgess in vol. vi. of the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> of the
                    American Oriental Society (New Haven, 1860), the sines of angles at an interval
                    of 3° 45' up to 90° are given; these were probably obtained from the sines of
                    60° and 45° by continual application of the dimidi-ary formula given above and
                    by the use of the complementary angle. The values sin 15° = 890', sin 7° 30' =
                    449', sin 3° 45' = 225', were thus obtained. Now the angle 3° 45' is itself
                    225'; thus the arc and the sine of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 96</hi> th of the circumference were found to be the same,
                    and consequently special importance was attached to this arc, which was called
                    the right sine. From the tables of sines of angles at intervals of 3° 45' the
                    law expressed by the equation sin <hi rend="italic">(n</hi> +1.225') - sin (<hi

                <p>was discovered empirically, and used for the purpose of recalculation. Bhâskara
                        (<hi rend="italic">fl</hi>. 1150) used the method, to which we have now
                    returned, of expressing sines and cosines as fractions of the radius; he
                    obtained the more correct values sin 3° 45'= 100/1529, cos 3° 45' = 466/467, and
                    showed how to form a table, according to degrees, from the values sin 1° =
                    10/573, cos 1° = 6568/6569, which are much more accurate than Ptolemy’s values.
                    The Indians did not apply their trigonometrical knowledge to the solution of
                    triangles; for astronomical purposes they solved right-angled plane and
                    spherical triangles by geometry.</p>
                <p>The Arabs were acquainted with Ptolemy’s <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> and
                    they probably learned from the Indians the use of the sine. The celebrated
                    astronomer of Batnae, Abú 'Abdallah Mohammed b. Jābir al-Battání (Bategnius),
                    who died in 929/930 A.D., and whose <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> were
                    translated in the 12th century by Plato of Tivoli into Latin, under the title
                        <hi rend="italic">De scientia stellarum,</hi> employed the sine regularly,
                    and was fully conscious of the advantage of the sine over the chord; indeed, he
                    remarks that the continual doubling is saved <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n581/mode/1up"

                    calculate sin <hi rend="italic">ϕ</hi> from the equation sin <hi rend="italic"
                        >ϕ</hi> ∕cos <hi rend="italic">ϕ</hi> = <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and he
                    also made a table of the lengths of shadows of a vertical object of height 12
                    for altitudes 1°, 2°, . .. of the sun; this is a sort of cotangent table. He was
                    acquainted, not only with the triangle formulae in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Almagest,</hi> but also with the formula cos <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = cos
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">c</hi> + sin <hi

                        >A</hi> for a spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">ABC.</hi> Abú 'l-Wafá of
                    Baghdad (b. 940) was the first to introduce the tangent as an independent
                    function: his “umbra” is the half of the tangent of the double arc, and the
                    secant he defines as the “diameter umbrae.” He employed the umbra to find the
                    angle from a table and not merely as an abbreviation for sin/cos; this
                    improvement was, however, afterwards forgotten, and the tangent was re-invented
                    in the 15th century. Ibn Yúnos of Cairo, who died in 1008, showed even more
                    skill than Al-Battání in the solution of problems in spherical trigonometry and
                    gave improved approximate formulae for the calculation of sines. Among the West
                    Arabs, Abú Mohammed Jābir b. Aflah, known as Geber b. Aflah, who lived at
                    Seville in the 11th century, wrote an astronomy in nine books, which was
                    translated into Latin in the 12th century by Gerard of Cremona and was published
                    in 1534. The first book contains a trigonometry which is a considerable
                    improvement on that in the <hi rend="italic">Almagest.</hi> He gave proofs of
                    the formulae for right-angled spherical triangles, depending on a rule of four
                    quantities, instead of Ptolemy’s rule of six quantities. The formulae cos <hi

                    had escaped the notice of Ptolemy and were given for the first time by Geber.
                    Strangely enough, he made no progress in plane trigonometry. Arrachel, a Spanish
                    Arab who lived in the 12th century, wrote a work of which we have an analysis by
                    Purbach, in which, like the Indians, he made the sine and the arc for the value
                    3° 45' coincide.</p>
                <p>Purbach (1423-1461), professor of mathematics at Vienna, wrote a work entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Tractatus super propositiones Ptole-maei de sinubus et
                        chordis</hi> (Nuremberg, 1541). This treatise consists of a development of
                    Arrachel’s method of interpolation for the calculation of tables of sines, and
                    was published by Regiomontanus at the end of one of his works. Johannes Müller
                    (1436-1476), known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Regiomontanus</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                        >q.v.</hi>), was a pupil of Purbach and taught astronomy at Padua; he wrote
                    an exposition of the <hi rend="italic">Almagest</hi> and a more important work,
                        <hi rend="italic">De triangulis planis et sphericis cum tabulis sinuum,</hi>
                    which was published in 1533, a later edition appearing in 1561. He re-invented
                    the tangent and calculated a table of tangents for each degree, but did not make
                    any practical applications of this table, and did not use formulae involving the
                    tangent. His work was the first complete European treatise on trigonometry, and
                    contains a number of interesting problems; but his methods were in some respects
                    behind those of the Arabs. Copernicus (1473-1543) gave the first simple
                    demonstration of the fundamental formula of spherical trigonometry; the <hi
                        rend="italic">Trigonometria Copernici</hi> was published by Rheticus in
                    1542. George Joachim (1514-1576), known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Rheticus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> wrote <hi rend="italic">Opus Palatinum de
                        triangulis</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tables,</hi> p. 9 above), which
                    contains tables of sines, tangents, and secants of arcs at intervals of 10" from
                    0° to 90°. His method of calculation depends upon the formulae which give sin
                        <hi rend="italic">nα</hi> and cos <hi rend="italic">nα</hi> in terms of the
                    sines and cosines of (<hi rend="italic">n</hi>- 1 )α and (<hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi>- 2)α; thus these formulae may be regarded as due to him. Rheticus
                    found the formulae for the sines of the half and third of an angle in terms of
                    the sine of the whole angle. In 1599 there appeared an important work by
                    Pitiscus (1561-1613), entitled <hi rend="italic">Trigonometries seu de
                        dimensione triangulorum</hi>; this contained several important theorems on
                    the trigonometrical functions of two angles, some of which had been given before
                    by Finck, Landsberg, and Adriaan van Roomen. François Viète or <hi

                    of multiples of a given arc in terms of the chord of the simple arc.</p>
                <p>A new stage in the development of the science was commenced after Napier’s
                    invention of logarithms in 1614. Napier also simplified the solution of
                    spherical triangles by his well-known analogies and by his rules for the
                    solution of right-angled triangles. The first tables of logarithmic sines and
                    tangents were constructed by Edmund Gunter (1581-1626), professor of astronomy
                    at Gresham College, London; he was also the first to employ the expressions
                    cosine, cotangent, and cosecant for the sine, tangent, and secant of the
                    complement of an arc. A treatise by Albert Girard (1590-1634), published at The
                    Hague in 1626, contains the theorems which give areas of spherical triangles and
                    polygons, and applications of the properties of the supplementary triangles to
                    the reduction of the number of different cases in the solution of spherical
                    triangles. He used the notation sin, tan, sec for the sine, tangent, and secant
                    of an arc. In the second half of the 17th century the theory of infinite series
                    was developed by Wallis, Gregory, Mercator, and afterwards by Newton and
                    Leibnitz. In the <hi rend="italic">Analysis per aequationes numero terminorum
                        infinitas,</hi> which was written before 1669, Newton gave the series for
                    the arc in powers of its sine; from this he obtained the series for the sine and
                    cosine in powers of the arc; but these series were given in such a form that the
                    law of the formation of the coefficients was hidden. James Gregory discovered in
                    1670 the series for the arc in powers of the tangent and for the tangent and
                    secant in powers of the arc. The first of these series was also discovered
                    independently by Leibnitz in 1673, and published without proof in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Acta eruditorum</hi> for 1682. The series for the sine in
                    powers of the arc he published in 1693; this he obtained by differentiation of a
                    series with undetermined coefficients.</p>
                <p>In the 18th century the science began to take a more analytical form; evidence of
                    this is given in the works of Kresa in 1720 and Mayer in 1727. Oppel’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Analysis triangulorum</hi> (1746) was the first complete work
                    on analytical trigonometry. None of these mathematicians used the notation sin,
                    cos, tan, which is the more surprising in the case of Oppel, since Euler had in
                    1744 employed it in a memoir in the <hi rend="italic">Acta eruditorum.</hi> John
                    Bernoulli was the first to obtain real results by the use of the symbol</p>
                <p>√-1; he published in 1712 the general formula for tan <hi rend="italic">nφ</hi>
                    in terms of tanφ, which he obtained by means of transformation of the arc into
                    imaginary logarithms. The greatest advance was, however, made by Euler, who
                    brought the science in all essential respects into the state in which it is at
                    present. He introduced the present notation into general use, whereas until his
                    time the trigonometrical functions had been, except by Girard, indicated by
                    special letters, and had been regarded as certain straight lines the absolute
                    lengths of which depended on the radius of the circle in which they were drawn.
                    Euler’s great improvement consisted in his regarding the sine, cosine, &amp;c.,
                    as functions of the angle only, thereby giving to equations connecting these
                    functions a purely analytical interpretation, instead of a geometrical one as
                    heretofore. The <pb break="no"

                    Moivre’s theorem, and a great number of other analytical properties of the
                    trigonometrical functions are due to Euler, most of whose writings are to be
                    found in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of the St Petersburg Academy.</p>
                <p>The preceding sketch has been mainly drawn from the following sources: — Cantor,
                        <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Math.;</hi> Hankel, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d.

                <p>Imagine a straight line terminated at a fixed point <hi rend="italic">O,</hi> and
                    initially coincident with a fixed straight line <hi rend="italic">OA,</hi> to
                    revolve round <hi rend="italic">O,</hi> and finally to take up any position <hi
                        rend="italic">OB.</hi> We shall suppose that, when this revolving straight
                    line is turning in one direction, say that opposite to that in which the hands
                    of a clock turn, it is describing a positive angle, and when it is turning in
                    the other direction it is describing a negative angle. Before finally taking up
                    the position <hi rend="italic">OB</hi> the straight line may have passed any
                    number of times through the position <hi rend="italic">OB,</hi> making any
                    number of complete revolutions round <hi rend="italic">O</hi> in either
                    direction. Each time that the straight line makes a complete revolution round
                        <hi rend="italic">O</hi> we consider it to have described four right angles,
                    taken with the positive or negative sign according to the direction in which it
                    has revolved; thus, when it stops in the position <hi rend="italic">OB,</hi> it
                    may have revolved through any one of an infinite number of positive or negative
                    angles any two of which differ from one another by a positive or negative
                    multiple of four right angles, and all of which have the same bounding lines <hi
                        rend="italic">OA</hi> and <hi rend="italic">OB.</hi> If <hi rend="italic"
                        >OB'</hi> is the final position of the revolving line, the smallest positive
                    angle which can have been described is that described by the revolving line
                    making more than one-half and less than the whole of a complete revolution, so
                    that in this case we have a positive angle greater than two and less than four
                    right angles. We have thus shown how we may conceive an angle not restricted to
                    less than two right angles, but of any positive or negative magnitude, to be
                    generated.</p>
                <p>Two systems of numerical measurement of angular magnitudes are in ordinary use.
                    For practical measurements the sexagesimal system is the one employed: the
                    ninetieth part of a right angle is taken as the unit and is called a degree; the
                    degree is divided into sixty equal parts called minutes; and the minute into
                    sixty equal parts called seconds; angles smaller than a second are usually
                    measured as decimals of a second, the “thirds,” “fourths,” &amp;c., not being in
                    ordinary use. In the common notation an angle, for example, of 120 degrees, 17
                    minutes, and 14∙36 seconds is written 120° 17' 14"∙36. The decimal system
                    measurement of angles has never come into ordinary use. In analytical
                    trigonometry the circular measure of an angle is employed. In this system the
                    unit angle is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in
                    length to the radius. The constancy of this angle follows from the geometrical
                    propositions—(1) the circumferences of different circles vary as their radii;
                    (2) in the same circle angles at the centre are proportional to the arcs which
                    subtend them. It thus follows that the unit mentioned above is an angle
                    independent of the particular circle used in defining it. The constant ratio of
                    the circumference of a circle to its diameter is a quantity incommensurable with
                    unity, usually denoted by π. We shall indicate later on (p. 571 <hi
                        rend="italic">sq.</hi>) some of the methods which have been employed to
                    approximate to the value of this quantity. Its value to 20 places is 3
                    ∙14159265358979323846; its reciprocal to the same number of places is
                    ∙31830988618379067153. In circular measure every angle is measured by the ratio
                    which it bears to the unit angle. Two light angles are measured by the quantity
                        <hi rend="italic">π,</hi> and, since the same angle is 180°, we see that the
                    number of degrees in an angle of circular measure <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is
                    obtained from the formula 180 × <hi rend="italic">θ∕π.</hi> The value of the
                    unit of circular measure has been found to 41 places of decimals by Glaisher
                        (<hi rend="italic">Proc. London Math. Sοc.,</hi> vol. iv.); the value of <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> from which the
                    unit can be easily calculated, is given to 140 places of decimals in <hi
                        rend="italic">Grunert's Archiv,</hi> vol. i., 1841. To 10 decimal places the
                    value of the unit angle is 57° 17'44"∙8062470964. The unit of circular measure
                    is too large to be convenient for practical purposes, but its use introduces a
                    simplification into the series in analytical trigonometry, owing to the fact
                    that the sine of an angle and the angle itself in this measure, when the
                    magnitude of the angle is indefinitely diminished, are ultimately in a ratio of
                    equality.</p>
                <p>If a point moves from a position <hi rend="italic">A</hi> to another position <hi
                        rend="italic">B</hi> on a straight line, it has described a length <hi
                        rend="italic">AB</hi> of the straight line. It is convenient to have a
                    simple mode of indicating in which direction on the straight line the length <hi
                        rend="italic">AB</hi> has been described; this may be done by supposing that
                    a point moving in one specified direction is describing a positive length, and
                    when moving in the opposite direction a negative length. Thus, if a point moving
                    from <hi rend="italic">A</hi> to <hi rend="italic">B ∣</hi> is moving in the
                    positive direction, we consider the length <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> as:
                    positive; and, since a point moving from <hi rend="italic">B</hi> to <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi> is moving in the negative direction, we consider the
                    length <hi rend="italic">BA</hi> as negative. Hence any portion of an infinite
                    straight line is considered to be positive or negative according to the
                    direction in which we suppose this portion to be described by a moving point;
                    which direction is the positive one is, of course, a matter of convention.</p>
                <p>If perpendiculars <hi rend="italic">AL, BM</hi> be drawn from two points <hi
                        rend="italic">A, B</hi> on any straight line, not necessarily in the same
                    plane with <hi rend="italic">AB,</hi> the length <hi rend="italic">LM,</hi>
                    taken with the positive or negative sign according to the convention as stated
                    above, is called the projection of <hi rend="italic">AB</hi> on the given
                    straight line; the projection of <hi rend="italic">BA</hi> being <hi
                        rend="italic">ML</hi> has the opposite sign to the projection of <hi
                        rend="italic">AB.</hi> If two points <hi rend="italic">A, B</hi> be joined
                    by a number of lines in any manner, the algebraical sum of the projections of
                    all these lines is <hi rend="italic">LM,—</hi> that is, the same as the
                    projection of <hi rend="italic">AB.</hi> Hence the sum of the projections of all
                    the sides of any closed polygon, not necessarily plane, on any straight line, is
                    zero. This principle of projections we shall apply below to obtain some of the
                    most important propositions in trigonometry.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to the conception of the generation of an angle as in fig. 1.
                    Draw <hi rend="italic">BOB'</hi> at right angles to and equal to <hi
                        rend="italic">AA'.</hi></p>
                <p>We shall suppose that the direction from <hi rend="italic">A'</hi> to <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi> is the’ positive one for the straight line <hi
                        rend="italic">AO A',</hi> and that from <hi rend="italic">B'</hi> to <hi
                        rend="italic">B</hi> for <hi rend="italic">BOB'.</hi> Suppose <hi
                        rend="italic">OP</hi> of fixed length, equal to <hi rend="italic">OA,</hi>
                    and let <hi rend="italic">PM, PN</hi> be drawn perpendicular to <hi
                        rend="italic">A'A, B'B</hi> respectively; then <hi rend="italic">OM</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">ON,</hi> taken with their proper signs, are the
                    projections of <hi rend="italic">OP</hi> on <hi rend="italic">A'A</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">B'B.</hi> The ratio of the projection of <hi rend="italic"
                        >OP</hi> on <hi rend="italic">B'B</hi> to the absolute length of <hi
                        rend="italic">OP</hi> is dependent only on the magnitude of the angle <hi
                        rend="italic">POA,</hi> and is called the sine of that angle; the ratio of
                    the projection of <hi rend="italic">OP</hi> on <hi rend="italic">A'A</hi> to the
                    length <hi rend="italic">OP</hi> is called the cosine of the angle <hi
                        rend="italic">POA.</hi> The ratio of the sine of an angle to its cosine is
                    called the tangent of the angle, and that of the cosine to the sine the
                    cotangent of the angle; the reciprocal of the cosine is called the secant, and
                    that of the sine the cosecant of the angle. These functions of an angle of
                    magnitude <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are denoted by sin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    cos <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> tan <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> cot <hi
                        rend="italic">a,</hi> sec <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, cosec <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> respectively. If any straight line <hi rend="italic">RS</hi> be
                    drawn parallel to <hi rend="italic">OP,</hi> the projection of <hi rend="italic"
                        >RS</hi> on either of the straight lines <hi rend="italic">A'A, B'B</hi> can
                    be easily seen to bear to <hi rend="italic">RS</hi> the same ratios which the
                    corresponding projections of <hi rend="italic">OP</hi> bear to <hi rend="italic"
                        >OP</hi>: thus, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the angle which <hi
                        rend="italic">RS</hi> makes with <hi rend="italic">A'A,</hi> the projections
                    of <hi rend="italic">RS</hi> on <hi rend="italic">A'A, B'B</hi> are <hi
                        rend="italic">RS</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >RS</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">a</hi> respectively, where <hi rend="italic"
                        >RS</hi> denotes the absolute length <hi rend="italic">RS.</hi> It must be
                    observed that the line <hi rend="italic">SR</hi> is to be considered as parallel
                    not to <hi rend="italic">OP</hi> but to <hi rend="italic">OP",</hi> and
                    therefore makes an angle π <hi rend="italic">+ a</hi> with <hi rend="italic"
                        >A'A;</hi> this is consistent with the fact that the projections of <hi
                        rend="italic">SR</hi> are of opposite sign to those of <hi rend="italic"
                        >RS.</hi> By observing the signs of the projections of <hi rend="italic"
                        >OP</hi> for the positions <hi rend="italic">P, P', P", P"'</hi> of <hi
                        rend="italic">P</hi> we see that the sine and cosine of the angle <hi
                        rend="italic">POA</hi> are both positive; the sine of the angle <hi
                        rend="italic">P'OA</hi> is positive and its cosine is negative; both the
                    sine and the cosine of the angle <hi rend="italic">P''OA</hi> are negative; and
                    the sine of the angle <hi rend="italic">P"OA</hi> is negative and its cosine
                    positive. If α be the numerical value of the smallest angle of which <hi
                        rend="italic">OP</hi> and <hi rend="italic">OA</hi> are boundaries, we see
                    that, since these straight lines also bound all the angles <hi rend="italic">2nπ
                        + a,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is any positive or negative
                    integer, the sines and cosines of all these angles are the same as the sine and
                    cosine of <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Hence the sine of any angle 2nπ + <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> is positive if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is between 0
                    and π and negative if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is between π and 2π, and the
                    cosine of the same angle is positive if α is between 0 and ½π or <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >π</hi> and 2π and negative if α is between ½π and <hi rend="superscript">
                        3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> π.</p>
                <p>In fig. 2 if the angle <hi rend="italic">POA</hi> is α, the angle <hi
                        rend="italic">P"''\OA</hi> is - α, <hi rend="italic">P'OA</hi> is π - <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">P''OA</hi> is π + <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi>, <hi rend="italic">POB</hi> is <hi rend="superscript"> π</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi>- <hi rend="italic">a</hi>. By observing the signs
                    of the projections we see that sin ( - <hi rend="italic">a</hi>)= - sin a, sin
                    (π- <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) = sin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> sin(π + <hi

                        rend="italic">a</hi>) = sin a.</p>
                <p>Also sin(½π + <hi rend="italic">a</hi>) = sin(π - ½π - <hi rend="italic">a)=</hi>
                    sin(½π- <hi rend="italic">a</hi>)= cos <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, cos(½π + <hi

                <p>From these equations we have tan(<hi rend="italic">-a)= -</hi> tan <hi
                        rend="italic">α</hi>, tan(π - α)= — tan <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> tan (π +

                <p>The only angles for which the projection of OP on B'B is the same as for the
                    given angle POA ( = α) are the two sets of angles bounded by OP, OA and OP', OA;
                    these angles are 2nπ + α and 2 <hi rend="italic">n</hi> π + π - <hi

                <p>From any general relation between the sides and angles of a triangle other
                    relations may be deduced by various methods of transformation, of which we give
                    two examples.</p>
                <p>(a) In any general relation between the sines and cosines of the angles <hi
                        rend="italic">A, B,</hi> O' of a triangle we may substitute <hi
                        rend="italic">pA+qB + rC, rA +pB + qC, qA +rB+pC</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                        >A, B, C</hi> respectively, where <hi rend="italic">p, q, r</hi> are any
                    quantities such that <hi rend="italic">p + q + r+1</hi> is a positive or
                    negative multiple of 6, provided that we change the signs of all the sines.
                    Suppose p + g <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> + r + l = <hi rend="italic"
                        >6n,</hi> then the sum of the three angles 2α7r - <hi rend="italic">(pA +qB
                        + rC), 2nπ - (rA +pB + qCl), 2nπ - (qA + rB +pC)</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                        >π</hi>; and, since the given relation follows from the condition <hi
                        rend="italic">A + B</hi> + C <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> = 7r, we may
                    substitute for <hi rend="italic">A, B, C</hi> respectively any angles of which
                    the sum is 7r; thus the transformation is admissible.</p>
                <p>(∕3) It may easily be shown that the sides and angles of the triangle formed by
                    joining the feet of the perpendiculars from the angular points <hi rend="italic"
                        >A, B, C</hi> on the opposite sides of the triangle <hi rend="italic"
                        >ABC</hi> are respectively <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">A,
                        b</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">B, c</hi> cos C, <hi rend="italic">π - 2A, π -
                        2B, π-2C∙,</hi> we may therefore substitute these expressions for <hi
                        rend="italic">a, b, c, A, B, G</hi> respectively in any general formula. By
                    drawing the perpendiculars of this second triangle and joining their feet as
                    before, we obtain a triangle of which the sides are <hi rend="italic">-a cos
                        A</hi> cos 2 J, - δ cos 2? cos 22?, - c cos <hi rend="italic">Ceos 2C</hi>
                    and the angles are <hi rend="italic">4A - π, 4B - π, ½C - π;</hi> we may
                    therefore substitute these expressions for the sides and angles of the original
                    triangle; for example, we obtain thus the formula</p>

                    are required for the purpose of the investigation of formulae given below.</p>
                <p>A spherical triangle is the portion of the surface of a sphere bounded by three
                    arcs of great circles of the sphere. If <hi rend="italic">BC, CA, AB</hi> denote
                    these arcs, the circular measure of the angles subtended by these arcs
                    respectively at the centre of the sphere are the sides <hi rend="italic">a, b,
                        c</hi> of the spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">ABC</hi>; and, if the
                    portions of planes passing through these arcs and the centre of the sphere be
                    drawn, the angles between the portions of planes intersecting at <hi
                        rend="italic">A, B, C</hi> respectively are the angles <hi rend="italic">A,
                        B, C of</hi> the spherical triangle. It is not necessary to consider
                    triangles in which a side is greater than 7r, since we may replace such a side
                    by the remaining arc of the great circle to which it belongs. Since two great
                    circles intersect each other in two points, there are eight triangles of which
                    the sides are arcs of the same three great circles. If we consider one of these
                    triangles <hi rend="italic">ABC</hi> as the fundamental one, then one of the
                    others is equal in all respects to <hi rend="italic">ABC,</hi> and the remaining
                    six have each one side equal to, or common with, a side of the triangle <hi
                        rend="italic">ABC,</hi> the opposite angle equal to the corresponding angle
                    of <hi rend="italic">ABC,</hi> and the other sides and angles supplementary to
                    the corresponding sides and angles of <hi rend="italic">ABC.</hi> These
                    triangles may be called the associated triangles of the fundamental one <hi
                        rend="italic">ABC.</hi> It follows that from any general formula containing
                    the sides and angles of a spherical triangle we may obtain other formulae by
                    replacing two sides and the two angles opposite to them by their supplements,
                    the remaining side and the remaining angle being unaltered, for such formulae
                    are obtained by applying the given formulae to the associated triangles.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">A</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,B</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                        >,C'</hi> are those poles of the arcs <hi rend="italic">BC, CA, AB</hi>
                    respectively which lie upon the same sides of them as the opposite angles <hi
                        rend="italic">A, B,C,</hi> then the triangle <hi rend="italic">A'HC'</hi> is
                    called the polar triangle of the triangle <hi rend="italic">ABC.</hi> The sides
                    of the polar triangle are <hi rend="italic">πA, π - B, π - C,</hi> and the
                    angles <hi rend="italic">τr - a, ττ -b, π — c.</hi> Hence from any general
                    formula connecting the sides and angles of a spherical triangle we may obtain
                    another formula by changing each side into the supplement of the opposite angle
                    and each angle into the supplement of the opposite side.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">0</hi> be the centre of the sphere on which is the
                    spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">ABC.</hi> Draw <hi rend="italic">AL</hi>
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">OC</hi> and <hi rend="italic">AM</hi>
                    perpendicular to the plane <hi rend="italic">0BC.</hi> Then the projection of
                        <hi rend="italic">OA</hi> on <hi rend="italic">OB</hi> is the sum of the
                    projections of <hi rend="italic">OL, LM, MA</hi> on the same straight line.
                    Since <hi rend="italic">AM</hi> has no projection on any straight line in the
                    plane <hi rend="italic">0BC,</hi> this gives <hi rend="italic">OA</hi> cos <hi

                    fundamental equations connecting the sides and angles of a spherical triangle;
                    all the other relations which we shall give below may be deduced analytically
                    from them; we shall, however, in most cases give independent proofs. By using

                <p>If we eliminate cos <hi rend="italic">b</hi> between the first two formulae of

                <p>The following proposition follows easily from the theorem in equation (3) :—If
                        <hi rend="italic">AD, BE, GF</hi> are three arcs drawn through <hi
                        rend="italic">A, B,C</hi> to meet the opposite sides in <hi rend="italic">D,
                        E, F</hi> respectively, and if these arcs pass through a point, the segments
                    of the sides satisfy the relation sin <hi rend="italic">BD</hi> sin <hi

                    conversely if this relation is satisfied the arcs pass through a point. From
                    this theorem it follows that the three perpendiculars from the angles on the
                    opposite sides, the three bisectors of the angles, and the three arcs from the
                    angles to the middle points of the opposite sides, each pass through a
                    point.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">D</hi> be the point of intersection of the three bisectors
                    of the angles <hi rend="italic">A, B, C,</hi> and if <hi rend="italic">DE</hi>

                <p>The formulae we have given are sufficient to determine three parts of a triangle
                    when the other three parts are given; moreover such formulae may always be
                    chosen as are adapted to logarithmic calculation. The solutions will be unique
                    except in the two cases (1) where two sides and the angle opposite one of them
                    are the given parts, and (2) where two angles and the side opposite one of them
                    are given.</p>
                <p>Suppose <hi rend="italic">a, b, A</hi> are the given parts. We determine <hi

                        U</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">A</hi>; this gives two supplementary values of

                        rend="italic">B &lt;</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Hence <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi> lies between the two values of <hi rend="italic"
                        >B,</hi> and therefore only one of these values is admissible, the acute or
                    the obtuse value according as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is greater or less than
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; there is therefore in this case always one
                    solution. Secondly, if sin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> &gt; sin <hi rend="italic"
                        >a,</hi> there is no solution when sin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi
                        rend="italic">A &gt;</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> but if sin <hi

                        >a</hi> there are two values of <hi rend="italic">B</hi> both greater or

                    negative; hence there are two solutions if <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is acute and
                    none if <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is obtuse. These two solutions fall together if
                    sin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">A</hi> = sin <hi

                    solution unless <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is obtuse, and in that case there are
                    two, which coincide as before if sin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi
                        rend="italic">A</hi> = sin <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Hence in this case
                    there are two solutions if sin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">b</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">A</hi> &gt; sin <hi rend="italic"
                        >a.</hi> Thirdly, if sin <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> sin <hi rend="italic"

                    negative, hence <hi rend="italic">A - B</hi> is zero or negative; thus there is
                    no solution unless <hi rend="italic">A</hi> is acute, and then there is one.
                    Similarly, if <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is obtuse, <hi rend="italic">A</hi> must
                    be so too in order that there may be a solution.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">a = b=</hi> 5, there is no solution unless <hi rend="italic"
                        >A = -,</hi> and theu there are an infinite number of solutions, since the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">C</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> become
                    indeterminate.</p>
                <p>The other case of ambiguity may be discussed in a similar manner, or the

                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">ABCD</hi> be a spherical quadrilateral inscribed in a small

                    is inscribed in the same circle as the spherical quadrilateral; hence by
                    Ptolemy’s theorem for a plane quadrilateral we obtain the analogous theorem for
                    a spherical one sin I sin ∣=sin " sin ∣+sin ∣ sin ∣.</p>
                <p>It has been shown by Remy (in <hi rend="italic">Crelle's joum.,</hi> vol. iii.)
                    that for any quadrilateral, if z be the spherical distance between the middle

                <p>This theorem is analogous to the theorem for any plane quadrilateral, that the

                <p>A theorem for a right-angled spherical triangle, analogous to the Pythagorean
                    theorem, has been given by Gudermann (in <hi rend="italic">Crelle's journ.,</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Analytical Trigonometry.</hi></p>
                <p>Analytical trigonometry is that branch of mathematical analysis in which the
                    analytical properties of the trigonometrical functions are investigated. These
                    functions derive their importance in analysis from the fact that they are the
                    simplest singly periodic functions, and are therefore adapted to the
                    representation of undulating magnitude. The sine, cosine, secant, and cosecant
                    have the single real period 2τr; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> each is unaltered
                    in value by the addition of 2π to the variable. The tangent and cotangent have
                    the period τr. The sine, tangent, cosecant, and cotangent belong to the class of
                    odd functions; that is, they change sign when the sign of the variable is
                    changed. The cosine and secant are even functions, since they remain unaltered
                    when the sign of the variable is reversed.</p>
                <p>The theory of the trigonometrical functions is intimately connected with that of
                        <hi rend="underline">com</hi> plex quantities,—that is, of quantities of the
                    form <hi rend="italic">x + vy</hi> (ι = ∖∕-l). Suppose we multiply together, by
                    the rules of ordinary algebra, two such quantities, we have</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ⅛ + <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Z∕ι)(¾ + *y
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) = (<hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ⅛ <hi

                    ¾V1)∙.</p>
                <p>We observe that the real part and the real factor of the imaginary part of the
                    expression on the right-hand side of this equation are similar in form to the
                    expressions which occur in the addition formulae for the cosine and sine of the
                    sum of two angles; in fact, if we put a¾=r <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> cos 0

                <p>We have thus obtained formulae for cos <hi rend="italic">nθ</hi> and sinnØ both
                    in ascending and in descending powers of cos 0 and sin 0. Viète obtained
                    formulae for chords of multiple arcs in powers of chords of the simple or
                    complementary arcs equivalent to the formulae (13) and (19) above. These are
                    contained in his work <hi rend="italic">Theoremata ael angulares sectiones.</hi>
                    James Bernoulli found formulae equivalent to (12) and (13) (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Mem. de l’Academie des Sciences,</hi> 1702), and transformed these series
                    into a form equivalent to (10) and (11). John Bernoulli published in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Acta eruditorum</hi> for 1701, among other formulae already
                    found by Viète, one equivalent to (17). These formulae have been extended to
                    cases in which <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is fractional, negative, or irrational;
                    see a paper by D. F. Gregory in <hi rend="italic">Camb. Math, joum.,</hi> vol.
                    iv., in which the series for cos <hi rend="italic">nθ,</hi> siniiØ in ascending
                    powers of cos 0 and sin 0 are extended to the case of a fractional value of τι.
                    These series have been considered by Euler in a memoir in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nova acta,</hi> vol. ix., by Lagrange in his <hi rend="italic">Calcul des

                    the logarithm of any complex or real quantity is a multiple-valued function, the
                    difference between successive values being 2π4; in particular, the most general
                    form of the logarithm of a real positive quantity is obtained by adding positive
                    or negative multiples of 2π4 to the arithmetical logarithm. On this subject, see
