                    Vespasian, Titus, Domitian, Nerva, Trajan. All we know of his personal history
                    is from allusions to himself in his own works, and from eleven letters addressed
                    to him by his very intimate friend the younger Pliny. The exact year of his
                    birth is a matter of inference, but it may be approximately fixed near the close
                    of the reign of Claudius, from 52 to 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Pliny
                    indeed speaks of Tacitus and himself as being “much of an age”<note

                    though himself born in 61 or 62, but he must have been some years junior to his
                    friend, who began, he tells us,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> i. 1.</p></note> his official
                    life with a quaestorship under Vespasian in 78 or 79, at which time he must have
                    been twenty-five years of age at least. Of his family and birthplace we know
                    nothing certain; we can infer nothing from his name Cornelius, which was then
                    very widely extended; but the fact of his early promotion seems to point to
                    respectable antecedents, and it may be that his father was one Cornelius
                    Tacitus, who had been a procurator in one of the divisions of Gaul, to whom
                    allusion is made by the elder Pliny in his <hi rend="italic">Natural
                    History</hi> (vii. 76). But it is all matter of pure conjecture, as it also is
                    whether his “praenomen” was Publius or Caius. He has come down to us simply as
                    Cornelius Tacitus. The most interesting facts about him to us are that he was an
                    eminent pleader at the Roman bar, that he was an eyewitness of the “reign of
                    terror” during the last three years of Domitian, and that he was the son-in-law
                    of the great and good Julius Agricola, the humane and enlightened governor of
                    Britain. This honourable connexion, which testifies to his high moral character,
                    may very possibly have accelerated his promotion, which he says<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi>
                    i. 1.</p></note> was begun by Vespasian, augmented by Titus, and still further
                    advanced by Domitian, under whom we find him presiding as praetor at the
                    celebration of the secular games in 88, and a member of one of the old priestly
                    colleges, to which good family was an almost indispensable passport. Next year,
                    it seems, he left Rome, and was absent till 93 on some provincial business, and
                    it is possible that in these four years he may have made the acquaintance of
                    Germany and its peoples. His father-in-law died the year of his return to Rome.
                    In the concluding passage of his <hi rend="italic">Life of Agricola</hi> he
                    tells us plainly that he witnessed the judicial murders of many of Rome’s best
                    citizens from 93 to 96, and that being himself a senator he felt almost a guilty
                    complicity in them. “Our hands,” he says, “dragged Helvidius to prison; we were
                    steeped in Senecio’s innocent blood.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    emperor Nerva’s accession his life became bright and prosperous, and so it
                    continued through the reign of Nerva’s successor, Trajan, he himself, in the
                    opening passage of his <hi rend="italic">Agricola,</hi> describing this as a
                    “singularly blessed time” <hi rend="italic">(beatissimum seculum);</hi> but the
                    hideous reign of terror had stamped itself ineffaceably on his soul, and when he

                    darkest side of imperialism. To his friend the younger Pliny we are indebted for
                    all we know (and this is but trifling) about his later life. He was advanced to
                    the consulship in 97, in succession to a highly distinguished man, Virginius
                    Rufus, on whom he delivered in the senate a funeral eulogy. “The good fortune of
                    Virginius,” says Pliny,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Epp.,</hi> ii. 1.</p></note> “was crowned by having the
                    most eloquent of panegyrists.” In 99 he was associated with Pliny in the
                    prosecution of a great political offender, Marius Priscus, under whom the
                    provincials of Africa had suffered grievous wrongs. The prosecution was
                    successful, and we have Pliny’s testimony<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Epp.,</hi> ii. 11.</p></note> that Tacitus
                    spoke with his characteristic dignity. Both received a special vote of thanks
                    from the senate for their conduct of the case. Of his remaining years we know
                    nothing, and we may presume that he devoted them exclusively to literary work.
                    It would seem that he lived to the close of Trajan’s reign, as he seems<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,ii.</hi> 61; iv. 4</p></note> to hint at that emperor’s extension of the
                    empire by his successful Eastern campaigns from 115 to 117. Whether he outlived
                    Trajan is matter of conjecture. It is worth noticing that the emperor Tacitus in
                    the 3d century claimed descent from him, and directed that ten copies of his
                    works should be made every year and deposited in the public libraries. He also
                    had a tomb built to his memory, which was destroyed by order of Pope Pius V. in
                    the latter part of the 16 th century. Tacitus, as we gather from one of Pliny’s
                    letters,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>had a great reputation during his lifetime. On one occasion a Roman knight, who
                    sat by his side in the circus at the celebration of some games, asked him, “Are
                    you from Italy or from the provinces?” His answer was, “You know me from your
                    reading.” To which the knight replied, “Are you then Tacitus or Pliny ?”</p>
                <p>Pliny, as we see clearly from several passages in his letters, had the highest
                    opinion of his friend’s ability and worth. He consults him about a school which
                    he thinks of establishing at Comum (Como), his birthplace, and asks him to look
                    out for suitable teachers and professors. And he pays<note anchored="true"

                    >Histories</hi> will be immortal, and this makes me the more anxious that my
                    name should appear in them.”</p>
                <p>The following is a list of Tacitus’s remaining works, arranged in their probable
                    chronological order, which may be approximately inferred from internal
                    evidence:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue on Orators,</hi> about 76 or 77;
                    (2) the <hi rend="italic">Life of Agricola,</hi> 97 or 98; (3) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Germany,</hi> 98, published probably in 99; (4) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Histories (Historwe),</hi> completed probably by 115 or 116, the
                    last years of Trajan’s reign (he must have been at work on them for many years);
                    (5) the <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> his latest work probably, written in part
                    perhaps along with the <hi rend="italic">Histories,</hi> and completed
                    subsequently to Trajan’s reign, which lie may very well have outlived.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Dialogue on Orators</hi> discusses, in the form of a
                    conversation which Tacitus professes to have heard (as a young man) between some
                    eminent men at the Roman bar, the causes of the decay of eloquence under the
                    empire. There are some interesting remarks in it on the change for the worse
                    that had taken place in the education of Roman lads.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Life of Agricola,</hi> short as it is, has always been
                    considered an admirable specimen of biography. The great man with all his grace
                    and dignity is brought vividly before us, and the sketch we have of the history
                    of our island under the Romans gives a special interest to this little work.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Germany,</hi> the full title of which is “Concerning the
                    geography, the manners and customs, and the tribes of Germany,” describes with
                    many suggestive hints the general character of the German peoples, and dwells
                    particularly on their fierce and independent spirit, which the author evidently
                    felt to be a standing menace to the empire. The geography is its weak point;
                    this was no doubt gathered from vague hearsay.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Histories,</hi> as originally composed in twelve books,
                    brought the history of the empire from Galba in 69 down to the close of
                    Domitian’s reign in 97. The first four books, and a small fragment of the fifth,
                    giving us a very minute account of the eventful year of revolution, 69, and the
                    brief reigns of Galba, Otho, and Vitellius, are all that remain to us. In the
                    fragment of the fifth book we have a curious and interesting account of the
                    Jewish nation, of their character, customs, and religion, from a cultivated
                    Roman’s point of view, which we see at once was a strongly prejudiced one.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Annals—</hi> a title for which there is no ancient
                    authority, and which there is no reason for supposing Tacitus gave distinctively
                    to the work—record the history of the emperors of the Julian line from Tiberius
                    to Nero, comprising thus a period from 14 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to 68.
                    Of these, nine books have come down to ns entire; of books v., xi., and xvi. we
                    have but fragments, and the whole of the reign of Caius (Caligula), the first
                    six years of Claudius, and the last three years of Nero are wanting. Out of a
                    period of fifty-four years we thus have the history of forty years.</p>
                <p>An attempt has been made recently to prove that the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi>
                    are a forgery by Poggio Bracciolini, an Italian scholar of the 15th century, but
                    their genuineness is confirmed by their agreement<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Introduction to vol. i. of Furneaux’s
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> of Tacitus, Clarendon Press Series,

                    discovered since that period. Another important fact has been brought to light.
                    Ruodolphus, a monk of a monastery at Fulda in Hesse-Cassel, writing in the 9th
                    century, says that Cornelius Tacitus speaks of the river known to moderns as the
                    Weser as the Visurgis. In the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> as they have come
                    down to us we find the Visurgis mentioned five times in the first two books,
                    whence we may conclude that a manuscript of them was in existence in the 9th
                    century. Add to this the testimony of Jerome that Tacitus wrote in thirty books
                    the lives of the Caesars, and the evidence of style, and there cannot be much
                    doubt that in the <hi rend="italic">Annals</hi> we have a genuine work of
                    Tacitus.</p>
                <p>Much of the history of the period described by him, especially of the earlier
                    Caesars, must have been obscure and locked up with the emperor’s private papers
                    and memoranda. As we should expect, there was a vast amount of floating gossip,
                    which an historian would have to sift and utilize as best lie might. Tacitus, as
                    a man of good social position, no doubt had access to the best information, and
                    must have talked matters over with the most eminent men of the day. There were
                    several writers and chroniclers, whom he occasionally cites but not very often;
                    there were memoirs of distinguished persons,—those, for example of the younger
                    Agrippina, of Thrasea, and Helvidius. There were several collections of letters,
                    like <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> those of the younger Pliny; a number, too, of
                    funeral orations; and the “acta senatus” and the “acta populi” or “acta diurna,”
                    the first a record of proceedings in the senate, the latter a kind of gazette or
                    journal. Thus there were the materials for history in considerable abundance,
                    and Tacitus was certainly a man who knew how to turn them to good account. He
                    has given us a striking, and on the whole doubtless a true, picture of the
                    empire in the 1st century. He wrote, it may be admitted, with a political bias
                    and a decided turn for satire, but he assuredly wrote with a high aim, and we
                    may accept his own account of it: “I regard<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> iii. 65.</p></note> it as
                    history’s highest function to rescue merit from oblivion, and to hold up as a
                    terror to base words and actions the reprobation of posterity.” Amid great evils
                    he recognized the existence of truly noble virtues even in his own degenerate
                    age. Still for the most part he writes as a man who felt deeply that the world
                    was altogether “out of joint”; the empire was in itself in his view a huge
                    blunder, and answerable more or less directly for all the diseases of society,
                    for all the demoralization and corruption of the great world of Rome, though as
                    to the provinces he admits that they were better off in many ways under the
                    emperors than they had been in the last days of the republic. But his political
                    sympathies were certainly with the old aristocratic and senatorian régime, with
                    the Rome of the Scipios and the Fabii; for him the greatness of his country lay
                    in the past, and, though he felt her to be still great, her glory was, he
                    thought, decidedly on the wane. He was, in fact, a political idealist, and could
                    hardly help speaking disparagingly of his own day. In his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Germany</hi> he dwells on the contrast between barbarian freedom and simplicity
                    on the one hand and the servility and degeneracy of Roman life on the other. Yet
                    he had a strong and sincere patriotism, which invariably made him minimize a
                    Roman defeat and the number of Roman slain. There seems to have been a strange
                    tinge, too, of superstition about him, and he could not divest himself of some
                    belief<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ann.,</hi> vi. 21, 22.</p></note> in astrology and revelations of the future
                    through omens and portents, though he held these were often misunderstood and
                    misinterpreted by charlatans and impostors. On the whole he appears to have
                    inclined to the philosophical theory of “necessitarianism,” that everyman’s
                    future is fixed from his birth; but we must not fasten on him any particular
                    theory of the world or of the universe. Sometimes he speaks as a believer in a
                    divine overruling Providence, and we may say confidently that with the Epicurean
                    doctrine he had no sort of sympathy.</p>
                <p>His style, whatever judgment may be passed on it, is certainly that of a man of
                    genius, and cannot fail to make a deep impression on the studious reader.
                    Tacitean brevity has become proverbial, and with this are closely allied an
                    occasional obscurity and a rhetorical affectation which his warmest admirers
                    must admit. He has been compared to Carlyle, and there are certainly
                    resemblances between the two both in style and tone of thought. Both affect
                    singularity of expression; both incline to an unhopeful and cynical view of the
                    world. Tacitus was probably never a popular author; to be understood and
                    appreciated he must be read again and again, or the point of some of his acutest
                    remarks will be quite missed. He has been several times translated, but it has
                    always been felt that he presents very great, if not insuperable, difficulties
                    to the translator.</p>
                <p>Murphy's translation (a paraphrase we should call it) is perhaps one of the best
                    known; it was published early in the present century. On this was based the
                    so-called Oxford translation, published by Bohn in a revised edition. The latest
                    translation is that by Messrs Church and Brodribb. There is on the whole a good
                    French translation by Louandre. The editions of Tacitus are very numerous. Among
