                    rate, as a criminal, and was liable to a fine for the breach of the peace,
                    commuted for a small sum of money, for which 5 W. and M. c. 12 substituted a fee
                    of 6s. 8d. recoverable as costs against the defendant. Trespass is not now
                    criminal except by special statutory enactment, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    old statutes against forcible entry, the Game Acts, and the private Acts of many
                    railway companies. When, however, trespass is carried sufficiently far it may
                    become criminal, and be prosecuted as assault if to the person, as nuisance if
                    to the land. At one time an important distinction was drawn between trespass
                    general and trespass special or trespass on the case, for which see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tort.</hi> The difference between trespass and case was
                    sometimes a very narrow one; the general rule was that where the injury was
                    directly caused by the act of the defendant the proper remedy was trespass,
                    where indirectly, case. The difference is illustrated by the action for false
                    imprisonment: if the defendant himself imprisoned the plaintiff the action was
                    trespass; if a third person did so on the information of the defendant it was
                    case. A close parallel is found in Roman law in the <hi rend="italic">actio
                    directa</hi> under the lex Aquilia for injury caused directly, the <hi
                    rend="italic">actio utilis</hi> for that caused indirectly. One of the reasons
                    for the rapid extension of the action on the case, especially that form of it
                    called <hi rend="italic">assumpsit,</hi> was no doubt the fact that in the
                    action on the case the defendant was not allowed to wage his law (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Wager).</hi></p>
                <p>In its more restricted sense, trespass is generally used for entry on land
                    without lawful authority by either a man, his servants, or his cattle. To
                    maintain an action for such trespass the plaintiff must have possession of the
                    premises. The quantum of possession necessary to enable him to bring the action
                    is often a question difficult to decide. In most instances the tenant can bring
                    trespass, the reversioner only case. By the Judicature Act, 1873, a mortgagor in
                    possession can sue for trespass in his own name. Remedies for trespass are
                    either judicial or extrajudicial. The most minute invasion of private right is
                    trespass, though the damages may be nominal if the injury was trivial. On the
                    other hand, they may be exemplary if circumstances of aggravation were present.
                    Pleading in the old action of trespass was of a very technical nature, but the
                    old-fashioned terms <hi rend="italic">alia enormia,</hi> replication <hi
                    rend="italic">de injuria,</hi> new assignment, &amp;c., once of such frequent
                    occurrence in the reports, are of merely historical interest since the
                    introduction of a simpler system of pleading, unless in those American States
                    where the old pleading has not been reformed. The <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Venue</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> in trespass was formerly local, in case
                    transitory. In addition to damages for trespass, an injunction may be granted by
                    the court. The power to grant injunctions against threatened or apprehended
                    trespass has been considerably enlarged by the Judicature Act, 1873. The
                    principal instances of extra-judicial remedies are distress damage feasant of
                    cattle trespassing, and removal of a trespasser without unnecessary violence,
                    expressed in the terms of Latin pleading by <hi rend="italic">molliter manus
                    imposuit.</hi></p>
                <p>Trespass may be justified by exercise of a legal right, as to serve the process
                    of the law, or by invitation or licence of the owner, or may be excused by
                    accident or inevitable necessity, as deviation from a highway out of repair.
                    Where a man abuses an authority given by the law, his wrongful act relates back
                    to his entry, and he becomes a trespasser <hi rend="italic">αb initio,</hi> that
                    is, liable to be treated as a trespasser for the whole time of his being on the
                    land. Mere breach of contract, such as refusal to pay for wine in a tavern which
                    a person has lawfully entered, does not constitute him a trespasser <hi
                    rend="italic">ab initio.</hi> A trespass of a permanent nature is called a
                    continuing trespass; such would be the permitting of one’s cattle to feed on
                    another’s land without authority.</p>
                <p>In Scots law trespass is used only for torts to land. By the Trespass (Scotland)
                    Act, 1865, trespassers are liable on summary conviction to fine and imprisonment
                    for encamping, lighting fires, &amp;c., on land without the consent and
                    permission of the owner.</p>
