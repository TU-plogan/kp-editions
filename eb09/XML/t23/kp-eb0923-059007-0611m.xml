                    did not long survive the inroads of the Teutonic tribes who in western Europe
                    divided the inheritance of the Latin world. All the early Teutonic codes, being
                    based, however remotely, on the right of private war and private vengeance,
                    might discourage, but were powerless to abolish, the instinct which impels the
                    members of half-civilized communities to avenge their own wrongs. Hence the <hi
                    rend="italic">pax Romana</hi> died with the empire; nor could the splendid
                    organization of Charlemagne do more than effect a very partial resuscitation of
                    it. Throughout the 9th and 10th centuries, as the life-benefices of the later
                    Carolingian kings became gradually transformed into hereditary fiefs, the
                    insecurity of life and property grew greater; for there was no central power to
                    curb the injustice of the petty dukes and counts who warred and pillaged at
                    their will. At this moment, when western Europe threatened to sink back into the
                    chaos from which it had been won by Rome, the church came forward to arrest the
                    process of its dissolution. Speaking at first in her own interest and in that of
                    the poor, whose great protector she claimed to be, she decreed a special peace
                    for the unarmed clerk and the industrious husbandman. The council of Charroux in
                    Poitou led the way in 989. With the opening of the next century the movement
                    spread over Aquitaine and the rest of France. Everywhere the bishops set
                    themselves to exact from the whole diocese, noble and simple alike, a novel oath
                    to abstain from violence and to respect the sanctity of churches. William V. of
                    Aquitaine, the most powerful lord of southern France, lent his influence to the
                    cause at the councils of Limoges (994) and Poitiers (999). The latter council
                    prescribed the methods by which all who violated their solemn engagement should
                    be punished. The times, however, were hardly ripe for the inauguration of an era
                    of peace. Gerard of Soissons, perhaps, was not the only bishop who eyed this
                    dream of universal harmony askance, as tending to encroach on the king’s
                    prerogative (see Bouquet, x. 201); and, on the whole, it may be said that the
                    “Peace of God” was at best but a somewhat ineffectual protection to churches,
                    priests, and labourers. If there was any hope of restraining the mutual feuds of
                    the barons it must be by other means. And here the church again, recognizing the
                    impossibility of absolutely stopping all feudal warfare, endeavoured to limit
                    it. This limitation of the right of perpetual warfare, reduced to writing,
                    sanctioned by an oath, and confirmed by the decrees of councils, assumed the
                    name of the “Truce of God” <hi rend="italic">(treva</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >treuga Dei).</hi> The truce of God seems to have been first established at the
                    synod of Tuluges, near Perpignan in Roussillon, on 16th May 1027. In accordance
                    with its decrees all warfare was to be suspended from noon on Saturday till
                    prime on Monday; and the peace of God was permanently extended to all monks,
                    clerks, bishops, and churches. Like the <hi rend="italic">pax ecclesiae,</hi>
                    this laudable example was soon followed elsewhere. About 1041 it extended itself
                    over Aquitaine and all France; in 1042 the council of Caen, under the sanction
                    of Duke William, established it in Normandy—a country in which, according to a
                    contemporary writer (Rodolph Glaber, v. 1), it was not at first accepted. By
                    this time its terms had been much enlarged; and we may perhaps take the
                    provisions of a second synod at Tuluges (1041) as representing its normal form.
                    According to this synod the <hi rend="italic">treuga Dei</hi> was to last from
                    the Wednesday evening to the Monday morning in every week, from the beginning of
                    Advent to the octave of the Epiphany, from the beginning of Lent till the octave
                    of Pentecost, for the feasts of the Holy Cross, the three great feasts of the
                    Virgin, and those of the twelve apostles and a few other saints. More usually
                    the interval between the Epiphany octave and Lent and that from Easter to
                    Rogations were left subject to the weekly truce only. Thus from being a mere
                    local institution it spread rapidly over all France, and seems to have crossed
                    into Germany, Italy, Spain, and England. It had also its special courts and
                    methods of procedure. Excommunication and banishment for seven or thirty years
                    were its penalties. Before long both the <hi rend="italic">pax ecclesiae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">treuga Dei</hi> were sanctioned by the holy see.
                    Special clauses were added to protect pilgrims, women, merchants, monks, and
                    clerks; while the cattle and agricultural implements of the peasant —his ox,
                    horse, plough, and even his olive-trees—were covered by the aegis of the church.
                    The first clause of the council of Clermont (1095), at which Urban II. preached
                    the first crusade, proclaimed the weekly truce for all Christendom, and perhaps
                    enjoined it in its most extended form, adding also a clause by which the oath
                    was to be renewed every three years by all men above the age of twelve, whether
                    noble, burgess, villain, or serf.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    was most powerful in the 12th century, during which period it was sanctioned
                    both by local and papal councils, such as that held at Rheims by Calixtus II. in
                    1119, and the Lateran councils of 1139 and 1179. With the 13th century its
                    influence began to decline, as the power of the king gradually led to the
                    substitution of the king’s peace for that of the church.</p>
