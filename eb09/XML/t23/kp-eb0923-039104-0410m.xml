                    (Sonrhai, <hi rend="italic">Timbutu</hi>; Berber, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tumbutku</hi>; Arab, <hi rend="italic">Tin-buhtu),</hi> a city of the Sahara,
                    on the southern verge of the desert, in 18° 4 ’ N. lat. and 1° 45' W. long., at
                    the north-east extremity of the Fulah state of Moassina (Massina), 9 miles north
                    of its riverine port Kabara, on the left bank of the Niger, at the confluence of
                    the numerous branches of the Joliba (upper Niger) where it trends eastwards, and
                    at the converging point of the main trade routes from the Gulf of Guinea and
                    from the Mediterranean across the western Sahara. Timbuktu lies on a terrace
                    formed by the southern scarp of the desert, about 800 feet above sea-level, and
                    overlooking a chain of <hi rend="italic">dhayas</hi> or marshy hollows, fringed
                    here and there with a few mimosas and palm thickets, amid the surrounding sandy
                    wastes. These dhayas, which are flooded every three or four years, converting
                    the lowland tracts between the terrace and the main stream into a labyrinth of
                    channels and backwaters, mark the bed of a navigable creek which formerly
                    branched from the Niger northwards to the foot of the scarp, and which in 1640
                    inundated a low-lying quarter of the city. According to Pouyanne and Sabatier,
                    the main stream follow*ed this course before it took its present easterly curve
                    to Burum, where it bends south wards to the coast. Here also it was probably
                    joined at some remote period by the now dried up Wady Messaura from the Tuát
                    oases south of Algeria, although the rough levels taken by Oscar Lenz and others
                    make it uncertain whether the flow through this depression was northwards or
                    southwards. In any case Timbuktu has been left, so to say, high and dry by the
                    general process of desiccation going on throughout the Saharian region. It was
                    founded, or more probably captured, by the Tuareg Berbers about the 11th
                    century, and under the Mandingo kings of Mali (Mallé) was a noted mart for gold
                    and salt in the 14th century, mention of “Timboutch” occurring on a Catalan map
                    dated 1373. Under Askia, founder of the extensive but short-lived Sonrhai empire
                    (1492), it rose to great splendour and became with Gogo a chief centre of
                    Mohammedan culture for the peoples of western Sudan. But since the overthrow
                    (1591) of the Sonrhai dynasty by the Morocco captain, the Andalusian Jodar with
                    his Ruma followers, Timbuktu has continued to be the prey of the surrounding
                    unruly populations—Tuaregs, Arabs or Arabized Berbers, Fulahs (1800), and
                    Toucouleurs (1865). Being thus at the mercv of all. it has ceased to rebuild its
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n411/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0411-0392"/> dismantled walls, being content to pay tribute to
                    each in turn and sometimes to more than one simultaneously, for which it
                    indemnifies itself by peaceful intervals of trade whenever the land routes are
                    open and the upper and lower reaches of the Niger are clear of pirates. But at
                    times even the short tract separating it from Kabara is so beset with marauders
                    that it bears the ominous name of “Ur-immandess,” that is, “He (God) hears not.”
                    Recently, however, it has enjoyed a considerable interval of peace, and the
                    population, estimated by Barth at 11,000 in 1853, had risen to 20,000 in 1880
                    (Lenz). These form a motley group of Sonrhais, Tuaregs, Mandingoes, Arabs from
                    Morocco, Berabish Arabs, Bambaras, Fulahs, and since 1850 a few Jewish traders.
                    Apart from some Christian captives, the place was reached during the 19th
                    century by only four Europeans—Laing from Tripolitana (1826), who was murdered
                    on his return journey, Caillié from the north (1828), Barth from central Sudan
                    (1853), and Lenz from Morocco (1880). Since 1884, however, regular relations
                    have been opened with the French on the upper Niger.</p>
                <p>From the ruins covering extensive tracts on the north and west sides, it is
                    evident that Timbuktu was formerly a much larger place than at present. Even the
                    great mosque, which must at one time have stood in the centre, now lies near the
                    outskirts, where its high but unsightly earth tower forms a striking landmark.
                    The aggregate of mean hovels or mud houses of which the place consists is only
                    relieved by a few structures of a better class. As in former times, a great
                    staple of trade is salt from Taudeni and other parts of the Sahara, here
                    exchanged with gold dust for kola nuts from the south, Manchester goods, and
                    some other European wares, which with tea are imported from Morocco or penetrate
                    from the British protected territories along the lower Niger. Cowries, slowly
                    yielding to European moneys, are the chief currency. The local industries are
                    mainly confined to some fancy and other leatherwork prepared by the Tuareg
                    women. The local administration is in the hands of an hereditary <hi
                    rend="italic">kahia,</hi> a kind of mayor, descended from one of the Ruma
                    families. The kahia is himself more or less under the control of a neighbouring
                    Tuareg chief and of the powerful Bakhai family, who, as “sherífs” and marabouts,
                    are revered throughout the western Sahara. Timbuktu, which possesses some
                    valuable Arabic manuscripts and is still a centre of Moslem teaching, is a
                    converging point of the chief west Sudanese and Saharan races—Arabs or Arabized
                    Berbers to the west; Sonrhais in the immediate vicinity, and thence
                    south-eastwards along the Niger; Ireghenaten or “mixed” Tuaregs southwards
                    across the Niger as far as the Hombori Hills and in the fertile Libbako plains
                    beyond them; Fulahs, Mandingoes, and Bambaras in and about the city; and Imóhag
                    or Imósharh Tuaregs belonging to the Awellimiden confederation mainly to the
                    north and east.</p>
