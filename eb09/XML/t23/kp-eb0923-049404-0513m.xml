                    driving of vehicles by electricity was made commercially practicable by the
                    invention of the dynamo-electric machine, which gave a ready means of producing
                    electrical energy by the expenditure of mechanical work, and by the further
                    discovery that the function of the dynamo could be reversed,—that it was capable
                    of acting efficiently as a motor to do mechanical work when supplied with energy
                    in the electrical form. Experiment has shown that when a dynamo is used to
                    produce an electric current, which, in its turn, drives another dynamo serving
                    as a motor, the double conversion of energy may be performed with no very
                    serious loss. In favourable cases, when the dynamo and motor are close together,
                    the motor will yield more than 80 per cent. of the work which is spent in
                    driving the dynamo. When they are far apart there is an additional loss, due to
                    the resistance of the conductor which connects them, and a further loss due to
                    its imperfect insulation. The use of high electromotive force, which reduces the
                    first of these, tends to increase the second; it is, however, practicable to
                    keep both within reasonable limits. Early attempts to apply electricity to
                    traction were made by Robert Davidson, who placed an electromagnetic locomotive
                    on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway in 1837, and by Jacobi <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0514-0495"/> of St Petersburg, who propelled a boat on the
                    Neva in 1839 by an electromagnetic engine driven by a battery of Grove’s cells.
                    The inefficiency and bulkiness of early electromotors, and the cost of producing
                    electric energy when a galvanic battery was the source, made it impossible for
                    electricity under such conditions as these to compete with other methods of
                    traction. A good battery using zinc as the active metal consumes from 1 to 2 lb
                    of zinc per hour per horse-power developed; a good steam-engine consumes from 2
                    to 3 lb of coal in doing the same amount of work, and the cost of zinc is about
                    fifty times that of coal. Hence, notwithstanding modern improvements in
                    electromotors, the cost of producing mechanical power by means of electricity,
                    when a zinc-consuming battery is the source, is still prohibitive.</p>
                <p>The earliest practical electric railway was constructed at the Berlin exhibition
                    of 1879 by Dr Werner Siemens. At one station was a dynamo driven by a
                    steam-engine. The current was conducted to the moving car through a special rail
                    placed between the ordinary rails and insulated from the ground by blocks of
                    wood. From this rail it passed through a motor-dynamo on the car, and the
                    ordinary rails completed the circuit. Electrical contact with the ordinary rails
                    was made by the wheels, and with the central rail by a pair of brushes made of
                    copper wire which rubbed against its sides. Spur-wheels were used to connect the
                    motor shaft with the wheels and to effect a suitable reduction of speed. The
                    line was half a mile long and of 2-feet gauge. The motor developed about 3½
                    horse-power, and was carried by a separate truck, forming a locomotive which
                    drew a car with 20 passengers at a speed of from 4 to 7 miles an hour.</p>
                <p>The success of the Berlin experiment was complete, and Messrs Siemens followed it
                    up in 1881 by the construction of a permanent electric tramway, 1½ miles in
                    length, at Lichterfelde, which has now (1887) been in continuous operation for
                    six years. At Lichterfelde the ordinary rails, insulated by wooden sleepers, are
                    the only conductors. Where roads cross the line the rails are cut out of
                    circuit, and the current is carried past the gap by underground cables, but
                    switches are provided by which the current can be sent into the insulated
                    sections if required. Each car takes 24 passengers, and runs at a speed of 12
                    miles an hour. There is no separate locomotive, the motor-dynamo being on the
                    car itself. In 1882 Messrs Siemens constructed an electric tramway in the mines
                    of Zankerode, in Saxony, and built for it a locomotive able to draw 8 tons at a
                    speed of 7½ miles an hour. Overhead conductors were employed, consisting of a
                    pair of insulated ˩-shaped rails fixed to the roof of the workings; the current
                    was conveyed to and from the locomotive by means of a pair of contact carriages
                    sliding on these conductors, and connected with the car by short flexible
                    cables. A similar line was opened in 1883 at the Hohenzollern colliery in Upper
                    Silesia.</p>
                <p>The same year witnessed the completion of another pioneer undertaking of the
                    first importance, an electric tramway 6 miles long connecting Portrush and
                    Bushmills, in the north of Ireland. Here the insulated conductor is a special
                    rail, carried alongside of the line on wooden posts at a height of 1½ feet above
                    the ground. Contact is made by springs shaped like carriage-springs, which
                    project from one side of the car at both ends, so that the length of the car
                    enables continuous contact to be maintained at crossroads, where there are gaps
                    in the conducting rail, past which the current is taken by underground cables.
                    The ordinary rails serve as return conductors. The dynamos are driven by
                    turbines at a station nearly a mile distant from the line; they supply a current
                    of 100 amperes with an electromotive force of 250 volts. The motors are placed
                    on passenger cars; their speed is regulated by means of resistance coils, which
                    the driver of the car switches into the circuit. A similar tramway, 3 miles
                    long, connecting Bessbrook and Newry, was opened in 1885; there also water-power
                    is made use of to drive the generating dynamos. On these lines the train usually
                    consists of a motor car with passengers, followed by two or three goods waggons,
                    and the whole working expenses are from 3d. to 4d. per train-mile. The speed is
                    10 miles an hour.</p>
                <p>Amongst early electrical railways Mr Volk’s short line on the beach at Brighton
                    deserves mention. There the rails themselves act as conductors, and are
                    insulated only by wooden sleepers lying on the shingle. The line has been in
                    operation since 1883, with a working expense of only 2d. per car-mile.</p>
                <p>Other English and Continental lines will be referred to later; it is, however, in
                    America that electrical traction has hitherto found its widest development. In
                    1880 Mr Edison ran an electric locomotive on an experimental track near his
                    laboratory at Menlo Park. Soon after the Chicago exhibition of 1883, at which an
                    electric railway was shown in action, a large number of permanent lines were
                    established. There are now more than twenty electrical tramways at work in the
                    United States, under the patents of Edison, Field, Daft, Van Depoele, Sprague,
                    and others. Many more lines are projected, and experiments are in progress on
                    the application of electrical traction on a large scale to the elevated railways
                    of New York.</p>
                <p>In all the instances which have been referred to above, electricity is employed
                    as a means of transmitting power as it is wanted from a generating station to
                    the cars, through a conductor extending along the track. Another method of
                    effecting electric traction is to carry a store of energy on the car or on a
                    special locomotive, by using secondary batteries which are charged from time to
                    time at the generating station. This system, which was introduced in England by
                    Mr Reckenzaun and on the Continent by M. Julien, has been successfully employed
                    on several lines.</p>
                <p>The system of storage, by means of secondary batteries, has the great advantage
                    over the system of transmission through a conductor that it makes each car
                    independent and that it is applicable to ordinary tramway lines. As regards
                    economy of power, we have in the storage system a more complex series of
                    transformation of energy, and therefore a larger number of items of loss. In
                    both systems alike we have a certain loss of energy at the dynamo and at the
                    motor. A secondary battery yields in the electrical form only about 70 per cent.
                    of the energy given to it. In comparing the two methods, the loss which this
                    involves has to be set off against that which occurs in the transmission system
                    in the process of conduction, an item which may be very small in favourable
                    cases, but which becomes large when there are many cars to be driven, when the
                    line is long, and when, owing to the use of an exposed conductor, the
                    electromotive force has to be kept low. Under average conditions it is probable
                    that the conductor system has a slight advantage over the other in this respect,
                    but the difference is not material, especially as the cost of power is a
                    comparatively small part of the whole working expense of a line. The difference
                    is slightly affected by the fact that in the storage system there is an extra
                    weight to be carried—namely, the batteries—amounting to about ¼ or <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> of the whole weight,
                    and the tractive force required to overcome friction is increased in a
                    corresponding degree. A serious objection to the storage system is the probable
                    cost of renewing batteries. In respect, however, both of durability and of power
                    (in relation to weight) secondary batteries have of late undergone a marked
                    improvement; and it is likely that the storage system will prove the most
                    applicable to tramways in city streets, where conductors on the level of the
                    road are impracticable and overhead conductors would not be permitted.</p>
                <p>The existing methods of electrical traction as applied to tramways may be
                    classified as follows:—</p>
                <p>I. Motor driven by storage batteries, the batteries and motor being carried
                    either (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) in the car itself or (<hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi>) on a separate truck forming a locomotive. Reckenzaun’s and Julien’s
                    cars, in which the batteries are under the seats, are examples of the first
                    plan, which is in operation on lines at Antwerp, Hamburg, Brussels, and New
                    York. Mr Elieson’s tramway locomotive working in London on the North
                    Metropolitan tramways is an example of the second plan. It is obviously
                    preferable, when space can be found on the car itself for the motor and
                    batteries, to place them there rather than on a separate truck. When a separate
                    locomotive is used it <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0515-0496"/> must be heavy enough to grip the rails, and the
                    whole weight to be drawn is then considerably greater.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a comparison of the weights to be drawn
                    and the tractive force required in different systems, see a paper by Mr
                    Reckenzaun, <hi rend="italic">Elect. Rev.,</hi> May 21, 1886.</p></note></p>
                <p>II. Conductor systems, which may be classified thus:—</p>
                <p>(a) Those using the ordinary rails as the only conductors. The lines at
                    Lichterfelde and Brighton, already mentioned, are examples of this plan, which
                    is quite inapplicable where the rails are laid flush with the roadway as in city
                    streets.</p>
                <p>(5) Those using a third (insulated) rail, above ground. To this class belong the
                    Portrush, the Bessbrook, and several American lines. This plan, like the last,
                    is not applicable to city streets.</p>
                <p>(c) Those using one (or in some cases two) overhead conductors. A line of this
                    type has been successfully worked between Mödling and Hinterbrühl, near Vienna,
                    and another between Frankfort and Offenbach, both since 1884, at a cost of about
                    3½d. per car-mile. The conductors consist of slotted tubes 1 inch in bore
                    supported on posts 18 feet high and stayed by wires at intermediate points to
                    keep them from sagging. The contact carriages are pistons sliding in the
                    tubes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For details of
                    the construction and working expenses of these and other lines, see the valuable
                    paper by Mr Reckenzaun, <hi rend="italic">Jour. Soc. of Arts,</hi> April
                    20,1887. Statistics of American lines will be found in a paper by T. C. Martin,
                    read before the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, May 18,
                    1887.</p></note> The Daft lines at Baltimore and other places in America, and
                    the Van Depoele lines, of which some 30 miles are in operation, are mostly
                    worked by means of overhead conductors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> Those using underground conductors in a slotted
                    channel or conduit. This system, which has the obvious advantage that the
                    conductor is placed entirely out of the way of street traffic, has been
                    introduced at Blackpool by Mr Holroyd Smith, and, in America, at Cleveland by
                    Messrs Bentley and Knight and at Philadelphia by Mr Schlesinger. In the
                    Blackpool line the conductor is split into two parts which run parallel to each
                    other within the conduit on its two sides, and are touched by a contact arm
                    which reaches down through a narrow central slot at the level of the street; an
                    electromotive force of 200 volts is employed. The conduit is placed midway
                    between the rails, but it may be questioned whether, in view of the conditions
                    of ordinary street traffic, a better place for it would not be at one side. Mr
                    Field has proposed a tramway with two conduits, one beside each rail, containing
                    two conductors, one to be charged positively and the other negatively, so that a
                    comparatively high resultant difference of potential is available for the motor
                    although the potential of neither conductor differs to a dangerous degree from
                    that of the earth.</p>
                <p>(<hi rend="italic">e</hi>) One system remains to be described, which was proposed
                    in 1881 by Messrs Ayrton and Perry as specially applicable to electric railways
                    of considerable length, in which an exposed conductor would give rise to much
                    loss through leakage. Their plan is to use a well-insulated conductor in a
                    closed channel underground. The line is divided into short sections; each of
                    these has an exposed conductor, which may be one of the rails, and this is
                    placed in temporary contact with the insulated conductor as the train passes, by
                    the pressure of the wheels on a flexible rail or stud, or by means of automatic
                    electromagnetic switches. Leakage is thus restricted to the continuous and
                    well-insulated conductor, together with that section of the surface conductor
                    which is in contact with the former at any one time; and the system has the
                    further advantage that it gives the means of providing an automatic block by
                    which successive trains are kept from overtaking one another.</p>
                <p>The form and disposition of the motor-dynamo and the mode by which it is
                    connected with the driving-axle of the car are matters in which much variety of
                    practice exists. The question of gearing is complicated by the fact that the
                    frame of the car oscillates vertically with respect to the axles. Spur-wheels,
                    worm-gear, frictiongear, belts, multiple-band gear, and chain-gear are or have
                    been used. Mr Reckenzaun’s car is carried by two bogie trucks, one under each
                    end, and each bogie carries a motor whose axle, placed longitudinally, drives a
                    central spur-wheel on one axle of the bogie by means of a worm. An advantage
                    possessed by two motors is that, by coupling them in series or parallel, or by
                    using one only, the driver is able to command different grades of power without
                    the use of resistance coils. In cars driven by storage batteries the same object
                    may be secured by various groupings of the cells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Telpherage.—</hi> In all the methods of electrical traction to
                    which reference has been made the road on which the cars run is essentially a
                    railway or tramway of the kind used in horse traction and steam traction. In
                    1881 the late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin devised a system of electric locomotion in
                    which the vehicles are hung upon what resembles an exaggerated telegraph line.
                    To this he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">telpherage.</hi> As developed by
                    the inventor, in conjunction with Messrs Ayrton and Perry, the system is
                    especially adapted to the transport of goods at a slow speed, in localities
                    where the traffic would be insufficient to support an ordinary railway.</p>
                <p>The telpher line is a steel rod or cable, suspended from brackets on posts about
                    70 feet apart; it serves at once as carrier of weights and conductor of
                    electricity. The line may be made rigid, and in that case a high speed of
                    transit may be attained; but in general the line is flexible and the trains
                    travel slowly in what may be, if the volume of traffic requires it, a nearly
                    continuous stream. Each train consists of a series of buckets or skeps which
                    hang each from a single running wheel or pair of wheels, and are spaced by
                    wooden connecting bars. A small electric motor, which hangs below the line and
                    is geared by spur and chain gearing to a pair of drivingwheels, forms the
                    locomotive. In general, the line is electrically divided into equal sections,
                    which have the same length as a single train, so that the front carriage is
                    always on the section in advance of the rear carriage. The train is furnished
                    with a continuous conductor from end to end, through which it makes electric
                    contact between the section in front and the section behind, and the motor is
                    included in the circuit of this conductor. Two systems of working are used,
                    which enable trains to be run either in electrical series or “parallel.” In the
                    series system the successive sections of the line are electrically connected, so
                    long as no train is on them, by means of switches at the joints between the
                    sections, so that the whole forms one continuous conductor. When a train comes
                    on any one section it breaks contact at the joint between that section and the
                    one behind it; the circuit, however, remains closed through the conductor on the
                    train itself, and in this way the motor receives the current which is passing
                    through the line. Other trains at other places in the line receive the same
                    current, each by breaking for the time the ordinary contact between the two
                    sections it touches, and substituting a contact through its own conductor and
                    motor. When a train leaves a section it replaces the switch that makes contact
                    with the section behind. If, however, there are more than one train on the line,
                    an automatic block system is added to prevent one from overtaking another by
                    letting the section which a train leaves stand insulated for a time. No control
                    is exercised from the vehicles themselves; in fact, the trains run without
                    attendants. In the simplest parallel system of telpherage a continuous conductor
                    distinct from the line is stretched alongside of it; the trains make contact
                    between the two. The figure shows another plan, known as the cross-over parallel
                    system, which is suitable where a double line of trains is desired. There A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>. . . form successive sections of one line, and B <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, ... of
                    another. A <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, A <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, A <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. . . are electrically continuous, and are connected to
                    one pole of the dynamo. B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. . . are also continuous, and are
                    connected to the other pole. Thus the sections of each line are alternately
                    positive and negative. Any train, such as P or Q, bridges the gap between two
                    sections and receives a current which suffers reversal as the train passes from
                    one section to the next. It is to be regretted that space does not admit of any
                    description of the details of telpherage, many of which present the utmost
                    ingenuity. The system was shown to be practicable by experiments on an
                    experimental line at Weston. The first telpher line on a commercial basis was
                    erected in 1885 at Glynde, in Sussex, and has been maintained in operation
                    notwithstanding many difficulties inseparable from so completely novel an
                    undertaking.</p>
                <p>The electrical propulsion of boats, by means of storage batteries, has been the
                    subject of several successful experiments, but has not found systematic
                    application. In this connexion reference should be made to a scheme proposed by
                    Ayrton and Perry for the haulage of boats on canals or of waggons upon roads.
                    Their proposal was to have a conductor ranged along the towing path, or along
                    the side of the road. A motor running on this was to pull itself along and drag
                    the boat or waggon after it.</p>
                <p>In aerial navigation, storage batteries working an electric motor have been used
                    to drive the propeller of a “dirigible” balloon.</p>
                <p>Space does not admit of more than the briefest reference to the theory of
                    electric motors. A motor may be regarded as a dynamo acting to produce an
                    electromotive force <hi rend="italic">e</hi> which is opposite in direction to
                    the externally impressed electromotive force E. The resultant electromotive
                    force is E - <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and on this, together with the resistance
                    of the circuit, the strength of the current C depends. The electrical power
                    supplied is CE, and of this the motor utilizes C <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The
                    efficiency is <hi rend="italic">e/</hi> E <hi rend="italic">.</hi> It is easily
                    seen, as was first shown by Jacobi, that the power developed by the motor (C <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi>) is a maximum when <hi rend="italic">e</hi> = ½E. But this
                    condition of maximum power involves that half the energy supplied is wasted; to
                    secure higher efficiency, motors are in practice run at much less than their
                    maximum power, so that <hi rend="italic">e</hi> may approach more nearly to
                    equality with E. The field magnets of motors, like those of dynamos, may be
                    wound with coils in series with the armature coil, or with coils forming a shunt
                    to the armature, or with a combination of both. A very important part of the
                    theory deals with the automatic regulation of speed by the use of compound
                    winding. In a paper of fundamental importance with regard to this part of the
                    subject, Messrs Ayrton and Perry<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Electromotors and their Government,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jour. Soc. Tel. Eng.,</hi> 1883.</p></note> have shown that a motor may be made
                    to run <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n516/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0516-0497"/> at constant speed under varying loads when the
                    external electromotive force is constant, provided that a differential
                    combination of direct shunt and reverse series winding be employed,—the shunt
                    coil serving to energize the magnets and the series coil to reduce their
                    magnetism to a certain extent when the current in the armature is increased. The
                    proportion of series to shunt winding necessary for this result depends on the
                    relation of the resistance of the armature to that of the shunt coil, and it is
                    an easy deduction from the theory that, when the resistance of the armature is
                    negligibly small, the speed of a simple shunt-wound motor driven by means of a
                    constant external electromotive force is sensibly constant, a result which has
                    been experimentally demonstrated by Mr Mordey <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Mag.,</hi> Jan. 1886). It is shown in the same paper that a similar means of
                    governing may be used when the current passing through the motor is kept
                    constant, instead of the external electromotive force. The principle of
                    differential compound winding to secure automatic regulation of speed has been
                    applied in several American motors, notably by Mr Sprague.</p>
