                    building of the highest ecclesiological importance, unique in Europe as a
                    perfect example of the arrangement of the choir in the 6th or 7th century, when
                    the original cathedral was built, and, though most of the upper structure was
                    rebuilt by Bishop Orseolo<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Son of the Venetian doge Pietro Orseolo I.</p></note> about 1008, the plan
                    of the church and the fittings of the choir still exist as they were originally
                    designed. The church consists of a nave, with ten bays of arches on marble
                    monoliths, and three aisles each terminated by an apse. Round the walls of the
                    central apse are six tiers of seats for the officiating clergy, and, in the
                    centre, raised above the others, a marble throne for the bishop, approached by a
                    flight of steps (see vol.</p>

                <p>iii. p. 418, fig. 16). The high altar stood in front of the steps, and the
                    celebrant stood with his back to the apse, looking over the altar towards the
                    congregation. An exactly similar arrangement still exists in many of the early
                    Coptic churches of Old Cairo: the church of Abu Sergeh is a specially perfect
                    example.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Middleton
                    in <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia,</hi> vol. xlviii. p. 398.</p></note> When the
                    church was reconstructed in 1008, Bishop Orseolo did not interfere with the
                    older and then obsolete arrangements of the choir, but added a later choir,
                    formed by marble screens, projecting three bays into the nave, with seats along
                    three sides of the enclosure,—an arrangement like that which still exists in the
                    church of S. Clemente in Rome (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome,</hi> voh <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">xx.</hi> p. 833). The present choir-stalls date from the 15th
                    century. A fine marble ambo was at the same time placed outside the cancelli,
                    and the position of the celebrant at the high altar was reversed. The vaults of
                    the three apses are covered with fine glass mosaics, added probably in the 12th
                    century: in the centre is a large figure of the Virgin, with the twelve apostles
                    below; other mosaics cover the vaults of the aisle-apses and the whole entrance
                    wall. The latter, much restored, has scenes of the Crucifixion, the Doom, and
                    Heaven and Hell. The sculpture of the nave capitals and on the marble cancelli
                    is very graceful work of Byzantine style, closely resembling similar panels at
                    Ravenna. One remarkable peculiarity of this church is the marble shutter which
                    closes each window on the right wall; these have pivots which revolve in
                    projecting corbels—a very early method of closing windows of which very few
                    examples still exist. Even when the shutters were closed some dim light passed
                    through the semitranslucent marble slabs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Similar marble slabs, not made to move, still exist in the
                    apse windows of S. Miniato, near Florence, and once existed in the basilica of
                    S. Lorenzo fnori le Mura, Rome.</p></note> An octagonal baptistery, also built
                    by Bishop Orseolo, stood outside the main entrance to the church, but has been
                    rebuilt on a smaller scale. The crypt under the central apse of the cathedral is
                    probably part of the original church, unaltered by any later changes.<note

                    Istria, a work of the 6th century, much resembles the cathedral of Torcello (see
                    vol. iii. p. 418, fig. 17). Similar plans are also to be seen in many of the
                    early churches of Syria (see De Vogiié, <hi rend="italic">Syrie Centrale,</hi>
                    Paris, 1865) as well as in the Coptic churches of Egypt.</p></note> The small
                    church of S. Fosca, which is connected with the cathedral by a loggia, is also a
                    building of exceptional interest, dating from the 10th century. It is purely
                    Oriental in plan, and much resembles that of St Mark’s at Venice and S. Vitale
                    at Ravenna, on a small scale. It has a cruciform nave, with a large dome
                    supported on eight columns, and a projecting choir with three apses. Externally
                    it is surrounded by a loggia, supported on marble columns with rich Byzantine
                    capitals. S. Fosca was partially rebuilt in the 12th century, and has since been
                    much modernized, but its original very interesting plan still remains but little
                    changed.</p>
