                <p><label type="entry">THULE</label> was the name given by Greek and Roman
                    geographers to a land situated to the north of Britain, which they believed to
                    be the most northerly portion of Europe, or indeed of the known world. The first
                    writer who mentioned the name was Pytheas of Massilia, whose statements
                    concerning it have been already given under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Pytheas.</hi> But it is impossible for us to determine with certainty what
                    those statements, which have only been transmitted to us at second or third
                    hand, really were, and still more so what was their real signification. It is
                    almost certain that Pytheas did not himself profess to have visited Thule, but
                    had only vaguely heard of its existence, as a land of unknown extent, situated,
                    according to the information he had received, six days’ voyage to the north of
                    Britain. This account was adopted by Eratosthenes (though rejected by Polybius
                    and Strabo), and accordingly this unknown land became a cardinal point in the
                    systems of many ancient geographers, as the northern limit of the known world.
                    Nothing more was learnt concerning it until the Romans under Agricola (about 84
                    A.D.) accomplished the circumnavigation of the northern point of Britain, and
                    not only visited, but according to Tacitus subdued, the Orcades or Orkney
                    Islands. On this occasion, the historian tells us, they caught sight also of
                        Thule,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Dispecta est
                            et Thule,” Tac., <hi rend="italic">Auric.,</hi> c. 10.</p></note> which
                    in this instance could only mean the group of the Shetland Islands. No further
                    account of this mysterious land is found in any ancient author, except vague
                    statements, derived from Pytheas, but mostly in an inaccurate and distorted
                    form, concerning its position and the astronomical phenomena resulting from this
                    cause. It is probable that what Pytheas really reported was that at the summer
                    solsticer the days were twenty-four hours in length, and conversely at the
                    winter solstice the nights were of equal duration, a statement which would
                    indicate the notion of its position in about 66° N. lat., or under what we now
                    call the Arctic Circle. The skill of Pytheas as an astronomer would have been
                    quite sufficient to lead him to the conclusion that this would be the case at
                    some point in proceeding northwards, and the rapid changes in this respect that
                    would be reported to him by any navigators that had really followed the shores
                    of Britain to any considerable extent in that direction would confirm him in the
                    correctness of his views. He had, too, a very exaggerated notion of the extent
                    of Britain (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pytheas),</hi> and hence he would be led to
                    place an island which was six days’ voyage to the north of it much nearer to the
                    Arctic Circle than its true position.</p>
                <p>The statement of Pytheas on this point appears to have obtained almost universal
                    belief until the time of Marinus of Tyre and his successor Ptolemy, who were
                    led—apparently from their knowledge that the group of islands to which the name
                    of Thule had been applied by the Romans was really not very far distant from the
                    Orcades—to bring down its position considerably more to the south, so that
                    Ptolemy places the island of Thule, which he still regards as the most northerly
                    point of Europe, in only 63° N. lat. Unfortunately this more reasonable view has
                    been discarded by many modern writers, who have gone back to the statements of
                    Pytheas concerning the length of the day, and have in consequence insisted upon
                    placing Thule within the Arctic Circle, and have thus been led to identify it
                    with Iceland. The improbability of such an hypothesis, when we consider the
                    state of ancient navigation, is in itself a sufficient refutation, and there
                    appears no reasonable doubt that the Thule of Pytheas, like that of the Romans
                    and of Ptolemy, was merely an exaggerated and somewhat erroneous conception of
                    the large group of the Shetland Islands, of which the principal, called
                    Mainland, is in fact so predominant that the whole may well have been considered
                    as one large island rather than a scattered group like the Orkneys. If we might
                    trust to the accuracy of Strabo’s quotation (ii. 5, p. 114), that Pytheas called
                    Thule “the mos&lt; northerly of the British Islands,” this would be decisive on
                    the point; but unfortunately the <hi rend="italic">verbal</hi> accuracy of such
                    references by ancient writers can seldom be relied on, and Strabo had evidently
                    never seen Pytheas’s original work.</p>
                <p>It appears, however, to be certain that Iceland was really visited by some Irish
                    monks long before its discovery by the Northmen, and is described under the name
                    of Thule by a writer named Dicuil, himself an Irish monk, who wrote in the first
                    half of the <pb break="no"

                    doubt that his statements really refer to that extensive but remote island. See
