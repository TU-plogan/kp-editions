                <p><label type="entry">TALLOW</label> is the solid oil or fat of ruminant animals,
                    but commercially it is almost exclusively obtained from oxen and sheep. The fat
                    is distributed throughout the entire animal structure; but it accumulates in
                    large quantities as “suet” in the body cavity, and it is from such suet that
                    tallow is principally melted or rendered. The various methods by which tallow
                    and other animal fats are separated and purified have been dealt with under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Oils</hi> (see vol. xvii. p. 743). In commerce ox tallow
                    and sheep tallow are generally distinguished from each other, although much
                    nondescript animal fat is also found in the market. Ox tallow occurs at ordinary
                    temperatures as a solid hard fat having a yellowish white colour; when fresh and
                    new it has scarcely any taste or smell; but it soon acquires a distinct odour
                    and readily becomes rancid. The fat is insoluble in cold alcohol, but it
                    dissolves in boiling spirit of 0 ’ 822 sp. gr. in chloroform, ether, and the
                    essential oils. The hardness of tallow and its melting-point are to some extent
                    affected by the food, age, state of health, &amp;c., of the animal yielding it,
                    the firmest ox tallow being obtained in certain provinces of Russia, where for a
                    great part of the year the oxen are fed on hay. New tallow melts at from 42 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 5 to 43° C., old tallow at 43° ’ 5, <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n44/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0044-0035"/> and the melted fat remains liquid till its
                    temperature falls to 33° or 34° C. Tallow consists of a mixture of two-thirds of
                    the solid fats palmitin and stearin, with one-third of the liquid fat olein. A
                    fluid oil known as tallow oil is obtained from solid tallow by the separation by
                    pressure of the greater part of the olein. To facilitate the separation of the
                    olein, tallow is first melted and just before resolidifying it is mixed with
                    about 10 per cent, of benzene or petroleum spirit. The mixture is then allowed
                    to solidify in flat cakes or slabs, which are placed in press bags and piled
                    between iron plates in a hydraulic press. On the application of pressure the
                    olein mixed with the solvent hydrocarbon flows freely out, leaving a hard dense
                    cake of stearin and palmitin in the bags. The volatile solvents are subsequently
                    driven off by blowing steam through the oil, which remains a turbid fatty fluid
                    from the proportion of solid fats it carries over with it from the hydraulic
                    press. Tallow oil is a useful lubricant and a valuable material for fine soap
                    making, but it is not now abundantly prepared. Mutton tallow differs in several
                    respects from that obtained from oxen. It is whiter in colour and harder, and
                    contains only about 30 per cent, of olein. Newly rendered it has little taste or
                    smell, but on exposure it quickly acquires characteristic qualities and becomes
                    rancid. Sweet mutton tallow melts at 46° and solidifies at 36° C.; when old it
                    does not melt under 49°, and becomes solid on reaching 44° or 45° C. It is
                    sparingly soluble in cold ether and in boiling spirit of 0’822 sp. gr.</p>
                <p>In early times tallow was a most important candle-making substance, and candles
                    made from this material are still consumed in no inconsiderable quantity, but
                    the greater proportion of the supply is now absorbed by the soap trade; the
                    artificial butter trade which has sprung up since 1872 also takes up large
                    quantities of sweet tallow. Tallow is further used extensively as a lubricant
                    and in leather dressing, &amp;c. It is of course a product of all cattle aud
                    sheep-rearing countries, and it forms an important article of export from the
                    United States, the Argentine Republic, and the Australian colonies. Till within
                    the last quarter of a century Russia supplied nearly all the tallow imported
                    into the United Kingdom; but now the imports from that source are on the most
                    meagre scale, although Russian P. Y. C. (pale yellow candle) continues to
                    represent the finest commercial brand.</p>
