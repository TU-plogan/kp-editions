                <p><label type="entry">TRUST</label>. In Roman and English law alike that legal
                    relation between two or more persons implied in the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >trust</hi> was of comparatively late growth. The trust of English law is
                    probably based upon a combination of the Roman conceptions of <hi rend="italic"
                        >usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum.</hi> To <hi rend="italic"
                        >usus</hi> is perhaps due the name as well as the idea of that right over
                    property, coordinate with the right of the nominal owner, possessed by the
                    person having the use. To <hi rend="italic">fidei-commissum</hi> appears to be
                    due the name as well as the idea of that confidence reposed in another which is
                    the essence of the modern trust. <hi rend="italic">Usus</hi> was in Roman law a
                    personal servitude, or right of one person over the land of another, confined to
                    his personal wants and without the right to the produce and profits which <hi
                        rend="italic">ususfructus</hi> carried. It has little in common with the use
                    of English law but the name and the conception of a dual ownership. The <hi
                        rend="italic">fideicommissum</hi> is more important; see <hi

                <p>707. By the legislation of Justinian the law of <hi rend="italic">legata</hi> was
                    practically assimilated to that of <hi rend="italic">fideicommissa.</hi> The
                    only thing that distinguished the one from the other was the mode in which the
                    gift was made: if by words of direct bequest, it was a <hi rend="italic"
                        >legatum,</hi> if by precatory words, a <hi rend="italic"
                        >fideicommissum.</hi> It may be noticed, as an illustration of the course
                    afterwards taken by the law in England, that <hi rend="italic"
                        >fideicommissa</hi> in favour of the church were so far favoured over others
                    that if paid over by mistake they could not be recovered. In addition to <hi
                        rend="italic">usus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum,</hi> the Roman
                    division of ownership into quiritary and bonitary (to use words invented at a
                    later time) may perhaps to some extent have suggested the English division into
                    legal and equitable estate. The two kinds of ownership were amalgamated by
                    Justinian. Legal and equitable estate are still distinct in England, though
                    attempts have been made in the direction of amalgamation. The gradual manner in
                    which the beneficiary became subject to the burdens attaching to the property of
                    which he enjoyed the benefit was a feature common to both the Roman and the
                    English system.</p>

                    been the invention of ecclesiastics well acquainted with Roman law, the object
                    being to escape the provisions of the laws against <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Mortmain</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> by obtaining the conveyance of
                    an estate to a friend on the understanding that they should retain the use, <hi

                    were soon extended to other purposes. They were found valuable for the defeat of
                    creditors, the avoiding of attainder, and the charging of portions. A use had
                    also the advantage of being free from the incidents of feudal tenure: it could
                    be alienated <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> by secret conveyance, and could
                    be devised by will. In many cases the feoffee<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Feoffment, though the usual, was not the
                            only mode of conveyance to uses. The preamble of the Statute of Uses

                    as he was called, or the person seised to the use of another, seems to have been
                    specially chosen on account of his rank and station, which would enable him to
                    defy the common law and protect the estate of his <hi rend="italic">cestui que
                        use,</hi> or the person entitled to the beneficial enjoyment. The Act of 1
                    Ric. II. c. 9 was directed against the choice of such persons. This alienation
                    of land in use was looked upon with great disfavour by the common law courts, in
                    whose eyes the cestui que use was only a tenant at will. Possibly the ground of
                    their refusal to recognize uses was that the assizes of the king’s court could
                    only be granted to persons who stood in a feudal relation to the king. The
                    denial of the right followed the denial of the remedy. The use was on the other
                    hand supported by the Court of Chancery, and execution of the confidence reposed
                    in the feoffee to uses was enforced by the court in virtue of the general
                    jurisdiction which as a court of conscience it claimed to exercise over breach
                    of faith. Jurisdiction was no doubt the more readily assumed by ecclesiastical
                    judges in favour of a system by which the church was generally the gainer. A
                    double ownership of land thus gradually arose, the nominal and ostensible
                    ownership,—the only one acknowledged in the courts of common law,—and the
                    beneficial ownership protected by the Court of Chancery. The reign of Henry V.
                    to a great extent corresponds with that of Augustus at Rome, as the point of
                    time at which legal recognition was given to what had previously been binding
                    only in honour. The means of bringing the feoffee to uses before the court was
                    the writ of <hi rend="italic">subpoena,</hi> said to have been invented by John
                    de Waltham, bishop of Salisbury and master of the rolls in the reign of Richard
                    II. By means of this writ the feoffee to uses could be compelled to answer on
                    oath the claim of his cestui que use. The doctrine of the Court of Chancery as
                    to the execution of a use varied according as there was transmutation of
                    possession or not. In the former case it was unnecessary to prove consideration;
                    in the latter, generally a case of bargain and sale, the court would not enforce
                    the use unless it was executed in law,—that is, unless there was a valuable
                    consideration, even of the smallest amount. Where no consideration could be
                    proved or implied, the use resulted to the feoffor. This theory led to the
                    insertion up to a recent date in deeds (especially in the lease of the lease and
                    release period of conveyancing) of a nominal consideration, generally five
                    shillings. Lands either in possession, reversion, or remainder could be granted
                    in use. Most persons could be feoffees to uses. The king and corporations
                    aggregate were, however, exceptions, and were entitled to hold the lands
                    discharged of the use. On the accession of Richard III., who from his position
                    of authority had been a favourite feoffee, it was necessary to pass a special
                    Act (1 Ric. III. c. 5), vesting the lands of which he had been feoffee either in
                    his co-feoffees or, in the absence of cofeoffees, in the cestui que use. The
                    practical convenience of uses was so obvious that it is said that by the reign
                    of Henry VII. most of the land in the kingdom was held in use. The freedom of
                    uses from liability to forfeiture for treason must have led to their general
                    adoption during the Wars of the Roses.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The use, as in later times the trust, was, however,
                            forfeited to the crown on attainder of the feoffee or trustee for
                            treason.</p></note> The secrecy with which a use could be transferred,
                    contrary as it was to the publicity required for livery of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Seisin (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> at common law, led to the
                    interference of the legislature on several occasions between the reigns of
                    Richard II. and Henry VIII., the general tendency of the legislation being to
                    make the cestui que use more and more subject to the burdens incident to the
                    ownership of land. One of the most important statutes was the Statute of
                    Mortmain (15 Ric. II. c. 5), forbidding evasion of the Statute <hi rend="italic"
                        >De Religiosis</hi> of Edward I. by means of feoffments to uses. Other Acts
                    enabled the cestui que use to transfer the use without the concurrence of the
                    feoffee to uses (1 Ric. III. c. 1), made a writ of <hi rend="italic"
                        >formedon</hi> maintainable against him (1 Hen. VII. c. 1), rendered his
                    heir liable to wardship and relief (4 Hen. VII. c. 17), and his lands liable to
                    execution (19 Hen. VII. c. 15). At length in 1535 the famous Statute of Uses (27
                    Hen. VIII. c. 10) was passed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>It was adopted in Ireland exactly a century later by 10
                            Car. I. c. 1 (Ir.). The law of uses and trusts in Ireland is practically
                            the same as that in England, the main differences being in procedure
                            rather than in substantive law.</p></note> The preamble of the statute
                    enumerates the mischiefs which it was considered that the universal prevalence
                    of uses had occasioned, among others that by fraudulent feoffments, fines,
                    recoveries, and other like assurances to uses, confidences, and trusts lords
                    lost their feudal aids, men their tenancies by the curtesy, women their dower,
                    manifest perjuries in trials were committed, the king lost the profits of the
                    lands of persons attainted or enfeoffed to the use of aliens, and the king and
                    lords their rights of year, day, and waste, and of escheats of felons’ lands. To
                    remedy this state of things it was enacted, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi>
                    that, where any person was seised of any hereditaments to the use, confidence,
                    or trust of any other person by any means, the person having such use,
                    confidence, or trust should be seised, deemed, and adjudged in lawful seisin,
                    estate, and possession of such hereditaments. Full legal remedies were given to
                    the cestui que use by the statute. He was enabled to distrain for a rent charge,
                    to have action, entry, condition, &amp;c. The effect of this enactment was to
                    make the cestui que use the owner at law as well as in equity (as had been done
                    once before under the exceptional circumstances which led to 1 Ric. III. c. 5),
                    provided that the use was one which before the statute would have been enforced
                    by the Court of Chancery. For some time after the passing of the statute an
                    equitable as distinct from a legal estate did not exist. But the somewhat narrow
                    construction of the statute by the common law courts in Tyrrel's case<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dyer’s <hi rend="italic"
                                >Reports,</hi> 155a.</p></note> (1557) enabled estates cognizable
                    only in equity to be again created. In that case it was held that a use upon a
                    use could not be executed; therefore in a feoffment to A and his heirs to the
                    use of B and his heirs to the use of C and his heirs only the first use was
                    executed by the statute. The use of B being executed in him, that of C was not
                    acknowledged by the common law judges; but equity regarded C as beneficially
                    entitled, and his interest as an equitable estate held for him in trust,
                    corresponding to that which B would have had before the statute. The position
                    taken by the Court of Chancery in trusts may be compared with that taken in <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mortgage</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). The Judicature
                    Act, 1873, while not going as far as the Statute of Uses and combining the legal
                    and equitable estates, makes equitable rights cognizable in all courts. From the
                    decision in Tyrrel's case dates the whole modern law of uses and trusts. In
                    modern legal language use is restricted to the creation of legal estate under
                    the Statute of Uses, trust is confined to the equitable estate of the cestui que
                    trust or beneficiary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uses since 1535.—</hi> The Statute of Uses is still the basis
                    of conveyancing. A grant in a deed is still, after the alterations in the law
                    made by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, made “to and to the use of A.” The statute
                    does not, however, apply indiscriminately to all cases, as only certain uses are
                    executed by it. It does not apply to leaseholds or copyholds, or to cases where
                    the grantee to uses is anything more than a mere passive instrument, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.</hi>, where there is any direction to him to sell the
                    property. The seisin, too, to be executed by the statute, must be in another
                    than him who has the use, for where A is seised to the use of A it is a common
                    law giant. The difference is important as far as regards the doctrine of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Possession (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> Constructive
                    possession is given by a deed operating under the statute even before entry, but
                    not by a common law grant (at any rate sufficient to entitle the grantee to be
                    registered as a voter), until actual receipt of rent by the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n618/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0618-0597"/> grantee. The operation of the Statute of Uses
                    was supplemented by the Statute of Inrolments and that of Wills. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Will.)</hi> The Statute of Inrolments (27 Hem VIII. c. 16)
                    enacted that no bargain and sale should pass a freehold unless by deed indented
                    and inrolled within six months after its date in one of the courts at
                    Westminster or with the <hi rend="italic">custos rotulorum</hi> of the county.
                    As the statute referred only to freeholds, a bargain and sale of a leasehold
                    interest passed without inrolment. Conveyancers took advantage of this omission
                    (whether intentional or not) in the Act, and the practical effect of it was to
                    introduce a mode of secret alienation of real property, the lease and release,
                    which was the general form of conveyance up to 1845. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Real Estate, Sale.)</hi> Thus the publicity of transfer, which it was the
                    special object of the Statute of Uses to effect, was almost at once defeated. In
                    addition to the grant to uses there were other modes of conveyance under the
                    statute which are now obsolete in practice, viz., the covenant to stand seised
                    and the bargain and sale. Under the statute, as before it, the use has been
                    found a valuable means of limiting a remainder to the person creating the use
                    and of making an estate take effect in derogation of a former estate by means of
                    a shifting or springing use. At common law a freehold could not be made to
                    commence <hi rend="italic">in futuro</hi>; but this end may be attained by a
                    shifting use, such as a grant (common in marriage settlements) to A to the use
                    of B in fee simple until a marriage, and after the celebration of the marriage
                    to other uses. An example of a springing use would be a grant to A to such uses
                    as B should appoint and in default of and until appointment to C in fee simple.
                    The difficulty of deciding where the seisin was during the suspension of the use
                    led to the invention of the old theory of <hi rend="italic">scintilla
                        juris,</hi> or continued possibility of seisin in the grantee to uses. This
                    theory was abolished by 23 and 24 Vict. c. 38, which enacted that all uses
                    should take effect by force of the estate and seisin originally vested in the
                    person seised to the uses. The most frequent instances of a springing use are
                    powers of appointment, usual in wills and settlements. There has been much
                    legislation on the subject of powers, the main effect of which has been to give
                    greater facilities for their execution, release, or abandonment, to aid their
                    defective execution, and to abolish the old doctrine of illusory
                    appointments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trusts.—</hi> A trust in English law is defined by Mr Lewin,
                    adopting Coke’s definition of a use, as “a confidence reposed in some other, not
                    issuing out of the land, but as a thing collateral, annexed in privity to the
                    estate of the land, and to the person touching the land, for which <hi
                        rend="italic">cestui que trust</hi> has no remedy but by <hi rend="italic"
                        >subpoena</hi> in Chancery.” The term <hi rend="italic">trust</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">trust estate</hi> is also used to denote the beneficial
                    interest of the cestui que trust. The term <hi rend="italic">truster</hi> is not
                    used, as it is in Scotland, to denote the creator of the trust. A trust has some
                    features in common with <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.)</hi>; but the great difference between them is that a contract can
                    only be enforced by a party or one in the position of a party to it, while a
                    trust can be, and generally is, enforced by one not a party to its creation. It
                    has more resemblance to <hi rend="italic">fideicommissum.</hi> But the latter
                    could only be created by a testamentary instrument, while a trust can be created
                    either by will or <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi>; nor was there any trace in
                    Roman law of that permanent legal relation which is suggested by the position of
                    trustee and cestui que trust. The heir, too, in Roman law was entitled, from 70
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> to the reign of Justinian, to one-fourth of a
                        <hi rend="italic">hereditas fideicommissaria</hi> as against the
                    beneficiary, while the very essence of the trust is its gratuitous character.
                    Trusts may be divided in more than one way, according to the ground taken as the
                    basis of division. One division, and perhaps the oldest, as it rests on the
                    authority of Bacon, is into <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >special,</hi> the first being where the trust is simply vested in a trustee
                    and the nature of the trust left to construction of law, the second where there
                    is an act to be performed by the trustee. Another division is into <hi
                        rend="italic">lawful</hi> and <hi rend="italic">unlawful,</hi> and
                    corresponds to Bacon’s division into intents or confidences and frauds, covins,
                    or collusions. A third division is into <hi rend="italic">public</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">private,</hi> the former being synonymous with charitable
                    trusts. A division often adopted in modern text-books and recognized by
                    parliament in the Trustee Act, 1850, is into <hi rend="italic">express,
                        implied,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">constructive.</hi> An express trust is
                    determined by the person creating it. It may be either <hi rend="italic"
                        >executed</hi> or <hi rend="italic">executory,</hi> the former where the
                    limitations of the equitable interest are complete and final, the latter where
                    such limitations are intended to serve merely as minutes for perfecting the
                    settlement at some future period, as in the case of marriage articles drawn up
                    as a basis of a marriage settlement to be in conformity with them. An implied
                    trust is founded upon the intention of the person creating it; examples of it
                    are a resulting trust, a precatory trust, and the trust held by the vendor on
                    behalf of the purchaser of an estate after contract and before conveyance. In
                    this case the vendor is sometimes called a trustee <hi rend="italic">sub
                        modo</hi> and the purchaser a cestui que trust <hi rend="italic">sub
                        modo.</hi> A constructive trust is judicially created from a consideration
                    of a person’s conduct in order to satisfy the demands of justice, without
                    reference to intention. The distinction between an implied and a constructive
                    trust is not always very consistently maintained. Thus the position of a vendor
                    towards a purchaser after contract is sometimes called a constructive trust. The
                    present law governing trusts rests upon the doctrines of equity as altered by
                    legislation. Its great importance has led to its becoming one of the most highly
                    developed departments of equity. The devolution of successive interests in wills
                    and settlements is almost wholly attained by means of trusts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Who may be a Trustee or Cestui que Trust.—</hi> The modern
                    trust is considerably more extensive in its operation than the ancient use. Thus
                    the crown and corporations aggregate can be trustees, and personalty can be held
                    in trust Provision is made by the Municipal Corporations Act, 1882, for the
                    administration of charitable and special trusts by municipal corporations. The
                    crown does not appear to be a trustee to as complete a degree as a subject may
                    be. Unsuccessful attempts have recently been made to impress the crown, or a
                    secretary of state as agent of the crown, with trusts of funds voted by
                    parliament for the public service, of booty of war granted by royal warrant, and
                    of money paid over by a foreign state in pursuance of a treaty. There are
                    certain persons who for obvious reasons, even if not legally disqualified, ought
                    not to be appointed trustees. Such are infants, lunatics, persons domiciled
                    abroad, felons, bankrupts, and <hi rend="italic">cestuis que trustent.</hi> The
                    appointment of any such person, or the falling of any existing trustee into such
                    a position, is generally ground for application to the court for appointment of
                    a new trustee in his place. Any one may be a cestui que trust except a
                    corporation aggregate, which cannot be a cestui que trust of real estate without
                    a licence from the crown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Creation and Extinction of the Trust.—</hi> A trust may be
                    created either by act of a party or by operation of law. Where a trust is
                    created by act of a party, the creation at common law need not be in writing.
                    The Statute of Frauds (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Fraud)</hi> altered the common
                    law by enacting that all declarations or creations of trusts or confidences of
                    any lands, tenements, or hereditaments shall be manifested and proved by some
                    writing, signed by the party who is by law enabled to declare such trust, or by
                    his last will in writing, or else they shall be utterly void and of none effect.
                    Trusts arising or resulting by implication or construction of law are excepted,
                    and it has been held that the statute applies only to real estate and chattels
                    real, so that a trust of personal chattels may still be declared by parol. The
                    declaration of a trust by the crown must be by letters patent. Trusts created by
                    will must conform to the requirements of the Wills Act (see W <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">ill).</hi> Except in the case of charitable trusts, the
                    cestui que trust must be a definite person. A trust, for instance, merely for
                    keeping up family tombs is void. Alteration of the trust estate by appointment
                    of a new trustee could up to 1860 only be made where the instrument creating the
                    trust gave a power to so appoint, or by order of the Court of Chancery. But now
                    by the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (superseding Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1860), the
                    surviving or continuing trustee or trustees, or the personal representative of
                    the last surviving or continuing trustee, may nominate in writing a new trustee
                    or new trustees. On such appointment the number of trustees may be increased.
                    Existing trustees may by deed consent to the discharge of a trustee wishing to
                    retire. Trust property may be vested in new or continuing trustees by a simple
                    declaration to that effect. By the Conveyancing Act, 1882, a separate set of
                    trustees may be appointed for any part of the property held on distinct trusts.
                    Trusts created by operation of law are either those which are the effect of the
                    application of rules of equity or those which have been constituted by a
                    judicial authority. They include resulting and constructive trusts. A resulting
                    trust is a species of implied trust, and consists of so much of the equitable
                    interest as is undisposed of by the instrument creating the trust, which is said
                    to result to the creator and his representatives. An example is the purchase of
                    an estate in the. name of the purchaser and others, or of others only. Here the
                    beneficial interest is the purchaser’s. An example of a constructive trust is a
                    renewal of a lease by a trustee in his own name, where the trustee is held to be
                    constructively a trustee for those interested in the beneficial term. An
                    instance of a constructive trust upon which the courts have often been called
                    upon to decide is the fiduciary relation between the promoter of a proposed
                    joint-stock company and the members of the company when formed. The other trusts
                    falling under the head of trusts by operation of law would be those imposed upon
                    a trustee by order of a court, even though they are imposed in pursuance of
                    provisions contained in a trust created by a party. Such would be the trusts
                    which have come within the cognizance of the court by virtue of the Trustee Act,
                    1850, or in any other way. The powers of the court over trusts have been much
                    extended by legislation. The Act of 1850 (13 and 14 Vict. c. 60) enabled the
                    Court of Chancery to appoint new trustees where expedient, and to make vesting
                    orders in many cases where such orders could not previously have been made, as
                    where a trustee was a lunatic, or an infant, or refused to convey. This Act was
                    extended by the Trustee Extension Act, 1852 (15 and 16 Vict. c. 55). By the
                    Conveyancing Act, 1881, a trustee appointed by the Chancery Division is to have
                    the same powers as if he had been originally appointed a trustee by the
                    instrument creating the trust. The Bankruptcy Act, 1883, enables the court to
                    appoint a new trustee in the place of a bankrupt trustee. Besides<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0619-0598"/> being duly created, it is necessary for the
                    validity of the trust that it should be a lawful one. An unlawful trust is one
                    which contravenes the policy of the law in any respect. Examples of such trusts
                    are trusts for a corporation without licence, for a perpetuity, and for purposes
                    subversive of morality, such as trusts for illegitimate children to be hereafter
                    born. Superstitious uses (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Roman Catholic Church,</hi>
                    vol. xx. p. 632) also fall under this head. There are also certain trusts which
                    are avoided by statute under particular circumstances, such as settlements in
                    fraud of creditors (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bankruptcy, Settlement).</hi> The
                    law cannot be evaded by attempting to constitute a secret trust for an unlawful
                    purpose. If an estate be devised by words <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                    carrying the beneficial interest, with an understanding that the devisee will
                    hold the estate in trust for such a purpose, he may be compelled to answer as to
                    the secret trust, and on acknowledgment or proof of it there will be a resulting
                    trust to the heir-at-law. In the case of an advowson suspected to be held for
                    the benefit of a Roman Catholic patron, there is a special enactment to the same
                    effect (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Quare Impedit).</hi> The rales of equity in
                    charitable trusts (which include all those mentioned in the preamble to 43 Eliz.

                    private trusts. Charitable trusts must be lawful, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    they must not contravene the Statutes of Mortmain; but a wider latitude of
                    construction is allowed in order to carry out the intentions of the founder, and
                    they will not be allowed to fail for want or uncertainty of objects to be
                    benefited. The court, applying the doctrine of <hi rend="italic">cy près,</hi>
                    will, on failure of the original ground of the charity, apply the funds as
                    nearly as possible in the same manner. On this principle gifts originally made
                    for purely charitable purposes have been extended to educational purposes.
                    Further, trustees of a charity may act by a majority, but ordinary trustees
                    cannot by the act of a majority (unless specially empowered so to do) bind a
                    dissenting minority or the trust property. A trust estate is subject as far as
                    possible to the rales of law applicable to a legal estate of a corresponding
                    nature, in pursuance of the maxim, “Equity follows the law.” Thus trust property
                    is assets for payment of debts, may be taken in execution, passes to creditors
                    in bankruptcy, and is subject to dower and curtesy, to the rules against
                    perpetuities, and to the Statutes of Limitation. This assimilation of the legal
                    and equitable estates has been produced partly by judicial decisions, partly by
                    legislation. A trust is extinguished, as it is created, either by act of a party
                    or by operation of law. An example of the former mode of extinction is a release
                    by deed, the general means of discharge of a trustee when the purposes of the
                    trust have been accomplished. Extinction by operation of law takes place when
                    there is a failure of the objects of the trust: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> if
                    the cestui que trust die intestate without heirs or next of kin, the trustee
                    retains the property discharged of the trust if it be real estate, if it be
                    personalty it falls to the crown. Equitable interests in real estate abroad are
                    as a rule subject to the <hi rend="italic">lex loci rei sitae,</hi> and an
                    English court has no jurisdiction to enforce a trust or settle a scheme for the
                    administration of a charity in a foreign country. An English court has, however,
                    jurisdiction to administer the trusts of a will as to the whole real and
                    personal estate of a testator, even though only a very small part of the estate,
                    and that wholly personal, is in England. This was decided by the House of Lords
                    in a well-known case in 1883.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        rend="italic">Rights and Duties of the Trustee.—</hi> The principal general
                    properties of the office of trustee, as given by Mr Lewin, are these :—(1) A
                    trustee having once accepted the trust cannot afterwards renounce. (2) He cannot
                    delegate it. (3) In the case of co-trustees the office must be exercised by all
                    the trustees jointly. (4) On the death of one trustee there is survivorship:
                    that is, the trust will pass to the survivors or survivor. (5) One trustee shall
                    not be liable for the acts of his co-trustee. (6) A trustee shall derive no
                    personal benefit from the trusteeship. The office cannot be renounced or
                    delegated, because it is one of personal confidence. It can, however, be
                    resigned, and recent legislation, as has been already stated, lias given a
                    retiring trustee large powers of appointing a successor. In the case of the
                    death of a single or last surviving trustee of real estate, the trust estate by
                    the Conveyancing Act, 1881, now devolves upon his personal representative
                    instead of upon his heir or devisee. The liability of one trustee for the acts
                    or defaults of another often raises very difficult questions. A difference is
                    made between trustees and executors. An executor is liable for joining in a
                    receipt <hi rend="italic">pro forma, as</hi> it is not necessary for him to do
                    so, one executor having authority to act without his co-executor; a trustee can
                    show that he only joined for conformity, and that another received the money. A
                    trustee’s receipt in writing is, under the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (superseding
                    Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1860), a sufficient discharge, and exonerates the
                    person paying from seeing that the money paid is duly applied according to the
                    trast. If one trustee be cognizant of a breach of trust committed by another,
                    and conceal it or do not take active measures to protect the cestui que trust’s
                    interests, he will be liable for the breach of trust. An indemnity clause is now
                    implied by statute in every trust deed, but this does not protect a trustee
                    against liability which would attach at law. A trustee, if he commit a breach of
                    trust at the request of his cestui que trust, may secure himself by an
                    indemnity, provided that the cestui que trust has been fully informed of the
                    facts of the case, and is not under any disability to consent, such as infancy.
                    The rule that a trustee is not to benefit by his office is subject to some
                    exceptions. He may do so if the instrument creating him trustee specially allows
                    him remuneration, as is usually the case where a solicitor is appointed. Where
                    the trust entirely fails, as has been said above, the trustee is indirectly
                    remunerated by his right to retain the trust estate. The main duties of trustees
                    are to place the trust property in a proper state of security, to keep it (if
                    personalty) in safe custody, and to properly invest and distribute it. A trustee
                    must be careful not to place himself in a position where his interest might
                    clash with his duty. As a rule he cannot safely purchase from his cestui que
                    trust while the fiduciary relation exists between them. In all purchases with
                    trust money he is bound to obtain the best price, unless where an Act of
                    Parliament, like the Housing of the Working Classes Act, 1885, specially
                    authorizes sale at an under value. Investments by trustees demand special
                    notice. The general rale is that a trustee must take as much care of the trust
                    property as of his own. He is, therefore, justified in following the usual
                    course of business adopted by prudent men in making investments, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by employing a stock-broker in the ordinary way. At
                    the same time he has not an uncontrolled power of investment, for (unless
                    authorized by the instrument creating the trust) he cannot lend trust money on
                    personal security or invest in shares of a private company. A trustee of shares
                    may be liable as a beneficial owner, even though his name appears on the
                    register of the company as a trustee. By recent legislation trustees, where not
                    expressly forbidden by the instrument creating the trust, have either an
                    absolute or qualified right to invest in certain securities. They have an
                    absolute right to invest in real securities in the United Kingdom (but not on a
                    second mortgage), in charges or mortgages under the Improvement of Land Act,
                    1864, in consols, exchequer bills, or any security the interest whereon is
                    guaranteed by parliament, in Bank of England, Bank of Ireland, East India, and
                    Metropolitan Board of Works stock. They have a qualified power of investment
                    (that is, an extension of powers already given in the instrument) in debentures
                    or debenture stock of railway and other companies, and of corporations and local
                    authorities under the Local Loans Act, 1875, in mortgage debentures under the
                    Mortgage Debenture Acts of 1865 and 1870, and in securities of the Isle of Man
                    Government. Trustees under the Settled Land Act, 1882, have somewhat larger
                    powers as to railway stock. In many cases there are restrictions on investment
                    in stock certificates payable to bearer, although in authorized securities. A
                    power of varying investments is generally implied, though not expressly given by
                    statute, as in Scotland. The duties of trustees in the distribution of trust
                    funds have been made less onerous by the Trustee Relief Acts of 1847 and 1849,
                    which enabled trustees or a majority of them to pay into the Bank of England to
                    the account of the particular trust any moneys belonging to the trust, thus
                    bringing the property within the jurisdiction of the court, from which it can
                    only be obtained on petition. Similar powers were conferred upon trustees of
                    charities by 18 and 19 Vict. c. 124. By more recent Acts (22 and 23 Vict. c. 35,
                    23 and 24 Vict. c. 38) application for advice may be made by a trustee to a
                    judge of the Chancery Division on a petition or summons. The liability of a
                    trustee to his cestui que trust on any claim for property held on an express
                    trust or in respect of breach of such trust is not barred by any statute of
                    limitations, 36 and 37 Vict. c. 66, s. 26 (2). The powers of trustees have
                    lately been considerably extended by the Conveyancing Act, 1881, and the Settled
                    Land Act, 1882, in other matters besides those that have been already noticed.
                    One of the most important of the new powers is that of compounding,
                    compromising, or abandoning claims relating to the trust. For the trustee in
                    bankruptcy, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bankruptcy.</hi> The trustee to preserve
                    contingent remainders, at one time common in conveyancing, has ceased to be

                    to whose office no duties were originally attached, or who, though such duties
                    were attached, would on the requisition of the cestui que trust be compellable
                    to convey the estate to him or by his direction. The term is used in some Acts
                    of Parliament, for instance the Vendor and Purchaser Act, 1874.<note

                    to a great extent deduced from what has been already said as to the correlative
                    duties and rights of the trustee. The cestui que trust has a general right to
                    the due management of the trust property, to proper accounts, and to enjoyment
                    of the profits. He can as a rule only act with the concurrence of the trustee,
                    unless he seeks a remedy against the trustee himself. Thus the trustee must be a
                    party to an action brought in respect of the trust estate, and must join in
                    presenting a petition in bankruptcy on account of a debt <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0620-0599"/> due to the estate, but the cestui que trust
                    on giving indemnity can require the trustee to lend his name as a party. He may
                    also require the trustee to execute conveyances of the legal estate according to
                    his directions. Trust property, if parted with by the trustee in fraud of the
                    trust may be followed by the cestui que trust, even into the hands of a
                    purchaser for value with notice of the trust. The cestui que trust may lose his
                    rights by fraud, by laches, and by concurrence or acquiescence in a breach of
                    trust. Though no lapse of time bars his remedy against the trustee personally,
                    he cannot, by the terms of the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874, recover land
                    or rent vested in a trustee upon an express trust after twelve years from the
                    time when the right accrued or six years after the cesser of any disability. The
                    equitable right of the cestui que trust has sometimes been recognized by statute
                    in cases where it would be manifestly unjust that he should suffer disability by
                    virtue of his having merely an equitable interest. The cestui que trust has the
                    right of voting for members of parliament, and is qualified to serve as a juror.
                    On bankruptcy of the trustee the trust estate is not affected. Nor was it
                    affected even before the Felony Act, 1870, by the conviction and attainder of
                    the trustee for felony. Attainder of the trustee for treason involved, however,
                    forfeiture of a trust estate of inheritance. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Treason.)</hi> The recognition of the cestui que trust as owner is still
                    not complete. Thus no notice of a trust is recognized in certain public
                    documents, as the books of the Bank of England and the registers kept under the
                    Merchant Shipping Act, 1854, the Companies Act, 1862, the Land Transfer Act,
                    1875, and the Colonial Stock Act, 1877.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Procedure.—</hi> This is regulated almost entirely by
                    legislation. Proceedings relating to a trust may be brought in different courts
                    of first instance,—(1) the Chancery Division of the High Court of Justice or the
                    Chancery Court of the County Palatine of Lancaster, (2) a court of bankruptcy,
                    (3) a county court, (4) a criminal court. (1) By the Judicature Act, 1873, § 34,
                    the execution of trusts, charitable or private, is assigned to the Chancery
                    Division. The rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, provide for special indorsement
                    in an action on a trust, for the parties to the action, for interrogatories and
                    pleading, and for proceeding by originating summons. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Summons. )</hi> Forms of pleading are given in the appendix to the rules.
                    An injunction rather than an action may sometimes be the proper remedy, as in
                    the case of threatened breach of trast. The Trustee Relief Acts, the Trustee
                    Act, and Lord St Leonards’s Act of 1859 provide for proceeding by petition or
                    summons. Applications under the Conveyancing Act must be in chambers in the
                    first instance, and so must applications under the Trustee Relief Acts where the
                    money or securities in court do not exceed £1000 or £1000 nominal value. The
                    procedure in charitable trusts differs to some extent from that in use in
                    private trusts. The most usual course of proceeding is by information in the
                    name of the attorney-general. Another mode is by petition under Sir Samuel
                    Romilly’s Act, 52 Geo. III. c. 101, superseding the cumbrous procedure by
                    commission which had been previously in use under 43 Eliz. c. 4. A third mode is
                    under the powers of the Charitable Trusts Acts, the first of which was passed in
                    1853. No proceeding under these Acts can be taken without the authority of the
                    charity commissioners. (2) The equitable debt due from the trustee to the cestui
                    que trust will support a petition in bankruptcy, and is a debt provable in
                    bankruptcy. An order of discharge in bankruptcy does not release the bankrupt
                    from any debt or liability incurred by means of fraudulent breach of trust, nor
                    does it release a co-trustee of the bankrupt. (3) The County Courts Equitable
                    Jurisdiction Act, 1865, confers on county courts the authority of the High Court
                    in the execution of trusts and proceedings under the Trustee Acts where the
                    trust estate does not exceed £500 in amount or value. By the County Courts Act,
                    1867, applications may be made at chambers for transfer to a county court of an
                    action pending in the High Court where the property does not exceed £500 in
                    amount or value. The same Act allows trust funds not exceeding that limit to be
                    paid into the post office savings bank in a county court town in the name of the
                    registrar. A county court has jurisdiction in charitable trusts where the income
                    of a charity does not exceed £50. The county court rules, 1886, contain orders
                    regulating the practice with respect to both private and charitable trusts.
                    Powers similar to those given to county courts in England have been conferred
                    upon the civil bill courts in Ireland. (4) At common law trustees committing a
                    fraudulent breach of trust could not be punished criminally. This was altered by
                    the Fraudulent Trustees Act of 1857, now superseded by the Larceny Act, 1861,
                    under which a trustee on an express trust, whether public or private, created by
                    deed, will, or instrument in writing, who with intent to defraud converts to his
                    own use or benefit or the use or benefit of any other person than the cestui que
                    trust, or for any purpose other than the public or charitable purpose, or
                    otherwise disposes of or destroys such property or any part thereof, is guilty
                    of misdemeanour and punishable with penal servitude for a term not exceeding
                    seven years. No prosecution is to be commenced without the sanction of the
                    attorneygeneral or—where civil proceedings have been already taken against the
                    trustee—without the sanction of the civil court. The offence cannot be
                    prosecuted at quarter sessions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        >Scotland.—</hi> The history of the law differs considerably from that of
                    England, though perhaps the position of the Scotch trustee is now not very
                    different from that of the trustee in England. The Statute of Uses did not apply
                    to Scotland, since neither that nor any similar legislation was necessary in a
                    system in which law and equity were administered by the same tribunals. Trusts
                    seem to have existed from time immemorial, and have been frequently regulated by
                    statute. The policy of the English Statute of Frauds was no doubt intentionally
                    imitated in the Act 1696, c. 25, enacting that no action of declarator of trust
                    should be sustained as to any deed of trust made for thereafter, except upon a
                    declaration or back-bond of trust lawfully subscribed by the person alleged to
                    be trustee and against whom or his heirs or assignees the declarator should be
                    intended, or unless the same were referred to the oath of the party <hi
                        rend="italic">simpliciter.</hi> The Act does not apply to all cases, but
                    only to those in which by the act of parties documents of title are in the name
                    of a trustee, but the beneficial interest in another. The person creating the
                    trust is called the <hi rend="italic">truster,</hi> a term unknown in England.
                    On the other hand the term <hi rend="italic">cestui que trust</hi> is unknown in
                    Scotland. The office of trustee is <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                    gratuitous, as in England, it being considered to fall under the contract of
                    mandate. Some of the main differences between English and Scotch law are these.
                    There is no presumption in Scotland of a resulting trust in favour of a
                    purchaser. A trust which lapses by the failure of a beneficiary goes to the
                    crown as <hi rend="italic">ultimus heres,</hi> not to the trustee. The office of
                    trustee is not a joint office, therefore there is no right of survivorship, and
                    on the death of a trustee the survivors are incompetent to act, unless a certain
                    number be declared or presumed to be a <hi rend="italic">quorum,</hi> or the
                    office be conferred on trustees and the accedors and survivors of them.
                    Sometimes the concurrence of one trustee is rendered absolutely necessary by his
                    being named <hi rend="italic">sine quo non.</hi> The Court of Session may
                    appoint new trustees, but generally appoints a judicial factor. There has been a
                    considerable amount of recent legislation, chiefly in the direction of extending
                    the powers of trustees and of the court, in trust matters. By 24 and 25 Vict. c.
                    84 (amended by 26 and 27 Vict. c. 115) an appointment of gratuitous trustees by
                    deed or local act was to be held to include certain provisions usually included
                    in deeds of appointment, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> powers of resignation and
                    of assumption of new trustees, and provisions that the majority of trustees
                    accepting and surviving should be a <hi rend="italic">quorum,</hi> and that each
                    trustee should only be liable for his own acts and intromissions and should not
                    be liable for omissions. The Trusts Act, 1867 (30 and 31 Vict. c. 97), added to
                    the common law powers of trustees by giving them authority to appoint factors
                    and law agents, to discharge trustees who have resigned, to grant leases for a
                    limited period, to uplift, discharge, or assign debts, to compromise claims, to
                    grant all necessary deeds, and to pay debts due by the truster or the trust
                    estate. It also gave the Court of Session power (exercisable by the lord
                    ordinary in the first instance) beyond what it possessed by its <hi
                        rend="italic">nobile officium,</hi> in cases of expediency, of selling the
                    trust estate, of granting feus or long leases, and of borrowing and excambion.
                    Power was given to trustees to appoint additional trustees by deed of
                    assumption, and where such assumption could not be made the court might appoint.
                    Authority was conferred upon the beneficiary of a lapsed trust to complete title
                    on petition. The powers of investment given to trustees have since been largely
                    increased by the Trusts Amendment Act, 1884. They are now much the same as those
                    allowed in England. The principal differences are that in Scotland there is a
                    statutory power to vary securities, and that statutory investment by a Scotch
                    trustee is not allowed in Bank of Ireland stock or on real security in Ireland.
                    The Titles to Land Consolidation Act, 1868 (31 and 32 Vict. c. 101), contained
                    provisions as to the mode of completing title by a judicial factor on a trust
                    estate and by trustees in sequestration and as to the vesting in trustees of
                    heritable property conveyed for religious or educational purposes. The
                    Conveyancing Act, 1874 (37 and 38 Vict. c. 94), dealt with compositions payable
                    by trustees on the death of a vassal, and with completion of title by the heir
                    of a sole or last surviving trustee, by a successor of an <hi rend="italic">ex
                        officio</hi> trustee, and by trustees where words of conveyance are not
                    expressed to be in favour of such trustees. Forms of documents relating to trust
                    property will be found in Juridical Styles and in the schedules to the Acts of
                    1867, 1868, and 1874. A conveyance in trust may be either absolute with a
                    back-bond or in form a conveyance in trast. A trustee is responsible for the due
                    execution of the trust, subject to the limitations contained in 24 and 25 Vict.
                    c. 84. The provision of the Companies Act, 1862, that no trust is to be entered
                    on the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n621/mode/1up"

                    trustee, a member of a joint-stock company, though entered on the register as a
                    trust disponee, may incur personal liability as a partner, unless the contrary
                    be expressed. Liability under such circumstances was established in the
                    litigation which followed the suspension of the City of Glasgow Bank in
                        1878.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The principal

                    sheriff court has jurisdiction over actions of declarator, relating to questions
                    of heritable right or title, where the value of the subject in dispute does not
                    exceed £50 by the year or £1000 in value (40 and 41 Vict. c. 50). A judicial
                    factor may be appointed by the sheriff court where the yearly value of the
                    estate does not exceed £100 (43 and 44 Vict. c. 4). Fraudulent trustees are
                    criminally liable at common law, not by statutory enactment, as in England.
                    Adjudication on a trust bond is a mode of obtaining the decision of the Court of
                    Session on a bond by a fictitious creditor, for the purpose of giving title to
                    the heir, by preventing his liability to possible passive representation. It is
                    regulated by 1695, c. 24.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    some other States uses and trusts have been abolished (with certain exceptions),
                    and every estate, subject to those exceptions, is deemed a legal right
                    cognizable in courts of law. The exceptions are in New York implied trusts and
                    express trusts to sell land for the benefit of creditors, to sell, mortgage, or
                    lease lands for the benefit of legatees, or for the purpose of satisfying any
                    charge thereon, to receive the rents and profits of lands and apply them to the
                    use of any person during the life of such person or any shorter term, or to
                    receive such rents and profits, and accumulate the same within the limits
                    allowed by the law. Trusts of personalty for public purposes are very generally
                    allowed in States where private trusts do not exist. Provisions similar to those
                    of the English Statute of Frauds have been generally adopted by the States which
                    recognize private trusts. Some States go further than the statute and allow the
                    creation of trusts (other than those arising by implication or operation of law)
                    only by means of will or deed. Where the trust is of real estate, the deed must
                    generally be registered (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Registration).</hi> Forms of
                    deeds of trust are given in the Statutes of Virginia and other States. The
                    English doctrine of <hi rend="italic">cy près</hi> seems to have been adopted
                    only in Pennsylvania. Conveyances in trust for the settlor are generally void
                    against creditors by the policy of the Acts of Elizabeth. By the legislation of
                    some States a freehold may commence <hi rend="italic">in futuro</hi> without the
                    operation of the Statute of Uses. Societies of professional trustees, receiving
                    a percentage of the income of the property as payment for their trouble and
                    liability, are frequently recognized by law. Such societies are generally under
                    an obligation to make periodical returns of their receipts and expenditure. A
                    public trustee as a corporation sole exists in some States. Trustee process in
                    the New England States is what is generally known as garnishee process in
                    England, that is, a means of reaching property and credits of a debtor in the
                    hands of third persons for the benefit of an attaching creditor.<note
