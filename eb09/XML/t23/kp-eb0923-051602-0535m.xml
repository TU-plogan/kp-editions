                    thus forms a compact inland territory nearly as broad as long, not more than 45
                    or 50 miles from the Indian Ocean at Delagoa Bay, but otherwise lying completely
                    within the outer rim of the vast South African tableland. A line drawn from the

                    from the same confluence southwards to the Natal frontier being 425, and the
                    greatest length east and west between the Zulu and Bechuana frontiers about 400
                    miles. In the absence of accurate surveys, the total area has been variously
                    estimated at from 110,000 to 120,000 square miles, with a population (including
                    aborigines) roughly calculated at from 750,000 to 800,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Physical Features.—</hi> Physically Transvaal forms a
                    well-marked section of the great South African plateau, an elevated shallow
                    basin with a mean altitude of over 3000 feet, whose conformation has been
                    compared to that of a saucer. On the south and east this basin is separated from
                    the coast by a lofty inner and less elevated outer rim, the former from 6000 to
                    10,000, the latter about 2000 feet high, sweeping round in curves concentric
                    with that of the seaboard, from Cape Colony through Natal and the east side of
                    Transvaal northwards to the equatorial regions. The inner rim, whose various
                    sections in the extreme south are known as the Roggeveld, Nieuweveld, and
                    Quathlamba ranges, takes in Natal and Transvaal the general name of the
                    Drakenberg Mountains. From the Natal frontier to the Lipalule (Olifant)
                    tributary of the Limpopo, the Drakenberg maintains the aspect of a more or less
                    continuous range 5000 to 7000 feet high, culminating in the Mauchberg (8725),
                    the highest point in Transvaal. A little to the east is the Spitskop (5637), and
                    further south the Klipstad (6020) and Holnek (5600). This section, whose several
                    ridges are known as the Verza-melberg, Randberg, Slangapiesberg, and Komatiberg,
                    falls everywhere precipitously eastwards towards the Libomba range, or outer rim
                    of the plateau, which maintains a mean elevation of 2000 feet along the eastern
                    border of Transvaal. Beyond the Lipalule, the Drakenberg loses the character of
                    a well-defined mountain system, broadening out into uplands moderately elevated
                    above the surrounding plateau, and breaking into ridges, such as the Murchison
                    and Zoutpansberg ranges, which run east and west between the Lipalule and
                    Limpopo. The whole system slopes gently westwards to the central tableland,
                    which is itself intersected by several broken ranges, such as the Maquassieberg,
                    Gat Rand, Witwater Rand, and Magalies-berg in the south, the Dwarsberg,
                    Marikele, Hanglip, Waterberg, and Blauberg in the north, all mostly trending in
                    the direction from east to west. But few of these ridges rise much above 4000
                    feet, and, as the plateau has a mean altitude of considerably over 3000 feet,
                    they detract little from the aspect of a vast level or slightly rolling upland
                    plain, almost everywhere presented by Transvaal west of the Drakenberg
                    orographic system.</p>
                <p>The numerous fossil remains of aquatic life, together with extensive sandy tracts
                    and the presence in several places of water-worn shingle, give to the central
                    tableland the appearance of an upheaved lacustrine basin, whose waters escaped
                    at one time through the Limpopo to the Indian Ocean, at another through the Vaal
                    to the Orange river, and thence to the Atlantic. The Vaal and Limpopo are still
                    the two great fissures in the plateau, which carry off most of the surface
                    waters to the surrounding marine basins. The water-parting between these two
                    river systems lies, not in the Drakenberg, itself pierced by the Lipalule and
                    several of its affluents, but in the Witwater Rand towards the south-west of the
                    state. From this point the Limpopo, or Crocodile, sweeps round first to the
                    west, then to the north-east, describing a semicircle of about 1000 miles to the
                    Limvuba (Pafuri) confluence, where it leaves Transvaal, flowing thence for
                    nearly 340 miles through Portuguese territory south-east to the Indian Ocean.
                    Captain G. A. Chaddock has shown (1884) that it is navigable for steamers to
                    this confluence, above which it is obstructed by the Tolo Azime and other
                    rapids. Throughout its whole course it receives numerous affluents on both
                    sides, such as the Shasha and Nuanetsi from the north, the Marico, Nyl, Limvuba,
                    Lipalule, and others from Transvaal, of which region it drains fully 95,000
                    square miles. With the exception of a few tracts watered by the headstreams of
                    the Buffalo (Tugela), Mvolozi, Usutu, and Umcomati (King George), flowing in
                    independent channels eastwards to the Indian Ocean, all the rest of Transvaal is
                    drained by the Vaal westwards to the Orange and Atlantic. The Vaal has its
                    easternmost sources in the Wakkerstroom district on the west slope of the
                    Drakenberg, whence it flows for about 450 miles, partly within, but mainly
                    along, the southern frontier of Transvaal, of which, with the Hart and other
                    tributaries on its right bank, it drains about 20,000 square miles altogether.
                    Besides these perennial streams, there are numerous shallow lagoons or saltpans
                    scattered over the western and northern districts, as well as thermal and
                    mineral waters, such as the Warmbad in the Nyl valley. But the only lake
                    properly so called is Lake Chrissie, a sheet of water nearly 40 miles round, and
                    in parts very deep, which lies on the west side of the Drakenberg, 5755 feet
                    above sea-level.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Although lying on the border of and partly
                    within the tropics, Transvaal, thanks to its great elevation above the sea, and
                    to the absence of extensive marshy tracts, enjoys on the whole a healthy
                    invigorating climate, well suited to the European constitution. Owing to the
                    dryness of the air, due to the proximity of the Kalahari desert, the western and
                    central districts are specially favourable to persons suffering from consumption
                    and other chest complaints. But some of the low-lying moist tracts along the
                    Limpopo and other river valleys, close to or within the torrid zone, are
                    extremely insalubrious, fever of the general African type being here endemic,
                    and its prevalence usually marked by the presence of the destructive tsetse fly.
                    The route from Delagoa Bay to the interior also traverses a fever-stricken coast
                    district between the sea and the Libomba escarpment, dangerous especially in the
                    rainy summer season. The rains generally begin about October, sometimes a little
                    before or after, and last intermittently till April. But the rainfall is very
                    unequally distributed, most of the moisture-bearing clouds from the Indian Ocean
                    being arrested by the great barrier of the Drakenberg, or counteracted by the
                    dry west winds from the Kalahari desert. Thus, while there is abundance of rain
                    in the east, the country gradually becomes drier as it approaches Bechuana-land.
                    During the dry winter season (April to September) keen frosty winds blow from
                    the south, sweeping freely over the central plains and carrying the moisture to
                    be precipitated as snow along the eastern highlands. Nevertheless, according to
                    the careful meteorological observations made by Mr Lys at Pretoria between 1877
                    and 1880, the mean annual temperature is considerably over 68° F., falling to
                    about 40° in June and rising to 90° and occasionally even 95° in January. The
                    rainfall in the same central district seldom reaches 30 inches, which is
                    probably a fair average for the whole of Transvaal, falling to 12 towards the
                    western and rising to 60 on the eastern frontier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral Resources.—</hi> Transvaal yields to no other African
                    region in the abundance of its mineral resources, while it is altogether
                    unrivalled in their extraordinary variety. These include, besides the precious
                    metals and diamonds, iron, copper, lead, cobalt, sulphur, saltpetre, and coal,
                    this last with gold, copper, and iron being probably the most abundant and
                    widely distributed. Gold, largely diffused throughout the Drakenberg and in the
                    northern Zoutpansberg and Waterberg districts and in the Rustenburg and Marico
                    districts in the extreme west, as well as in the highlands between Transvaal and
                    the Zambesi, has hitherto been worked chiefly in the rich auriferous region of
                    Lydenburg about Mount Mauchberg and Mount Spitskop in the central parts of the
                    Drakenberg range, and farther south in the Johannesburg and Lower Kaap (Sheba)

                    discovered in 1873, lie at an elevation of 4500 to 5000 feet 40 miles south of
                    the Lipalule river and 125 north-west of Lorenzo Marques on Delagoa Bay, the
                    chief diggings being at Pilgrim’s Rest and Mac Mac close to the Spitskop. In the
                    Middelburg district the chief centres of mining operations are the recently
                    founded towns of Barberton and Johannesburg. In some years the Lydenburg,
                    Marabastad, and other diggings have jointly yielded over £300,000, obtained by
                    washing and without any quartz-crushing. Iron ores are also widely distributed,
                    and the Yzerberg (“Iron Mountain”) near Marabastad (24° S., 30° E.) consists of
                    an enormous mass of rich iron ore, which the natives have worked for ages.
                    Diamonds are chiefly confined to the Bloemhoff district on the Vaal above the
                    great diamantiferous region of Kimberley in Griqualand West. Coal abounds in the
                    south-eastern districts (Wakkerstroom, Utrecht), and also farther north in
                    Middelburg (Nazareth) and Lydenburg. In some places seams 7 or 8 feet thick lie
                    so near the surface that they are quarried and the coal carted away by the
                    natives. The prevailing formations where this great mineral wealth is embedded
                    are quartz, porphyry, granites, clay slates, greenstone, Lower Devonian strata,
                    conglomerates, and limestones.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora. —</hi> In Transvaal, as in most of the continent, an
                    herbaceous flora prevails largely over forest growths, which are here confined
                    chiefly to the deep kloofs (gorges) of the mountain ranges, and to the courses
                    of the larger streams. Bush, including mimosas, thorn thickets, and creepers,
                    covers extensive tracts on the northern and southern plains, and the
                    Wakkerstroom and Utrecht districts towards Natal are well wooded. But elsewhere
                    the characteristic features are grasslands, downs, hill slopes, flats, and even
                    many parts of the higher uplands being covered with savannahs generally
                    affording good pasturage and fodder for cattle. In the woodlands the prevailing
                    species are three varieties of yellow wood (<hi rend="italic">Podocarpus),</hi>
                    often growing to an enormous size, the Cape beech (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Myrsine),</hi> several varieties of the wild pear <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Olinia)</hi> and of stinkwood <hi rend="italic">(Oreodaρhne),</hi> ironwood,
                    and ebony. The Boers and other settlers have hitherto occupied themselves
                    chiefly with stock-breeding (sheep, cattle, and horses), but there can be no
                    doubt that much of the country is eminently suited for the cultivation of
                    cereals, yielding two annual crops and producing some of the finest wheat in the
                    world. Tobacco, the vine, and most European fruits and vegetables also thrive
                    well, while semi-tropical products, such as cotton, sugar, and coffee, might be
                    raised in the warmer northern districts.</p>

                    characteristic large animals, such as the lion, leopard, rhinoceros, elephant,
                    giraffe, zebra, quagga, several varieties of antelope, and the ostrich, which
                    roam over the continent from Soudan to the Cape. All these animals still exist,
                    but in greatly reduced numbers, being now largely replaced by the domestic
                    animals—cattle, sheep, and horses —introduced by the white settlers. All the
                    large rivers are inhabited by the hippopotamus and crocodile, the latter giving
                    an alternative name to the Limpopo; the buffalo, gnu, eland, springbok,
                    wildbeeste, baboon, and several other members of the ape family are also
                    frequently met with. The country is occasionally swept by destructive flights of
                    locusts; but the greatest enemy of the stock-breeder is the tsetse fly, which
                    infests the coastlands and many of the riverine tracts, but shows a tendency to
                    disappear with the large game, retreating with the advance of the plough. A
                    tsetse belt 40 miles wide along the whole course of the Limpopo still bars the
                    spread of European settlements beyond Transvaal in the direction of the
                    Zambesi.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inhabitants.—</hi> Of the population not more than 50,000 are
                    whites, mostly Boers (descendants of the early Dutch, French, and German
                    immigrants to the Cape), with a large and increasing percentage of British
                    settlers, attracted in recent years especially to the Lydenburg and other mining
                    districts. All the rest are natives, belonging mainly to the Basuto and Bechuana
                    branches of the Bantu family, and consequently allied in speech and to a large
                    extent in physique to their Zulu-Kaffre neighbours. A considerable number of
                    these natives have abandoned the tribal state and taken service, either freely
                    or by compulsion, with the whites as farm labourers in the rural districts, and
                    as domestic servants in the towns, and are now also largely employed in mining
                    operations. The great bulk of the rest, who retain their national usages and
                    recognize the authority of more or less independent tribal chiefs, are
                    concentrated in the northern and eastern provinces of Zoutpansberg (364,000),
                    Waterberg (174,000), and Lydenburg (123,000). There are also about 40,000 in
                    Bloemhoff (extreme south-west), and the same number in the western provinces of
                    Rustenburg and Marico, but only a few scattered groups in all the rest of the
                    country. These western and south-western tribes (Barolongs, Batlapins, Bakwenas,
                    Bakhatlas, &amp;c.) are all Bechuanas; the others mainly Makatis, as the Basutos
                    are here collectively called. It may be stated in a general way that the whole
                    country south of the Lipalule is now free of native claims and open to European
                    colonization, while the northern region between that river and the Limpopo is
                    still to a large extent occupied by unreduced or unbroken Basuto
                    communities.</p>

                    Lipalule, about 35,000 square miles altogether, with an altitude ranging from
                    4000 to 7000 feet; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Banken veld,</hi> or terrace lands,
                    comprising the low eastern zone between the Drakenberg and Libomba ranges,
                    falling in many places down to a level of 2000 feet, with an area of 15,000 to
                    20,000 square miles; (3) the <hi rend="italic">Bosch veld,</hi> or bush country,
                    comprising all the rest of the land, with an altitude of 3000 to 4000 feet and
                    an area of 60,000 square miles. For administrative purposes the country is again
                    divided into thirteen provinces :—Zoutpansberg and Waterberg in the north;
                    Lydenburg, Middelburg (formerly Nazareth), Pretoria, Rustenburg, and Marico in
                    the centre; Utrecht, Londina, Wakkerstroom, Heidelberg, Potchefstroom, and
                    Bloemhoff in the south. In the southern part of Lydenburg lies the somewhat
                    detached district of New Scotland, comprising some 500,000 acres selected by the
                    late Mr M ‘Corkindale as a Scotch pastoral and agricultural settlement. It is a
                    healthy prosperous country, lying on the slopes of the Drakenberg, within 310
                    miles of Durban, Natal. But the most thickly settled province is Potchefstroom,
                    a fertile tract, 3500 to 5000 feet high, abundantly watered by the Mooi, Schoen,
                    and other streams flowing to the Vaal, and well suited for tillage and
                    pasturage. Its capital of like name (derived from elements in those of
                    Potgieter, Scherf, and Stockenstroom, three popular Boer leaders during the
                    early migrations) is the most settled and one of the largest towns in Transvaal.
                    The only other places deserving the name of town are Pretoria, capital of the
                    province of like name and of the state, occupying a somewhat central position
                    100 miles north-east of Potchefstroom, 980 from Cape Town, 820 from Port
                    Elizabeth, and 400 from Durban; Barberton, in the Lower Kaap mining district,
                    150 miles by road from Delagoa Bay, only three years old, but already by far the
                    largest place in the state, with a population (1887) of 15,000; and
                    Johannesburg, centre of the goldfields of the same name, 30 miles south-east of
                    Pretoria, and 72 east of Potchefstroom, founded in 1886, but already larger than
                    Pretoria, with a population of over 4000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Statistics.—</hi> Transvaal enjoys
                    representative institutions, with a volksraad or parliament of forty-four
                    members elected for four years, one-half retiring every two years, the executive
                    being entrusted to a president elected for five years by the whole body of
                    electors, assisted by a council of four, the <hi rend="italic">ex-oficio</hi>
                    vice-president and the state secretary, with two others appointed by the
                    volksraad. The revenue, derived chiefly from land sales, quit rents, stamps,
                    hut-tax, and customs, balanced the expenditure in 1885, and exceeded it by
                    £15,000 in 1886, the respective sums being £260,000 and £245,000. In 1884 the
                    public debt was £396,000, the exports (gold, ivory, corn, wool, hides, cattle,
                    ostrich feathers, &amp;c.) about £600,000, and the imports probably over
                    £1,000,000. The long-projected railway, intended to afford an outlet to the
                    coast at Delagoa Bay, was completed in 1887 from Lorenzo Marques, the seaward
                    terminus, to the Transvaal frontier, a distance of 50 miles. Transvaal is in
                    telegraphic communication with the Cape and the rest of the world through the
                    Orange Free State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The historic life of Transvaal begins with the
                    “Great Trek,” or general exodus of the Cape Colony Boers, who, being
                    dissatisfied, especially with the liberal policy of the British Government
                    towards the natives, removed northwards in large numbers between the years 1833
                    and 1837. By 1836 some thousands had already crossed the Vaal, that is, had
                    reached the “Trans-Vaal” country, which at that time was mostly under the sway
                    of the powerful refugee Zulu chief Moselekatze, whose principal kraal was at
                    Mosega in the present Marico district on the west frontier. To avenge the
                    massacre of some emigrant bands, the Boers under Maritz and Potgieter attacked
                    and utterly defeated Moselekatze at this place in 1837. Next year the Zulu chief
                    withdrew beyond the Limpopo, where he founded the present Matebele state between
                    that river and the Zambesi, thus leaving the region between the Vaal and Limpopo
                    virtually in the hands of the Trekkers. But their position was rendered insecure
                    on the east side by the military despotism of the fierce Zulu chief Dingaan,
                    who, after the murder of his brother Chaka, had asserted his authority over the
                    whole of Zululand and most of the present Natal. The situation was rendered
                    almost desperate by the complete rout and wholesale massacre (1838) of the right
                    division of the emigrant Boers, who had ventured to cross the Buffalo under
                    Pieter Retief, and who were defeated by Dingaan, first at Umkongloof
                    (“Aceldama”), then at Weenen (“Weeping”), and again soon after under Uys,
                    Maritz, and Potgieter, when as many as 800 fell before the irresistible
                    onslaught of the disciplined Zulu warriors. At this critical juncture the
                    Trekkers were saved from utter extermination by <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0538-0519"/> Andries Pretorius of Graaff Reiπet, by whom
                    Dingaan met with a first check before the close of 1838, followed in January
                    1840 by a still more crushing defeat. Dingaan having been soon after murdered,
                    the friendly Panda was set up in his place, and Natal proclaimed a Boer
                    republic. But the British occupation of that territory in 1843 induced the Boers
                    to retire in two bands across the Drakenberg, the southern division settling in
                    the present Orange Free State, the northern again passing into Transvaal. But,
                    owing to internal dissensions, and the perpetual bickerings of the two most
                    prominent personalities, Pretorius and Potgieter, all attempts at establishing
                    an organized system of government throughout Transvaal ended in failure, till
                    Pretorius induced the British Government to sign the Sand River convention
                    (January 17, 1852), which virtually established the political independence of
                    that region. The death both of Pretorius and Potgieter in 1853 prepared the way
                    for a period of internal peace under Pretorius’s eldest son Marthinus Wessels
                    Pretorius, first president of the “Dutch African Republic,” whose title was
                    afterwards altered (1858) to that of the “South African Republic.” But a fatal
                    element of weakness lay in the persistent refusal of the Boers to treat the
                    natives on a footing of equality, or even with common justice. The murder of
                    Hermann Potgieter and family (1854), avenged by Pretorius at Makapan’s Cave, was
                    followed (1856) by the “Apprentice Law,” establishing a system of disguised
                    slavery, which was further strengthened by the sanction (1858) of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Grond wet,</hi> or “Fundamental Law,” declaring that the “people
                    will admit of no equality of persons of colour with the white inhabitants either
                    in state or church.” Owing to this policy opposition was constantly shown both
                    to the English traders, disposed to deal fairly with all, and to the
                    missionaries, preachers of universal equality, as illustrated by the plunder of
                    Livingstone’s house by the commando sent against the native chief Secheli in
                    1852. À brief chronicle must here suffice of subsequent events down to the
                    present time:— 1857. Invasion of the Orange Free State by Pretorius; dispute
                    settled without bloodshed by the treaty of June 1.</p>
                <p>1859. Pretorius elected president of the Free State; fails to effect the union of
                    the two states.</p>
                <p>1863. Return of Pretorius, during whose absence affairs had fallen into
                    confusion; continued troubles with the natives; quarrels with the Batlapins,
                    Barolongs, and Griquas in the west; in the east with Ketchywayo, king of
                    Zululand, about the Boers’ right to the Wakkerstroom and Utrecht districts.</p>
                <p>1867. Discovery of diamonds, and Mauch’s announcement of goldfields in the
                    interior.</p>
                <p>1868. Pretorius’s proclamation extending the boundaries of the state west to Lake
                    Ngami, east to Delagoa Bay, whence disputes and negotiations with England and
                    Portugal, Delagoa Bay being ultimately awarded (July 1875) to Portugal by the
                    French president, Marshal MacMahon, to whose decision the matter had been
                    referred.</p>
                <p>1871. Boundary disputes towards the south-west settled by the award of
                    Lieutenant-Governor Keate of Natal, leading to the resignation of Pretorius and
                    appointment of President Burgers.</p>
                <p>1875. The Fundamental Law forces Burgers to measures leading to the war with
                    Sikokuni, chief of the Bapedi, south of the Olifant river, who claimed large
                    part of Lydenburg and even of Pretoria; Burgers’s visit to Europe in connexion
                    with the Delagoa Railway scheme; on his return he finds everything in the
                    greatest confusion; Boers dispirited by repeated reverses in the Sikokuni war;
                    an empty treasury; broken credit; the state practically bankrupt and exposed to
                    imminent danger of invasion by Bapedis and Zulus. Hence 1876-77. Intervention of
                    England, and Sir Theophilus Shepstone’s proclamation (April 12, 1877) annexing
                    Transvaal, followed by the appointment of Sir W. Owen Lanyon as British
                    administrator.</p>
                <p>1880-81. Revolt of the discontented Boers, who, being successful in a few
                    contests with British troops, induced the British Government to restore the
                    republic under the “suzerainty” of the queen, by the treaty of peace of March
                    21, 1881, a British resident being appointed, with the functions of a
                    consul-general.</p>
                <p>1883. S. J. Paul Krüger elected president.</p>
                <p>1884. Convention of London (February 27, ratified by the volksraad, August 8)
                    recognizing the state as the South African Republic, and considerably
                    restricting the British suzerainty.</p>
                <p>1885. Proclamation (March 23) of the British protectorate over Bechuanaland,
                    thereby arresting the westward advance of the Boers into the Bamangwato,
                    Bakwena, Bangwaketsi, and Barolong territories, and keeping open the great trade
                    route from Cape Colony through Hopetown and Shoshong to the Zambesi.</p>
                <p>1886. Fresh discoveries of rich auriferous deposits especially in the Middelburg
                    province, followed by a great influx of English-speaking populations,
                    threatening to swamp the Boer element.</p>
                <p>1886. Projected South African confederation, opposed by Krüger, but supported by
                    the Orange State, Cape Colony, and a majority of the Transvaal Boers. Connected
                    with this scheme is the proposal of a uniform tariff and the immediate
                    construction of a through railway from Cape Town to Delagoa Bay. (A. H. K.)</p>
