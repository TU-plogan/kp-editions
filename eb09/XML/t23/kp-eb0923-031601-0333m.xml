                    >The Arabian Nights’ Entertainments,</hi> is a collection of tales written in
                    Arabic, which first became generally known in Europe in the early part of last
                    century through the French translation by Antoine <hi rend="smallcaps">Galland
                    (ç.u),</hi> and rapidly attained such universal popularity that it is
                    unnecessary to describe the contents of the book. But the origin of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi> claims discussion in this place. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatique</hi> for 1827, p. 253, Von
                    Hammer drew attention to a passage in the <hi rend="italic">Golden Meadows</hi>
                    of Mas'údí (ed. Barbier de Meynard, iv. 89 <hi rend="italic">sq.),</hi> written
                    in 943 A.D., in which certain stories current among the old Arabs are compared
                    with “the books which have reached us in translations from Persian, Indian, and
                    Greek, such as the book of <hi rend="italic">Hezár Afsáne,</hi> a title which,
                    translated from Persian into Arabic, means ‘the thousand tales.’ This book is
                    popularly called <hi rend="italic">The Thousand and One Nights,</hi> and
                    contains the story of the king and his vizier and of his daughter Shirazád and
                    her slave girl Dínázád. Other books of the same kind are the book of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ferza and Símás,</hi> containing stories of Indian kings and
                    viziers, the book of Sindibád, &amp;c.” Von Hammer concluded that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thousand and One Nights</hi> were of Persian or Indian origin.
                    Against this conclusion De Sacy protested in a memoir <hi rend="italic">(Mem. de
                    l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Acαd. des Inscr.,</hi> 1833, x. 30 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sqj),</hi> demonstrating that the character of the book we know is genuinely
                    Arabian, and that it must have been written in Egypt at a comparatively recent
                    date. Von Hammer in reply adduced, in <hi rend="italic">Jour. As.,</hi> 1839,
                    ii. p. 175 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> a passage in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fihrist</hi> (987 A.D.), which is to the following effect:—</p>
                <p>“The ancient Persians were the first to invent tales, and make books of them, and
                    some of their tales were put in the mouths of animals. The Ashghanians, or third
                    dynasty of Persian kings, and after them the Sásánians, had a special partin the
                    development of this literature, which found Arabic translators, and was taken up
                    by accomplished Arabic literati, who edited it and imitated it. The earliest
                    book of the kind was the <hi rend="italic">Hezár afsán</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thousand</hi><hi rend="italic">Tales,</hi> which had the following origin. A
                    certain Persian king was accustomed to kill his wives on the morning af ter the
                    consummation of the marriage. But once he married a clever princess called
                    Shahrazád, who spent the marriage night in telling a story which in the morning
                    reached a point so interesting that the king spared her, and asked next night
                    for the sequel. This went on for a thousand nights, till Shahrazád had a son,
                    and ventured to tell the king of her device. He admired her intelligence, loved
                    her, and spared her life. In all this the princess was assisted by the king’s
                    stewardess Dínázád. This book is said to have been written for the princess
                    Homái (MSS. Homání), daughter of Bahman. ... It contains nearly two hundred
                    stories, one story often occupying several nights. I have repeatedly seen the
                    complete book, but it is really a meagre and uninteresting production” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fihrist,</hi> ed. Flügel, p. 304).</p>
                <p>Persian tradition (in Firdausi) makes Princess Homái the daughter and wife of
                    Bahman Ardashír, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Artaxerxes I. Longimanus. She is
                    depicted as a great builder, a kind of Persian Semiramis, and is a half-mythical
                    personage already mentioned in the Avesta, but her legend seems to be founded on
                    the history of Atossa and of Parysatis. Firdausi says that she was also called
                    Shahrazád (Mohl, v. 11). This name and that of Dínázád both occur in what
                    Mas'ddí tells of her. According to him, Shahrazád was Homái’s mother (ii. 129),
                    a Jewess (ii. 123). Bahman had married a Jewess (i. 118), who was instrumental
                    in delivering her nation from captivity. In ii. 122 this Jewish maiden who did
                    her people this service is called Dínázád, but “the accounts,” says our author,
                    “vary.” Plainly she is the Esther of Jewish story. Tabari (i. 688) calls Esther
                    the mother of Bahman, and, like Firdausi, gives to Homái the name of Shahrazád.
                    The story of Esther and that of the original <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> have
                    in fact one main feature in common. In the former the king is offended with his
                    wife, and divorces her; in the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights</hi> he finds
                    her unfaithful, and kills her. But both stories agree that thereafter a new wife
                    was brought to him every night, and on the morrow passed into the second house
                    of the women (Esther), or was slain <hi rend="italic">(Nights).</hi> At length
                    Esther or Shahrazád wins his heart and becomes queen. The issue in the Jewish
                    story is that Esther saves her people; in the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> the
                    gainers are “the daughters of the Moslems,” but the old story had, of course,
                    some other word than “Moslems.” Esther’s foster-father becomes vizier, and
                    Shahrazád’s father is also vizier. Shah-razád’s plan is helped forward in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> by Dínázád, who is, according to Mas'údí, her
                    slave girl, or, according to other MSS., her nurse, and, according to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fihrist,</hi> the king’s stewardess. The last account comes
                    nearest to Esther ii. 15, where Esther gains the favour of the king’s
                    chamberlain, keeper of the women. It is also to be noted that Ahasuerus is read
                    to at night when he cannot sleep (Esther vi. 1). And it is just possible that it
                    is worth notice that, though the name of Ahasuerus corresponds to Xerxes,
                    Josephus identifies him with Artaxerxes I.</p>
                <p>Now it may be taken as admitted that the book of Esther was written in Persia, or
                    by one who had lived in Persia, and not earlier than the 3d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> If now there is real weight in the points of contact
                    between this story and the <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights—</hi> and the points
                    of difference cannot be held to outweigh the resemblances between two legends,
                    each of which is necessarily so far removed from the hypothetical common
                    source—the inference is important for both stories. On the one hand, it appears
                    that (at least in part) the book of Esther draws on a Persian source; on the
                    other hand, it becomes probable that the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> are older
                    than the Sásánian period, to which Lane, iii. 677, refers them.</p>
                <p>It is a piece of good fortune that Mas'údí and the <hi rend="italic">Fihrist</hi>
                    give us the information cited above. For in general the Moslems, though very
                    fond of stories, are ashamed to recognize them as objects of literary curiosity.
                    In fact, the next mention of the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> is found only
                    after <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n334/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0334-0317"/> a lapse of three centuries. Makrízí, describing
                    the capital of Egypt, quotes from a work of Ibn Sa'íd (c. 1250 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> who again cites an older author (Al-Kortobí), who,
                    in speaking of a love affair at the court of the caliph Al-Ámir (1097-1130),
                    says “what is told aboutit resembles the romance of Al-Battál, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thousand and One Nights” (Hitat,</hi> Búlák ed., i. 485, ii.
                    181).</p>
                <p>That the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> which we have are not the original
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">Hezár Äfsáne</hi> is certain, for the
                    greater part of the stories are of Arabian origin, and the whole is so
                    thoroughly Mohammedan that even the princes of remote ages who are introduced
                    speak and act as Moslems. It might be conceived that this is due to a gradual
                    process of modernization by successive generations of story-tellers. But against
                    this notion, which has been entertained by some scholars, Lane has remarked with
                    justice that, much as MSS. of the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> differ from one
                    another in points of language and style, in the order of the tales, and the
                    division into nights, they are all so much at one in essentials that they must
                    be regarded as derived from a single original. There is no trace of a recension
                    of the text that can be looked on as standing nearer to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hezar Afsáne.</hi> And the whole local colour of the work, in point of dialect
                    and also as regards the manners and customs described, clearly belongs to Egypt
                    as it was from the 14th to the 16th century. Some points, as De Sacy and Lane
                    have shown, forbid us to place the book earlier than the second half of the 15th
                    century. Galland’s MS. copy, again, was in existence in 1548. Lane accordingly
                    dates the work from the close of the 15 th century or the beginning of the 16th,
                    but this date appears to be too late. For Abu’l-Mahásin, an Egyptian historian
                    who died in 1470, writing of Hamdi, a famous highwayman of Baghdad in the 10th
                    century, remarks that he is probably the figure who used to be popularly spoken
                    of as Ahmed al-Danaf (ed. Juynboll, ii. 305). Now in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nights</hi> Ahmed al-Danaf really plays a part corresponding to that of the
                    historical Hamdi, being now a robber (Lane, ii. 404) and again a captain of the
                    guard (Lane, ii. 249). It would seem that Abu’l-Mahásin had read or heard the
                    stories in the <hi rend="italic">Nights,</hi> and was thus led to compare the
                    historical with the fictitious character. And, if this be so, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nights</hi> must have been composed very soon after 1450.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The hypothesis of gradual and
                    complete modernization is also opposed to the fact that the other romances used
                    by Cairene storytellers (such as those of Antar and of Saif) retain their
                    original local colour through all variations of language and
                    style.</p></note></p>
                <p>No doubt the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> have borrowed much from the <hi

                    original Arabic translation of that work some of the Persian stories were
                    replaced by Arab ones. But that our <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> differ very
                    much from the <hi rend="italic">Hezár Afsáne</hi> is further manifest from the
                    circumstance that, even of those stories in the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi>
                    which are not Arabian in origin, some are borrowed from books mentioned by

                <p>Not a few of the tales are unmistakably of Indian or</p>

                    stories the scene lies in Persia or India, and the source is foreign, but the
                    treatment thoroughly Arabian and Mohammedan. Sometimes, indeed, traces of Indian
                    origin are perceptible, even in stories in which Hárún al-Rashíd figures and the

                    and form alike, are Arabian, and so many of them have the capital of the caliphs
                    as the scene of action that it may be guessed that the author used as one of his
                    sources a book of tales taken from the era of Baghdad’s prosperity.</p>
                <p>The late date of the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> appears from sundry

                    (Lane, i. 99),—the first three colours are those of the turbans which, in 1301,
                    Mohammed b. Keláún of Egypt commanded his Moslem, Christian, and Jewish subjects

                    imperfect copies.</p>
                <p>Many of the tales in the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> have an historical basis,
                    as Lane has shown in his notes. Other cases in point might be added: thus the
                    chronicle of Ibn al-Jauzí (died 1200 A.D.) contains a narrative of Kamar, slave
                    girl of Shaghb, the mother of Al-Moktadir, which is the source of the tale in
                    Lane, i. 310 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and of another to be found in
                    M‛Naghten, iv. 557 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>; the latter is the better story,
                    but departs so far from the original that the author must have had no more than
                    a general recollection of the narrative he drew on.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De Goeje in <hi rend="italic">Gids,</hi>
                    1876, ii. pp. 397-411.</p></note> There are other cases in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nights</hi> of two tales which are only variations of a single theme, or even
                    in certain parts agree almost word for word. Some tales are mere compounds of
                    different stories put together without any art, but these perhaps are, as Lane
                    conjectures, later additions to the book; yet the collector himself was no great
                    literary artist. We must picture him as a professional story-teller equipped
                    with a mass of miscellaneous reading, a fluent power of narration, and a ready
                    faculty for quoting, or at a push improvising, verses. His stories became
                    popular, and were written down as he told them,—hardly written by himself, else
                    we should not have so many variations in the text, and such insertions of “the
                    narrator says,” “my noble sirs,” and the like. The frequent coarseness of tone
                    is proper to the condition of Egyptian society under the Mameluke sultans, and
                    would not have been tolerated in Baghdad in the age <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0335-0318"/> to which so many of the tales refer. Yet with all
                    their faults the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> have beauties enough to deserve
                    their popularity, and to us their merit is enhanced by the pleasure we feel in
                    being transported into so entirely novel a state of society.</p>
                <p>The original of some of the most interesting tales in Galland’s version, as
                    “Aladdin and the Wonderful Lamp,” “Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves,” has just
                    been discovered by Dr Zotenberg in a MS. recently acquired by the National
                    Library at Paris. A careful examination of this MS. and of the Wortley-Montagu
                    MS. in the Bodleian may lead perhaps to a more certain conclusion as to the time
                    of composition.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Thousand and One Nights</hi> became known in Europe
                    througlι A. Galland’s French version (12 vols., 12mo, Paris, 1704-12); the
                    publication was an event in literary history, the influence of which can be
                    traced far and wide. This translation, however, left much to be desired in point
                    of accuracy, and especially failed to reproduce the colour of the original with
                    the exactness which those who do not read merely for amusement must desire. It
                    was with a special view to the remedying of these defects that Lane produced in
                    1840 his admirably accurate, if somewhat stilted, translation, enriched with
                    most valuable notes and a discussion of the origin of the work (new edition,
                    with some additional notes, 3 vols., 8vo., London, 1859). Lane’s translation
                    omits the tales which he deemed uninteresting or unfit for a European public. No
                    full translation into English can be published, and, though two such have been
                    privately printed, and one of these (by Sir R. Burton) is being reproduced in an
                    expurgated form, Lane’s version is still unsuperseded for all serious use. Of
                    the Arabic text of the <hi rend="italic">Nights</hi> the principal editions
                    are—(1) M ’ Naghten’s edition, 4 vols., 8vo, Calcutta, 1839-42; (2) the Breslau
                    edition, 12 vols., 12mo, 1835-43, the first 8 vols, by Habicht, the rest by
                    Fleischer (compare as to the defects of Habicht’s work, Fleischer, <hi
