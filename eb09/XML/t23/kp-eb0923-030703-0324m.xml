                    Breslau, March 30, 1799, in humble circumstances. He received his education at
                    the grammar school and university of his native town, and early distinguished
                    himself by wonderful versatility of mind, a phenomenal power of acquiring
                    languages, and an omnivorous appetite for books. A romantic love of the East and
                    its literature led him to exchange the university of Breslau for that of Berlin,
                    that he might study Oriental languages to greater advantage, and there he was
                    received into the house of the Orientalist Von Dietz. He was introduced to
                    Pietistic circles in Berlin, and came specially under the influence of Baron Von
                    Kottwitz, who became his “spiritual father,” and of the historian Neander.
                    Before deciding on the career of theological professor, he had in view that of a
                    missionary in the East. Meanwhile he was feeling the influence to a certain
                    degree of the romantic school, and of Schleiermacher and Hegel too, though he
                    never sounded the depths of their systems. At length, in his twenty-first year,
                    he finally decided to adopt the academical calling. From December 1820 to April
                    1826 he was “privat-docent” and “prof, extraordinarius” of theology in Berlin,
                    though he was at the same time most active in the work of home and foreign
                    missions. He lectured on the Old and New Testaments, theology, apologetics, and
                    the history of the church in the 18th century. The first fruit of his Oriental
                    studies and his introduction to his profession was his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ssufismus, siυβ Theosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Persarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantheistica</hi> (1821); following the same line of study he published <hi
                    rend="italic">Blütensammlung aus der morgenländischen Mystik</hi> (1825) and <hi
                    rend="italic">Speculative</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinitätslehre des späteren
                    Orients</hi> (1826). His well-known essay on the nature and moral influence of
                    heathenism (1822) was published by Neander, with high commendation, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Denkwürdigkeiten·,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                    the Epistle to the Romans</hi> (1824) secured him a foremost place amongst the
                    most suggestive, if not the most accurate, Biblical· interpreters of that time.
                    Another work, which was soon translated into all the principal European
                    languages, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Lehre von der Sünde und
                    vom Versöhner</hi> (1823), the outcome of his own religious history, procured
                    for him the position which he ever after held of the modern Pietistic apologist
                    of evangelical Christianity. In 1825, with the aid of the Prussian Government,
                    he visited the libraries of England and Holland, and on his return was appointed
                    professor of theology at Halle, the centre of German rationalism. Here he made
                    it his aim to combine in a higher unity the learning and to some extent the
                    rationalism of Sender with the devout and active pietism of Francke; and, in
                    spite of the opposition of the theological faculty of the university, he
                    succeeded in changing the character of its theology. This he effected partly by
                    his lectures, particularly his exegetical courses, but, above all, by his
                    personal influence upon the students, and, after 1833, by his preaching. His
                    theological position was that of a mild and large-hearted orthodoxy, which laid
                    more stress upon Christian experience than upon rigid dogmatic belief. On the
                    two great questions of miracles and inspiration he made great concessions to
                    modern criticism and philosophy. The battle of his life was on behalf of
                    personal religious experience, in opposition to the externality of rationalism,
                    orthodoxy, or sacrament-arianism. He fought this battle with weapons taken in
                    the first instance from his own personal history, but also from the wide world
                    of human culture, ancient and modern. Carl Schwarz happily remarks that, as the
                    English apologists of the 18th century were themselves infected with the poison
                    of the deists whom they endeavoured to refute, so Tholuck absorbed some of the
                    heresies of the rationalists whom he tried to overthrow. As a preacher Tholuck
                    ranked amongst the foremost of his time. He was also one of the prominent
                    members of the Evangelical Alliance, and few men were more widely known or more
                    beloved throughout the Protestant churches of Europe and America than he. He
                    died at Halle, June 10, 1877.</p>
                <p>After his commentaries (on Romans, the Gospel of John, the Sermon on the Mount,
                    and the Epistle to the Hebrews) and several volumes of sermons, his best-known
                    books are <hi rend="italic">Stunden christlicher Andacht</hi> (1839, 8th ed.
                    1870), intended to take the place of Zschokke’s standard rationalistic work with
                    the same title, and his reply to Strauss’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus
                    (Glaubivürdigkeit</hi><hi rend="italic">der evangelischen</hi><pb break="no"

                    published at various times valuable contributions towards a history of
                    rationalism, — <hi rend="italic">Vorgeschichte des Rationalismus</hi> (1853-62),

                    essays connected with the history of theology and especially of apologetics. His
