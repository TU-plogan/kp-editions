                    circulating religious treatises or books. The circulation of short treatises for
                    the promotion of Christian knowledge is older than the invention of printing.
                    Wickliffe, for instance, was a great writer and circulator of tracts, employing
                    his Oxford friends and pupils to multiply copies. So was Luther in his day, with
                    the help by that time of printer and bookseller. In later times John Wesley was
                    a busy worker in this way; and Hannah More, from her own pen, produced what were
                    known as the “Cheap Repository Tracts,” highly lauded by Bishop Porteus, and
                    widely used towards the close of the 18th century. Before this time there had
                    been efforts of associated labour for the same object, a “book society for
                    promoting religious knowledge among the poor” having been established in 1750. A
                    similar society was formed at Edinburgh in 1793. But it was at the close of the
                    century, in 1799, that there was founded in London the Religious Tract Society,
                    an institution unparalleled in the extent and variety of its operations, and the
                    parent of numerous societies in different parts of the empire as well as in the
                    United States and on the continent of Europe. There are other associations with
                    kindred objects, but in connexion with particular ecclesiastical systems. Thus
                    the tract department of the Christian Knowledge Society is specially connected
                    with the Church of England; and the Wesleyans, Baptists, and other denominations
                    have their own tract societies. The Church of Rome also has now similar
                    associations. The Religious Tract Society is alone in being confined to the
                    diffusion of religious truth common to all Protestant Christians, to the
                    exclusion of topics touched by ecclesiastical divisions. This catholicity is
                    secured by the fundamental rules of the society, and by its managing committee
                    being composed half of Churchmen and half of Nonconformists of all
                    denominations.</p>
                <p>A brief statement of the proceedings of the Religious Tract Society, as presented
                    in its latest annual <hi rend="italic">Report,</hi> will best serve to show the
                    general objects and operations of all such organizations,— any special or varied
                    action elsewhere adopted being noted as we proceed. The main object of the
                    society is the preparation and publication of religious literature. At first
                    this consisted mostly of tracts and small treatises. After a time larger books
                    were published, including series of reprinted works of the early Reformers and
                    English Protestant theologians and Biblical expositors, and also books on common
                    subjects treated in a religious spirit. The society also issues magazines for
                    all classes. Four of these periodicals, the <hi rend="italic">Leisure Hour,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">Sunday at Home,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Boys' Own
                    Paper,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Girls' Own Paper,</hi> have a united
                    circulation, including monthly parts and yearly volumes, of nearly 600,000
                    numbers weekly, or above 30 millions in the year. The total annual issue,
                    including books, tracts, &amp;c., at home and abroad, is nearly 86 millions.</p>
                <p>The distribution of this is chiefly through the ordinary channels of trade, with
                    the exception of the tracts, which are circulated by home and foreign missionary
                    societies, and various agencies public and private. Almost every missionary
                    agency is indebted to the Religious Tract Society for the work carried on
                    through the press. Grants are made, either free or as nearly as possible at cost
                    price; and, when it is advisable to produce publications at foreign stations,
                    grants of paper and other material, as well as money payments, are voted. The
                    publications are in almost every tongue, the list containing works in 174
                    languages and dialects.</p>
                <p>The funds for this large and varied work come partly from donations,
                    subscriptions, and legacies, but chiefly from the profits of the sales of the
                    society’s publications. The total missionary and evangelistic expenditure in the
                    year ending March 31, 1886, amounted to £47,722, of which £19,019 was supplied
                    from the trade funds, which have also borne the entire cost of management, both
                    of the business and missionary departments. The total amount received from
                    sales, subscriptions, and all other sources was £212,731, 11s. 8d.</p>
                <p>The American Tract Society and some of the Continental societies undertake the
                    distribution as well as the production of tracts and books, by means of paid
                    colporteurs and other agents. The Continental societies produce most of their
                    own books and tracts, aided largely by grants of money and paper from the
                    Religious Tract Society.</p>
