                        >Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus,</hi> is the earliest ancl after
                    Augustine the greatest of the ancient church writers of the°West. Before him the
                    whole Christian literature in the Latin language consisted of a translation of
                    the Bible, the <hi rend="italic">Octavius</hi> of Minucius Felix—an apologetic
                    treatise written in the Ciceronian style for the higher circles of society, and
                    with no evident effect for the church as a whole—and a list of the books
                    recognized as canonical (the so-called Muratorian fragment). Whether Victor the
                    Roman bishop and Apollonius the Roman senator ever really made an appearance as
                    Latin authors is quite uncertain. Tertullian in fact created Christian Latin
                    literature; one might almost say that that literature sprang from him
                    full-grown, alike in form and substance, as Athene from the head of Zeus.
                    Cyprian polished the language that Tertullian had made, sifted the thoughts he
                    had given out, rounded them off, and turned them into current coin, but he never
                    ceased to be aware of his dependence on Tertullian, whom he designated as <hi
                        rend="italic">κατ’ eξoχην</hi> his master (Jer., <hi rend="italic">De Vir.
                        III.,</hi> 53). Augustine, again, stood on the shoulders of Tertullian and
                    Cyprian; and these three North Africans are the fathers of the Western
                    churches.</p>
                <p>Tertullian’s place in universal history is determined by</p>
                <p>(1) his intellectual and spiritual endowments, (2) his moral force and
                    evangelical fervour, (3) the course of his personal development, (4) the
                    circumstances of the time in the midst of which he worked.</p>
                <p>(1) Tertullian was a man of great originality and genius, characterized by the
                    deepest pathos, the liveliest fancy, and the most penetrating keenness, and was
                    endowed with ability to appropriate and make use of all the methods of
                    observation and speculation, and with the readiest wit. His writings in tone and
                    character are always alike “rich in thought and destitute of form, passionate
                    and hairsplitting, eloquent and pithy in expression, energetic and condensed to
                    the point of obscurity.” His style has been characterized with justice as dark
                    and resplendent like ebony. His eloquence was of the vehement order; but it wins
                    hearers and readers by the strength of its passion, the energy of its truth, the
                    pregnancy and elegance of its expression, just as much as it repels them by its
                    heat without light, its sophistical argumentations, and its elaborate
                    hair-splittings. Though he is wanting in moderation and in luminous w armth, his
                    tones are by no means always harsh; and as an author he ever aspired with
                    longing after humility and love and patience, though his whole life was lived in
                    the atmosphere of conflict. Tertullian both as a man and as a writer had much in
                    common with the apostle Paul.</p>
                <p>(2) In spite of all the contradictions in which he involved himself as a thinker
                    and as a teacher, Tertullian was a compact ethical personality. What he was he
                    was with his whole being. Once a Christian, he was determined to be so with all
                    his soul, and to shake himself free of all half measures and compromises with
                    the world. It is not difficult to lay one’s finger upon very many obliquities,
                    self-deceptions, and sophisms in Tertullian in matters of detail, for he
                    struggled for years to reconcile things that were in themselves irreconcilable;
                    yet in each case the perversities and sophisms were rather the outcome of
                    peculiarly difficult circumstances in which he stood. It is easy to convict him
                    of having failed to control the glowing passion that was in him. He is often
                    outrageously unjust in the substance of what he says, and in manner harsh to
                    cynicism, scornful to gruesomeness; but in no battle that he fought was he ever
                    actuated by selfish interests. What he did was really done for the Gospel, as he
                    understood it, with all the faculties of his soul. But he understood the Gospel
                    as being primarily an assured hope and a holy law, as fear of the Judge who can
                    cast into hell and as an inflexible rule of faith and of discipline. Of the
                    glorious liberty of the children of God he had nothing but a mere presentiment;
                    he looked for it only in the world beyond the grave, and under the power of the
                    Gospel he counted as loss all the world could give. He well understood the
                    meaning of Christ’s saying that He came not into the world to bring peace, but a
                    sword: in a period when a lax spirit of conformity to the world had seized the
                    churches he maintained the “vigor evangelicus” not merely against the Gnostics
                    but against opportunists and a worldly-wise clergy. Among all the fathers of the
                    first three centuries Tertullian has given the most powerful expression to the
                    terrible earnestness of the Gospel.</p>
                <p>(3) The course of Tertullian’s personal development fitted him in an altogether
                    remarkable degree to be a teacher of the church. Born at Carthage of good family
                    —his father was a “centurio consularis”—he received a first-rate education both
                    in Latin and in Greek. He was able to speak and write Greek, and gives evidence
                    of familiarity alike with its prose and with its poetry; and his excellent
                    memory—though he himself complains about it—enabled him always to bring in at
                    the right place an appropriate, often brilliant, quotation or some historical
                    allusion. The old historians, from Herodotus to Tacitus, were familiar to him,
                    and the accuracy of his historical knowledge is astonishing. He studied with
                    earnest zeal the Greek philosophers; Plato in particular, and the writings of
                    the Stoics, he had fully at command, and his treatise <hi rend="italic">De
                        Anima</hi> shows that he himself was able to investigate and discuss
                    philosophical problems. From the philosophers he had been led to the medical
                    writers, whose treatises plainly had a place in his working library. But no
                    portion of this rich store of miscellaneous knowledge has left its
                    characteristic impress on his writings; this influence was reserved for his
                    legal training. His father, whose military spirit reveals itself in the whole
                    bearing of Tertullian, to whom Christianity was above everything a “militia,”
                    had intended him for the law. He studied in Carthage, probably also in Rome,
                    where, according to Eusebius, he enjoyed the reputation of being one of the most
                    eminent jurists. This statement derives confirmation from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Digest,</hi> where references are made to two works, <hi rend="italic">De
                        Castrensi Peculio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Quaestionum Libri VIII.</hi>,
                    of a Roman jurist named Tertullian, who must have flourished about 180 A.D. In
                    point of fact the quondam advocate never disappeared in the Christian presbyter.
                    This was at once his strength and his weakness: his strength, for as a
                    professional pleader he had learned how to deal with an adversary according to
                    the rules of the art—to pull to pieces his theses, to reduce him <hi
                        rend="italic">ad absurdum,</hi> and to show the defects and contradictions
                    of his statements,—and was specially qualified to expose the irregularities in
                    the proceedings taken by the state against the Christians; but it was also his
                    weakness, for it was responsible for his litigiousness, his often doubtful
                    shifts and artifices, his sophisms and <hi rend="italic">argumentationes ad
                        hominem,</hi> his fallacies and surprises. At Rome in mature manhood
                    Tertullian became a Christian, under what circumstances we do not know, and
                    forthwith he bent himself with all his energy to the study of Scripture and of
                    Christian literature. Not only was he master of the contents of the Bible: he
                    also read carefully the works of Hermas, Justin, Tatian, Miltiades, Melito,
                    Irenaeus, Proculus, Clement, as well as many Gnostic treatises, the writings of
                    Marcion in particular. In apologetics his principal master was Justin, and in
                    theology proper and in the controversy with the Gnostics, Irenaeus. As a thinker
                    he was not original, and even as a theologian he has produced but few new
                    schemes of doctrine, except his doctrine of sin. His special gift lay <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0210-0197"/> in the power to make what had been
                    traditionally received impressive, to give to it its proper form, and to gain
                    for it new currency. From Rome Tertullian visited Greece and perhaps also Asia
                    Minor; at any rate we know that he had temporary relations with the churches
                    there. He was consequently placed in a position in which he could check the
                    doctrine and practice of the Roman Church. Thus equipped with knowledge and
                    experience, he returned to Carthage and there laid the foundation of Latin
                    Christian literature. At first, after his conversion, he wrote Greek, but by and
                    by Latin almost exclusively. The elements of this Christian Latin language may
                    be enumerated as follows :—(i.) it had its origin, not in the literary language
                    of Rome as developed by Cicero, but in the language of the people as we find it
                    in Plautus and Terence; (ii.) it has an African complexion; (iii.) it is
                    strongly influenced by Greek, particularly through the Latin translation of the
                    Septuagint and of the New Testament, besides being sprinkled with a large number
                    of Greek words derived from the Scriptures or from the Greek liturgies; (iv.) it
                    bears the stamp of the Gnostic style and contains also some military
                    expressions; (v.) it owes something to the original creative power of
                    Tertullian. As for his theology, its leading factors were—-(i.) the teachings of
                    the apologists; (ii.) the philosophy of the Stoics; (iii.) the rule of faith,
                    interpreted in an anti-Gnostic sense, as he had received it from the Church of
                    Rome; (iv.) the Soterio-logical theology of Melito and Irenaeus; (v.) the
                    substance of the utterances of the Montanist prophets (in the closing decades of
                    his life). This analysis does not disclose, nor indeed is it possible to
                    discover, what was the determining element for Tertullian; in fact he was under
                    the dominion of more than one ruling principle, and he felt himself bound by
                    several mutually opposing authorities. It was his desire to unite the enthusiasm
                    of primitive Christianity with intelligent thought, the original demands of the
                    Gospel with every letter of the Scriptures and with the practice of the Roman
                    Church, the sayings of the Paraclete with the authority of the bishops, the law
                    of the churches with the freedom of the inspired, the rigid discipline of the
                    Montanist with all the utterances of the New Testament and with the arrangements
                    of a church seeking to set itself up within the world. At this task he toiled
                    for years, involved in contradictions which it took all the finished skill of
                    the jurist to conceal from him for a time. At last he felt compelled to break
                    off from the church for which he had lived and fought; but the breach could not
                    clear him from the contradictions in which he found himself entangled. Not only
                    did the great chasm between the old Christianity, to which his soul clung, and
                    the Christianity of the Scriptures as juristically and philosophically
                    interpreted remain unbridged; he also clung fast, in spite of his separation
                    from the Catholic church, to his position that the church possesses the true
                    doctrine, that the bishops <hi rend="italic">per successionem</hi> are the
                    repositories of the grace of the teaching office, and so forth. The growing
                    violence of his latest works is to be accounted for, not only by his burning
                    indignation against the everadvancing secularization of the Catholic church, but
                    also by the incompatibility between the authorities which he recognized and yet
                    was not able to reconcile. After having done battle with heathens, Jews,
                    Marcionites, Gnostics, Monarchians, and the Catholics, he died an old man,
                    carrying with him to the grave the last remains of primitive Christianity in the
                    West, but at the same time in conflict with himself.</p>
                <p>(4) What has just been said brings out very clearly how important in their
                    bearing on Tertullian’s development were the circumstances of the age in which
                    he laboured. His activity as a Christian falls between 190 and 220, a period of
                    very great moment in the history of the Catholic church; for within it the
                    struggle with Gnosticism was brought to a. victorious close, the New Testament
                    established a firm footing within the churches, the “apostolic” rules which
                    thenceforward regulated all the affairs of the church were called into
                    existence, and the ecclesiastical priesthood came to be developed. Within this
                    period also falls that evangelical and legal reaction against the political and
                    secular tendencies of the church which is known as Montanism. The same
                    Tertullian who had fortified the Catholic church against Gnosticism was none the
                    less anxious to protect it from becoming a political organization. Being unable
                    to reconcile incompatibles, he broke with the church and became the most
                    powerful representative of Montanism in the West.</p>
                <p>Although Tertullian’s extant works are both numerous and copious, our knowledge
                    of his life is very vague. He cannot have been born much later than about 150.
                    His activity as a jurist in Rome must fall within the period of Commodus; for
                    there is no indication in his writings that he was in Rome in the time of Marcus
                    Aurelius, and many passages seem to preclude the supposition. The date of his
                    conversion to Christianity is quite uncertain; there is much in favour of the
                    years between 190 and 195. How long he remained in Rome after becoming a
                    Christian, whether he had attained any office in the church before leaving Rome,
                    what was the date of his visit to Greece,—on these points also we remain in
                    ignorance. It is certain that he was settled in Carthage in the second half of
                    197, the date of his writing his <hi rend="italic">Apοlοgeticus</hi> and
                    (shortly afterwards) his two books <hi rend="italic">Ad Nationes·,</hi> we also
                    know that he became a presbyter in Carthage and was married. His recognition of
                    the Montanistic prophecy in Phrygia as a work of God took place in 202-203, at
                    the time when a new persecution broke out. For the next five years it was his
                    constant endeavour to secure the victory for Montanism within the church; but in
                    this he became involved more and more deeply in controversy with the majority of
                    the church in Carthage and especially with its clergy, which had the support of
                    the clergy of Rome. As Jerome writes <hi rend="italic">{De Vir. III.,</hi> 53):
                    “Usque ad mediam aetatem presbyter fuit ecclesiae Africanae, invidia postea et
                    contumeliis clericorum Romanae ecclesiae ad Montani dogma delapsus.” On his
                    breach with the Catholic church, probably in 207-208, he became the head of a
                    small Montanist community in Carthage. In this position he continued to labour,
                    to write, and to assail the lax Catholics and their clergy until at least the
                    time of Bishop Calixtus in the reign of Elagabalus. The year of his death is
                    uncertain. Jerome <hi rend="italic">{ut sup.)</hi> says: “Fertur vixisse usque
                    ad decrepitam aetatem.” That he returned at last to the bosom of the Catholic
                    church is a mere legend, the motive of which is obvious; his adherents after his
                    death continued to maintain themselves as a small community in Carthage.
                    Although he had left the church, his earlier writings continued to be
                    extensively read; and in the 4th century his works, along with those of Cyprian,
                    were the principal reading of Western Christians, until they were superseded by
                    those of Jerome, Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory. Jerome has included him in his
                    catalogue of Christian “viri illustres,” but only as a Catholic to whom
                    reference should be made with caution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The works of Tertullian, on the chronology of which a great deal has been
                    written, and which for the most part do not admit of being dated with perfect
                    certainty, fall into three classes,—the apologetic, the polemical theological,
                    and the ascetic. And in point of time also three periods can be readily
                    distinguished, the years 202-203 and 207-208 constituting the divisions. Some of
                    the things he wrote have unfortunately disappeared,—in particular the <hi

                        Virginibus Velandis</hi> in Greek; his works in Latin on the same subjects
                    have survived.</p>

                        Feminarum Libri II., De Testimonio Animae</hi> (written soon after the <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">De Baptismo Haereticorum</hi> (now lost), <hi
                        rend="italic">De Baptismo, De Pernitentia, De Oratione</hi> (the last three
                    written for catechumens), <hi rend="italic">De Patientia, Ad Uxorem Libri IL, De

                    (in its first form). The <hi rend="italic">Apologeticus,</hi> which in the 3d
                    century was translated into Greek, is the weightiest work in defence of
                    Christianity of the first two centuries. Respecting its relation to the <hi

                    present writer it seems unquestionable that Tertullian’s work was the later. Of
                    great moment also is the <hi rend="italic">De Praescriptione Haereticorum,</hi>
                    in which the jurist is more clearly heard than the Christian. The <hi

                    Academy is about to publish an edition by Reifferscheid. There are German

                    appears in Clark’s Ante-Nicene Theological Library. Separate treatises of

                    Havercamp (1718), Oehler (1849), and Kayser (1865); the <hi rend="italic">Ad
