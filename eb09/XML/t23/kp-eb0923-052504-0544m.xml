                <p><label type="entry">TREASON</label>. The law which punishes treason is a
                    necessary consequence of the idea of a state, and is essential to the existence
                    of the state. Most, if not all, nations have accordingly, at an early period of
                    their history, made provision by legislation or otherwise for the punishment of
                    those offences against public order which consist in more or less direct attacks
                    upon the safety of the state or its chief. The principle is universal; it is the
                    application of the principle which leads to differences of opinion. What would
                    have been a capital crime at Rome under Tiberius may be no offence at all in
                    England. It is to the advantage of both the state and the citizen that what is
                    treason and what is not should be clearly defined, so that as little as possible
                    discretionary power, apt to be strained in times of popular excitement, should
                    be left to the judicial or executive authorities. The importance of this was
                    seen by Montesquieu. Vagueness in the crime of treason, says he, is sufficient
                    to make the government degenerate into despotism.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Esprit des Lois,</hi> bk.
                    xii. c. 7.</p></note> At the same time, it may be observed that despotic
                    Governments have not always left the crime undefined. The object of Henry VIII.,
                    for instance, was rather to define it as closely as possible by making certain
                    acts treason which would not have been so without such definition. In both
                    ancient and modern history treason has generally been a crime prosecuted by
                    exceptional procedure, and visited with <hi rend="italic">afflictive</hi> as
                    distinguished from <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> punishments (to use the
                    terminology of Bentham).</p>
                <p>In Roman law the offences originally falling under the head of treason were
                    almost exclusively those committed in military service, such as in England would
                    be dealt with under the Army Act. The very name <hi rend="italic"
                    >perduellio,</hi> the name of the crime in the older Roman law, is a proof of
                    this. <hi rend="italic">Perduelles</hi> were, strictly, public enemies who bore
                    arms against the state; and traitors were regarded as having no more rights than
                    public enemies. The Twelve Tables made it punishable with death to communicate
                    with the enemy or to betray a citizen to the enemy. Other kinds of <hi
                    rend="italic">perduellio</hi> were punished by interdiction of fire and water.
                    The crime was tried before a special tribunal, the <hi rend="italic">duumviri
                    perduellionis,</hi> perhaps the earliest permanent criminal court existing at
                    Rome. At a later period the <pb break="no"

                    place to that of <hi rend="italic">laesa majestas, deminuta</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">minuta majestas,</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic">majestas.</hi>
                    The lex Julia majestatis, to which the date of 48 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    has been conjecturally assigned, continued to be the basis of the Roman law of
                    treason until the latest period of the empire. The original text of the law
                    appears to have still dealt with what were chiefly military offences, such as
                    sending letters or messages to the enemy, giving up a standard or fortress, and
                    desertion. With the empire the law of <hi rend="italic">majestas</hi> received
                    an enormous development, mainly in the reign of Tiberius, and led to the rise of
                    a class of professional informers, called <hi rend="italic">delatores.</hi><note

                    time of Justinian is contained chiefly in the titles of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>xlviii.
                    4.</p></note> and <hi rend="italic">Code</hi><note anchored="true"

                    >Digest</hi> (taken from Ulpian) is this: “majestatis crimen illud est quod
                    adversus populum Romanun vel adversus securitatem ejus committitur.” Of treasons
                    other than military offences, some of the more noticeable were the raising of an
                    army or levying war without the command of the emperor, the questioning of the
                    emperor’s choice of a successor, the murder of (or conspiracy to murder)
                    hostages or certain magistrates of high rank, the occupation of public places,
                    the meeting within the city of persons hostile to the state with weapons or
                    stones, incitement to sedition or administration of unlawful oaths, release of
                    prisoners justly confined, falsification of public documents, and failure of a
                    provincial governor to quit his province at the expiration of his office or to
                    deliver his army to his successor. The intention <hi rend="italic"
                    >(voluntas)</hi> was punishable as much as an overt act <hi rend="italic"
                    >(effectus).</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    similar provision was contained in the Golden Bull of Charles IV. c. 24. In
                    English law, with the one exception of a statute of Richard II. (21 Ric. II. c.
                    3) repealed in the first year of Henry IV., an overt act has always been
                    necessary. The difficulty of proving a mere intention is obvious. In French and
                    German law the overt act <hi rend="italic">(attentat or Unternehmen)</hi> is as
                    indispensable as in English.</p></note> The reported opinions as to what was not
                    treason show the lengths to which the theory of treason must have been carried
                    by at least some person in authority. It was not treason to repair a statue of
                    the emperor which had decayed from age, to hit such a statue with a stone thrown
                    by chance, to melt down such a statue if unconsecrated, to use mere verbal
                    insults against the emperor, to fail in keeping an oath sworn by the emperor, or
                    to decide a case contrary to an imperial constitution. Treason was one of the
                    “publica judicia,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one of those crimes in which any
                    citizen was entitled to prosecute. The law went further than this, and deprived
                    the accused in a charge of treason of his ordinary remedy for malicious
                    prosecution. It also took from him the privilege (which those accused of other
                    crimes generally possessed) from accusation by women or infamous persons, from
                    liability to be put to the torture, and from having his slaves tortured against
                    him (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Torture).</hi> The punishment from the time of
                    Tiberius was death (usually by beheading)<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>To harbour a fugitive enemy was punishable only by
                    deportation, <hi rend="italic">Dig</hi>., xlviii. 19, 40.</p></note> and
                    confiscation of property, coupled with complete civil disability. A traitor
                    could not make a will or a gift or emancipate a slave. Even the death of the
                    accused, if guilty of treason of the gravest kind, such as levying war against
                    the state, did not extinguish the charge, but the memory of the deceased became
                    infamous, and his property was forfeited as though he had been convicted in his
                    lifetime.</p>
                <p>The law of England corresponds to a considerable extent with Roman law; in fact,
                    treason is made by Blackstone the equivalent of the <hi rend="italic">crimen
                    laesae majestatis.</hi> The history of the crime in the two systems agrees in
                    this that in both the law was settled by legislation at a comparatively early
                    period, and subsequently developed by judicial construction. In both, too, there
                    were exceptional features distinguishing this crime from other offences.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The position of treason as a
                    special crime prosecuted by special procedure is one common to most legal
                    systems at some period of their existence. For instance, in Germany, by a
                    constitution of Henry VII. the procedure was to be summary, <hi rend="italic"
                    >sine strepitu et figura judicii.</hi></p></note> For instance, at common law
                    treason was not bailable (except by the Queen’s Bench) or clergyable, could not
                    be cleared by sanctuary, and did not admit of accessories, for all were
                    principals, nor could a married woman plead coercion by her husband. To stand
                    mute and refuse to plead did not save the lands of the accused, as it did in
                    felony, so that the “peine forte et dure” (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Torture)</hi> was unnecessary in treason. These severities were due to the
                    conception of treason as a breach of the oath of allegiance. Other differences
                    introduced by statute will be mentioned later. In some cases a statute simply
                    affirmed the common law, as did the Statute of Treasons to a great extent, and
                    as did 26 Hen. VIII. c. 13, depriving those accused of treason of the benefit of
                    sanctuary. How far the Roman law was consciously imitated in England it is
                    impossible to determine. It was certainly not adopted to its full extent, for
                    many acts were <hi rend="italic">majestas</hi> which were never treason, even in
                    the most despotic periods. Treason was the subject of legislation in many of the
                    pre-Conquest codes. The laws of Alfred<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>c. 4.</p></note> and Aethelred<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>V. 30.</p></note> punished with death any one
                    plotting against the life of the king. Soon after the Conquest the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leges Henrici Primi</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>lxxix. 2.</p></note> put any one slaying the king’s
                    messenger in the king’s mercy. The crime was shortly defined by Glanvill<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>xiv. 1.</p></note> and at
                    greater length by Bracton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">b</hi>.</p></note> who follows Roman law closely. He
                    includes under treason sedition and coining. Treason seems to have rested
                    chiefly, if not wholly, upon common law until the year 1352, when the famous
                    Statute of Treasons (25 Edw. III. st. 5, c. 2) was passed. The statute appears
                    to have arisen from a petition of the Commons in 1348, praying for a definition
                    of the offence of accroaching royal power, a charge on which several
                    persons—notably Gaveston and the Despencers—had suffered. The offences made
                    treason by the statute are these:—(1) to compass or imagine<note anchored="true"

                    violate the king’s companion, or his eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of
                    his eldest son and heir; (3) to levy war against the king in his realm, or be
                    adherent to the king’s enemies in his realm, giving them aid and comfort in the
                    realm or elsewhere; (4) to counterfeit the king’s great or privy seal or his
                    money; (5) to bring false money into the realm, counterfeit to the money of
                    England, as the money called Lushburgh,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Luxemburg.</p></note> knowing
                    the money to be false; (6) to slay the chancellor, treasurer, or the king’s
                    justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assize,
                    and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places
                    doing their offices. The statute further defined petty treason to be the slaying
                    of a master by his servant, a husband by his wife, or a prelate by a man secular
                    or religious owing him allegiance. In all cases of treason not specified in the
                    statute the justices before whom the case came were to tarry without going to
                    judgment until the cause had been <pb break="no"

                    parliament whether it ought to be judged treason or felony. The statute, so far
                    as it defines the offence, is still law, except the clauses as to counterfeiting
                    the seal, coining, and petit treason, repealed respectively, after a
                    considerable amount of intermediate modification by statute, by 11 Geo. IV. and
                    1 Will. IV. c. 66, 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 34, 30 Geo. III. c. 48, and 9 Geo. IV.
                    c. 31. Petit treason is now treated as murder, 24 and 25 Vict. c. 100.<note

                    known.</p></note> From the time of the passing of the Statute of Treasons the
                    limits of treason were continually being extended for a time, and again reduced
                    to the bounds fixed by the statute. It protected only the king’s life, and its
                    insufficiency was supplemented in periods of danger by legislation, often of a
                    temporary nature. Under Richard II. and Henry VIII. many new offences were made
                    treason,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One reason for
                    making these offences treason rather than felony was no doubt to give the crown
                    rather than the lord of the fee the right to the real estate of the criminal on
                    forfeiture. Had the offences been felony the king would have had only his year,
                    day, and waste on the estate escheating to the lord, as was the case in treason
                    before the Statute of Treasons (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Felony).</hi></p></note> but the Acts creating these new treasons were repealed
                    at the earliest opportunity by the parliaments of their successors, and the
                    Statute of Treasons was made the final standard by 1 Mary, sess. 1, c. 1. The
                    reign most prolific in statutory additions to the law of treason was undoubtedly
                    that of Henry VIII. Legislation in this reign was little more than a register of
                    the fluctuating opinions of the monarch. Thus, by 25 Hen. VIII. c. 22 it was
                    treason not to believe Mary illegitimate and Elizabeth legitimate; by 28 Hen.
                    VIII. c. 7 it was treason to believe either legitimate; by 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1 it
                    was treason not to believe both legitimate. An interesting act of this reign, 37
                    Hen. VIII. c. 10, shows that a class of men like the Roman <hi rend="italic"
                    >delatores</hi> must have been called into existence by all the new legislation.
                    The Act constituted it felony to make anonymous charges of treason without
                    daring to appear in support of them before the king or council. Out of the mass
                    of Henry VIII.’s Acts, only two are still law,—28 Hen. VIII. c. 15 and 35 Hen.
                    VIII. c. 2, giving power to try treasons committed within the jurisdiction of
                    the admiralty and out of the realm. Many other instances of offences of a
                    temporary kind made treason at different times occur among the statutes,
                    especially in those levelled at the papal jurisdiction by the parliaments of
                    Elizabeth. A few of the more interesting of other kinds may be briefly noticed.
                    It was treason by 21 Ric. II. c. 4 to attempt to appeal or annul judgments made
                    by parliament against certain traitors; by 2 Hen. V. st. 1, c. 6, and 29 Hen.
                    VI. c. 2 to break a truce or safe-conduct; by 5 and 6 Edward VI. c. 11 to hold
                    castles, fortresses, or munitions of war against the king; by 17 Car. II. c. 5
                    to adhere to the United Provinces; by 9 Will. III. c. 1 to return without
                    licence if an adherent of the Pretender; by 12 and 13 Will. III. c. 3 to
                    correspond with the Pretender; and by 57 Geo. III. c. 6 to compass or imagine
                    the death of the prince regent. In addition to these, many Acts of attainder
                    were passed at different times. One of the most severe was that against
                    Catherine Howard, 33 Hen. VIII. c. 21, which went as far as to make it
                    treasonable for any queen to conceal her antenuptial incontinence. Other Acts
                    were those against Archbishop Scrope, Owen Glendower, Jack Cade, Lord Seymour,
                    Sir John Fenwick, James Stuart, and Bishop Atterbury. In one case, that of
                    Cromwell, Ireton, and Bradshaw, an Act of attainder was passed after the death
                    of those guilty of the treason, 12 Car. II. c. 30. At times</p>
                <p>Acts of indemnity were passed to relieve those who had taken part in the
                    suppression of rebellion from any possible liability for illegal proceedings.
                    Three such Acts were passed in the reign of William III.</p>
                <p>The Statute of Treasons, as interpreted by the judges, is still the standard by
                    which an act is determined to be treason or not. The judicial interpretation has
                    been sometimes strained to meet cases scarcely within the contemplation of the
                    framers of the statute: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> it became established
                    doctrine that a conspiracy to levy war against the king’s person or to imprison
                    or depose him might be given in evidence as an overt act of compassing his
                    death, and that spoken words, though they could not in themselves amount to
                    treason, might constitute an overt act, and so be evidence. Besides decisions on
                    particular cases, the judges at different times came to general resolutions
                    which had an appreciable effect on the law. The principal resolutions were those
                    of 1397 (confirmed by 21 Ric. II. c. 12), of 1557, and those agreed to in the
                    case of the regicides at the Restoration and reported by Sir John Kelyng. A
                    remarkable resolution <hi rend="italic">in favorem rei</hi> among the latter was
                    that a prisoner ought not to be ironed during trial. The result of judicial
                    decisions on the Statute of Treasons was summed up in Acts passed in 1786, made
                    permanent in 1817 and in 1848 (57 Geo. III. c. 6 and 11 Vict. c. 12, the latter
                    often called the Treason Felony Act). The effect of this legislation, according
                    to Mr Justice Stephen, is that such of the judicial constructions as extend the
                    imagining of the king’s death to imagining his death, destruction, or any bodily
                    harm tending to death or destruction, maim or wounding, imprisonment or
                    restraint, have been adopted, while such of the constructions as make the
                    imagining of his deposition conspiring to levy war against him, and instigating
                    foreigners to invade the realm, have not been abolished, but are left to rest on
                    the authority of decided cases. The present state of the law has been
                    incorporated by skilled lawyers in the draft criminal code, which will no doubt
                    become an Act when parliament has leisure to devote to matters of this kind. The
                    code draws a distinction between treason and treasonable crimes, the former
                    including such acts (omitting those that are obviously obsolete) as by the
                    Statute of Treasons and subsequent legislation are regarded as treason proper,
                    the latter including the crimes contained in the Act of 1848. In the words of
                    the code (§ 76) “treason is (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) the act of killing Her
                    Majesty, or doing her any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim or

                    eldest son and heir-apparent of Her Majesty, or the queen consort of any king of

                    the forming and manifesting by an overt act an intention to kill the eldest son

                    with any person to kill Her Majesty, or to do her any bodily harm tending to

                    imprison or restrain her; or (<hi rend="italic">f</hi>) levying war against Her

                    Ireland or of any other of Her Majesty’s dominions or countries; or in order by
                    force or constraint to compel Her Majesty to change her measures or counsels, or
                    in order to intimidate or overawe both Houses or either House of Parliament; or
                    (<hi rend="italic">g</hi>) conspiring to levy war against Her Majesty with any
                    such intent or for any such purpose as aforesaid; or (A) instigating any

                    Her Majesty in such war by any means whatsoever; or (y) violating, whether with

                    heir-apparent for the time being of the king or queen regnant.” There are a few
                    other Acts still in force besides those of 1817 and 1848 which have dealt with
                    substantive law. By 11 Henry VII. c. 1 obedience to the <hi rend="italic">de
                    facto</hi> sovereign for the time being is not treason. By 1 Anne st. 2, c. 21,
                    it is treason to endeavour to hinder the next successor to the crown from
                    succeeding, and by 6 Anne c. 41 it is treason to maliciously, advisedly, and
                    directly by writing or printing maintain and affirm that any person has a right
                    to the crown otherwise than according to the Acts of Settlement and Union, or
                    that the crown and parliament cannot pass statutes for the limitation of the
                    succession to the crown.</p>
                <p>The Acts dealing with procedure and punishment are more numerous, and are
                    characterized by a slowly increasing favour shown to the accused,—in fact,
                    considerably greater than in felony, for counsel were not allowed to prisoners
                    in charges of felony until 1836, and such prisoners are still not entitled to a
                    copy of the indictment or the names of the witnesses or jury. With respect to
                    the mode of trial, the effect of common law and legislation is that there are
                    now four varieties,— <hi rend="smallcaps">Impeachment (</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    as regards appeals in the common law courts or in parliament, by the effect of
                    several statutes passed between 1332 and 1399. Appeals of treason were finally

                    Traitors in the reign of Edward 1V., and perhaps later, were at times tried by
                    martial law. The issue of commissions of martial law in time of peace was
                    declared illegal by the Petition of Right in 1628. The prerogative of the crown
                    to try traitors by martial law in time of open rebellion still exists, and is
                    recognized by statute. In two Acts, for instance, dealing with Ireland, 43 Geo.
                    III. c. 117 and 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 4, it was provided that nothing in the Acts
                    was to take away the undoubted prerogative of the crown for the public safety to
                    resort to the exercise of martial law against open enemies and traitors. A peer
                    is tried before the House of Lords, or the court of the lord high steward if the
                    trial be during the recess of parliament. Procedure in such trials is regulated
                    by 7 and 8 Will. III. c. 3, and other Acts. The last trial of a peer for treason
                    was that of Lord Lovat in 1746-47. Persons subject to naval or military law are
                    triable by court martial in certain cases under the powers given by the Naval
                    Discipline Act, 1866, and the Army Act, 1881. The trial of treason committed out
                    of the realm is regulated by 35 Hen. VIII. c. 2, 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11, and 7
                    Anne c. 21. Lord Macguire was tried by jury in England under 35 Hen. VIII. c. 2
                    for treason committed in Ireland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Procedure before and at the trial depends upon a large number of Acts, of which
                    the most important is one passed in 1695 (7 and 8 Will. III. c. 3). It enacted
                    that persons indicted for treason are to have a copy of the indictment delivered
                    to them five days before trial. The court is empowered to assign counsel for the
                    prisoner (a power extended to impeachments by 20 Geo. II. c. 30). The oath of
                    two witnesses, or confession in open court, or refusal to plead, or peremptory
                    challenge of more than thirty-five jurors is necessary for conviction. The
                    witnesses must be both to the same overt act or one to one and the other to
                    another overt act of the same treason. If two or more treasons of divers kinds
                    are alleged in one indictment, one witness to prove one treason and another to
                    prove another are not sufficient. No person is to be indicted unless within
                    three years after the offence, except on a charge of attempted assassination of
                    the king. The accused is to have copies of the panel of the jury<note

                    entitled to the same process to compel his witnesses to appear as is usually
                    granted to compel the witnesses for the prosecution. No evidence is to be given
                    of any overt act not expressly laid in the indictment. The Act expressly denied
                    the prisoner the names of the witnesses against him. The law on this point was
                    altered by 7 Anne c. 21, which enacted that a list of such witnesses was to be
                    delivered to him ten days before trial. Such witnesses had previously been made
                    examinable upon oath by 1 Anne st. 2, c. 9. By 5 and 6 Vict. c. 51 (extending
                    the provisions of an Act of 1800) the advantages given by the Act of William
                    III. are not to extend to a prisoner charged with treason in compassing or
                    imagining any bodily harm tending to the death or destruction, maiming or
                    wounding of the queen, where the overt act is an attempt to injure the person of
                    the queen. In such a case the trial is to proceed in every respect and on the
                    like evidence as if it were for murder. By</p>
                <p>11 Vict. c. 12 no prosecution for a felony under the Act, in so far as it is
                    expressed by open and advised speaking only, is to be instituted unless
                    information be given to a justice or sheriff within six days and a warrant
                    issued within ten days of the information, and no person is to be convicted of
                    such an offence except on confession in open court or proof by two witnesses.
                    The prisoner is not to be acquitted if the facts amount to treason. There may be
                    accessories to felonies under this Act, which, as has been already stated, there
                    cannot be to treason. The prosecutor and witnesses are not entitled to costs. By
                    a later Act of the same year (11 and</p>
                <p>12 Vict. c. 42, § 23) a person charged with treason is not to be admitted to bail
                    except by order of a secretary of state or by the Queen’s Bench Division or a
                    judge thereof in vacation.</p>

                    them into a furnace is alluded to by Dante, <hi rend="italic">Inferno,</hi>
                    xxiii. 66.</p></note> The sentence was that the offender, if a man, be drawn on
                    a hurdle to the place of execution, that there he be hanged by the neck till he
                    be dead, that his head be severed from his body, and that his body be divided
                    into four quarters, the head and quarters to be at the disposal of the crown. A
                    woman was drawn to the place of execution, and there burned alive. The Acts of
                    30 Geo. III. c. 48 and 54 Geo. III. c. 146 changed the sentence to hanging in
                    the case of women, and in the case of men enabled the crown, by warrant under
                    the sign manual countersigned by a secretary of state, to change the sentence to
                    beheading or remit it altogether. By the Felony Act, 1870, the punishment is
                    hanging only, but 54 Geo. III. c. 146 appears to be still so far in force that
                    beheading may be substituted by warrant of the crown where the criminal is a
                    man. Attainder and forfeiture are abolished by the Felony Act, 1870, except
                    where the offender has been outlawed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Trials for treason in Great Britain and Ireland have been very numerous, and
                    occupy a large part of the numerous volumes of the <hi rend="italic">State
                    Trials.</hi> Some of the more interesting may be mentioned. Before the Statute
                    of Treasons were those of Gaveston and the Despensers in the reign of Edward II.
                    on charges of accroaching the royal power. After the Statute were those (some
                    before the peers by trial or impeachment, most before the ordinary criminal
                    courts) of Empson and Dudley, Fisher, More, the earl of Surrey, the duke of
                    Somerset, Anne Boleyn, Lady Jane Grey, Sir Thomas Wyatt, Cranmer, the queen of
                    Scots, Sir Walter Raleigh, Strafford, Laud, Sir Henry Vane and other regicides,
                    William, Lord Russell, Algernon Sidney, the duke of Monmouth, and those
                    implicated in the Pilgrimage of Grace, the Gunpowder, Popish, Rye House, and
                    other plots. Cases where the proceeding was by bill of attainder have been
                    already mentioned. Occasionally the result of a trial was confirmed by statute.
                    In some of these trials, as is well known, the law was considerably strained in
                    order to insure a conviction. Since the Revolution there have been the cases of
                    those who took part in the risings of 1715 and 1745, Lord George Gordon in 1780,
                    Hardy and Horne Tooke in 1794, the Cato Street conspirators in 1820, Frost in
                    1840, and the Fenians in 1867. It should be noticed that many cases of
                    proceedings for treason against foreigners occur. Treason committed by them
                    within the realm is a breach of what has been called local allegiance, due to
                    the sovereign of the country in which they reside. Such are the cases of Leslie,
                    bishop of Ross, ambassador to Elizabeth from the queen of Scots, the Marquis de
                    Guiscard in Queen Anne’s reign, and Gyllenborg, the ambassador from Sweden to
                    George II. Proceedings against ambassadors for treason have never gone beyond
                    imprisonment, more for safe custody than as a punishment. No amount of residence
                    abroad will suffice to exempt a native-born subject from the penalty of treason
                    if he bear arms against the country of his birth.<note anchored="true"

                    treason, in the words of Blackstone, “consists in the bare knowledge and
                    concealment of treason, without any degree of assent thereto, for any assent
                    makes the party a principal traitor.” At common law even the concealment was
                    treason, but 5 and 6 Edw. VI. c. 11 and 1 and 2 Ph. and Μ. c. 10 made
                    concealment a misprision only. The offence was dealt with by many Acts, under
                    some of which rather remarkable crimes were made misprision; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> 14 Eliz. c. 3 constituted the counterfeiting of foreign coinage a
                    misprision. The procedure in trials for misprision is in general the same as
                    that followed in trials for treason, most of the Acts regulating procedure
                    including both crimes. The punishment is loss of the profit of the lands of the
                    offender during life, and imprisonment for life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cognate Offences.—</hi> Under this head may be conveniently
                    grouped certain offences against public order which, though not technically
                    treason or treasonable offences (to use the language of the draft criminal
                    code), are so nearly allied to them as to make it convenient to treat them under
                    the head of treason. The most interesting of these for historical reasons is <hi
                    rend="italic">praemunire.</hi> The word is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >praemunire</hi> or <hi rend="italic">praemoneri facias,</hi> the introductory
                    words of the writ of summons to the defendant to answer the charge. From this
                    the word came to be used to denote the offences prosecuted by means of such a
                    writ, usually of an ecclesiastical kind. The Statute of Praemunire, specially so
                    called, is 16 Ric. II. c. 5, enacting that the procuring at Rome or elsewhere of
                    any translations, bulls, &amp;c., against the king puts the persons offending
                    out of the king’s protection, subjects their goods to forfeiture and themselves
                    to attachment or process of <hi rend="italic">praemunire facias.</hi> The Act
                    introduced no new principle, but simply continued the anti-papal policy visible
                    in the Statutes of Provisors, the earliest of which dated from 1307. At
                    different times many other Acts were passed, extending the penalties of
                    praemunire to other crimes, usually those connected with the supremacy of the
                    pope (2 Hen. IV. c. 4, mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Tithes,</hi> is an
                    example), but sometimes of a more distinctly political as distinguished from
                    religious nature. Thus it is praemunire by 13 Car. I. c. 1 to affirm the power
                    of parliament to legislate without the crown, by the Habeas Corpus Act to send a
                    prisoner beyond seas, and to verbally assert the right of a person to the crown
                    contrary<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n548/mode/1up"

                    by 6 Anne c. 41. To do so by writing or printing is, as has been said, treason.
                    The latest Act constituting a praemunire is the Royal Marriage Act, 12 Geo. III.
                    c. 11, which subjects to the penalties of premunire any one guilty of a breach
                    of the provisions of the Act. A peer charged with praemunire is not entitled to
                    trial by his peers, but is to be tried by a jury. The most famous historical
                    instance of a prosecution on the Statute of Praemunire was that of Wolsey in
                    1529. Other offences cognate to treason are publishing scandalous stories about
                    the king (the leasing-making of Scotch law), maladministration and sale of
                    public offices, coining, offences against the Foreign Enlistment Act, and the
                    crimes specially provided against by 33 Hen. VIII. c. 12 and 5 and 6 Vict. c.
                    51. The former Act punished malicious striking in the king’s palace by perpetual
                    imprisonment, fine, and loss of the right hand. The minute provisions for the
                    mutilation of the offender are very curious, but not of immediate interest, as
                    that part of the Act which inflicted mutilation was repealed by 9 Geo. IV. c.
                    31. By 5 and 6 Vict. c. 51 it is a high misdemeanour, punishable by penal
                    servitude for seven years, to wilfully discharge, point, aim, or present at the
                    person of the queen any gun or other arms, loaded or not, or to strike at or
                    attempt to throw anything upon the queen’s person, or to produce any firearms or
                    other arms, or any explosive or dangerous matter, near her person, with intent
                    to injure or alarm her or to commit a breach of the peace. For other offences

                    rend="italic">Scotland. —</hi> Treason included treason proper, or crimes
                    against the crown or the state, such as rebellion, and crimes which, though not
                    technically treasonable, were by legislation punished as treason. Examples of
                    the latter were the remaining in England against the king’s will, 1430, c. 19;
                    wilful fire-raising, 1526, c. 10; kidnapping, 1567,c. 27; theft, reset, and
                    stouthrief by banded men, 1587, c. 34. There were also many acts dealing with
                    offences in the nature of resistance to authority, such as unlawful
                    convocations, and with treasons of a merely transitory nature, such as
                    attempting to restore the Ruthvens (1600), taking or owning the Covenants
                    (1685), or corresponding with James VII. (1698). Acts of forfeiture were
                    sometimes directed against individuals, as 1645, c. 23, against the marquis of
                    Huntly. Scottish procedure was as a rule less favourable to the accused than
                    English. In one matter, however, the opposite was the case. Advocates
                    compellable to act on behalf of the accused were allowed him by 1587, c. 57,
                    more than a century before the concession of a similar indulgence in England. At
                    one time trial in absence and even after death was allowed, as in Roman law. In
                    the case of Robert Leslie, in 1540, a summons after death was held by the
                    estates to be competent, and the bones of the deceased were exhumed and
                    presented at the bar of the court.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In the one instance in England—that of Cromwell, Ireton, and
                    Bradshaw— where the bodies of alleged traitors were exhumed after death they
                    were not brought to the bar of a court as in Scotland.</p></note> The Act 1542,
                    c. 13, confined this revolting procedure to certain treasons of the more heinous
                    kind. By 7 Anne c. 21 trial in absence—the last instance of which had occurred
                    in 1698—was abolished. The same Act assimilated the law and practice of treason
                    to that of England in other respects by enacting that no crime should be treason
                    or misprision in Scotland but such as was treason or misprision in England. The
                    Act further provided that the trial was to be by a jury of twelve, not fifteen
                    as in other crimes, before the court of justiciary, or a commission of oyer and
                    terminer containing at least three lords of justiciary. To slay a lord of
                    justiciary or lord of session, or to counterfeit the great seal, was made
                    treason. The Act also contained provisions as to forfeiture,<note

                    treason was regulated by 22 Geo. II. c. 48. The punishment still remains the
                    same as it was in England before the Felony Act, 1870, and attainder and
                    forfeiture are still the effects of condemnation for treason, the Act of 1870
                    not extending to Scotland. One or two other statutory provisions may be briefly
                    noticed. The trial of a peer of Great Britain for treason committed in Scotland
                    is to be by a commission from the crown, on indictment found by a jury of twelve
                    (6 Anne c. 23, 6 Geo. IV. c. 66). Bail in treason-felony is only to be allowed
                    by consent of the public prosecutor or warrant of the high or circuit court (11
                    Vict. c. 12). The term <hi rend="italic">lese-majesty</hi> was sometimes used
                    for what was treason proper, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in 1524, c. 4, making
                    it lese-majesty to transport the king out of the realm, sometimes as a synonym
                    of <hi rend="italic">leasing-making.</hi> This crime (also called verbal
                    sedition) consisted in the engendering discord between king and people by
                    slander of the king.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It
                    is called by Hallam “the old mystery of iniquity in Scots law.”</p></note> The
                    earliest Act against leasing-making <hi rend="italic">eo nomine</hi> was in
                    1524. The reign of James VI. was pre-eminently prolific in legislation against
                    this crime. It is now of no practical interest, as prosecutions for
                    leasing-making have long fallen into desuetude. At one time, however, the powers
                    of the various Acts were put into force with great severity, especially in the
                    trial of the earl of Argyll in 1681. The punishment for leasing-making, once
                    capital, is now, by 6 Geo. IV. c. 47, fine or imprisonment, or both. The offence
                    of praemunire was introduced into Scotland at a comparatively late period. By 6
                    Anne c. 23 it is praemunire for the peers of Scotland assembled to elect
                    representatives to treat of any other matter.<note anchored="true"

                    >Ireland.—</hi> Numerous Acts, beginning with 18 Hen. VI. c. 2, were passed by
                    the Irish parliament—in many cases mere echoes of previous English legislation.
                    As in England and Scotland, there was a tendency to include under treason crimes
                    of quite another character. Murder was made treason by 10 Hen. VII. c. 21, and
                    arson by 13 Hem VIII. c. 1. Apparently the law must sometimes have been strained
                    against accused persons, for 3 and 4 Ph. and Μ. c. 11 enacted that trials for
                    treason were to be according to the common law. Treasons of a temporary nature
                    were often the subject of legislation. An example is 11 Eliz. c. 6, making it
                    treason to assume the name and authority of O’Neill. The provisions of the
                    English Act of William III. as to witnesses, &amp;c., were not extended to
                    Ireland until 1821 by 1 and 2 Geo. IV. c. 24. Many Acts of indemnity were passed
                    both by the parliaments of Ireland and of the United Kingdom. Among the more
                    important were an Irish Act of 1799 (39 Geo. III. c. 3), indemnifying those who
                    had been active in suppressing the treasonable rising of the previous year, and
                    one of the parliament of the United Kingdom (41 Geo. III. c. 104), indemnifying
                    those who had taken part in the suppression of rebellion subsequent to 1799. The
                    law is now practically the same as that of England, unless where exceptional
                    political circumstances have led to exceptional legislation. Thus a series of
                    enactments called the “Whiteboy Acts” (passed by the Irish and the United
                    Kingdom parliaments between 1775 and 1830) was intended to give additional
                    facilities to the executive for the suppression of tumultuous risings. Many
                    Irish Acts dealt with unlicensed possession and manufacture of arms. A similar
                    policy was continued after the Union, and appears in the Peace Preservation Act,
                    1881, continued in 1887 for five years. Some Acts, such as 3 and 4 Will. IV. c.
                    4, went as far as to make offenders in a proclaimed district triable by
                    court-martial. By the Prevention of Crime Act, 1882, now expired, the
                    lord-lieutenant was empowered to issue special commissions for the trial without
                    jury of treason and treason-felony. The power was never exercised. The Criminal
                    Law and Procedure (Ireland) Act, 1887, deals with resistance to authority and
                    offences of a treasonable nature, especially “dangerous associations,” though
                    treason is not mentioned by name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">British Colonies and Dependencies.—</hi> The law in the main
                    agrees with that of the mother country, but it is quite competent for a colony
                    to deal with treason by its own legislation which need not necessarily be in
                    accordance with English law, and is sometimes expressed in more definite terms.
                    Thus the Indian penal code makes it punishable with transportation for life to
                    wage war against the Government of any Asiatic power in alliance or at peace
                    with the queen, or to attempt to excite feelings of disaffection to the
                    Government. Numerous temporary Acts were passed about the time of the mutiny,
                    one of the most characteristic being an Act of 1858 making rebellious villages
                    liable to confiscation. By the Cape of Good Hope statutes it is treason to
                    deliver arms or gunpowder to the queen’s enemies. Many colonies adopt the
                    English legislation as to procedure, and some, as New South Wales, &amp;c.,
                    enact the Treason Felony Act. A striking feature of colonial legislation on this
                    subject is the great number of Acts of indemnity passed after different
                    rebellions. Instances of such Acts occur in the legislation of Canada, Ceylon,
                    the Cape of Good Hope, New Zealand, St Vincent, and Jamaica. The most important
                    in the history of law is the Jamaica Act of 1866, indemnifying Mr Eyre for any
                    acts committed during the suppression of the rising in the previous year. It was
                    finally held by the Exchequer Chamber in 1870 that this Act protected Mr Eyre
                    from being sued successfully in England on a cause of action arising out of his
                    acts during the outbreak (“Phillips <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Eyre,” <hi

                    rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The law is based upon that of England. By
                    Art. 3 s. 3 of the constitution “treason against the United States shall consist
                    only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them
                    aid and comfort. No person shall bo convicted of treason unless on the testimony
                    of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court. The
                    Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason; but no attainder
                    of treason shall work corruption of blood or forfeiture, except during the life
                    of the person attainted.” By Art. 2 s. 4 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0549-0530"/> impeachment for and conviction of treason is a
                    ground for removing the president, vice-president, and other civil officers. The
                    punishment by an Act of 1790 was declared to be death by hanging. But during the
                    Civil War a new Act (17 July 1862) was passed, providing that the punishment
                    should be death, or, at the discretion of the court, imprisonment at hard labour
                    for not less than five years, and a fine of not less than 10,000 dollars to be
                    levied on the real and personal property of the offender, in addition to
                    disability to hold any office under the United States. The Act of 1862 and other
                    Acts also deal with the crimes of inciting or engaging in rebellion or
                    insurrection, criminal correspondence with foreign Governments in relation to
                    any disputes or controversies with the United States, or to defeat the measures
                    of the Government of the United States, seditions, conspiracy, recruiting
                    soldiers or sailors and enlistment to serve against the United States. The Act
                    of 1790 further provides for the delivery to the prisoner of a copy of the
                    indictment and a list of the jurors, for defence by counsel, and for the finding
                    of the indictment within three years after the commission of the treason.
                    Misprision of treason is defined to be the crime committed by a person owing
                    allegiance to the United States, and having knowledge of the commission of any
                    crime against them, who conceals and does not as soon as may be disclose and
                    make known the same to the president or to some judge of the United States, or
                    to the governor or to some judge or justice of a particular State. The
                    punishment is imprisonment for not more than seven years and a fine of not more
                    than 1000 dollars (see <hi rend="italic">Revised Statutes,</hi> §§ 1033,
                    1034,1043, 5331-5338; Story, <hi rend="italic">Constitution of the United
                    States,</hi> §§ 1296-1301, 1796-1802). Treason against the United States cannot
                    be inquired into by any State court, but the States may, and some of them have,
                    their own constitutions and legislation as to treasons committed against
                    themselves, generally following the lines of the constitution and legislation of
                    the United States. In some cases there are differences which are worth notice.
                    Thus the constitution of Massachusetts, § 25, declares that no subject ought in
                    any case or in any time to be declared guilty of treason by the legislature. The
                    same provision is contained in the constitutions of Vermont, Connecticut,
                    Pennsylvania, Alabama, and others. In some States the crime of treason cannot be
                    pardoned; in others, as in New York, it may be pardoned by the legislature, and
                    the governor may suspend the sentence until the end of the session of the
                    legislature next following conviction. In some States a person convicted of
                    treason is disqualified for exercising the franchise. In New York conviction
                    carries with it forfeiture of real estate for the life of the convict and of his
                    goods and chattels. (J. W†. )</p>
