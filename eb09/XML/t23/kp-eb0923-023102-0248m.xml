                <p><label type="entry">THEFT</label> is, in modern legal systems, universally
                    treated as a crime, but the conception of theft as a crime is not one belonging
                    to the earliest stage of law. To its latest period Roman law regarded theft <hi
                    rend="italic">(furtum)</hi> as a delict <hi rend="italic">prima facie</hi>
                    pursued by a civil remedy,—the <hi rend="italic">actio furti</hi> for a penalty,
                    the <hi rend="italic">vindicatio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">condictio</hi> for
                    the stolen property itself or its value. In later times, no doubt, a criminal
                    remedy to meet the graver crimes gradually grew up by the side of the civil, and
                    in the time of Justinian the criminal remedy, where it existed, took precedence
                    of the civil (CW., iii. 8, 4). But to the last criminal proceedings could only
                    be taken in serious cases, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> against stealers of
                    cattle <hi rend="italic">(abigei)</hi> or the clothes of bathers <hi
                    rend="italic">(balnearii).</hi> The punishment was death, banishment, or labour
                    in the mines or on public works. In the main the Roman law of theft coincides
                    with the English law. The definition as given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes</hi> (iv. 1, 1) is “furtum est contrectatio rei fraudulosa, vel
                    ipsius rei, vel etiam ejus usus possessionisve,” to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Digest</hi> (xlvii. 2, 1, 3) adds “lucrifaciendi gratia.” The earliest English
                    definition, that of Bracton (150δ), runs thus: “furtum est secundum leges
                    contrectatio rei alienae fraudulenta cum animo furandi invito illo domino cujus
                    res illa fuerit.” Bracton omits the “lucri faciendi gratia” of the Roman
                    definition, because in English law the motive is immaterial,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus destruction of a letter
                    by a servant, with a view of suppressing inquiries into her character, makes the
                    servant guilty of larceny in English law.</p></note> and the “usus ejus
                    possessionisve,” because the definition includes an intent to deprive the owner
                    of his property permanently. The “animo furandi” and “invito domino” of
                    Bracton’s definition are expansions for the sake of greater clearness. They seem
                    to have been implied in Roman law. <hi rend="italic">Furtum</hi> is on the whole
                    a more comprehensive term than theft. This difference no doubt arises from the
                    tendency to extend the bounds of a delict and to limit the bounds of a crime.
                    Thus it was <hi rend="italic">furtum</hi> (but it would not be theft at English
                    common law) to use a deposit of pledge contrary to the wishes of the owner, to
                    retain goods found, or to steal a human being, such as a slave or <hi
                    rend="italic">filius familias</hi> (a special form of <hi rend="italic"
                    >furtum</hi> called <hi rend="italic">plagium).</hi> The latter would be in
                    English law an abduction under certain circumstances, but not a theft. On the
                    other hand, one of two married persons could not commit <hi rend="italic"
                    >furtum</hi> as against the other, but theft may be so committed in England
                    since recent legislation. As a <hi rend="italic">furtum</hi> was merely a
                    delict, the οόΖψαίιο <hi rend="italic">ex delicto</hi> could be extinguished by
                    agreement between the parties; it will be seen that this cannot be done in
                    England. In another direction English law is more considerate of the rights of
                    third parties than was Roman. As will appear hereafter, the thief can give a
                    good title to stolen goods; in Roman law he could not do so, except in the
                    single case of a <hi rend="italic">hereditas</hi> acquired by <hi rend="italic"
                    >usucapio.</hi> The development of the law of <hi rend="italic">furtum</hi> at
                    Rome is historically interesting, for even in its latest period is found a relic
                    of one of the most primitive theories of law adopted by courts of justice: “They
                    took as their guide the measure of vengeance likely to be exacted by an
                    aggrieved person under the circumstances of the case” (Maine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ancient Law,</hi> ch. x.). This explains the reason of the division of <hi
                    rend="italic">furtum</hi> into <hi rend="italic">manifestum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">nec manifestum.</hi> The manifest thief was one taken
                    red-handed,—“taken with the manner,” in the language of old English law. The
                    Twelve Tables denounced the punishment of death against the manifest thief, for
                    that w ould be the penalty demanded by the indignant owner in whose place the
                    judge stood. The severity of this penalty was afterwards mitigated by the
                    praetor, who substituted for it the payment of quadruple the value of the thing
                    stolen. The same penalty was also given by the praetor in case of theft from a
                    fire or a wreck, or of prevention of search. No doubt the object of this large
                    penalty was to induce injured persons to refrain from taking the law into their
                    own hands. The Twelve Tables mulcted the non-manifest thief in double the value
                    of the thing stolen. The actions for penalties were in addition to the action
                    for the stolen goods themselves or their value. The quadruple and double
                    penalties still remain in the legislation of Justinian. The search for stolen
                    goods, as it existed in the time of Gaius, was a survival of a period when the
                    injured person was, as in the case of summons <hi rend="italic">(in jus
                    vocatio),</hi> his own executive officer. Such a search, by the Twelve Tables,
                    might be conducted in the house of the supposed thief by the owner in person,
                    naked except for a cincture, and carrying a platter in his hand, safeguards
                    apparently against a violation of decency and against any possibility of his
                    making a false charge by depositing some of his own property on his neighbour’s
                    premises. This mode of search became obsolete before the time of Justinian.
                    Robbery <hi rend="italic">(bona vi rapta)</hi> was violence added to <hi
                    rend="italic">furtum.</hi> By the <hi rend="italic">actio vi bonorum
                    raptorum</hi> quadruple the value could be recovered if the action were brought
                    within a year, only the value if brought after the expiration of a year. The
                    quadruple value, it is to be noted, included the stolen thing itself, so that
                    the penalty was in effect only a triple one. It was inclusive, and not
                    cumulative, as in <hi rend="italic">furtum.</hi></p>
                <p>In England theft appears to have been very early regarded by legislators as a
                    matter calling for special attention. The pre-Conquest compilations of laws are
                    full of provisions on the subject. It is noticeable that the earlier ones appear
                    to regard theft as a delict which may be compounded for by payment. Considerable
                    distinctions of person are made, both in regard to the owner and the thief.
                    Thus, by the laws of Ethelbert, if a freeman stole from the king he was to
                    restore ninefold, if from a freeman or from a dwelling threefold. If a theow
                    stole, he had only to make a twofold reparation. In the laws of Alfred ordinary
                    theft was still only civil, but he who stole in a church was punished by the
                    loss of his hand. The laws of Ina named as the penalty death or redemption
                    accoτd-ing<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n249/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0249-0232"/> to the wer-gild of the thief. By the same laws
                    the thief might be slain if he fled or resisted. Gradually the severity of the
                    punishment increased. By the laws of Athelstan death in a very cruel form was
                    inflicted. At a later date the <hi rend="italic">Leges Henrici Primi</hi> placed
                    a thief in the king’s mercy, and his lands were forfeited. Putting out the eyes
                    and other kinds of mutilation were sometimes the punishment. The principle of
                    severity continued down to the present century, and until 1827 theft of certain
                    kinds remained capital. Both before and after the Conquest local jurisdiction
                    over thieves was a common franchise of lords of manors, attended with some of
                    the advantages of modern summary jurisdiction. It might be exercised either over
                    thieves who committed a theft or were apprehended within the lordship <hi
                    rend="italic">(infangthef),</hi> or over those inhabitants of the lordship who
                    were apprehended elsewhere <hi rend="italic">(outfaηgthef).</hi> Either or both
                    franchises might be enjoyed by grant or prescription. As lately as 1 Ph. and M.
                    c. 15 infangthef and outfangthef were confirmed to the lords marchers of Wales.
                    An analogous franchise was <hi rend="italic">theam,</hi> or the right of calling
                    upon the holder of stolen goods to vouch to warranty, t.e., to name from w hom
                    he received them. In the old law of theft there were to be found two interesting
                    survivals of the primitive legal notions which were found in Roman law. Up to a
                    comparatively recent date a distinction analogous to that between <hi
                    rend="italic">furtum manifestum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nec manifestum</hi>
                    was of importance in English criminal practice. The thief “taken with the
                    manner” was by the Statute of Westminster the First not to be admitted to bail
                    (see <hi rend="italic">Letters of Junius,</hi> lxviii.). In modern procedure the
                    probable guilt or innocence of the accused is not so much to be considered in a
                    question of bail as the probability of his appearance at the trial. The other
                    matter worthy of notice is the old pursuit <hi rend="italic">(secta)</hi> by hue
                    and cry. In the pre-Conquest codes the owner was generally allowed to take the
                    law into his own hand, as in early Roman law, and get back his goods by force if
                    he could, no doubt with the assistance of his neighbours where possible. From
                    this arose the later development of the hue and cry, as the recognized means of
                    pursuing a thief. The Statutes of Westminster the First and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >De officio coronatoris</hi> enacted that all men should be ready to pursue and
                    arrest felons, and ten years later the Statute of Winchester (1285) enforced
                    upon all the duty of keeping arms for the purpose of following the hue and cry.
                    It also made the hundred liable for thefts with violence committed in it, an
                    adoption no doubt in feudal law of the old pre-Conquest liability of the
                    frith-borg. As justice became more settled, the hue and cry was regulated more
                    and more by law, and lost much of its old natural simplicity. This led to its
                    gradually becoming obsolete, though the Statutes of Westminster the First and
                    <hi rend="italic">De officio coronatoris</hi> are still nominally law as far as
                    they relate to the hue and cry. The Statute of Winchester as to the liability of
                    the hundred was repealed in 1827.</p>
                <p>The term theft in modern English law is sometimes used as a synonym of larceny,
                    sometimes in a more comprehensive sense. In the latter sense it is used by Mr
                    Justice Stephen, who defines it as “the act of dealing from any motive whatever,
                    unlawfully and without claim of right, with anything capable of being stolen, in
                    any of the ways in which theft can be committed” (for which see § 296—300),
                    “with the intention of permanently converting that thing to the use of any
                    person other than the general or special owner thereof” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Digest of the Criminal Law,</hi> § 295). In this broader sense the term
                    applies to all cases of depriving another of his property, whether by removing
                    or withholding it. It thus includes larceny, robbery, cheating, embezzlement,
                    and breach of trust. Embezzlement is a statutory crime created as a separate
                    form of offence in the last century (see vol. viii. p. 159). The difference
                    between larceny and embezzlement turns mainly on the fact of the master’s being
                    in actual or constructive possession of the stolen property (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Possession).</hi> Fraudulent breach of trust was not made a
                    specific offence until 1857 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trust).</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Larceny</hi> (a corruption of <hi rend="italic">latrocinium),</hi>
                    or theft proper, was felony at common law. The common law of larceny has been
                    affected by numerous statutes, the main object of legislation being to bring
                    within the law of larceny offences which were not larcenies at common law,
                    either because they were thefts of things of which there could be no larceny at
                    common law, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> beasts <hi rend="italic">ferae
                    nativrae,</hi> title deeds, or choses inaction, or because the common law
                    regarded them merely as delicts for which the remedy was by civil action, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> fraudulent breaches of trust. The earliest Act in the
                    statutes of the realm dealing with larceny appears to be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carta Forestae</hi> of 1225, by which line or imprisonment was inflicted for
                    stealing the king’s deer. The next Act appears to be the Statute of Westminster
                    the First (1275), dealing again with stealing deer. From this it seems as though
                    the beginning of legislation on the subject was for the purpose of protecting
                    the chases and parks of the king and the nobility. An immense mass of the old
                    Acts will be found named in the repealing Act of 1827, 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 27.
                    An Act of the same date, 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 29, removed the old distinction
                    between grand and petit larceny.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This provision was most unnecessarily repeated in the
                    Larceny Act of 1861.</p></note> The former was theft of goods above the value of
                    twelve pence, in the house of the owner, not from the person, or by night, and
                    was a capital crime. It was petit larceny where the value was twelve pence or
                    under, the punishment being imprisonment or whipping. The gradual depreciation
                    in the value of money afforded good ground for Sir Henry Spelman’s sarcasm that,
                    while everything else became dearer, the life of man became continually cheaper.
                    The distinction between grand and petit larceny first appears in statute law in
                    the Statute of Westminster the First, c. 15, but-it was not created for the
                    first time by that statute. It is found in some of the pre-Conquest codes, as
                    that of Athelstan, and it is recognized in the <hi rend="italic">Leges Henrici
                    Primi.</hi> A distinction between simple and compound larceny is still found in
                    the books. The latter is larceny accompanied by circumstances of aggravation, as
                    that it is in a dwellinghouse or from the person. The law of larceny is now
                    contained chiefly in the Larceny Act, 1861, 24 and 25 Vict. c. 96 (which extends
                    to England and Ireland), a comprehensive enactment including larceny,
                    embezzlement, fraud by bailees, agents, bankers, factors, and trustees,
                    sacrilege, burglary, housebreaking, robbery, obtaining money by threats or by
                    false pretences, and receiving stolen goods, and prescribing procedure, both
                    civil and criminal. There are still, however, some earlier Acts in force dealing
                    with special cases of larceny, such as 33 Hen. VIII. c. 12, as to stealing the
                    goods of the king, and the Game, Post-Office, and Merchant Shipping Acts. Later
                    Acts provide for larceny by a partner of partnership property (31 and 32 Vict.
                    c. 116), and by a husband or wife of the property of the other (45 and 46 Vict.
                    c. 75). Proceedings against persons subject to naval or military law depend upon
                    the Naval Discipline Act, 1866, and the Army Act, 1881. There are several Acts,
                    both before and after 1861, directing how the property is to be laid in
                    indictments for stealing the goods of counties, friendly societies, trades
                    unions, &amp;c. The principal conditions which must exist in order to constitute
                    larceny are these :— (1) there must be an actual taking into the possession of
                    the thief, though the smallest removal is sufficient; (2) there must be an
                    intent to deprive the owner of his property for an indefinite period, and to
                    assume the entire dominion over it, an intent often described in Bracton’s words
                    as <hi rend="italic">animus furandi</hi>; (3) this intent must exist at the time
                    of taking; (4) the thing taken must be one capable of larceny either at common
                    law or by statute. One or two cases falling under the law of larceny are of
                    special interest. It was held more than once that a servant taking corn for the
                    purpose of feeding his master’s horses, but without any intention of applying it
                    for his own benefit, was guilty of larceny. To remedy this hardship, 26 and 27
                    Vict. c. 103 was passed to declare such an act not to be felony. The case of
                    appropriation of goods which have been found has led to some difficulty. It now
                    seems to be the law that in order to constitute a larceny of lost goods there
                    must be a felonious intent at the time of finding, that is, an intent to deprive
                    the owner of them, coupled with reasonable means at the same time of knowing the
                    owner. The mere retention of the goods when the owner has become known to the
                    finder does not make the retention criminal. Larceny of money may be committed
                    when the money is paid by mistake, if the prisoner took it <hi rend="italic"

                    a post-office savings bank, received by the mistake of the clerk a larger sum
                    than he was entitled to. The jury found that he had the <hi rend="italic">animus
                    furandi</hi> at the time of taking the money, and that he knew it to be the
                    money of the postmaster-general. The majority of the court held it to be
                    larceny. In a case in 1885 (Reg. <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Ashwell, <hi
                    rend="italic">Law Rep.,</hi> 16 Queen’s Bench Division, 190), where the
                    prosecutor gave the prisoner a sovereign believing it to be a shilling, and the
                    prisoner took it under that belief, but afterwards discovered its value and
                    retained it, the court was equally divided as to whether the prisoner was guilty
                    of larceny at common law, but held that he was not guilty of larceny as a
                    bailee. The procedure in prosecutions for larceny has been considerably affected
                    by recent legislation. The inconveniences of the common-law rules of
                    interpretation of indictments led to certain amendments of the law, now
                    contained in the Larceny Act, for the purpose of avoiding the frequent failures
                    of justice owing to the strictness with which indictments were construed. Three
                    larcenies of property of the same person within six months may now be charged in
                    one indictment. On an indictment for larceny the prisoner may be found guilty of
                    embezzlement, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>; and if the prisoner be
                    indicted for obtaining goods by false pretences, and the offence turn out to be
                    larceny, he is not entitled to be acquitted of the misdemeanour. A count for
                    receiving may be joined with the count for stealing. In many cases it is
                    unnecessary to allege or prove ownership of the property the subject of the
                    indictment. The Act also contains numerous provisions as to venue and the
                    apprehension of offenders. In another direction the powers of courts of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Summary Jurisdiction</hi> (y.v.) have been extended, in the
                    case of charges of larceny, embezzlement, and receiving stolen goods, against
                    children and young persons and against adults pleading guilty or waiving their
                    right to trial by jury. The maximum punishment for larceny is fourteen years’
                    penal servitude, but this can only be inflicted in certain exceptional cases,
                    such as horse or cattle stealing and larceny by a servant or a person in the
                    service of the crown or the police. The extreme punishment for simple larceny
                    after a previous conviction for felony is ten years’ penal servitude. . Whipping

                <p><hi rend="italic">Robbery</hi> is larceny accompanied by violence or threatened
                    violence. "Whether obtaining money by threats to accuse of crime was robbery at
                    common law was open to some doubt. It is now a specific offence under the
                    Larceny Act, punishable by penal servitude for life. Whipping may be added as
                    part of the sentence for robbery by 26 and 27 Vict. c. 44.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cheating</hi> is either a common-law or statutory offence. An
                    indictment for cheating at common law is now of comparatively rare occurrence.
                    The statutory crime of obtaining money by false Pretences is the form in which
                    the offence generally presents itself.</p>
                <p>∣ike embezzlement, this offence dates as a statutory crime from the last century.
                    It now depends upon the Larceny Act. A false pretence is defined by Mr Justice
                    Stephen as “a false representation made either by words, by writing, or by
                    conduct that some fact or facts existed” <hi rend="italic">(Digest of the
                    Criminal Law,</hi> § 330). The principal points to notice are that the false
                    pretence must be of an existing fact <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> it was held
                    not to be a false pretence to promise to pay for goods on delivery), and that
                    property must have been actually obtained by the false pretence. The broad
                    distinction between this offence and larceny is that in the former the owner
                    intends to part with his property, in the latter he does not. By 22 and 23 Vict.
                    c. 17, no indictment for obtaining money by false pretences is to be presented
                    or found by the grand jury unless the defendant has been committed for trial or
                    the indictment is authorized in one of the ways mentioned in the Act. The
                    maximum punishment for the common-law offence is fine or imprisonment at
                    discretion, for the statutory five years’ penal servitude.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stolen Goods.—</hi> The owner of the goods stolen has an action
                    against the thief for the goods or their value. How far he is entitled to pursue
                    his civil right to the exclusion of criminal prosecution does not seem very
                    clear upon the authorities. One of the latest statements of the law was that of
                    Mr Justice Watkin Williams :—“It has been said that the true principle of the
                    common law is that there is neither a merger of the civil right, nor is it a
                    strict condition precedent to such right that there shall have been a
                    prosecution of the felon, but that there is a duty imposed upon the injured
                    person not to resort to the prosecution of his private suit to the neglect and
                    exclusion of the vindication of the public law; in my opinion this view is the
                    correct one” (Midland Insurance Company <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Smith, <hi
                    rend="italic">Law Rep.,</hi> 6 Queen’s Bench Division, 568). Dealing with stolen
                    goods by persons other than the thief may affect the rights of such persons
                    either criminally or civilly. Two varieties of crime arise from such dealings.
                    (1) Receiving stolen goods knowing them to have been stolen, a misdemeanour at
                    common law, is by the Larceny Act a felony punishable by penal servitude for
                    fourteen years where the theft amounts to felony, a misdemeanour punishable by
                    penal servitude for seven years where the theft is a misdemeanour, as in
                    obtaining goods by false pretences. Recent possession of stolen property may,
                    according to circumstances, support the presumption that the prisoner is a thief
                    or that he is a receiver. The Prevention of Crime Act, 1871, made important
                    changes in the law of evidence in charges of receiving. It allows, under proper
                    safeguards, evidence to be given in the course of the trial of the finding of
                    other stolen property in the possession of the accused, and of a previous
                    conviction for any offence involving fraud and dishonesty. (2) Compounding
                    theft, or theftbote, that is, taking back stolen goods or receiving compensation
                    on condition of not prosecuting, is a misdemeanour at common law. It need not
                    necessarily be committed by the owner of the goods. Under the Larceny Act it is
                    a felony punishable by seven years’ penal servitude to corruptly take money or
                    reward for helping to recover stolen goods without using all due diligence to
                    bring the offender to trial. By the same Act, to advertise or print or publish
                    any advertisement offering a reward for the return of stolen goods, and using
                    any words purporting that no questions will be asked, &amp;c., renders the
                    offender liable to a penalty of £50. This penalty must, by 33 and 34 Vict. c.
                    65, be sued for within six months, and the assent of the attorney-general is
                    necessary. Various Acts provide for the liabilities of pawnbrokers, publicans,
                    marine-store dealers, and others into whose possession stolen goods come. Search
                    for stolen goods can only be undertaken by a police officer under the protection
                    of a search warrant. The law as to stolen goods, as far as it affects the civil
                    rights and liabilities of the owner and third parties, is shortly as follows. As
                    a general rule a purchaser takes goods subject to any infirmities of title. The
                    property in money, bank-notes, and negotiable instruments passes by delivery,
                    and a person taking any of these <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> and for value
                    is entitled to retain it as against a former owner from whom it may have been
                    stolen. In the case of other goods, a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> purchaser
                    of stolen goods in market overt (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sale)</hi> obtains a
                    good title (except as against the crown), provided that the thief has not been
                    convicted. After conviction of the thief the property revests in the owner, and
                    the court before which the thief was convicted may order restitution, except in
                    the cases specially mentioned in the Larceny Act, i.e., the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bona fide</hi> discharge or transfer of a security for value without notice and
                    the fraudulent dealing by a trustee, banker, &amp;c., with goods and documents
                    of title to goods entrusted to him. After conviction of the thief the goods must
                    be recovered from the person in whose hands they are at the time of the
                    conviction, for any sales and resales, if the first sale was in market overt,
                    are good until conviction of the thief. If the goods were obtained by false
                    pretences and not by larceny, the question then is whether the property in the
                    goods has passed or not, and the answer to this question depends upon the nature
                    of the false pretences employed. If the vendee obtains possession of goods with
                    the intention by the vendor to transfer both the property and the possession,
                    the property vests in the vendee until the vendor has done some act to disaffirm
                    the transaction. But if there was never any such intention,—if, for instance,
                    the vendor delivers the goods to A. B. under the belief that he is C. D.,—the
                    property does not vest in the transferee, and the owner may recover the goods
                    even from a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> purchaser.<note anchored="true"

                    policy of the Acts was to make thefts what were not thefts at common law, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> stealing fruit, dogs, hawks, or deer, and to extend the
                    remedies, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by giving the justiciar authority
                    throughout the kingdom, by making the master in the case of theft by the servant
                    liable to give the latter up to justice, or by allowing the use of firearms
                    against thieves. The general result of legislation in England and Scotland has
                    been to assimilate the law of theft in both kingdoms. As a rule, what would be
                    theft in one would be theft in the other. There can be theft of children in
                    Scots as in Roman law, under the name of <hi rend="italic">plagium.</hi> The
                    crime of stouthrief is robbery accompanied by exceptional violence. The English
                    receiving stolen goods and obtaining money under false pretences are represented
                    by the reset and fraud of Scots law. Theftbote or <hi rend="italic">redemptio
                    furti</hi> appears in legislation as early as the assizes of King William, c. 2.
                    The offender was there subjected to the ordeal of water if convicted on the oath
                    of three witnesses, to be immediately hanged if the oath of three <hi
                    rend="italic">seniores</hi> were added. The offence was made punishable by 1436,
                    c. 1, 1515, c. 2, and appears still to be a crime. Blackmailing, under that
                    name, was forbidden by 1567, c. 27. There is no consolidation Act for Scotland
                    like the Larceny Act for England and Ireland, but various Acts are in force
                    dealing with specific offences or with procedure. Thus 7 Anne c. 21, § 7, makes
                    theft by landed men no longer treason, as it had previously been. 4 Geo. II. c.
                    32 deals with theft of lead, &amp;c., fixed to houses, 21 Geo. II. c. 34 with
                    the admissibility of an accomplice as witness in a charge of cattle stealing, 51
                    Geo. III. c. 41 with theft of linen, &amp;c. The most important Act relating to
                    procedure is 31 and 32 Viet c. 95, § 12, by which a previous conviction for
                    theft may be libelled and proved as aggravation of robbery, and a <pb break="no"

                    from any one in whose possession they are. The protection given by market overt
