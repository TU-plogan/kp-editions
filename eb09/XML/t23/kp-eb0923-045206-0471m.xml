                    <hi rend="italic">He Motu</hi> (printed amongst his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Op&gt;era</hi><hi rend="italic">Geometrica,</hi> 1644). Its communication by
                    Castelli to Galileo in 1641 led to the adoption as a disciple by the Florentine
                    sage of one who seemed not unworthy to become his successor. Torricelli
                    accordingly, repairing to Florence, October 10, 1641, resided with Galileo, and
                    acted as his amanuensis during the three remaining months of his life. On its
                    close his contemplated return to Rome was anticipated by his nomination as
                    grand-ducal mathematician and professor of mathematics in the Florentine
                    academy. The discovery which has perpetuated his fame was made in 1643. Galileo
                    had failed to perceive why water refuses to rise above 33 feet in a closed tube.
                    It occurred to Torricelli to try the experiment in a more compendious form. The
                    anticipated result ensued that the suspended column of mercury was shorter than
                    that of water in the proportion of its greater specific gravity. He immediately
                    concluded both to be sustained by atmospheric pressure, and constructed
                    the*“siphon-barometer” expressly for the purpose of measuring its fluctuations.
                    By this momentous discovery the obscure notion of a <hi rend="italic">fuga
                    vacui</hi> was banished from physical science, and its progress most notably
                    quickened. The mercurial barometer was long known as the “Torricellian tube,”
                    and the vacuum it includes is still designated the “Torricellian vacuum.”</p>
                <p>The publication amongst Torricelli’s <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Geometrica</hi> (Florence, 1644) of a tract on the properties of
                    the cycloid involved him in a controversy with Roberval, who accused him of
                    plagiarizing his earlier solution of the problem of its quadrature. There seems,
                    however, no room for doubt that Torricelli’s was arrived at independently, The
                    matter was still in debate when he was seized with fever and pleurisy, and died
                    at Florence, after twenty days’ illness, October 25, 1647, at the age of 39. He
                    was buried in San Lorenzo, and a commemorative statue of him erected at Faenza
                    in 1864. He was of a singularly amiable disposition, and possessed qualities the
                    most felicitous for the investigation of nature. Among the new truths detected
                    by him was the valuable mechanical principle that if any number of bodies be so
                    connected that, by their motion, their centre of gravity can neither ascend nor
                    descend, then those bodies are in equilibrium. He also discovered the remarkable
                    fact that the parabolas described (in a vacuum) by indefinitely numerous
                    projectiles discharged from the same point with equal velocities, but in all
                    directions, are situated within a paraboloid which is a tangent to all of them.
                    His theorem that a fluid issues from a small orifice with the same velocity
                    (friction and atmospheric resistance apart) which it would have acquired in
                    falling through the depth from its surface is of fundamental importance in
                    hydraulics. He greatly improved both the telescope and microscope, and invented
                    the simple microscope composed of a globule of melted glass. Several large
                    object lenses, engraven with his name, are preserved at Florence. He used and
                    developed Cavalieri’s method of indivisibles.</p>
                <p>A selection from Torricelli’s manuscripts was published by Tommaso Bonaventura in
                    1715, with the title <hi rend="italic">Lezimιi Aecαdemiche</hi> (Florence). They
                    include an address of acknowledgment on his admission to the Accademia della
                    Crusca. His essay on the inundations of the Val di Chiana was printed in <hi
