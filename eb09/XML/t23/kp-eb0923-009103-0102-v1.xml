                    better service as the means of his introduction to <hi rend="italic">The New
                        York Tribune.</hi> With the money thus obtained, and with an advance made to
                    him on account of some journalistic work to be done in Europe, “J. B. Taylor”
                    (as he had up to this time signed himself, though he bore no other Christian
                    name than Bayard) set sail for the East. The young poet spent a happy time in
                    roaming through certain districts of England, France, Germany, and Italy; that
                    he was a born traveller is evident from the fact that this pedestrian tour of
                    almost two years cost him only £100. The graphic accounts which he sent from
                    Europe to <hi rend="italic">The New York Tribune, The Saturday Evening
                        Post,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The United States Gazette</hi> were so
                    highly appreciated that on Taylor’s return to America he was advised to throw
                    his articles into book form. In 1846, accordingly, appeared his <hi
                        rend="italic">Views Afoot, or Europe seen with Knapsack and Staff.</hi> This
                    pleasant book had considerable popularity, and its author now found himself a
                    recognized man of letters; moreover, Horace Greeley, then editor of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Tribune,</hi> placed Taylor on the staff of that journal, thus
                    securing him a certain if a moderate income. His next journey, made when the
                    gold-fever was at its height, was to California, as correspondent for the <hi
                        rend="italic">Tribune</hi>; from this expedition he returned by way of
                    Mexico, and, seeing his opportunity, published (1850) a highly successful book
                    of travels, entitled <hi rend="italic">Eldorado, or Adventures in the Path of
                        Empire.</hi> Ten thousand copies were said to have been sold in America, and
                    thirty thousand in Great Britain, within a fortnight from the date of issue.
                    Bayard Taylor always considered himself native to the East, and it was with
                    great delight that in 1851 he found himself on the banks of the Nile. He
                    ascended as far as 12° 30' N. lat., and stored his memory with countless sights
                    and delights, to many of which he afterwards gave expression in metrical form.
                    From England, towards the end of 1852, he sailed for Calcutta, proceeding thence
                    to China, where he joined the expedition of Commodore Perry to Japan. The
                    results of these journeys (besides his poetical memorials, to which reference
                    will be afterwards made) were <hi rend="italic">A Journey to Central Africa, or
                        Life and Landscapes from Egypt to the Negro Kingdoms of the Nile</hi>
                    (1854); <hi rend="italic">The Land of the Saracens, or Pictures of Palestine,
                        Asia Minor, Sicily, and Spain</hi> (1854); and <hi rend="italic">A Visit to
                        India, China, and Japan in the Year 1853</hi> (1855). On his return (1854)
                    from these various journeyings he entered, with marked success, upon the career
                    of a public lecturer, delivering addresses in every town of importance from
                    Maine to Wisconsin. After two years’ experience of this lucrative profession, he
                    again started on his travels, on this occasion for northern Europe, his special
                    object being the study of Swedish life, language, and literature. The most
                    noteworthy result was the long narrative poem <hi rend="italic">Lars,</hi> but
                    his “Swedish Letters” to the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> were also
                    republished, under the title <hi rend="italic">Northern Travel</hi> (1857). In
                    October 1857 he married Maria Hansen, the daughter of the well-known German
                    astronomer. The ensuing winter was spent in Greece. In 1859 Taylor once more
                    traversed the whole extent of the western American gold region, the primary
                    cause of the journey lying in an invitation to lecture at San Francisco. About
                    three years later he entered the diplomatic service as secretary of legation at
                    St Petersburg, and the following year (1863) became chargé d’affaires at the
                    Russian capital. In 1864 he returned to the United States and resumed his active
                    literary labours, and it was at this period that <hi rend="italic">Hannah
                        Thurston,</hi> the first of his four novels, was published. This book had a
                    moderate success, but neither in it nor in its successors did Bayard Taylor
                    betray any special talent as a novelist: some of his characters are faithful
                    studies from life, and he could describe well the aspects of nature,—but a good
                    deal more than this is necessary for the creation of noteworthy romances. In
                    1874 he went to Iceland, to take part in the centennial celebration which was
                    held in that year. In J une 1878 he was accredited United States minister at
                    Berlin. Notwithstanding the resistless passion for travel which had always
                    possessed him, Bayard Taylor was (when not actually <hi rend="italic">en
                        route)</hi> sedentary in his habits, especially in the later years of his
                    life; and at Berlin he aggravated a constitutional liver affection by too
                    sedulous devotion to literary studies and pursuits, in the intervals of leisure
                    from his diplomatic duties. His death occurred on the 17 th of December, only a
                    few months after his arrival in Berlin.</p>
                <p>The main drawback to the widespread acceptance of Bayard Taylor’s poetry as a
                    whole is its perpetual diffuseness. His most ambitious productions—his <hi
                        rend="italic">Masque of the Gods</hi> (1872), <hi rend="italic">Prince
                        Deukalion</hi> (1877), <hi rend="italic">The Picture of St John (1865), Lars
                        (1818),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Prophet</hi> (1874)—are marred by a
                    ceaseless effort to overstrain his power. <hi rend="italic">Lars</hi> is the
                    least likely of his longer poems to survive any length of time: it lacks the
                    grandiose eloquence and impressive “adjuncts” of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Masque</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prince Deukalion,</hi> while in theme and
                    treatment it is, at most, only sedately agreeable. <hi rend="italic">The Poems
                        of the Orient</hi> contains his most genuinely satisfactory poetic writings.
                    But probably long after even the most familiar of the poems just mentioned have
                    ceased to be popular, when even the <hi rend="italic">Views Afoot</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Eldorado</hi> no longer hold the attention of the numerous
                    public interested in vividly narrated experiences of travel, Bayard Taylor will
                    be remembered by his poetic and excellent translation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Faust.</hi> Taylor felt, in all truth, “the torment and the ecstasy of
                    verse”; but, as a critical friend has written of him, “his nature was so ardent,
                    so full-blooded, that slight and common sensations intoxicated him, and he
                    estimated their effect, and his power to transmit it to others, beyond the true
                    value.” He felt life as perhaps only the poetic temperament can experience the
                    beauty of the world; single words thus became for him so charged with poetry
                    that he overlooked the fact that to most people these were, simply in
                    themselves, mere abstract terms—sunshine, sea, spring, morning, night, and so
                    forth. Thus a stanza having absolutely nothing original or striking or even
                    poetic in it would, because <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0103-0092"/> born of him, seem to be poetry unadulterate:
                    to <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mind, each line, each word, was charged with
                    delightful significance, therefore —so he felt—would be so also to the
                    sympathetic reader. He had, from the earliest period at which he began to
                    compose, a distinct lyrical faculty: so keen indeed was his ear that he became
                    too insistently haunted by the music of others, pre-eminently of Tennyson. But
                    he had often a true and fine note of his „own. His best short poems are “The
                    Metempsychosis of the Pine” and the well-known Bedouin love-song, the latter a
                    stirring lyric that ought assuredly to endure. In his critical essays Bayard
                    Taylor had himself in no inconsiderable degree what he wrote of as “that pure
                    poetic insight which is the vital spirit of criticism.” The most valuable of
                    these prose dissertations are the <hi rend="italic">Studies in German
                        Literature.</hi></p>
