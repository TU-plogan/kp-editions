                    probably to be identified with Tilpin, who was archbishop of Rheims towards the
                    end of the 8th century. This Tilpin is alluded to by Hincmar (845-882), his
                    third successor in the see. According to Flodoard <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi>

                    in his place a warrior-clerk, Milo. The same writer represents Milo as
                    discharging a mission among the Vascones or Basques, the very people to whom
                    authentic history has ascribed the great Carolingian disaster at Roncesvalles.
                    It is possible that we owe the warlike legends that have accumulated round the
                    name of Turpin to some confusion of his identity with that of his martial
                    predecessor. Flodoard says that Tilpin was originally a monk of St Denis; and we
                    know from Hincmar that, after his appointment to Rheims, he occupied himself in
                    securing the restoration of the metropolitan rights and landed property of his
                    church, whose revenue and prestige had been impaired under Milo’s rule. He was,
                    according to the latter authority, elected in the days of Pippin, the son of
                    Charles Martel, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> between 752 and 768. He died, if we
                    may trust the evidence of a diploma alluded to by Mabillon, in 794. Hincmar, who
                    composed his epitaph, makes him bishop for forty years and more, from which it
                    is evident that he was elected somewhere about 754. Flodoard, however, states
                    that he died in the forty-seventh year of his bishopric. Tilpin was present at
                    the synod of Rome in 769; and Pope Hadrian, at the request of Charlemagne, sent
                    him a pallium and confirmed the rights of his church <hi rend="italic">(Gallia
                    Christiana,</hi> ix. 28-30). According to Flodoard, he substituted monks for
                    canons in the monastery of St Remigius; and 17th-century tradition ascribed to
                    him an ancient <hi rend="italic">pontificale,</hi> still extant in Marlot’s days
                    (17th century).</p>
                <p>The above is a summary of all that authentic history and trustworthy tradition
                    teach about the author to whom the common voice of the Middle Ages ascribed the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ηistoriα Caroli Magni.</hi> A short account of the work has
                    been given elsewhere <hi rend="smallcaps">(Roland, Legend of).</hi> But, popular
                    as this production was during the Middle Ages, it was rather the crystallization
                    of earlier Roland legends than the source of later ones. Potthast has enumerated
                    about fifty codices without by any means, according to Μ. Gaston Paris,
                    exhausting the list. The latter writer has made the <hi rend="italic">Historia
                    Karoli</hi> the subject of a special study <hi rend="italic">(De
                    Pseudo-Turpino,</hi> Paris, 1865), which may be recommended as a model of
                    brilliant though cautious scholarship. The great popularity of the pseudo-Turpin
                    seems to date from the latter half of the 12th century; and Μ. Paris enumerates
                    at least five French translations belonging to the 13th, and one into Latin
                    verse of about the same age. Mr Ward <hi rend="italic">(Cat. of Romances,</hi>
                    549) has recently expressed a doubt as to whether the Turpin chronicle was
                    completed at Vienne.</p>
