                    has many fine suburban villas, and the district is noted for its sylvan beauty.
                    Opposite the town there is an eyot in the river about 8 acres in extent, called
                    Eel Pie Island, much resorted to by boating parties. The parish church of St
                    Mary was rebuilt in red brick in very plain style after the fall of the old one
                    in 1713, but the picturesque western tower of the 14th century still remains. It
                    contains many interesting monuments, including one to Pope, who was buried in
                    the nave. The principal public buildings are the town-hall and assembly rooms
                    (built in 1876, and containing the free library established in 1882), the
                    economic museum, the royal naval female school for the daughters of naval and
                    marine officers, the Montpellier lecture hall, the metropolitan and City of
                    London police orphanage, the almshouses of the London Carpenters’ Company<pb

                    homeless and destitute. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 2415
                    acres) in 1871 was 10,533, and in 1881 it was 12,479.</p>
                <p>Twickenham at Domesday was included in Isleworth. Anciently it was called
                    Twittenham or Twicanham. The manor was given in 941 by King Edmund to the monks
                    of Christ Church, Canterbury, from whom it had been previously taken, but it was
                    again alienated, for it was restored to the same monks by Edred in 948. In the
                    reign of Henry VIII. it came into the possession of the crown, and by Charles I.
                    was assigned to Henrietta Maria as part of her jointure. It was sold during the
                    Protectorate, but after the Restoration the queen mother resumed possession of
                    it. In 1670 it was settled for life on Catherine of Braganza, queen of Charles
                    II. It still remains in possession of the crown, but since the death of
                    Catherine has been let on leases. In the neighbourhood are many residences of
                    literary or historical interest. Pope’s villa, where he lived from 1717 till his
                    death in 1744, has been removed. Among old mansions of interest still remaining
                    are Strawberry Hill, the residence of Horace Walpole, now much altered; Marble
                    Hill, built by George III. for the countess of Suffolk, and subsequently resided
                    in by the marquis of Wellesley; Orleans House, built in the reign of Queen Anne
                    by Johnstone, occupied for some time by the duke of Orleans, and from 1879 to
                    1883 as a club house; York House, said to have been the residence of James II.
                    when duke of York, bestowed by Charles II. on Lord Clarendon when he married the
                    duke of York’s daughter, and in modern times resided in by the Comte de Paris;
                    and Twickenham House, formerly the residence of Sir John Hawkins, author of the
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Music,</hi> and the meeting place of the “Literary
                    Club.” Of the old manor house of Twickenham, to which Catherine of Aragon is
                    said to have retired after her divorce from Henry VIII., and which was
                    subsequently the residence of Catherine of Braganza, queen of Charles II., the
                    only remains are a ruin called the Aragon tower. Twickenham Park House, for some
                    time the residence of Lord Chancellor Bacon, has been demolished.</p>
