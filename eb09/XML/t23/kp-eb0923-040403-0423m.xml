                <p><label type="entry">TINNEVELLI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Tinavelly</hi></label>, a
                    district of British India, in the Madras presidency, lying between 8° 9' and 9°
                    56' N. lat. and 77° 16' and 78° 27' E. long. It has an area of 5381 square
                    miles, and a coast-line of nearly 100 miles. Madura district bounds it on the N.
                    and N.E., on the S. and S.E. the Gulf of Mannár, and on the W. the southern
                    Ghats. Tinnevelli is a large plain, with an average elevation of 200 feet,
                    sloping to the east with slight undulations. Along the western boundary the
                    mountains rise to 4000 feet; but they send out no spurs into the district, nor
                    are there any isolated hills. The district is watered by numerous short streams,
                    the principal being the Támbraparní (length 80 miles). In the north the scenery
                    is unattractive and the soil poor; in the south red sandy soil prevails, in
                    which little save the Palmyra palm will grow. But along the banks of the rivers
                    are rice-fields and a variety of trees and crops. Many shoals occur near the
                    shore, and in the north-east numerous rocks and reefs. The hills which divide
                    Tinnevelli from Travancore are chiefly granite and gneiss; and along the coast
                    stretches the broad belt of alluvium common to the whole east coast of India,
                    and in it are many salt marshes, divided by sand-dunes from the sea. Several
                    veins of calc spar cross the district from east to west, and the beds of all the
                    rivers are more or less encrusted with a deposit of lime. The district contains
                    many ancient and magnificent buildings; but the most interesting antiquities are
                    the large sepulchral earthen urns of prehistoric races which have been found at
                    several places, especially along the course of the Támbrapaní, and which contain
                    bones, pottery of all sorts, beads and bronze ornaments, iron weapons,
                    implements, &amp;c. As the seat of Dravidian civilization Tinnevelli possesses
                    more antiquarian interest than any other part of Madras. The climate is very hot
                    and dry except at <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n424/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0424-0405"/> the season of the monsoons; the average annual
                    rainfall throughout the district is 1ess than 25 inches. Tinnevelli possesses
                    several roads, but no canals. The South Indian Railway enters the district five
                    miles north of Virudupatti and runs to Tuticorin (77 miles); a branch line (18
                    miles) connects this last town with Tinnevelli.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population numbered 1,699,747 (males 825,887, females 873,860), of
                    whom 1,468,977 were Hindus, 89,767 Mohammedans, and 140,946 Christians.
                    Tinnevelli has twelve towns with over 10,000 inhabitants each, viz., <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tinnevelli</hi> (see below); Srívil-liputur, 18,256;
                    Palamcotta, 17,964; Tuticorin, 16,281; Kulase Kharapatnam, 14,972; Sivagiri,
                    13,632; Víravanallur, 12,318; Rajapalayam, 12,021; Tenkasi, 11,987; Káyalpatnam,
                    11,806; Kalladakúrchi, 10,936; and Sivakási, 10,833. Out of the total area of
                    5381 square miles 1403 are uncultivable waste. In 1885-86 cereals, chiefly rice
                    and spiked millet or <hi rend="italic">kambιι,</hi> the staple food of the
                    district, occupied 842,741 acres, pulses 192,341, oil seeds 78,127, and cotton
                    206,717. The total area of forest is roughly estimated at 1500 square miles.
                    Tuticorin is the only port of any importance. The chief exports are cotton,
                    coffee, jaggery, chillies, &amp;c.; sheep, horses, cattle, and poultry are also
                    sent to Ceylon. There is a considerable inland trade with Travancore. The pearl
                    fishery on the coast is now unimportant. Coastal navigation is dangerous. In
                    1885-86 the total revenue of the district was £365,744, of which the land-tax
                    yielded £305,850.</p>
                <p>The early history of Tinnevelli is mixed up with that of Madura and Travancore.
                    Down to 1781 it is a confused tale of anarchy and bloodshed. In that year the
                    nawab of Arcot assigned the revenues to the East India Company, whose officers
                    then undertook the internal administration of affairs. Several risings
                    subsequently took place, and in 1801 the whole Carnatic, including Tinnevelli,
                    was ceded to the British. Tinnevelli is now the most Christian district of all
                    India, both Roman Catholic and Protestant.</p>
