                    development which terminates in the bell or opening of the lower end only begins
                    at a point that varies from a third to a fourth of the total length from that
                    extremity. The air inside is set in vibration by the lips (which act as true
                    reeds) applied to the edges of a basin-like mouthpiece fitted to the upper part
                    of the instrument. The material has nothing to do with the production of that
                    brilliant quality of tone by which the trumpet is so easily distinguished from
                    every other mouthpiece instrument: the difference is partly due to the distinct
                    form given to the basin of the mouthpiece, but principally to the proportions of
                    the column of air determined by the conical or cylindrical form of its
                    envelope.</p>
                <p>The possibility of producing sonorous disturbance of a mass of air through a
                    mouthpiece, or more simply through the orifice of the tube, has been known from
                    a very early period,—a shell bored at its extremity, or a horn with the point
                    removed, being without doubt the most ancient instrument for producing sound.
                    Nearly all the nations of antiquity had mouthpiece instruments; but the greater
                    number of these, though grouped under the general designation of trumpets, have
                    only a very distant relationship to the modern instrument. The Romans had four
                    such instruments,—the <hi rend="italic">tuba, buccina, cornu,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">lituus.</hi> The tuba, represented in the bas-reliefs of the
                    triumphal arch of Titus, was a kind of straight bronze clarion, with a conical
                    column of air. It is ordinarily designated the Roman trumpet, and was about 39
                    inches long; its compass should not go beyond the first six proper notes of the
                    harmonic scale. The Roman tuba and the Greek salpinx are supposed to be one and
                    the same instrument. The buccina was also of bronze, with a tube measuring fully
                    11 feet in length. The tube is only slightly conical, and the quality of tone
                    bears a striking resemblance to that of the bass trombone in G; the proper tones
                    for harmonics were those subjoined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The difficulty of producing the fundamental or first proper
                    note increases with the length and narrowness of the tube. The proportions of
                    the buccina render the production of this note very difficult.</p></note> The
                    cornu was often made of a bullock’s horn, but bronze was also employed, <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0614-0593"/> as in a specimen in the British Museum. This
                    instrument measured 4 feet 6 inches in length, and the scale was that herewith
                    shown. The Roman cornu was probably like the Greek keras. The three preceding
                    instruments were used in giving signals to the infantry. The cavalry calls were
                    given with the lituus, a specimen of which exists in the museum of the Vatican,
                    found in 1827 in a tomb at Cerveteri (Caere). The tube is cylindrical for the
                    greater part of its length, its conical development beginning only at the lower
                    end, where the instrument begins to curve. The lituus easily produces the
                    accompanying proper notes; its quality of tone is like that of a trumpet in G.
                    In Ireland and Denmark numerous mouthpiece instruments in bronze have been
                    found, sixteen different specimens being preserved in the museum of the Royal
                    Irish Academy at Dublin, and six (of which facsimiles exist in South Kensington
                    Museum) in the museum at Copenhagen. But none of these have the proportions of a
                    trumpet; all, by the conical development of the tube as well as by the curved
                    form, recall their first model, the horn, successive transformations of which
                    have given rise to the clarion and the numerous family of bugles.</p>
                <p>We have no precise information as to the form which the lituus, the ancestor of
                    the modern trumpet, assumed during the Middle Ages. A miniature in the
                    Bible<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris.</p></note> presented in 850 to Charles the Bald
                    places the lituus in the hands of one of the companions of King David, but we
                    are not warranted in concluding from this that the Etruscan instrument was in
                    use in the 9th century. The earliest representation of the trumpet with its
                    present proportions of tube and form of bell seems to belong to the 15th
                    century. Fra Angelico (d. 1455) has painted angels with trumpets having either
                    straight or zigzag tubes, the shortest being about 5 feet long. The perfect
                    representation of the details, the exactness of the proportions, the natural
                    pose of the angel players, suggest that the artist painted the instruments from
                    real models.</p>
                <p>The credit of having bent the tube of the trumpet in three parallel branches,
                    thus creating its modern form, has usually been claimed for a Frenchman named
                    Maurin (1498-1515). But the transformation was really made in Italy about the
                    middle of the 15th century, as is proved by the bas-reliefs of Luca della Robbia
                    intended to ornament the organ chamber of the cathedral of Florence (see vol.
                    XX. p. 588); there a trumpet having the tube bent back as just described is very
                    distinctly figured. From the beginning of the 16th century we have numerous
                    sources of information. Virdung<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    distinctive characters, and it is impossible to make them out by examination of
                    his engravings. Probably the felttrumet and the clareta closely resembled each
                    other; but the compass of the former, destined for military signals, hardly went
                    beyond the 8th proper tone, while the latter, reserved for high parts, was like
                    the clarino (see below). The thurner horn was probably a kind of clarino or
                    clarion used by watchmen on the towers. The <hi rend="italic">trummet</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">jäger trommet</hi> are the only two mouthpiece instruments
                    of the trumpet kind cited by Praetorius.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    but with the help of a shank it could be put in C, the equivalent of the
                    “chorton” D, the two differing about a tone. Sometimes the trummet was lowered
                    to B and even B♭. The jäger trommet, or “trompette de chasse,” was composed of a
                    tube bent several times in circles, like the posthorn, to make use of a
                    comparison employed by Praetorius himself. His drawing does not make it clear
                    whether the column of air was like that of the trumpet; there is therefore some
                    doubt as to the true character of the instrument. The same author further cites

                    description of the <hi rend="italic">sourdine,</hi> a kind of mute or damper
                    introduced into the bell, already employed in his time, and still made use of to
                    weaken the sound. The shape of the trumpet, as seen in the bas-reliefs of Luca
                    della Robbia, was retained for more than three hundred years: the first
                    alterations destined to revolutionize the whole technique of the instrument were
                    made about the middle of the 18th century. Notwithstanding the imperfections of
                    the trumpet during this long period, the performers upon it acquired an
                    astonishing dexterity.</p>
                <p>The usual scale of the typical trumpet, that in D, is</p>
                <p>Praetorius exceeds the limits of this compass in the higher range, for he says a
                    good trumpeter could produce the subjoined notes.</p>
                <p>This opinion is shared by Bach, who, in a trumpet solo which ends the cantata
                    “Der Himmel lacht,” wrote up to the twentieth of these sounds. So considerable a
                    compass could not be reached by one instrumentalist: the trumpet part had
                    therefore to be divided, and each division was designated by a special
                    name.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">flattergrob,</hi> the second <hi rend="italic">grobstimme,</hi>
                    the third <hi rend="italic">faulstimme,</hi> the fourth <hi rend="italic"
                    >mittelstimme.</hi> The part that was called principal went from the fifth to
                    the tenth of these tones. The higher region, which had received the name of
                    “clarino,” was again divided into two parts: the first began at the eighth
                    proper tone and mounted up towards the extreme high limit of the compass,
                    according to the skill of the executant; the second, beginning at the sixth
                    proper tone, rarely went beyond the twelfth. Each of these parts was confided to
                    a special trumpeter, who executed it by using a larger or a smaller
                    mouthpiece.</p>
                <p>Playing the clarino differed essentially from playing the military trumpet, which
                    corresponded in compass to that called principal. Compelled to employ very small
                    mouthpieces to facilitate the emission of very high sounds, clarino players
                    could not fail to alter the tone of the instrument, and instead of getting the
                    brilliant and energetic quality of tone of the mean register they were only able
                    to produce more or less doubtful notes without power and splendour. Apart from
                    this inconvenience, the clarino presented numerous deviations from just
                    intonation. Hence the players of that time failed to obviate the bad effects
                    inevitably resulting from the natural imperfection of the harmonic scale of the
                    trumpet in that extreme part of its compass; in the execution, for instance, of
                    the works of Bach, where the trumpet should give sometimes and the
                    instrumentalist could only command some the eleventh proper tone, which times is
                    neither the one nor the other of these.</p>
                <p>Further, the thirteenth proper tone, for which is written, is really too flat,
                    and it is absolutely impossible to remedy this defect, since it entirely depends
                    upon the laws of resonance affecting columns of air.</p>
                <p>Since the abandonment of the clarino (about the middle of the 18th century) our
                    orchestras have been enriched with trumpets that permit the execution of the old
                    clarino parts, not only with perfect justness of intonation, but with a quality
                    of tone that is not deficient in character when compared with the mean register
                    of the old principal instrument. The introduction of the clarinet or little
                    clarino is one of the causes which led to the abandonment of the older
                    instrument and may explain the preference given by the composers of that epoch
                    to the mean register of the trumpet. The clarino having disappeared before
                    Mozart’s day, he had to change the trumpet parts of Handel and Bach to allow of
                    their execution by the performers of his own time. It was now that crooks began
                    to be frequently used. Trumpets were made in F instead of in D, furnished with a
                    series of shanks of increasing length for the tonalities of E, E♭, D, D♭, C, B,
                    B♭, and sometimes even A.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0615-0594"/>
                <p>The first attempts to extend the limited resources of the instrument in its new
                    employment arose out of Hampel’s idea of lowering the harmonic sounds by
                    introducing the hand into the bell. But, instead of fixing the shanks between
                    the mouthpiece and the upper extremity, they were adapted to the body of the
                    instrument itself by a double slide, upon the two branches of which tubes were
                    inserted bent in the form of a circle and gradually lengthened as required. This
                    modified instrument became known as the “invention horn.” This system was
                    applied to the trumpet by Michel Woegel (born at Rastatt in 1748), whose
                    “invention trumpet” had a great success, notwithstanding the unavoidable
                    imperfection of a too great disparity in quality of tone between the open and
                    the closed sounds. The idea of applying the trombone slide to the trumpet is
                    obvious. The slide trumpet is mentioned by T. E. Altenburg,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Versuch einer Anleitung zur
                    heroisch-musikalischen Trompeterund Pauker-Kunst,</hi> Halle, 1795.</p></note>
                    who compares it, and with reason, to the alto trombone; and there are grounds
                    for identifying it with the “tromba da tirarsi” employed by J. S. Bach in some
                    of his compositions. The slide trumpet is still used in England in a somewhat
                    modified form. About 1760, Kolbel, a Russian musician, applied a key to the
                    horn, and soon afterwards the trιmpet received a similar addition. By opening
                    this key, which is placed near the bell, the instrument was raised a diatonic
                    semitone, and by correcting errors of intonation by the pressure of the lips in
                    the mouthpiece the following diatonic succession was obtained.</p>
                <p>This invention was improved in 1801 by Weidinger, trumpeter to the imperial court
                    at Vienna, who increased the number of keys and thus made the trumpet chromatic
                    thoughout its scale. The instrument shown in the accompanying figure is in G;
                    the keys are five in number, and as they open one after another or in
                    combination it is possible to connect the second proper tone with the third by
                    chromatic steps, and thus produce the following succession. The number of keys
                    was applied to fill up the gaps between the extreme sounds of the interval of a
                    fifth; and a like result was arrived at more easily for the intervals of the
                    fourth, the major third, &amp;c., furnished by the proper tones of 3, 4, 5,
                    &amp;c. But, though the keyed trumpet was a notable improvement on the invention
                    trumpet, the sounds obtained by means of the lateral openings of the tube did
                    not possess the qualities which distinguish sounds caused by the resonance of
                    the air-column vibrating in its entirety. But in 1815 Stölzel made a genuine
                    chromatic trumpet by the invention of the ventile or piston; for this ingenious
                    mechanism, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Trombone.</hi> The simple trumpet is now no
                    longer employed except in cavalry regiments.</p>
                <p>It is usually in E♭. The bass trumpet in E♭, which is an octave lower, is
                    sometimes, but rarely, used. Trumpets with pistons are generally constructed in
                    F, with crooks in E and E♭. In Germany trumpets in the high B♭ with a crook in A
                    are very often used in the orchestra. They are easier for cornet à piston
                    players than the trumpet in F. The present writer has recently constructed for
                    the concerts of the Conservatoire at Brussels trumpets in the high D, an octave
                    above the old trumpet in the same key. They permit the execution of the high
                    trumpet parts of Handel and J. S. Bach. The bass trumpet with pistons used for
                    Wagner’s tetralogy is in E♭, in unison with the ordinary trumpet with crooks of
                    D and C; but, when constructed so as to allow of the production of the second
                    proper tone as written by this master, this instrument belongs rather to the
                    trombones than to the trumpets. (V. Μ.)</p>
