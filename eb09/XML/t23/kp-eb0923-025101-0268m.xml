                    (1777-1857), was born on the 4th of May 1777, at Louptière, near
                    Nogent-sur-Seine, in Champagne. His father, though a poor man, sent him to the
                    academy of Sens, where he received a liberal education. At the age of sixteen he
                    went to Paris to study pharmacy. He attended the lectures of Fourcroy and
                    Vauquelin, and saw that the only way to learn chemistry was to work at it.
                    Vauquelin, himself a poor man, admitted a few students to his laboratory on
                    payment of a fee of 20 francs a month. But this fee was prohibitory to the
                    peasant’s son; the utmost that his father could send him just kept him alive in
                    Paris. Thénard went to Vauquelin and asked to be allowed to do any menial work
                    for him, if only he would let him assist in his laboratory. One of Vauquelin’s
                    sisters had slipped into the room and heard part of the conversation; she said
                    to her brother, “He is a good lad; you should keep him; he will help you in the

                    >au</hi><hi rend="italic">feu·,</hi> your dandy assistants always let it boil.”
                    Thénard was engaged on these terms. Long afterwards he said that he looked upon
                    the chemistry of the <hi rend="italic">pot</hi><hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">feu</hi> and the process of simmering as of very great importance:
                    they had been the turning-point of his life. Thénard assisted Vauquelin in the
                    laboratory and at his lectures, and, when by starving for a day or two he
                    accumulated sous enough to pay for a seat in the gallery, used to go to the
                    theatre to improve his pronunciation and rub off his rustic accent.</p>
                <p>By and by Vauquelin gave him an opportunity of testing his powers as a lecturer.
                    Having to go for some days to the country, he asked Thénard to take his place.
                    For the first two or three lectures his attention was fixed on his work, and his
                    eyes did not wander from the lecture table. On the fifth day he ventured to look
                    round the room, when to his consternation he saw Fourcroy and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0269-0252"/> Vauquelin among the audience. They were so
                    satisfied with what they had heard that they obtained for Thénard in 1797 an
                    appointment as teacher of chemistry in a school, and in 1798 the post of
                    répétiteur at the École Polytechnique.</p>
                <p>In 1804 Vauquelin resigned the professorship of chemistry at the Collège de
                    France, and successfully used his influence to have Thénard appointed. In 1810
                    he succeeded Fourcroy both as professor of chemistry at the École Polytechnique
                    and as member of the Academy. He was also appointed professor of chemistry in
                    the faculty of the sciences. ^ He was made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour
                    in 1814, commander in 1837, and grand officer in 1842. In 1825 Charles X. gave
                    him the title of baron; from 1827 to 1830 he represented the department of Yonne
                    in the chamber of deputies. In 1832 Louis Philippe made him a peer of France. As
                    vice-president of the conseil supérieure de l’instruction publique, he exercised
                    a great influence on scientific education in France. He died 21st June 1857, and
                    was buried at La Ferte, near Châlon-sur-Saône. In 1861 a statue was erected to
                    him at Sens, and in 1865 the name of his native village was changed to La
                    Louptière-Thénard. Thénard was tall and strongly built, his hair was thick and
                    black, his eyes bright, and his manner active and prompt. He married, in 1810,
                    Mlle. Humblot, granddaughter of Conté. His wife and several of his children
                    predeceased him. He was survived by his son Paul, who had assisted him in some
                    of his later researches.</p>
                <p>Thénard was above all things a teacher: as he himself said, the professor, the
                    assistants, the laboratory, everything, must be sacrificed to the students. The
                    history of his discovery of the peroxide of hydrogen well illustrates the
                    predominance of the teacher in his character. He was lecturing on the formation
                    of salts, and had told his students that a metal must be oxidized to a certain
                    extent in order that it may combine with an acid to form a salt; if the metal be
                    combined with more than the proper quantity of oxygen, the excess of oxygen will
                    be given off when the oxide is treated with an acid, and, as an illustration, he
                    mentioned the action of acids on peroxide of barium. As he spoke his conscience
                    smote him, for the experiment had not been made. Immediately after lecture he
                    mixed peroxide of barium and nitric acid, keeping the temperature low by means
                    of ice. He was surprised to see the peroxide dissolve without any evolution of
                    gas. He left the mixture standing, and next day, before lecture, noticed small
                    bubbles of gas rising from it. Pouring some of the liquid into a test-tube and
                    warming it, he saw a large amount of gas escape, which he easily recognized as
                    pure oxygen. At first he thought the acid had been oxidized, but he soon saw the
                    true explanation of the phenomena, and discovered the peroxide of hydrogen. His
                    lecture experiments were few, well-chosen, and accurately performed. If any
                    failure occurred he would roundly scold his assistant, often apologizing for his
                    vehemence when the short fit of anger was over. His lecture room, seated for
                    1000, was almost always crowded by eager and attentive students and
                    visitors.</p>
                <p>Like most great teachers, Thénard published a text-book, and perhaps we may say
                    that by his <hi rend="italic">Traité de Chimie Élémentaire, Théorique et
                    Pratique</hi> (4 vols., Paris, 1813-16; 6th ed., 5 vols., 1833-36) he did even
                    more to further the progress of the science than by his numerous and important
                    original discoveries. His first original paper (1799) was on the compounds of
                    arsenic and antimony with oxygen and sulphur. Careful analyses led him to
                    conclusions as to the composition of the metallic oxides contradictory of some
                    of Berthollet’s theoretical views; he also showed (1802) that Berthollet’s
                    “zoonic acid” was impure acetic acid. Berthollet, far from resenting these
                    corrections from a younger man, took this opportunity of introducing himself,
                    and invited Thénard to become a member of the “Société d’Arcueil,” to the
                    proceedings of which Thénard contributed important papers. Soon after his
                    appointment as répétiteur at the École Polytechnique Thénard made the
                    acquaintance of Gay-Lussac, and formed with him a lifelong friendship. Their
                    joint work, and its relation to the discoveries of Davy, have been fully
                    recorded in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Gay-Lussac.</hi> Of his separate
                    investigations perhaps the most important is that on the compound ethers, begun
                    in 1807. He showed that each acid gives its own ether, and that the acid and
                    alcohol can be recovered by decomposing the ether by means of caustic alkali.
                    His discovery of peroxide of hydrogen (1818) has already been described. His
                    researches on sebacic acid (1802) and on bile (1807) also deserve special
                    notice. The blue substance known as Thénard’s blue (essentially aluminate of
                    cobalt) was prepared by him in response to a demand by Chaptai for a cheap blue,
                    as bright ,as ultramarine, and capable of standing the temperature of the
                    porcelain furnace.</p>
                <p>Thénard’s researches were chiefly published in the <hi rend="italic">Annale» de
                    Chimie et de</hi><hi rend="italic">Physique,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
