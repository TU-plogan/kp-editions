                    1602-1659), a distinguished Dutch navigator, born at Hoorn, North Holland,
                    probably in 1602 or 1603. He is known to have made two important voyages of
                    discovery in the Pacific and Southern Oceans; only of the second of them have we
                    a full account. In June 1639 Tasman, along with Matthew Quast, was despatched by
                    Van Diemen, governorgeneral of the Dutch East Indies, on a voyage to the Western
                    Pacific, which was first directed to the Philippine Islands; part of the coast
                    of Luzon was explored. Sailing east and north Tasman and Quast touched at
                    several of the Bonin Islands, which they were probably the first to discover.
                    Sailing still farther north, in quest of what were then known as the “islands of
                    gold and silver,” they reached the latitude of 38° 40' N., about 600 miles east
                    of Japan, and continued east for other 300 miles on the parallel without
                    discovering anything. On October 15 the navigators decided to return, and, after
                    touching at Japan, anchored at Taiwan-fu, Formosa, November 21. After this,
                    Tasman was engaged in operations in the Indian seas until 1642, when he set out
                    on his first great expedition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Several Dutch navigators had already discovered various portions of the west
                    coast of Australia, and the Dutch East India Company were anxious to obtain a
                    more accurate and extended survey of that land. Sailing from Batavia on August
                    14, 1642, with two vessels, the “Heemskirk” and “Zeehaan,” Tasman on November 24
                    sighted the land to which he gave the name of Van Diemen, in honour of the
                    governor-general, but which is now named Tasmania. He doubled the land, which he
                    evidently did not know was an island, and, running up Storm Bay, anchored on
                    December 1 in the bay to which he gave the name of Frederick Henry. There he set
                    up a post on which he hoisted the Dutch flag. Quitting Van Diemen’s Land on
                    December 5, Tasman steered eastwards with a vague idea of reaching the Solomon
                    Islands, and on December 13 he discovered a “high mountainous country,” which he
                    called “Staatenland” (New Zealand). Cruising along the west coast of the South
                    Island, he anchored on the 18th in 40° 50' S. lat., at the entrance of a “wide
                    opening,” which he took to be a “fine bay,” but which was no doubt Cook’s
                    Strait. He gave the name of Moordenaars (Massacre) Bay to the bay, at which he
                    attempted to land, and where several of his men were killed by the natives.
                    Leaving New Zealand, and pursuing an irregularly north direction, but never
                    coming in sight of Australia, he discovered, on January 21, 1643, two islands
                    belonging to the Friendly group, to which he gave the names of Middelburg (Eova)
                    and Amsterdam (Tongatabu). After discovering several other islands in the
                    Friendly group and their neighbourhood, Tasman steered north and west, reaching
                    the neighbourhood of New Britain on March 22. On the 24th he passed Morghen
                    Islands, and, sailing round New Ireland and along the north coast of New Guinea,
                    he cleared the straits between New Guinea and Jilolo, arriving at Batavia on
                    June 15, after a ten months’ voyage.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    found the “Instructions” given to Tasman for his voyage to New Guinea. He is
                    instructed to obtain a thorough knowledge of Staten and Van Diemen’s Land, and
                    “whether New Guinea is a continent with the great Zuidland, or separated by
                    channels and islands,” and also “whether the new Van Diemen’s Land is the same
                    continent with these two great countries or with one of them.” In this voyage
                    Tasman had three vessels under his command. His discoveries were confined to the
                    north and north-west coasts of Australia, and his chart gives the soundings for
                    the whole of this line of coast. He discovered the Gulf of Carpentaria, and
                    established the continuity of the north-west coast of the land designated
                    generally “the great known south continent,” as far south as about the 22d
                    degree. The fullest details as to maps of the voyage and other authorities will
                    be found in Mr Major’s Hakluyt Society volume referred to above. Tasman rightly
                    ranks as one of the greatest navigators of the 17th century. He died at Batavia
                    in October 1659.</p>
