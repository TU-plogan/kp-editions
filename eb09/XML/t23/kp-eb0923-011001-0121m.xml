                    in Wermland. His father was a pastor, and his grandparents on both sides were
                    peasants. His father, whose name had been Esaias Luβasson, took the surname of
                    Γegnerus—altered by his fifth son, the poet, to Tegnér —from the hamlet of
                    Tegnaby in Smâland, where he was born. In 1799 Tegnér, hitherto educated in the
                    country, entered the university of Lund, where he graduated in philosophy in
                    1802, and continued as tutor until 1810, when he was elected Greek lecturer. In
                    1812 he was named professor, and continued to work as a lecturer in Lund until
                    1824, when he was made bishop of Wexiö. At Wexiö he remained until his death,
                    twenty-two years later. Tegnér’s early poems have little merit. He was
                    comparatively slow in development. His first great success was a dithyrambic
                    war-song for the army of 1808, which stirred every Swedish heart. In 1811 his
                    patriotic poem <hi rend="italic">Svea</hi> won the great prize of the Swedish
                    Academy, and made him famous. In the same year was founded in Stockholm the
                    Gothic League <hi rend="italic">{Götiska forbundet),</hi> a sort of club of
                    young and patriotic men of letters, of whom Tegnér quickly became the chief. The
                    club published a magazine, entitled <hi rend="italic">Iduna,</hi> in which it
                    printed a great deal of excellent poetry, and ventilated its views, particularly
                    as regards the study of old Icelandic literature and history. Tegnér, Geijer,
                    Afzelius, and Nicander became the most famous members of the Gothic League. Of
                    the very numerous poems written by Tegnér in the little room at Lund which is
                    now shown to visitors as the Tegnér museum, the majority are short, and even
                    occasional lyrics. His celebrated <hi rend="italic">Sony to the Sun</hi> dates
                    from 1817. He completed three poems of a more ambitious character, on which his
                    fame chiefly rests. Of these, two, the romance of <hi rend="italic">Axel</hi>
                    and the delicately-chiselled idyl of <hi rend="italic">Nattvards-barnen</hi>
                    (“The First Communion,” 1820), translated by Longfellow, take a secondary place
                    in comparison with Tegnér’s masterpiece, of world-wide fame. In 1820 he
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Iduna</hi> certain fragments of an epic or cycle
                    of epical pieces, on which he was then working, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frithiofssaga</hi> or the Story of Frithiof. In 1822 he published five more
                    cantos, and in 1825 the entire poem. Before it was completed it was famous
                    throughout Europe; the aged Goethe took up his pen to commend to his countrymen
                    this “alte, kräftige, gigantisch-barbarische Dichtart,” and desired Amalie von
                    Imhoff to translate it into German. This romantic paraphrase of an ancient saga
                    was composed in twenty-four cantos, all differing in verse form, modelled
                    somewhat, it is only fair to say, on an earlier Danish masterpiece, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Helge</hi> of Oehlenschlagaer. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Frithiofssaga</hi> is the best known of all Swedish productions; it is said to
                    have been translated nineteen times into English, eighteen times into German,
                    and once at least into every European language. It is far from satisfying the
                    demands of more recent antiquarian research, but it still is allowed to give the
                    freshest existing impression, in imaginative form, of life in early Scandinavia.
                    In later years Tegnér began, but left unfinished, two important epical poems,
                    <hi rend="italic">Gerda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kroηbruden.</hi> The period
                    of the publication of <hi rend="italic">Frithiofssaga</hi> (1825) was the
                    critical epoch of his career. It made him one of the most famous poets of
                    Europe; it transferred him from his study in Lund to the bishop’s palace in
                    Wexiö; it marked the first breakdown of his health, which had hitherto been
                    excellent; and it witnessed a singular moral crisis in the inner history of the
                    poet, about which much has been written, but of vrhich little is known. Tegnér
                    was at this time passionately in love with a certain beautiful Euphrosyne Palm,
                    the wife of a town-councillor in Lund, and this unfortunate passion, while it
                    inspired much of his finest poetry, turned the poet’s blood to gall. From this
                    time forward the heartlessness of woman is one of Tegnér’s principal themes. It
                    is a remarkable sign of the condition of Sweden at that time that a man not in
                    holy orders, and so little in possession of the religious temperament as Tegnér,
                    should be offered and should accept a bishop’s crozier. He did not hesitate in
                    accepting it: it was a great honour; he was poor; and he was anxious to get away
                    from Lund. No sooner, however, had he begun to study for his new duties than he
                    began to regret the step he had taken. It was nevertheless too late to go back,
                    and Tegnér made a respectable bishop as long as his health lasted. But he became
                    moody and melancholy; as early <pb break="no"

                    brain, and in 1840, during a visit to Stockholm, he suddenly became insane. He
                    was sent to an asylum in Schleswig, and early in 1841 he was cured, and able to
                    return to Wexiö. It was during his convalescence in Schleswig that he wrote <hi
                    rend="italic">Kronbruden.</hi> He wrote no more of importance; in 1843 he had a
                    stroke of apoplexy, and on the 2d of November 1846 he died in Wexiö. From 1819
                    he had been a member of the Swedish Academy, where he was succeeded by his
                    biographer and best imitator Böttiger. In prose Tegnér wrote letters, which have
                    been collected, and which are considered the best of their kind in the Swedish
                    language. As a poet he will scarcely be preferred to Bellman or to Runeberg by
                    Swedish verse amateurs, but he still exceeds these and all other writers in
                    popularity.</p>
