                    settled in Copenhagen, and there carried on the trade of a wood-carver. While
                    very young, Bertel Thorwaldsen learnt to assist his father; at the age of eleven
                    he entered the Copenhagen school of art, and soon began to show his exceptional
                    talents. In 1792 he won the highest prize, the travelling studentship, and in
                    1796 he started for Italy in a Danish man-of-war. On the 8th of March 1797 he
                    arrived in Rome, where Canova was at the height of his popularity. Thorwaldsen’s
                    first success was the model for a statue of Jason, which was highly praised by
                    Canova, and he received the commission to execute it in marble from Thomas Hope,
                    a wealthy English art-patron. From that time Thorwaldsen’s success was assured,
                    and he did not leave Italy for twenty-three years. In 1819 he returned to
                    Denmark, where he was received with the greatest enthusiasm. He was there
                    commissioned to make the colossal series of statues of Christ and the twelve
                    apostles which are now in the Fruenkirche in Copenhagen. These were executed
                    after his return to Rome, and were not completed till 1838, when Thorwaldsen
                    again returned to Denmark. He died suddenly in the Copenhagen theatre in 1844,
                    and bequeathed a great part of his fortune for the building and endowment of a
                    museum in Copenhagen, and also left to fill it all his collection of works of
                    art, and the models for all his sculpture,—a very large collection, exhibited to
                    the greatest possible advantage. Thorwaldsen is buried in the courtyard of this
                    museum, under a bed of roses, by his own special wish.</p>
                <p>On the who!e Thorwaldsen was the most successful of all the imitators of
                    classical sculpture, and many of his statues of pagan deities are modelled with
                    much of the antique feeling for breadth and purity of design. His attempts at
                    Christian sculpture, such as the tomb of Pius VIL in St Peter’s and the Christ
                    and Apostles at Copenhagen, are less successful, and were not in accordance with
                    the sculptor’s real sympathies, which were purely classic. Thorwaldsen’s private
                    life was not admirable: he worked sometimes with feverish eagerness; at other
                    times he was idle for many months together. A great number of his best works
                    exist in private collections in England. His not very successful statue of Lord
                    Byron, after being refused a place in Westminster Abbey, was finally deposited
                    in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge. The most widely popular among
                    Thorwaldsen’s works have been some of his bas-reliefs, such as the Night and the
                    Morning, which he is said to have modelled in one day. In the main his
                    popularity is now a thing of the past, owing chiefly to the reaction against the
                    pseudo-classic style of sculpture.</p>
