                <p><label type="entry">TABERNACLE</label>, the portable sanctuary of Israel in the
                    wilderness wanderings. Critical analysis of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pentateuch</hi> (γ.-v.) teaches us to draw a sharp line between the old notices
                    of the tabernacle contained in the pre-Deutero-nonιic history book (JE) and the
                    account given by the post-exilic priestly narrator. The latter throws back into
                    the time of Moses the whole scheme of worship and ritual of which the second
                    temple was the centre, and, as this scheme necessarily implies the existence of
                    an elaborate sanctuary on the pattern of the temple, he describes a tabernacle
                    of extraordinary splendour pitched in the middle of the camp, with an outer and
                    inner chamber and a courtyard, and all the apparatus of sacrificial and atoning
                    ritual, just as in the temple, only constructed of boards, posts, and curtains
                    so that it could be taken down and moved from place to place. The whole
                    description is ideal, as appears not only from the details but from the fact
                    that the old history knows nothing of such a structure. The Chronicler indeed,
                    who had before him the Pentateuch in its present shape, assumes that after the
                    Israelites entered Canaan the tabernacle continued to be the one legitimate
                    place of sacrifice until it was superseded by Solomon’s temple, and represents
                    it as standing at Gibeon in the days of David and his son (1 Chron. xxi. 29 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.;</hi> 2 Chron. i. 3). But the book of Kings knows Gibeon only
                    as “the greatest high place” (1 Kings iii. 4).<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two passages in the old history, which
                    comprises the books of Judges, Samuel, and Kings, speak of the tabernacle <hi

                    to be interpolated (1 Sam. ii. 22; 1 Kings viii. 4).</p></note></p>
                <p>Again, the tabernacle of the Priestly Code is pre-eminently the sanctuary of the
                    ark, bearing the name <hi rend="italic">mishkan haedûth,</hi> “the tabernacle of
                    the testimony,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the habitation in which lay “the
                    ark of the testimony” or chest containing the stones on which the decalogue w as
                    inscribed. But between Joshua’s days and the building of the temple the ark
                    migrated from one tent or habitation to another (2 Sam. vii. 6; 1 Chron. xvii.
                    5), and at Shiloh it was housed not in a tent but in a temple (1 Sam. iii. 3,
                    15). And, while in the Priestly Code the tabernacle is the only legitimate
                    sanctuary and its priests are the only legitimate priests, the whole history
                    shows that no such restriction was even thought of till after the time of the
                    prophet Isaiah.</p>
                <p>With all this it agrees that the oldest parts of the Pentateuch speak indeed of a
                    tabernacle, but one of a quite different kind. The tabernacle of the Elohist
                    (for of the two narratives—Elohistic and Jahvistic—which are combined in the
                    so-called Jehovistic history only the former seems to mention it) is a tent
                    which Moses pitched outside the camp (Exod. xxxiii. 7 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.∖</hi> and -where Jehovah was wont to reveal Himself to him in the pillar of
                    cloud, which descended for the purpose and stood at the door (Num. xi. 25; xii.
                    5; xiv. 10); it is therefore called <hi rend="italic">ohel mded,</hi> “the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n15/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0015-0006"/> tent of tryst.” No description of it is given,
                    nor is its origin spoken of, but something of the old narrative has obviously
                    been lost before Exod. xxxiii. 7, and here what is lacking was probably
                    explained. It appears, however, that it was very different from the tabernacle
                    described by the priestly narrator. It τvas not in the centre of the camp but
                    stood some distance outside it,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In old Israel the sanctuary, after the people had settled
                    down in cities, usually stood outside the town, and this was the case even with
                    the temple at Jerusalem when it was first built.</p></note> and it was not the
                    seat of an elaborate organization of priests and guarded by a host of Levites,
                    but had a single minister and custodian, viz., Joshua, who was not a Levite at
                    all but Moses’ attendant (Exod. xxxiii. 11).</p>
                <p>The existence of such a simple tent sanctuary presents none of the difficulties
                    that beset the priestly narrative. Portable shrines were familiar to Semitic
                    antiquity, and tents as sanctuaries were known to the Israelites in much later
                    times at the high places and in connexion with irregular worships (Ezek. xvi.
                    16, “thou didst take of thy garments and madest for thyself sewn high places,”
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> shrines of curtains sewn together; 2 Kings xxiii.
                    7, where for “hangings for the grove” read “tents for the Ashera”; comp. Hos.
                    ix. 6 and Syriac <hi rend="italic">prakk,</hi> Assyrian <hi rend="italic"
                    >parakku,</hi> a small chapel or shrine, from the same root as Hebrew <hi
                    rend="italic">paroketh,</hi> the vail of the Holy of Holies). Such idolatrous
                    tabernacles were probably relics of the usages of the nomadic Semites, and it is
                    only natural that Israel in its wanderings should have had the like. And it is
                    noteworthy that the portable chapels of the heathen Semites were mainly used for
                    divination (comp. <hi rend="italic">Journ. of Philol.,</hi> xiii. 283 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf</hi> just as the Mosaic tabernacle is described by the Elohist
                    not as a place of sacrifice (such as the tabernacle of the Priestly Code is) but
                    as a place of oracle.</p>
                <p>The heathen shrines of this sort contained portable idols or baetylia (see
                    Selden, <hi rend="italic">De Diis Symis,</hi> i. 6); but what the Mosaic
                    tabernacle contained is not expressly told. The ordinary and seemingly the
                    easiest assumption is that the ark stood in it, and Deut. x. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> w hich must be drawn from the lost part of the older narrative
                    already alluded to, certainly places the construction of the ark, to contain the
                    tables of stone, just before the time when the tabernacle is first mentioned by
                    the Elohist. But neither in Deuteronomy nor before it are the ark and the
                    tabernacle ever mentioned together, and of the two old narrators it is not clear
                    that the Jahvist ever mentions the tabernacle or the Elohist the ark. The
                    relation between the two calls for further investigation, especially as the ark
                    retains its importance after the occupation of Canaan, while the “tent of tryst”
                    is not mentioned after the time of Moses, who, according to the Elohist (Exod.
                    xii.), enjoyed at it a privilege of direct access to the Deity not ajccorded to
                    later prophets.</p>
