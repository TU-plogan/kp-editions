                    population of the United States of America, is bounded by the Gulf of Mexico on
                    the S.E., by Louisiana and Arkansas on the E., by Arkansas and the Indian
                    Territory on the N., the latter extending north of its northern prolongation
                    (the Panhandle), by New Mexico on the W. and N. of its western prolongation (the
                    trans-Pecos region), and by Mexico on the S.W. Its area in 1880 was 262,290

                    Red river of Louisiana, thence following that river west to its intersection

                    long., thence south to lat. 32°, thence west to its intersection with the Rio
                    Grande, which river constitutes the south-western border of the State to the
                    Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                <p>The surface features are exceedingly varied, the prevailing elements being
                    steppes or treeless plains in the north-west, mountains west of the Pecos river,
                    forests in the east, marshes adjacent to the coast, low prairies in the
                    south-east, and a combination of prairies and broken hills, interspersed with
                    forest growth and thickets of tall shrubs (chaparral), in the centre. These
                    regions are classified as follows (see map below). (1) The coast plain is the
                    direct geographical and geological continuation of the other States which border
                    on the Gulf of Mexico. It includes all the country east of a line concentric
                    with the coast, drawn from Texarkana in the north-east corner of the State to
                    near Laredo on the Rio Grande. The general direction of its slope, in common
                    with that of the rest of the State, is from north-west to south-east. Its
                    altitude ranges up to 500 feet. The immediate coast strip is newly made
                    marshland; west of this and north of the Colorado river are forests; and to the
                    south of it the country is mostly a plain. (2) The black prairie region succeeds
                    the coast plain on the west. Its western border is sharply defined from the Red
                    river to the Rio Grande, beginning at Denison, passing through or near the
                    cities of Sherman, Dallas, Waco, Austin, and San Antonio, and then deflected
                    westward to Eagle Pass. It is a gently undulating prairie, covered with a rich
                    black soil, and varies in altitude from 300 to 700 feet. (3) The central region
                    extends from the black prairie region on the east to the eastern escarpment of
                    the great plains on the north-west and the trans-Pecos mountains on the
                    south-west. This is the only region of Texas which is not the direct
                    continuation of the physical features of some adjoining political division. A
                    great variety of conditions is embraced within its bounds. In its north-eastern
                    part are two long belts of stunted forest (the Cross Timbers), extending from
                    the Red river to the Brazos, and separated by a prairie 50 miles in width. This
                    is the most fertile portion of the entire region. West of this sub-region and
                    north of the Colorado is a broken, arid country (the Coal-measures), having a
                    sandy, pebbly soil, covered with a scattered growth of vegetation. West of this,
                    between the 100th meridian and the escarpment of the plains, is the gypsum
                    country, consisting of the so-called “red beds” of the western United States,
                    accompanied by massive deposits of gypsum and other salts. This country is much
                    sculptured by erosion, and in places resembles the “bad lands” of the upper
                    Missouri country. There are also extensive intervals of prairie here. Near the
                    centre, in the counties of San Saba, Mason, and Llano, is a rough,
                    semi-mountainous area of older formations. The southern half of the central
                    region is a broken country of white limestone formation, semi-tropical in
                    climate, and covered with scraggy vegetation, its physical features graduating
                    into those of northern Mexico. The south-western part is a rolling plain,
                    entirely destitute of streams. Throughout the region, at intervals of many
                    miles, low, truncated hills <hi rend="italic">(buttes)</hi> occur, representing
                    the remains of limestone formations now being rapidly, eroded. The region, as a
                    whole, is poorly watered. It is best adapted for cattle and sheep raising, and
                    is the chief locality of those industries in Texas. The altitude varies from 700
                    to 2500 feet. (4) The plains region is the portion of the State west of the
                    101st meridian and north of the thirty-second parallel, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0220-0203"/> commonly known as the “Staked Plain” (Llano
                    Estacado). It is the direct southern continuation and termination of the great
                    plains of the North American continent which extend along the eastern slope of
                    the Rocky Mountains from British America to tho Rio Pecos. The eastern edge is
                    well marked by a steep escarpment, which, in consequence of destructive erosion,
                    is constantly receding to the westward. The surface is smooth, and utterly
                    devoid of forest growth or streams of water. But there are many small ponds or
                    lakes, and in the southern part these are saline. The soil is light, rich, and
                    porous, and is covered with a good growth of grass. Until a few years ago this
                    region was totally unpeopled, but many portions of it are now (1887) used for
                    grazing purposes, water being secured by means of wells or artificially
                    constructed reservoirs. The altitude ranges from 2500 to 4000 feet. (5) The
                    trans-Pecos or mountainous region west of the Pecos river is composed of
                    numerous mountain peaks and ranges, with intervening valleys of many miles in
                    width. It is poorly watered, and the population outside the immediate Rio Grande
                    valley is very sparse. The general level of the country is from 3000 to 5000
                    feet.</p>
                <p>The rivers are separable into several sub-systems. The Rio Grande and the
                    Arkansas, constituting the north and south limits of the Texas drainage system,
                    with their respective tributaries, the Pecos and the Canadian, originate in a
                    limited district of northern New Mexico and Colorado, and ultimately reach the
                    sea at points a thousand miles apart. The Canadian and the Pecos have cut deep
                    canons through the Llano Estacado. The former continues eastward through Indian
                    Territory, and the latter southward, joining the Rio Grande between 101° and
                    102° W. long, on the southern border of the State. The Rio Grande and the Pecos
                    receive no tributaries of importance in Texas, but are constant in their flow.
                    The next and most important group comprises the Red, the Brazos, and the
                    Colorado, all of which originate along the eastern border of the Llano. They
                    traverse similar regions, and have a general resemblance in character of
                    sediment, irregularity of flow, velocity, and topography of drainage basins.
                    Their brackish water is principally derived from the sudden precipitation of
                    rainfall along the gypsiferous escarpments of the Llano. Its volume is
                    ordinarily small, the flow often ceasing entirely west of the black prairie
                    region. There are periodic freshets, however, which suddenly swell the volume to
                    enormous proportions. These freshets, laden with the rich red loam of the
                    plains, usually reach the lower inhabited sections of the State in periods of
                    drought, and are termed “red rises.” Much of this sediment is deposited upon the
                    flood plane of the lower valleys, and by this process the most valuable sugar
                    and cotton lands of the coast plain have been built up. Another important group
                    consists of the Sabine, the Trinity, the San Marcos, the Guadalupe, and the
                    Nueces, most of which have their origin near the western border of the black
                    prairie region. These streams have a greater volume and are more constant in
                    flow than any others, and are usually without deep canons or wide bottoms. Many
                    of them, especially those south of Austin, have their origin from large springs
                    situated along the foot of the escarpment line extending from Austin
                    southwestward. Another subsidiary system of streams originates in the narrow
                    Quaternary region along the coast, within the district of the greatest rainfall.
                    These streams are tidal, and sometimes navigable towards their mouths. Most of
                    them are locally known as bayous. In general, the rivers of Texas are not
                    adapted for irrigation or navigation. Neither do they afford much available
                    water power north of Austin.</p>
                <p>The entire geologic series, with a few exceptions, is represented in Texas. The
                    earlier Palaeozoic rocks, including the pre-Cambrian (Keweenawian; A in
                    accompanying geological map), the Potsdam (oc), and the Ordovician (oc), up to
                    the Trenton, underlie the State, but are only exposed in two limited districts.
                    The first of these is in the counties of Mason, Llano, Burnet, and San Saba in
                    the central region; the other is in the disturbed mountainous portion of the
                    trans-Pecos region. The Cambrian was deposited horizontally upon the upturned
                    Keweenawian, and the Ordovician appears to rest conformably upon the Cambrian
                    (Potsdam); but there λvas a continental elevation of the whole region, probably
                    commencing at the close of the Trenton epoch, which continued until the
                    beginning of the Coal-measure epoch, for the Upper Silurian, Devonian, and
                    sub-Carboniferous are absent, and the earlier rocks are disturbed. These earlier
                    Palaeozoic sediments present no marked stratigraphical or palaeontological
                    differences from the same formations throughout the continent, and thus show the
                    widely distributed uniformity of conditions which then existed. At the
                    commencement of the Carboniferous period, however, that marked difference of
                    faunal, lithological, and stratigraphical features began which distinguishes the
                    synchronous deposits of the later formations of the western and eastern portions
                    of the United States. The Texas region has been the transition ground, and hence
                    all the geologic deposits, beginning with the Carboniferous, have two faces,
                    dependent upon their geographical position east or west of 100° W. long., and
                    representing the sediments either of interior continental basins or of the
                    waters of the Atlantic during alternating periods of submergence and emergence.
                    The Carboniferous rocks, and most of the succeeding formations, are exposed in
                    two widely separated portions of the State, with entirely different lithological
                    and faunal aspects. The mutual relations of these series have never been traced.
                    The first occurs in the central region between 97° and 100° W. long., north of
                    the Colorado river, and consists of clays, sandstones, conglomerates,
                    limestones, and coal seams of workable thickness. It is the southwestern
                    prolongation and termination of the Coal-measures of the eastern United States.
                    These rocks, although in general similar to them, differ in some respects from
                    those of the same formation further east, and also exhibit a few resemblances to
                    the strictly marine Carboniferous of the Rocky Mountain region (κ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>), To the other series belongs the trans-Pecos
                    Carboniferous (κ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>). Although this is of the same
                    geologic age as the eastern Coal-measures, it is a purely marine deposit of
                    limestones and sandstones, and is barren of vegetable remains. It is exposed
                    along the Guadalupe and other mountains of the trans-Pecos region, forming the
                    most eastern outcrops of the non-coal-bearing Carboniferous of the west. The
                    study of the areal distribution and relation of the strata intervening between
                    the Carboniferous and the fully-identified Cretaceous in Texas has not been
                    begun. The Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic, if they exist, have not been clearly
                    diagnosed, although these names have been applied to the series of rocks west of
                    the central Carboniferous region. The thickness of the sediments belonging to
                    these undetermined strata is very great. They are mostly un∙ fossiliferous, and
                    the presence of stratified gypsum and other salts indicates that they were laid
                    down in an interior basin cut off from oceanic waters and were too highly
                    concentrated for the existence of molluscan life. Certain of these deposits,
                    known as “red beds” or “Jura-Trias” <hi rend="smallcaps">(jt),</hi> extend
                    beneath the Llano Estacado, across New Mexico, and into Arizona. The Cretaceous
                    is by far the most conspicuous and extensive of the geologic formations of the
                    State. It once covered the entire territory, but has been eroded away in many
                    places west of the black prairie region, exposing the older formations, and is
                    covered to the east of that region by more recent deposits. From the fact that
                    the lowest member of the series is found resting directly upon the pre-Cambrian
                    in Llano county, the Carboniferous in Lampasas and the counties northward, the
                    Silurian in the trans-Pecos region, and the Jura-Trias beds in the plains
                    region, it is evident that its beginning marked a period of continental
                    submergence, and that this submergence, from the great thickness of pelagic
                    sediments in it, was long continued. The lowest member of the series, the oldest
                    known of the American Cretaceous, is unknown elsewhere in the United States, and
                    its peculiar features give individuality to the central region. This member <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(cn),</hi> which may be called the Texas group, is the
                    equivalent of the Neocomian of Europe, and many of its fossils are common to
                    Europe and America. It is not exposed east of the central region, except
                    (probably) in the salines of Louisiana. There was a great elevation of this
                    deep-sea formation at its close, as is attested by the shallow water sediments
                    of later groups deposited unconformably upon it. The Middle (cc, cs <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) and the Upper Cretaceous (cs <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> and cs <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) are also well exposed. The black
                    prairie region is underlain by the middle and upper groups of the marine
                    Cretaceous characteristic of the other Gulf States and known as the Rotten
                    Limestone (cs <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) and Ripley (cs <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi>) groups. The Cretaceous groups of the Rocky Mountain
                    region extend into Texas, and are exposed in the trans-Pecos region and along
                    the lower Rio Grande. The <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0221-0204"/> Tertiary formations, so far as recognized, are
                    purely marine, and, like the marine Upper Cretaceous of the black prairie
                    region, are the direct geographical continuation of the formations of the other
                    Gulf States. They occupy the coast plain, in bands approximately concentric with
                    the shore of the Gulf of Mexico, and represent the sediments of its receding
                    waters. The alleged occurrence of the fresh-water Miocene, the Loup river group
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(m),</hi> upon the Llano Estacado has not been
                    demonstrated. Quaternary <hi rend="smallcaps">(q)</hi> and other recent alluvial
                    deposits occur along the coast and the upper terraces of the three older river
                    systems as far west as the eastern border of the central region. This is
                    attested by the character of the deposits, accompanied by well-authenticated
                    remains of the elephant and mastodon. These Quaternary soils are mostly the
                    redeposited detritus of the strata of the eastern escarpment of the Llano
                    Estacado, which is carried down by the “red rises.” The surface features of the
                    central region are the result of sub-aerial denudation. The black prairie is
                    protected from this destructive erosive process by the tenacious character of
                    its soil; and the coast plain is covered by a luxuriant forest growth, and is
                    constantly extending eastward by the recession of the shore line. The final
                    emergence of the State began in Middle Cretaceous time, and was connected with
                    the same movements that brought up the Rocky Mountain system. The strata of
                    Texas, except the Palaeozoic groups, are soft, and yield readily to
                    disintegration. A few eruptive sheets are found in the trans-Pecos region and
                    along the lower Rio Grande, being remnants of the eastern edge of the great
                    eruptive area of the Rocky Mountain region. Granitic masses occur, as extrusions
                    from the preCambrian, in the central and trans-Pecos Palaeozoic deposits.</p>
                <p>The eastern ranges of the Rocky Mountain system are deflected towards the Gulf of
                    Mexico after passing south of 33° N. lat., and take a south-easterly course
                    through Texas into Mexico, the trend of their axes being generally parallel to
                    the direction of the Rio Grande and its principal tributaries. The only true
                    mountains in Texas are situated west of the Pecos, with the exception of a few
                    foot-hills <hi rend="italic">(domitas)</hi> which re-enter the State from Mexico
                    near Eagle Pass and follow the river to an undetermined point below Laredo. The
                    principal ranges are the Guadalupe, Limpia, Chinali, Los Chisos, Organ, and
                    Franklin Mountains. They are composed of older rocks, in most places; the later
                    formations have been washed away, except where protected by eruptive flows. The
                    most eastern and northern of these mountains are usually the highest. Guadalupe
                    Peak is 9000 feet; Limpia Peak and the crest of the Chinalis, from 3500 to 8000
                    feet; Eagle Mountains, 7000; and the intervening valleys from 3500 to 5000 feet.
                    The low buttes of the central region are miscalled mountains upon most maps.
                    There are several well-defined escarpments extending for long distances,
                    approximately north and south The step of the first of these, from Austin to
                    Eagle Pass, is from 200 to 500 feet high, and is the result of an elevation at
                    the close of the early Cretaceous period. Near the 100th meridian another
                    escarpment occurs, and along the eastern and southern borders of the Staked
                    Plain still another. The western part of the coast plain has a few low hills.
                    The rest of the State has no notable prominences.</p>
                <p>The mineral resources of Texas have not been mapped or studied, and hence the
                    State ranks last in mineral products. The trans-Pecos region is rich in silver
                    and lead ores; but the State owus the mineral rights of nearly all the land, and
                    has hitherto declined to open them to development. Only one mine is worked here.
                    Silver and gold have also been discovered and mined in Llano and Mason counties,
                    but without successful results. Gold occurs throughout the marine limestones of
                    the lowest (Texas) group of the Cretaceous, but not in sufficient quantity for
                    profitable extraction. Rich but not abundant copper ores occur in the drift of
                    the gypsum country. Iron ore is found in the Tertiary of eastern Texas, and is
                    profitably reduced in a few charcoal furnaces by the aid of convict labour. At
                    present these are remote from coal and suitable means of transportation.
                    Magnetic iron ore occurs in the pre-Cambrian rocks of Mason county, and recent
                    analyses show it to be equal in quality to the best Swedish ores. It is in great
                    abundance, but remote from means, of transportation and fuel. Ores of iron
                    (sphaero-siderite) occur in the central Carboniferous formation, but their
                    commercial value is unknown. The non-metals occur in great abundance in
                    different portions of the State, including salt, gypsum, magnesium sulphate,
                    natural cements, kaolin, and other clays. The unutilized beds of massive gypsum
                    are, with the exception of those of the Sahara and the Andes, the purest and
                    most extensive in the world. Salt is gathered from lacustral deposits or mined
                    at El Paso, Colorado City, and along the lower Gulf coast for local use. The
                    coals of the central Carboniferous area have been worked to some extent, but are
                    generally of inferior quality, having from 50 to 70 per cent, of ash. A ery
                    recent discoveries of better quality have been reported. Tertiary fibrous
                    lignite, of light specific gravity, is found in great abundance all along the
                    junction of the coast plain and black prairie regions. It is worked to a small
                    extent, but has no commercial value. The most important coal area is the
                    semi-bituminous lignite belt of the trans-Pecos and lower Rio Grande regions,
                    which is the direct geographical continuation of the late Cretaceous coals of
                    New Mexico and Colorado. It is worked at Eagle Pass and Santa Toma, near Laredo.
                    The beautiful marbles and other ornamental stones of the State are untouched,
                    with the exception of the Llano county granite.</p>
                <p>The amount and regularity of the rainfall decreases inland, the mean annual
                    varying from 52’3 inches at Galveston to 13 at El Paso in the extreme west and
                    23 at Mobeetie in the extreme north. The subjoined table gives the mean
                    temperature and rainfall of certain representative localities :—</p>

                <p>The coast plain and the black prairie regions have abundant rainfall for
                    agricultural purposes. It decreases, however, to the west, and varies greatly in
                    different years, sometimes being ample; but in 1885-86 it did not average 10
                    inches. The precipitation is also very sudden, seldom lasting more than a few
                    minutes at a time. Only 52 per cent, of the 20 inches of rainfall in the central
                    region and west of it falls in the agricultural season, one-half being in summer
                    and the remainder in autumn, so that it is equivalent to only 15 inches in
                    regions where the rainfall occurs in more propitious seasons. This condition is,
                    however, especially favourable for grazing. There are few statistics of the
                    plains region; but the rainfall along its eastern escarpment is slightly greater
                    and more regular than that of the central region. The temperature varies greatly
                    throughout the State, both in extremes and means. Fort Ringgold on the lower Rio
                    Grande is the hottest point in the United States, except Key West, Fla. Its mean
                    temperature is 73'4° Fahr.; that of El Paso is 63°, and of Mobeetie 54 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6°. The prevalent winds are southerly and
                    south-easterly, and blow constantly across the State, without which its summers
                    would be unendurable. The Rio Grande valley is not subject to frosts. Snow
                    seldom falls south of Galveston and Austin. In the Panhandle the winters are
                    severe.</p>
                <p>The arboreal flora of Louisiana and Arkansas extends into northeastern Texas,
                    conformable with the coast plain, where, immediately south of the Colorado river
                    the great pine belt of the Atlantic and Gulf coasts terminates. The flora of the
                    great plains region, principally consisting of nutritious grasses, enters the
                    north-western portion of the State and extends south to the 32d parallel and
                    east to the 101st meridian. The peculiar plants of the Rocky Mountain plateaus
                    penetrate into the trans-Pecos region, while the north Mexican flora is found
                    along the Rio Grande. The central region is a transition ground where these
                    floras find representation generally in deteriorated and dwarfed species. In the
                    coast plain occur the long and short leaf pine, with many species of oak and
                    hickory. The black prairie region is destitute of trees, except scattered
                    individuals of live oak and the mesquite bush <hi rend="italic">(jProsopis
                    glandulosa).</hi> The broad river valleys of this region, however, are
                    well-timbered with pecan, cypress, cottonwood, and several species of oak, and
                    have a vigorous growth of smaller shrubs. West of the black prairie region the
                    dwarfed, stunted trees are of little value except for fuel. The river valleys
                    have the same character of trees as further east, but the rocky highlands are
                    covered with scraggy bushes (chaparral) of oak, juniper, and cedar. The summits
                    of the Guadalupe and Limpia ranges, in the trans-Pecos region, are clothed with
                    forests of the yellow <hi rend="italic">(Pinus ponderosa),</hi> flexible (P. <hi
                    rend="italic">flexilis),</hi> and nut pine <hi rend="italic">(P. edulis),</hi>
                    all of which attain great size. Many smaller trees grow on these mountains. The
                    valleys and several of the ranges in the last-named region, however, are
                    destitute of trees. The entire Rio Grande valley, from El Paso to Brownsville,
                    grows many species of cactus and other prickly, coriaceous shrubs. The grasses
                    of the State are especially numerous in species, and are found most luxuriantly
                    on the prairies of the lower <pb break="no"

                    lumber supply of the State comes entirely from the east Texas pine forests. The
                    cedar, juniper, and mesquite are only utilized for fuel and fencing.</p>

                    western part of the central region. Their southern limit is approximately the
                    31st parallel. The highest ranges of the trans-Pecos region possess the unique
                    avian and mammalian fauna of the Rocky Mountains, including the blacktailed or

                    with a few Mexican species. The lower valleys have a mingling of the Mexican,
                    Rocky Mountain, and great plain faunas. Along the valley of the Rio Grande, and
                    extending northward in places, the subtropical fauna is Mexican, including the
                    peccary <hi rend="italic">(Dicotylcs torquatus),</hi> armadillo <hi

                    and ocelot <hi rend="italic">(Felis pardalis).</hi> Among the birds are the

                    >(Geococcyx viaticus),</hi> and numerous other unique forms. The fauna of the
                    humid wooded coast plain is the south-western continuation and termination of
                    that of the South Atlantic and Gulf States, with slight variations, and includes
                    the Virginia deer <hi rend="italic">(Cariacus leucurus),</hi> raccoon <hi

                    named fauna on the west, except in its wooded river bottoms. The central region
                    possesses representatives of the great plains, Rocky Mountain, Mexican, and
                    Louisiana faunas, but none of them cross it into other regions. It is a true
                    transitional ground of most of the faunas of all temperate North America, east
                    of the Pacific slope.</p>
                <p>The total population in 1880 was 1,591,749 (837,840 males and 753,909 females),
                    and in 1887 it was estimated to have risen to 2,415,000, giving 9 <hi

                    in 1880 1,477,133 were natives of the United States and 114,616 foreign born.
                    There were 393,384 Negroes, 136 Chinese, 992 Indians, and 43,000 civilized
                    aborigines (Mexicans). Of the entire population 522,133 persons were engaged in
                    occupations as follows :—in agriculture (including stock-raising), 359,317 (68’8
                    per cent.); in law, medicine, and other professions, 97,651 (18 <hi

                    (6'7 per cent.); in manufacturing and mining, 30,346 (5'8 per cent.). At the
                    same date there were 3153 prisoners, 2276 idiots, 1564 insane, 533 paupers, 1375

                <p>84 per cent, of the total population of the State is found east of the central
                    region—the black prairie region (northern half) being the most densely
                    populated, and the coast plain next. Between 1880 and 1887 there was a large
                    flow of population into the trans-Pecos and plains tegions, and during the last
                    two years mentioned a decrease in the central region. The population consists
                    principally of white natives of the southern United States, except in the
                    counties of Brazos, Fort Bend, Harrison, Marion, Moore, and Washington, where it
                    is of Negro race; in the counties of Fayette, Colorado, Guadalupe, Comal, and
                    Gillespie, where it is German; and along the Rio Grande, where it is
                    Mexican.</p>
                <p>Of the United States Texas now ranks first in the production of cotton and
                    cattle, second in sugar, sheep, mules, and horses, eighth in rice and pigs. The
                    eastern third of the State, containing 80 per cent, of the entire population, is
                    agricultural; the remainder is pastoral. The chief crops are cotton and Indian
                    com; wheat is grown in the northern part of the black prairie and eastern part
                    of the central regions, sugar in the lower bottom lands of the Brazos and the
                    Colorado, rice on the coast. The chief vegetable products for 1880 were—cotton,
                    805,284 bales; Indian corn, 29,065,172 bushels; wheat, 2,567,737; oats,
                    4,893,359; sweetpotatoes, 1,460,079; Irish potatoes, 228,832; barley, 72,786;
                    rye, 25,399; sugar, 4951 hogsheads; molasses, 810,605 gallons; hay, 59,699 tons;
                    tobacco, 221,283 pounds; rice, 62,152 pounds; orchard products, to the value of
                    §876,844. The total value of these products was §63,076,311. Since 1882 the
                    quantity of cotton produced annually has exceeded 2,000,000 bales, of 500 pounds
                    each. In 1880 there were 174,184 farms in the State, with an aggregate of
                    12,650,314 acres of improved land. The farms are usually of large size, and
                    garden, orchard, and dairy products are entirely secondary to plantation crops.
                    The southern part of the coast plain and the rest of the State west of the black
                    prairie region are peculiarly adapted to pastoral pursuits, which are entirely
                    separated from agricultural, the cattle and sheep being allowed to roam at
                    large, or enclosed in enormous pastures, where they subsist without other food
                    or shelter than nature affords. In 1880 there were in the State— 4,084,605
                    cattle, 2,411,633 sheep, 1,950,371 pigs, 805,606 horses, and 132,447 mules and
                    asses. The sheep walks are more particularly confined to the southern half of
                    the central region, including the lower Rio Grande valley.</p>
                <p>The exports are cotton, wool, and hides, most of which are shipped from Galveston
                    or sent overland by rail. The chief imports are manufactured articles used in
                    the State, also coal and railway material. Apart from a small retail trade along
                    the border, there are no exports to the adjoining States. The principal seaport
                    and commercial city is Galveston. The mileage in railways has increased from
                    1048 in 1872 to 5974 in 1882, and to 7034 in 1886.</p>
                <p>The founders of the State made liberal provision, by grants of land and revenue,
                    for public education, but their intentions have not been carried out by
                    subsequent legislation. Texas occupies the anomalous position of having the best
                    school fund and the poorest school system in the United States. The public free
                    school system proper consists of two normal schools for the preparation of
                    teachers and numerous district schools, open for four months in the year. In
                    most of the cities the State fund is supplemented by local taxation, and
                    excellent schools are maintained. In 1886 there were 489,795 children w ithin
                    school age, and the cost of the maintenance of the whole system was §2,362,226.
                    There are no schools for secondary education, except the high schools of a few
                    cities. The State university is at Austin; it is abundantly endowed with lands,
                    but does not receive the full benefit of its revenues. There is also a State
                    agricultural and mechanical college, but technical training is made
                    secondary.</p>
                <p>The State government differs somewhat from those of the rest of the Union, owing
                    to the fact that it has had to adapt itself to the administration of the great
                    public domain, by which most of the public institutions are supported and works
                    of internal improvement accomplished, and because much of the attention of the
                    Government has been necessarily diverted to the protection of its extensive
                    frontier. The executive government consists of a governor, comptroller,
                    treasurer, commissioner of the general land office, and superintendent of
                    education, elected biennially, with an attorneygeneral and a secretary of state,
                    appointed by the governor. The judiciary consists of two courts of final appeal,
                    one for criminal, the other for civil business; forty itinerant higher courts
                    for the trial of penal offences and civil suits; courts for misdemeanours and
                    minor civil cases in each county; and innumerable justices’ courts for first
                    hearings. The legislature consists of 32 senators elected for four years, and
                    115 members of the house of representatives elected for two years. It is
                    restricted by the constitution to biennial sessions of ninety days each. The
                    State is divided into thirteen congressional and forty judicial election
                    districts. It is also divided into 232 counties, 75 of which have no population,
                    or insufficient population to be organized. Each county is divided into four
                    commissioners’ precincts and a varying number of school, election, and justices’
                    precincts. The State has always maintained a corps of troops, formerly for
                    protection against Indians, but now for preserving order in the unorganized
                    counties. It has institutions for the blind, deaf and dumb, and insane. The
                    prison system is far superior to that of the other southern States, but still
                    very imperfect. The bonded debt of the State on 1st January 1887 was §4,237,730,
                    and its taxable wealth §600,000,000. The aggregate debt of all the counties and
                    cities was §7,000,000. The homestead and exemption laws are unusually liberal to
                    the debtor.</p>
                <p>The upper Rio Grande valley was visited in 1580-83 by the Spaniards, who
                    established missions among the settled Indians near El Paso and Santa Fé. The
                    first white settlement was made by La Salle at Lavaca, on the coast, in 1685.
                    The country was inhabited by Indians of various tribes, both savage and
                    agricultural, most of whom are now extinct, except the so-called “Mexican”
                    population of the Rio Grande. From 1583 to 1794 many missions were established
                    by Roman Catholic missionaries among the Indians, whe were completely alienated
                    from their original language, religion, domestic habits, and tribal relations.
                    After the purchase of Louisiana from the French in 1803 Anglo-American
                    adventurers began to cross into Texas from the United States. In 1821, when
                    Mexico threw off the Spanish yoke, Texas and Coahuila constituted <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n223/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0223-0206"/> a state of the republic. It was shortly after
                    this that the first American colonists were permitted to enter the territory
                    under Government patronage. Within ten years over 20,000 had settled between the
                    Sabine and the Colorado. In 1830 the Mexican Government placed them under
                    military rule, from which, with accompanying impositions, originated the war of
                    Texan Independence. The Anglo-Americans were assisted by volunteers from the
                    United States, and the war was terminated by the defeat of the Mexicans under
                    General Santa Anna at San Jacinto, 21st April 1836. From 1837 to 1845 Texas was
                    an independent republic. It was admitted to the United States on 29th December
                    1845, in spite of the protests of Mexico, and a war with that country
                    immediately ensued. The new State sold to the United States Government for
                    §10,000,000 all the territory west and north of the present boundaries between
                    the headwaters of the Rio Grande and the Arkansas. But it reserved the control
                    and disposal of the public lands within its borders, which have proved a
                    magnificent source of revenue, and also the right to divide into five states,
                    should future growth and development justify it. By a small majority the State
                    seceded from the Union in 1861. In 1868 a new constitution was adopted, and the
                    State readmitted into the Union. In 1874 the Kiowa and Comanche Indians, who had
                    prevented the settlement of the central and plains regions from the earliest
                    times, were subjugated.</p>
