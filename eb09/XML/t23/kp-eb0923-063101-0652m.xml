                <p><label type="entry">THE</label> terms “Turkestan” and “Central Asia” are often
                    used indiscriminately to describe the whole of the immense territory to the east
                    of the Caspian, comprised between Siberia on the north and Khorasan (Persia),
                    Afghanistan, and Tibet on the south, or to designate separate, sometimes
                    arbitrarily determined, parts of the same region. In the beginning of the 19th
                    century the whole of the territory just named, with its great variety of
                    altitudes, climate, inhabitants—these last differing as much in their history as
                    in their present characteristics— was comprised under the vague denomination of
                    High Tartary, or High or Interior Asia. After the appearance of Humboldt’s first
                    draft of <hi rend="italic">Asie Centrale</hi> in 1831, the term “Central Asia”
                    came into favour. But Humboldt’s limits of Central Asia were too mathematical
                    (from 39½° to 49½° N. lat.), and were further unsatisfactory because influenced
                    by his erroneous conception of the mountains of Central Asia, which he supposed
                    to run either along parallels or along meridians. Richthofen made an attempt to
                    limit the sense of the term, proposing to apply it only to that region—embracing
                    the Tarim drainage area and the Gobi —which has no outlet either towards the
                    ocean or to the Sea of Aral and Lake Balkash (Balkhash), and which constitutes
                    the Hang-hai of the Chinese and the supposed bed of the Tertiary Asiatic
                    Mediterranean. But this terminology, besides the drawback of including within
                    Central Asia the steppes of the Gobi as far east as Transbaikalia and the Great
                    Khingan, notwithstanding the broad differences by which they are distinguished
                    from the drainage area of the Tarim, was open to another objection, which has
                    been pointed out in Μ. Mushketoff's <hi rend="italic">Turkestan.</hi> It
                    excluded from Central Asia Turkestan proper, which nevertheless has had the same
                    recent geological history as the Tarim region, and therefore has so many
                    features in common with it as regards soil, climate, flora, fauna, population,
                    and even civil history. On the other hand, if Central or Interior Asia were to
                    include West Turkestan, and its limits to be determined by those of the
                    drainage-areas which have no outlet to the ocean, the basins of the Volga and
                    Ural,—that is, territories purely European in character,—would have to be
                    comprised under the same denomination. The fact is that in Asia, as so often
                    elsewhere, hydrographical considerations alone furnish no sound basis for
                    geographical delimitations, and that these last must result from a complicated
                    variety of considerations, chiefly orographical, inasmuch as orographical are
                    indicative of other physical characters, such as geology, climate, flora, fauna,
                    and so on. Such were the views of Ritter and Humboldt, and we are now brought
                    back to their conceptions, but corrected into accordance with improved knowledge
                    of the Asiatic continent. The name Central Asia can still be used with great
                    advantage to designate that immense portion of the continent to the east of the
                    Caspian and the Ust-Urt plateau which is limited on the north by the important
                    climatic and geo-botanic boundary of the Irtish and Aral water-parting and the
                    Great or Ektagh Altai, on the east by the eastern Gobi, and on the south by the
                    northern border of the Khor plateau (Aɫtyn-Tagh and Kuen-Lun), the Hindu-Kush,
                    and the Kopet-Dagh. Extensive as it is, this territory has its own climatic and
                    geo-botanic features; it forms a distinct part of the continent, when the
                    orography of Asia is broadly viewed; and its inhabitants have a number of common
                    characteristics resulting directly from the physical features of the territory.
                    But this immense area must be subdivided; and its subdivisions become apparent
                    as soon as the orographical features are grasped.</p>
                <p>Two great plateaus constitute the two backbones, as it were, of the orographical
                    structure of Asia,—that of eastern Asia, an immense triangle stretching
                    north-eastwards, having the Himalayas for its base and the peninsula of the
                    Tchuktchis for its apex; and that of western Asia, which extends at right angles
                    to the above, from the lower Indus to the Black Sea. The Hindu-Kush connects
                    these two massive swellings, both continents of the oldest formation in Asia.
                    Both are fringed on their northern edges by lofty chains of mountains. The
                    Tian-Shan, the Altai, the Sayan, and the Vitim Mountains rise in a long
                    succession on the borders of the former, while a series of chains, which might
                    be described under the general name of Kopet-Dagh, continued into the
                    Transcaucasian chains, rise on the north-eastern edge of the western
                    plateau.</p>
                <p>An immense trapezoidal depression occupies the angle on the west where the great
                    plateaus meet, and this depression is West Turkestan. Its south-eastern limits
                    are the Hindu-Kush and the Tian-Shan; on its south-western edge it has the
                    Iranian plateau; and its north-west and north-east boundaries correspond with
                    the edge of the Ust-Urt and the Irtish and Aral water-parting, which separates
                    it from Siberia. The trapezium is 1100 miles long from south-west to north-east,
                    and 900 miles wide from southeast to north-west. It thus includes, not only the
                    depression at the junction of the two plateaus, but also the girdle of alpine
                    tracts which fringes them, and in whose deep and sheltered valleys the Turkish
                    and partly Iranian population of Turkestan find a fertile soil and plenty of
                    water for their fields, while their herds graze on the rich alpine meadows in
                    the very heart of the Tian-Shan. Not orographically only but also in respect of
                    its recent geological past, its climate, flora, fauna, and inhabitants, this
                    region forms a geographical domain by itself, quite distinct from the steppes of
                    south-eastern Russia, the prairies of Siberia, and the two great plateaus by
                    which it is inclosed; and, although it is easily subdivided into two parts—the
                    dry lowlands of the Transcaspian depression and the plains and highlands of
                    Turkestan proper—it presents one geographical whole when contrasted with the
                    surrounding regions. Some doubt may arise as to the propriety of including in it
                    the plateau of Pamir; but its flora and fauna are so closely connected with
                    those of the Tian-Shan that, although better treated as a separate sub-region,
                    like the Transcaspian Turcoman steppes, it cannot be separated from the above.
                    For the orographer, the “Roof of the World” is merely a succession of the wide
                    <hi rend="italic">syrts</hi> or alpine plateaus that are characteristic of the
                    Tian-Shan. Most of this territory has within recent years been annexed to the
                    Russian empire. Bokhara, with its vassal khanates in the gorges of the Pamir
                    slopes, and Khiva, although they are still described as independent, are in
                    reality rapidly becoming dependencies of Russia, and the railway from the
                    Caspian, which is about to connect Merv with Samarkand, will complete the
                    annexation of Bokhara. West Turkestan, therefore, is often called Russian
                    Turkestan, as distinguished from Chinese or East Turkestan.</p>
                <p>This second great region of Central Asia also has well-defined limits. A glance
                    at any recent map shows that there is in the great eastern plateau a depression
                    bordered by the deep slopes of the Pamir (Humboldt’s Bolor) on the W., the
                    border-ridges of Tibet (Kuen-Lun and Aɫtyn-Tagh) on the S., the eastern
                    Tian-Shan on the N., and the western Gobi on the E.<note anchored="true"

                    <pb corresp="kp-eb0923-0653-0632" xml:id="pbn9632"/> which narrows to the east

                    plateaus, it is itself a plateau, ranging from 3000 to 4000 feet above
                    sea-level. This depression—the Hang-hai of the Chinese, which, during the later
                    Tertiary and earlier Quaternary period, was covered by a sea, of which a very
                    small survival still exists in Lob-Nor—is now drained by the Tarim. Its deserts,
                    in which human settlements are now very rare, though formerly the population was
                    much denser, have been described under a variety of names (Little Bokhara,
                    Alty-shar or Jity-shar, Kashgaria, and so on); but the name of East Turkestan
                    has prevailed, and there is no reason for abandoning it, provided it is not
                    confounded with <hi rend="smallcaps">Dzungaria</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                    >q.v</hi>.) in the north and the great Desert of Gobi in the east. Dzungaria is
                    a deep trench leading from the lowlands to the central plateau, and has special
                    physical its vassal khanates, and parts of Afghan Turkestan. (B) East Turkestan,
                    comprising the Tarim region as far east as Lob-Nor, (C) Dzungaria, limited on

                <p>As comprised within the above limits, West Turkestan has an area of nearly
                    1,680,000 square miles, and a population of nearly 8,500,000.<note

                    including the lonely plateau of Pamir, features and a history of its own. The
                    Mongolian Gobi, on the other hand, owing to its position on the lower terrace of
                    the plateau of eastern Asia, must be regarded as a separate unity. In fact, it
                    appears to be more closely connected with the plateau of the Selenga on the
                    north and that of Ordos on the south than with East Turkestan; and it, too, has
                    its own physical features, its own inhabitants, and its own history.</p>
                <p>The expression Central Asia thus includes the following countries. (A) West
                    Turkestan, comprising the Tian-Shan highlands, the Balkash plains, and the
                    Aral-Caspian lowlands, politically divided into Russian Turkestan (the
                    general-governorship of Turkestan and the Aral-Caspian slope of Turgai and
                    Akmolinsk), the Chinese oasis of Kulja (Kuldja), the Transcaspian region, Khiva,
                    Bokhara and in height second only to that of Tibet; the immense complex of
                    alpine tracts described under the general name of Tian-Shan (three times as long
                    as the Alps of Europe), which lift their snow-clad peaks four and nearly five
                    miles above the sea, and feed huge glaciers, while their deep valleys and gorges
                    partake of almost every variety of climate and vegetation; rich prairies and
                    still wider lowlands descending below the level of the ocean; and deserts where
                    the winds, burning hot or icy, but always dry, have free scope to modify the
                    surface, which is bare of vegetation.</p>
                <p>Nevertheless West Turkestan is sharply divided into two parts,—the highlands in
                    the south-east and the plains and deserts in the north-west. The former cover an
                    area nearly 1000 miles long by 270 broad, of which the northern parts are
                    described under the general name of Tian-Shan (properly, T’han-Shañ). Their
                    distinctive feature is that, like the highlands of Siberia, they constitute a
                    high border-ridge<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n654/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0654-0633"/>, running W.S.W. to E.N.E. on the edge of the
                    great plateau of eastern Asia. This plateau is fringed on its outer side by a
                    complex of shorter ranges, which mostly run parallel to the border-ridges and
                    send off a series of isolated chains, due to a later system of upheaval, through
                    the plains and steppes in a north-western direction. Down to the middle of the
                    19th century these highlands were almost absolutely unknown, and the orography
                    of Central Asia as shown on our maps was quite hypothetical. Numerous surveys by
                    Russian and British explorers have, however, recently disclosed the real
                    structure of those regions; and it has now become possible to discriminate the
                    leading features of the orographical conformation of the country. The
                    Hindu-Kush, with its snow-clad summits of 18,000 and 20,000 feet, limits the
                    highlands of Turkestan to the south-east. It appears now to be settled that this
                    ridge runs from north-east to south-west, as far at least as the latitude of
                    Cabul, and possibly still farther south; and the last Russian surveys of the
                    Pamir show that it extends north-east as far as Tash-Kurgan (37° 45' N. lat.,
                    75° E. long.). At the foot of its north-western slope it has the plateau of
                    Pamir—the “Roof of the World,”—with an area of about 37,000 square miles. A
                    series of chains, gently sloping and dome-shaped, rising 4000 or 5000 feet above
                    the level of the plateau, traverse it from south-west to north-east, with a
                    remarkable parallelism, dividing it into a series of broad parallel
                    flat-bottomed grooves or valleys, which do not sink below 10,000, and sometimes
                    14,000, feet above sea-level. Thus the features of the lower plateaus of
                    north-eastern Asia reappear here on a greater scale, having the same characters
                    and the same direction in the plaitings of the earth’s crust.</p>
                <p>Nearly 150 miles to the north-west of the Hindu-Kush lies the north-western
                    border of the Pamir, fringed by the lofty Trans-Aɫai Mountains. Their crest,
                    covered with snow, rises nearly 4 miles above the sea (Kaufmann Peak 23,000
                    feet); but the traveller approaching them from the south would hardly guess
                    their height, because their southern slope towards the wildernesses of the
                    plateau, themselves 13,000 feet high, is very gentle. The great elevation of the
                    border-chain is only realized when it is seen from the Alai valley on the north,
                    where its steep and deeply furrowed sides tower up like a dark wall, from 11,000
                    to 14,000 feet high, above the high and broad valley of the Kizil-su. The
                    geological structure of the Aɫai valley must not be inferred from its
                    orographical features, otherwise we should describe it as longitudinal. It is
                    watered by the Kizil-su, which flows towards the westsouth-west and joins the
                    Amu-Daria under the name of Vaksh (or Wakhsh). On the north it has the lofty
                    Aɫai-Tagh range, also partially snow-clad. On our best maps the Trans-Aɫai
                    Mountains are figured as an isolated range, some 120 miles in length; and it
                    cannot yet be affirmed with certainty which chains of the Tian-Shan, possessing
                    the same border-ridge characters, ought to be considered as its continuations.
                    Further research is needed to determine whether it is continued south-west by
                    the Darvaz, or Lahor, Mountains, where the group of lofty Sel-tau peaks feed the
                    extensive Fedtchenko glacier, or by the Hoja-Mahomet chain on the left bank of
                    the Amu-Daria.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See G.

                    still unsettled. As for the north-eastern continuations of the Trans-Aɫai, the
                    present writer is inclined to trace them, not in the Kokshaɫ-tau, but in the
                    Terskei Ala-tau and the high mountains of Sary-yassy, where the Khan-Tengri
                    lifts its snow-clad granitic cap 24,000 feet above the sea, and is surrounded by
                    numerous vast glaciers (Semenoff's and Mushketoff's Muz-art). It would thus
                    separate, broadly speaking, the drainage area of the Tarim from those of</p>
                <p>Lake Balkash and the Sea of Aral. Thus the border-ridge of the Central Asian
                    plateau would have a length of more than 1000 miles from the Amu to Kulja, and
                    the valleys of the upper Naryn and Tekkes would therefore be homologous with
                    that of the Aɫai.</p>
                <p>A girdle of alpine tracts, from 150 to 180 miles in width, which fringes the
                    outer edge of the Pamir plateau, consists of shorter chains running parallel to
                    the border ridge and ranging from 11,000 to 17,000 and 20,000 feet in altitude.
                    They are separated by deep valleys, mostly with three separate foldings of Azoic
                    rocks. Some of these ranges are covered with perennial snow and feed great
                    glaciers, among which Schurovsky and Fedtchenko glaciers around the lofty Kok-su
                    group are especially worthy of mention. These subsidiary chains all belong to
                    the oldest system of upheavals, which have had a north-east direction, and which
                    at four different places are modified by more modern ones having a north-western
                    direction. In lat. 47° N. the orographical structure becomes more complicated,
                    the alpine region being pierced by the broad Dzungarian trench, which leads from
                    the lowlands of the Irtish to the heights of the Central Asian plateau. A high
                    ridge—the Tarbagatai—continued in the Tchinghiz (Jinghiz) and Karkaralinsk
                    Mountains, branches off north-westwards, separating Turkestan from Siberia.
                    Further east the Tian-Shan is continued on our maps in an eastern direction; but
                    our knowledge of it still remains very imperfect.<note anchored="true"

                    the “Eastern Tian-Shan of our maps, which runs east-south-east to Bagratch-kul,
                    as a separate chain belonging to the more modern system of north-western
                    upheavals, meeting at its eastern extremity a chain which trends towards the
                    north-east.</p></note></p>
                <p>A series of deep depressions,—Balkh, Ferghana, Issyk-kul, and Kulja, —sinking to
                    low levels amidst the Tian-Shan highlands follow one another in a north-east
                    direction. That of Issyk-kul is occupied by the lake of the same name (5000 feet
                    above the sea), while the second and fourth, now desiccated, are lacustrine
                    basins. A great number of smaller lacustrine basins, mostly filled with Tertiary
                    conglomerates, occur higher up in the mountains. For the orographer and the
                    geologist they are homologous with those of the Altai and east Siberia
                    (Bukhtarma, Us, Irkut, Barguzin, and others). The rivers that issued from the
                    high alps had to pierce many parallel ridges in order to reach the plains, and
                    they frequently expanded into wide lakes before cleaving through the chains of
                    mountains the narrow and deep transverse gorges by which they descended to the
                    lower terraces.</p>
                <p>Like the highlands of Siberia, those of Turkestan are fringed by a girdle of
                    plains, having an altitude of from 1000 to 1500 feet, and these again are
                    skirted by an immense lowland area reaching only 400, 300, and 150 feet, or even
                    sinking below the level of the ocean. These plains and lowlands cover nearly
                    650,000 square miles. Some geographers divide them into two portions,—the higher
                    plains of the Balkash (the Ala-kul and Balkash drainage areas) and the
                    Aral-Caspian depression, which occupies nearly two-thirds of the whole and has
                    been ably described by M. Mushketoff under the appropriate name of Turanian
                    basin,—the Kara-tau Mountains being considered as the dividing line between the
                    two. The Balkash plains, more than 1000 feet above the sea, and covered with
                    clay, with a girdle of loess at their foot, are well watered by the Ili and
                    other feeders of Lake Balkash (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Semiryetchensk)</hi> and
                    on their rich prairies are the homes of numerous Kirghiz. In the south-west the
                    clayey soil becomes saline. There is the Famine steppe (Bek-pak-daɫa), while in
                    the Ak-kum steppe, which surrounds Lake Kara-kul, large areas are covered with
                    sands, partly shifting. A gulf of clayey plains penetrates up the Ili into the
                    interior<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n655/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0655-0634"/> of the mountains, and its thick layers of loess
                    form the Kulja oasis. Another gulf, penetrating much more deeply into the
                    highlands up the trench occupied by Lakes Ebi-Nor and Ayar, and joining the
                    trench of the upper Irtish, leads by an imperceptible gradient up to the plateau
                    of Central Asia. It is known as the “Dzungarian Gate,” and a gate it has been
                    since the dawn of history for whole nations of nomads who have migrated from the
                    rapidly desiccating plateau down to the grassy prairies of Siberia and Russia.
                    The plains and lowlands of the Turanian basin are subdivided by a line drawn
                    from north-east to south-west along a slight range of hills running from the
                    sources of the Ishim towards the south-east corner of the Caspian (Bujnurd and
                    Elburz edge of Khorasan). This low range, which most probably separated the
                    lowlands of the Aral-Caspian region (submerged during the Post-Pliocene period)
                    from the higher plains which had emerged by the end of the Tertiary period, now
                    divides the Transcaspian steppes from the somewhat different higher plains (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Transcaspian Region).</hi> In the Turanian basin the
                    contrast between desert and oasis is much stronger than in the Balkash region.
                    Fertile soil, or rather soil which can be rendered fertile by irrigation, is
                    limited to a narrow terrace of loess along the foot of the mountains (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Syr-Daria),</hi> and is surrounded by barren deserts. Even
                    where the loess spreads over terraces at some distance from the mountains, as in
                    the south-east Transcaspian region, it can be cultivated only when irrigated.
                    The dryness of the climate is excessive: rain falls only where the hills cause
                    the clouds to condense, the soil elsewhere being moistened only occasionally by
                    a few showers. Two rivers only— the Syr and the Amu—succeed in crossing the
                    desert and reaching the Sea of Aral. But their former tributaries no longer run
                    their full course: the glacier-fed Zerafshan dries up amidst the gardens of
                    Bokhara soon after emerging from the highlands; and the Tejen, the Murghab, and
                    the Andkho lose themselves amidst the fields of the Turcomans. The only
                    tributaries which the Amu retains are those which have the whole of their course
                    in the highlands. In the north such formerly important tributaries of the
                    Syr-Daria as the Tchu, with its subtributary the Sary-su, now dry up some
                    hundreds of miles distant from the main stream. The arid desert absorbs every
                    drop of running water which reaches its borders.</p>
                <p>The whole area is now undergoing geological changes on a vast scale. Rivers have
                    changed their courses, and lakes their outlines. Far away from their present
                    shores the geologist finds indubitable traces of the recent presence of the
                    lakes in the shells they have left amidst the sands. Traces of former rivers and
                    channels, which were the main arteries of prosperous regions within the period
                    of written history, have now disappeared. Of the highly developed civilizations
                    which grew up and flourished in Bactriana, Bokhara, and Samarkand the last
                    traces are now undergoing rapid obliteration with the desiccation of the rivers
                    and lakes. The great “Blue Sea” of Central Asia, the Sea of Aral, which at a
                    recent epoch (Post-Glacial) extended south-west to Sary-kamysh, and the shells
                    of which are found north and east of its present shores from 50 to 200 feet
                    above its present level (162 feet above the ocean, and 245 above the Caspian),
                    now occupies but a small portion of its former extent. It covers a shallow
                    depression, some 23,000 square miles in area, which is drying up with
                    astonishing rapidity, so that the process of desiccation can be shown on surveys
                    separated only by intervals of ten years; large parts of it, like Gulf Aibughir,
                    have dried up since the Russians took possession of its shores. Steamers
                    regularly ply on its waters and ascend both its tributaries. The whole country
                    is dotted with lakes, which are rapidly disappearing under the hot winds of the
                    deserts; and the clayey <hi rend="italic">takyrs</hi> of the steppes give
                    evidence of thousands of lakes which have quite recently ceased to exist,
                    leaving beds of clay kept wet by the condensed moisture of winter and the few
                    rain-showers of early spring.</p>
                <p>Like the highlands of eastern Asia, those of Turkestan are mostly built up of
                    Azoic gneisses and metamorphic slates, resting upon granites, syenites, old
                    orthoclase porphyries, and the like. These upheavals date from the remotest
                    geological ages; and since the Primary epoch a triangular continent having its
                    apex turned towards the north-east, as Africa and America have theirs pointing
                    southward, rose in the middle of what now constitutes Asia. It is only in the
                    outer foldings of the highlands that Primary fossiliferous deposits are
                    found,—Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permo-Carbonic. Within that period the
                    principal valleys were excavated, and their lower parts have been filled up
                    subsequently with Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary deposits. One of the most
                    striking instances of this is the very thick Cretaceous and Tertiary deposits
                    which cover the bottom of the valley of the Vaksh (right tributary of the Amu)
                    and are continued for about 300 miles to the north-east, as far as the Aɫai
                    valley,—probably along the edge of the Pamir plateau. The deposits of the
                    Secondary period have not maintained their horizontal position. While upheavals
                    having a north-eastern strike continued to take place after the Carboniferous
                    epoch,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mushketoff’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Turkestan</hi> (pp. 35, 681) seems to justify this
                    conclusion.</p></note> another series of upheavals, having a north-western
                    strike, and occasioned by the expansion of diabases, dolerites, melaphyres, and
                    andesites, occurred later, subsequently at least to the close of the Tertiary
                    period, if not also before it, dislocating former chains and raising rocks to
                    the highest levels by the addition of new upheavals to the older ones.
                    Throughout the Triassic and Jurassic periods nearly all Turkestan remained a
                    continent indented by gulfs and lagoons of the south European Triassic and
                    Jurassic sea. Immense fresh-water lakes, in which were deposited layers of
                    plants (now yielding coal), filled up the depressions of the country. Cretaceous
                    and Tertiary deposits occur extensively along the edge of the highlands. Upper
                    and Middle Cretaceous, containing phosphates, gypsum, naphtha, sulphur, and
                    alum, attain thicknesses of 2000 and 5000 feet in Hissar. Representatives of all
                    the Tertiary formations are met with in Turkestan; but, while in the highlands
                    the strata are coast - deposits, they assume an open sea character in the
                    lowlands, and their rich fossil fauna furnishes evidence of the gradual
                    shallowing of that sea, until at last, after the Sarmathian period, it became a
                    closed Mediterraneam During the Post-Pliocene period this sea broke up into
                    several parts, united by narrow straits. The connexion of Lake Balkash with the
                    Sea of Aral can hardly be doubted; but this portion of the great sea was the
                    first to be divided. While the Sea of Aral remained in connexion with the
                    Caspian, the desiccation of the Lake Balkash basin, and its break-up into
                    smaller separate basins, were already going on. The Quaternary epoch is
                    represented by vast morainic deposits in the valleys of the Tian-Shan. About
                    Khan-Tengri glaciers descended to a level of 6800 feet above the sea,<note

                    and discharged into the wide open valleys or <hi rend="italic">syrts.</hi> It is
                    most probable that, when allowance has been made for the obliteration of glacial
                    markings, and the region has been better explored, it will appear that the
                    glaciation of Turkestan was on a scale at least as vast as that of the
                    Himalayas. In the lowlands the Aral-Caspian deposits, which it is difficult to
                    separate sharply from the later Tertiary, cover the whole of the area. They
                    contain shells of molluscs now inhabiting the Sea of Aral, and in their
                    petrographical features are exactly like those of the lower Volga. The limits of
                    the Post-Pliocene Aral-Caspian sea have not yet been fully traced. It extended
                    some 200 miles north and more than 90 miles east of the present Aral shores. A
                    narrow strait connected it with Lake Balkash. The Ust-Urt plateau and the
                    Mugojar Mountains (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turgai)</hi> prevented it from
                    spreading north-westward, and a narrow channel connected it along the Uzboi (see
                    p. 512 <hi rend="italic">supra)</hi> with the Caspian, which sent a broad gulf
                    to the east, spread up to Volga, and was connected by the Manytch with the Black
                    Sea basin. Great interest, geological and historical, thus attaches to the
                    recent changes undergone by this basin; but much still remains to be done before
                    the numerous questions arising in connexion with it can be settled. Since the
                    theory of geological cataclysms was abandoned, and that of slow modifications of
                    the crust of the earth accepted, new data have been obtained in the Aral-Caspian
                    region to show that the rate of modification after the close of the Glacial
                    period, although still very slow, was faster than had been supposed from the
                    evidence of similar changes now going on in Europe and America. The effects
                    produced by desiccating agencies are beyond all comparison more powerful than
                    those which result from the earthquakes that are so frequent in Turkestan. All
                    along the base of the highlands, from Khojend to Vyernyi, earthquakes are

                <p>The climate of West Turkestan is exceedingly dry and continental. Although the
                    country is comprised within the latitudes of Sicily and Lyons, it has a south
                    Norwegian January and a Persian summer. Temperatures of more than 100° Fahr. in
                    the shade are common, and the heat is rendered still more unbearable by the
                    reflexion from a soil destitute of vegetation. The winter is for the most part
                    so cold that the average temperature of January is below the freezing point, and
                    even reaches 0° Fahr. Snow falls for several months on the lower Syr-Daria, and,
                    were it not blown away by the winds, sledge-communication would be possible.
                    This river is frozen for an average of 123 days every year in its lower parts,
                    and nearly 100 days at Perovsk. At Tashkend there is snow during two months and
                    temperatures of -10° Fahr. have been measured. In 1876, on 24th October,
                    almond-trees, vines, and cotton crops were buried under a heavy snowfall. To the
                    south of Khojend the winter becomes more clement. Absence of rain is the
                    distinctive feature of the climate. Although it rains and snows heavily on the
                    mountains, only 11 inches of rain and snow fall throughout the year at Tashkend,
                    at the base of the highlands; and the steppes of the lower Amu have less than 3

                <p>The fauna of Turkestan belongs to the great zoo-geographical domain of northern
                    Asia, and is only differentiated by the presence of species which have
                    disappeared from the peripheric parts of the Old World and now find a refuge in
                    the remotest regions of the uninhabited plateau. From the great Palaeoarctic
                    region it is distinguished by the presence of Himalayan species. The distinctive
                    animal of the Pamir plateau is the magnificent <hi rend="italic">Ovis poli</hi>
                    (conjectured to be the ancestor of our common sheep), mentioned by Marco Polo
                    and rediscovered by Syevertsoff. It breeds by thousands on the Pamir, climbing
                    the highest ridges, which it prefers to the valleys. The region to which it is
                    confined has the shape of an ellipse, with its longer axis running south-west to
                    north-east. The animal is rare on the upper Naryn, and never penetrates to the
                    west of Sel-su. In the alpine tracts of the Tian-Shan, on the borders of the
                    Pamir, their horns and skulls are frequently met with, but there the place of
                    the species is now taken by <hi rend="italic">Oris karelini</hi> The wild horse,
                    which occurred in Poland a few centuries ago, has been discovered by Prejevalsky
                    in the highlands of Dzungaria and described as <hi rend="italic">Equus
                    prjevalskii</hi> by Polyakoff. The wild camel inhabits the lonely plateaus south
                    of the Ala-Shan; but no description of it has been published. The other mammals
                    of Turkestan are mostly those which are met with elsewhere in north Asia. The
                    large light-coloured Himalayan bear (<hi rend="italic">Ursus isabellinus)</hi>
                    has its home on the Pamir, and the smaller, strong, white-clawed <hi
                    rend="italic">Leucοnyx</hi> up to the highest levels on the Tian-Sham Antelopes,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lepus lehmanni, Lagomys rutilus,</hi> various species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Arvicolae,</hi> and the Himalayan long-tailed marmot (<hi
                    rend="italic">Arctomys caudatus),</hi> the most characteristic inhabitant of the
                    alpine meadows, are the only mammals of the Pamir proper. In the alpine region
                    are found the badger (<hi rend="italic">Meles taxus),</hi> the ermine (<hi
                    rend="italic">Foetorius ermineus)</hi> and six other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mustelidae,</hi> the wild dog (<hi rend="italic">Canis alpinus),</hi> the
                    common and the blackeared fox (<hi rend="italic">C. melanotis),</hi> while the
                    corsac fox (<hi rend="italic">C. corsac)</hi> is met with only on the plains.
                    Two species of lynx, the cheetah (<hi rend="italic">Felis jubata), Felis
                    manul,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Felis irbis,</hi> this last extending
                    westwards as far as the Persian Gulf and eastwards as far as the river Amur,
                    must be added to the above. The tiger is met with only on the lower Amu-Daria,
                    except when it wanders to the alpine region in pursuit of the maral deer (<hi
                    rend="italic">Cerυus maral).</hi> The jackal is characteristic of the steppes;
                    it banishes the wolves and foxes. Hares are represented by several species, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepras lehmanni</hi> being the most characteristic. Both the
                    common and the long-tailed marmot (<hi rend="italic">A. baibacinus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A. caudatus)</hi> are found at the foot of the mountains, as also
                    four species of <hi rend="italic">Spermophilus,</hi> three of voles, two of the
                    mouse, and three of the hamster. The <hi rend="italic">Meriones</hi> (four
                    species) and the jerboa (five species) are only met with in the steppe region.
                    Of ruminants, besides the sheep (<hi rend="italic">O.poli, O. karelini, O.
                    nigrimontana, O. heinsii),</hi> we find one mufflon (<hi rend="italic">Musimοn
                    vignei),</hi> formerly known only in the Himalayas, the Chinese antelope (<hi
                    rend="italic">Antilope subgutturosa)</hi> and the saiga antelope in the steppes,
                    the Siberian ibex and another goat, the yak, the zebu or Indian ox, the common
                    ox, the camel, and the dromedary. The wild boar is common in the reed thickets
                    along the rivers and lakes, where it stays during the winter, migrating to the
                    highlands in summer. The hedgehog and porcupine are common in the plains.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to describe in a few words the avifauna. No fewer than 385
                    species are recorded, most of them being middle-European and Mediterranean. A
                    large number were formerly known only in the Himalayas, or in Persia, while
                    others have their origin in east Asia. The commonest are mostly European
                    acquaintances. As for the very rich insect fauna, of which full descriptions are
                    now accessible, it is worthy of note that among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera</hi> of the Pamir there is an interesting mixture of Tian-Shan with
                    Himalayan species. Μ. Grum-Grzimailo found on the Pamir the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colias nastes,</hi> a species characteristic of Labrador and Lapland; like the
                    alpine plants which bear witness to a Glacial period flora in the Himalayas,
                    this butterfly is a survival of the Glacial period fauna of the Pamir.<note

                <p>As a whole the flora of Turkestan belongs to that of Central Asia, which was
                    formerly continued by geo-botanists as far west as the steppes of Russia, but
                    which must now be considered as a separate region subdivided into two,—the
                    Central Asian proper and that of the Gobi. It has its own habitus,
                    notwithstanding the number of species it has in common with Siberia and
                    south-east Russia on the one hand and with the Himalayas on the other, and this
                    habitus is due to the dryness of the climate and the consequent changes
                    undergone by the soil. Towards the end of the Glacial period the Tian-Shan
                    Mountains had a flora very like that of northern Caucasus, combining the
                    characters of the floras of the European Alps and the Altai, while the prairies
                    had a flora very much like that of the south Russian steppes. During the Stone
                    Age the human inhabitants lived in forests of maple, white beech, and apple
                    trees. But the gradual desiccation of the country resulted in the immigration
                    from the Central Asian plateau of such species as could adapt themselves to the
                    dry climate and soil, in the disappearance of European and Altaic species from
                    all drier parts of the region, in the survival of steppe species, and in the
                    adaptation of many of the existing species to the needs of an arid and extreme
                    climate and a saline soil.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Geogr. Soc., vol. xxiii., 1887.</p></note> At present the flora of Turkestan has
                    a variety of characters, depending on the various physical aspects of the
                    separate regions, the Pamir vegetation and that of the Aral-Caspian steppes
                    constituting two types with numberless intermediate gradations.</p>
                <p>There is no arboreal vegetation on the Pamir, except a few willows and tamarisks
                    along the rivers. Mountain and valley alike are covered with soft carpets of
                    grass, various species of <hi rend="italic">Festuca</hi> predominating almost to
                    the exclusion of all others. In the immediate vicinity of water the <hi
                    rend="italic">ryang (Carex physoides)</hi> grows, and a few patches are covered
                    with <hi rend="italic">Allium.</hi> To these may be added a few <hi
                    rend="italic">Ranunculaceae,</hi> some <hi rend="italic">Myosotis,</hi> low <hi
                    rend="italic">Scabiosae,</hi> the common <hi rend="italic">Taraxacum,</hi> one

                    >Leguminosae.</hi> In the north and west the <hi rend="italic">Stipa</hi> of the
                    Russian steppes supersedes <hi rend="italic">Festuca</hi> and affords splendid
                    pasture for the herds of the Kara-Kirghiz. In the gorges and on the
                    better-watered slopes of the mountains the herbaceous vegetation becomes
                    decidedly rich. Besides the above-named there are many other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineae,</hi> such as the beautiful <hi rend="italic">Lasiagrοstis
                    splendens,</hi> and whole seas of <hi rend="italic">Scabiosae. Eremurus,</hi> of
                    a variety of colours and 6 to 7 feet in height, forms thickets along with the

                    chain are richer in trees. Up to 12,000 feet full-grown specimens occur of the
                    <hi rend="italic">artcha (Juniperus pseudo-Sabina),</hi> characteristic of the
                    whole northern slopes of the Turkestan highlands, the poplar, a very few birches
                    (<hi rend="italic">B. Sogdiana),</hi> and a rich underwood of shrubs familiar in
                    European gardens, such as <hi rend="italic">Rhododendron chrysanthum, Sorbus
                    aucuparia (rοwan), Berberis heteropoda</hi> (berberry), <hi rend="italic"

                    (hawthorn). Farther east and north comes the Turkestan pine (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Picea Schrenkiana),</hi> while at lower levels there grow numerous willows,
                    black and white poplars, tamarisk, large <hi rend="italic">Celtis,</hi> as well
                    as shrubs of <hi rend="italic">Elaeagnus</hi> (wild olive), <hi rend="italic"

                    not seem to have found yet the shape of leaves best suited to the climate, and
                    therefore produces them in most striking variety, and the dwarf <hi

                    maple—also occur.</p>
                <p>The above applies to most of the highlands of the Tian-Shan. The drier southern
                    slopes are quite devoid of arboreal vegetation.</p>

                <p>On the northern slopes, at the higher levels, only the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Juniperus pseudo-Sabina</hi> grows on the mountains, and rich meadow grasses

                    the conifer zone begins, characterized by the <hi rend="italic">Picea

                    course the artcha and a few other deciduous trees also occur. The richest zone
                    is that which comes next, extending downwards to 5000 and 4500 feet. There woods
                    of birch, several species of poplar, the maple (<hi rend="italic">Acer
                    Semenovii),</hi> and a rich underwood spread over the mountain slopes. Orchards
                    of apple and apricot surround the villages. The meadows are covered with a rich
                    vegetation,—numberless bright <hi rend="italic">Paeoniae,</hi> variegated <hi
                    rend="italic">Scabiosae,</hi> large <hi rend="italic">Convolvulaceae,</hi> all

                    plants appear everywhere in patches in the Turkestan meadows. Very often—almost
                    invariably on the drier southern slopes of the mountains—the steppe vegetation
                    climbs up to the level of the alpine. Nowhere, perhaps, is the effect of various
                    soils—loess, clay, salt clay, and sand—upon vegetation better observable than in
                    the recently-emerged and arid regions of Turkestan.</p>
                <p>The “culture” or “apricot” zone is followed by the prairie belt, in which
                    black-earth plants (<hi rend="italic">Stipa</hi> and the like) struggle for
                    existence against invading Central Asian forms. And then come the lowlands and
                    deserts with their moving sandy <hi rend="italic">barkhans, shors,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">takyrs</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Transcaspian Region).

                    willows grow along the rivers. Large areas are wholly destitute of vegetation,
                    and after crossing 100 miles of such a desert the traveller will occasionally
                    come upon a forest of <hi rend="italic">saksaul ( Anabasis Ammodendron).</hi>
                    Contorted stems, sometimes of considerable thickness, very hard, and covered
                    with a grey cracked bark, rise out of the sand, bearing green plumes of thin
                    branches, with small greyish leaves and pink fruit Sometimes the tree is a mere
                    knot peeping above the sand with a crown of thin branches. But even these
                    fantastic growths are rapidly being destroyed by the Kirghiz herdsmen, who use
                    them for fuel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Olga

                    Amu.</p>
                <p>As already stated (p. 635), the climate of Turkestan varies considerably from
                    north to south. In Akmolinsk and Semiryetchensk most of the kinds of corn which
                    characterize Middle Russia are grown. South of the Tchu and the Syr-Daria
                    gardening is a considerable industry; and, although rye and wheat continue to be
                    the chief crops, the culture of the apple, and especially of the apricot (<hi
                    rend="italic">uryuk),</hi> acquires importance. Attempts are also made to
                    cultivate the vine. The inhabitants of the neighbourhood of Tashkend and
                    Samarkand, as well as those of the much more northern but better sheltered Kulja
                    oasis, add the cultivation of the almond, pomegranate, and fig. Vines are grown
                    and cotton planted in those districts. Finally, about Khojend and in Ferghana,
                    where the climate is milder still, the vine and the pistachio tree cover the
                    hills, while agriculture and horticulture have reached a high degree of
                    perfection. Successful attempts are now being made to grow the tea-plant in the
                    Transcaspian region.</p>
                <p>The arable land, being limited to the irrigated terraces of loess already spoken
                    of, occupies less than a fiftieth of the whole area of West Turkestan, even when
                    the Transcaspian deserts are left out of account. The remainder is nearly
                    equally divided between pasture land and desert (sandy steppe and barren
                    mountain). Owing to a very equitable distribution of irrigation water in
                    accordance with Moslem law, agriculture and gardening have reached a high stage
                    of development in the oases. Two crops are usually taken every year.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Middendorff's very
                    valuable sketches of agriculture in Ferghana in <hi rend="italic">Mem. Acad. Sc.
                    of St Petersburg,</hi> 1881.</p></note> Wheat, barley, millet, pease, lentils,
                    rice, sorghum, lucerne, and cotton are the chief agricultural products. Carrots,
                    melons, vegetable marrows, and onions are extensively grown. Rye and oats are
                    cultivated in Kazalinsk and Kopat. Corn is exported. Owing to the irrigation,
                    total failure of crops and consequent famines are unknown, unless among the
                    Kirghiz shepherds. The kitchen gardens of the Mohammedans are, as a rule,
                    admirably kept. Potatoes are grown only by the Russians. The cultivation of
                    cotton is rapidly extending (32,000 acres in 1886), as also is sericulture,
                    which is chiefly carried on in Ferghana, whence silk cocoons are an important
                    item of export. Cattle-breeding is extensively pursued, and in Russian Turkestan
                    alone recent estimates show 400,000 camels, 1,600,000 horses, 1,200,000 cattle,
                    and 11,000,000 sheep. This last figure, however, is but a very rough
                    estimate,—the flocks on the Kirghiz steppe being so large that the proprietors
                    themselves do not know their exact numbers. Murrains are of frequent occurrence;
                    a recent one resulted in a terrible famine among the Kirghiz. Live cattle,
                    hides, wool, camel-hair, tallow, felt, and leather are exported to a
                    considerable extent.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of Turkestan is considerable. Traces of auriferous sands have
                    been discovered at many places, but the percentage of gold is too poor to make
                    the working remunerative. Silver, lead, and iron ores occur at several places;
                    but the want of fuel is an obstacle to their exploitation. The vast coal-beds of
                    Kulja and several inferior ones in Turkestan are not yet seriously worked, the
                    total yearly output being only some 120,000 cwts. The naphtha wells of Ferghana
                    and the layers of graphite about Sairam-Nor are also neglected. There are
                    abundant deposits of gypsum, alum, kaolin, marble, and similar materials.
                    Notwithstanding the salt springs of Ferghana and Syr-Daria, the salt lakes of
                    the region, and the rock-salt strata of the Alexandrovsk Mountains, salt is
                    imported.</p>
                <p>Turkestan has no manufacturing industry carried on by means of machinery, except
                    a few distilleries and two establishments for dressing raw cotton. But there is
                    a great variety of artisan work, which, however, has been for some time
                    declining and now stands at a rather low level.<note anchored="true"

                    carried on. Its importance may be judged by the fact that in 1876 27,900 camels
                    were used for the transport of wares to Tashkend. This town and Bokhara are the

                <p>Turkestan has been the theatre of so many migrations and conquests that its
                    present population could not fail to be very mixed. Both Aryans and Mongols
                    (especially the Ural-Altaic branch) have their representatives there, the former
                    settled for the most part, the latter chiefly nomad. The Ural-Altaians, or
                    Turanians, are numerically the predominant element, and consist of Turcomans,
                    Kirghiz, Uzbegs, and Sarts. The Turcomans inhabit chiefly that part of Turkestan
                    which is now known as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Transcaspian Region (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> They number less than one million. The KaraKalpaks
                    (“Black Bonnets”) may number about 50,000 in Turkestan, and some 300,000 in the
                    Russian empire altogether. Very little is known of their history. They are
                    supposed to be but recent immigrants to Syr-Daria, having come from the former
                    Bulgarian empire on the middle Volga. Their language and habits are the same as
                    those of the Kirghiz; but for the last century and a half they have had some
                    acquaintance with agriculture. Their pacific temper exposed them to the raids of
                    the Kirghiz, who compelled them first to settle in Dzungaria, then to change
                    their dwellings several times, and ultimately (in 1742) to recognize the
                    sovereignty of Russia. Even since that time they have been driven by the
                    persecutions of their old enemies to cross the Aral-Caspian steppes and seek
                    refuge near Astrakhan. The real masters of the steppes and highlands of
                    Turkestan are the Kirghiz, of whom there are two branches,—the Kazak (Cossack)
                    Kirghiz and the Kara (Black) Kirghiz or Burut (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kirghiz).</hi> The Uzbegs, who played a predominant political part in Turkestan
                    before the Russian conquest, are of Turco-Tartar origin and speak a pure Jagatai
                    dialect; but they are mixed to a great extent with Persians, Kirghiz, and
                    Mongols. They are subdivided into clans and lead a semi-nomadic life, preserving
                    most of the attractive features of their Turkish congeners—especially their
                    honesty and independence. When settled they are mostly designated as Sarts—a
                    name which has reference more to manner of life than to anthropological
                    classification, although a much stronger admixture of Iranian blood is evident
                    in the Sarts, who also speak Persian at Khojend and Samarkand. Tarantchi or
                    Taranji (“labourer” in Chinese) is the name given to those Sarts who were
                    settled in the Kulja region by the Chinese Government after the rising of 1758.
                    They constitute about two-fifths of the population of Kulja. After defeating the
                    Dzungañs in the year 1865, they took the political power in Kulja into their own
                    hands, offering shelter to the Kirghiz who made inroads on the Russian
                    dominions. This was made a pretext for the annexation of Kulja by Russia in
                    1871; but it has been since restored to China. The origin of the Dzungañs is
                    somewhat problematical. They number nearly 20,000, and inhabit the valley of the
                    Ili in Kulja and partly are settled in Russian Turkestan. They are Mohammedans,
                    but have adopted Chinese manners of life. The Mongolian branch is represented in
                    Turkestan by Kalmucks and Torgoutes (Torgod) in the north-east and in Kulja,
                    where they are mixed with Solons, Sibos, and Chinese. The Aryan Tajak (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tajak),</hi> the aborigines of the fertile parts of Turkestan,
                    were subdued by the Turco-Mongolian invaders and partly compelled to emigrate to
                    the mountains, where they are now known as Galtchas. They constitute the
                    intellectual element of the country and are the principal owners of the
                    irrigated land,—the Uzbegs being their labourers,—merchants, and mollahs or
                    priests. They are Sunnite Mussulmans. The other representatives of Aryan <pb

                    liberated slaves; Indians, who carry on trade and usury in the cities; a few
                    Gipsies; and the Russians. Among these last two distinct elements must be
                    noticed,—the Cossacks, who are settled on the borders of the Kirghiz steppe and

                <p>Populous cities adorned with fine monuments of Arabian architecture, numerous
                    ruins of cities decayed, grand irrigation canals now lying dry, and written
                    monuments of Arabian literature testify to a time when civilization in Turkestan
                    stood at a much higher level than at present. This period was during the first
                    centuries after its conversion to Islam. Now all is in decay. The beautiful
                    mosques and madrasas are dilapidated; no astronomers watch the sky from the tops
                    of their minarets; and the scholars of the madrasas waste their time on the most
                    deplorably puerile scholasticism. The inspiration of early belief has
                    disappeared; the ruling motive of the mollahs (priests) is the thirst for
                    personal enrichment, and the people no longer follow the khojas (see p. 639
                    below). The agricultural labourer has preserved the uprightness, diligence, and
                    sobriety which characterize the Turkish peasant in Asia as well as in Europe;
                    but the richer inhabitants of the cities are grossly sensual. Centuries of wars,
                    followed by massacres and cruel vengeance, an unceasing civil strife between
                    parties disputing for supremacy in the name of religion, conspiracies, appeals
                    to foreigners, and endless intrigues have hastened the decay of Mohammedan
                    civilization in the khanates of Turkestan and paved the way for Russian
                    conquest.</p>
                <p>It remains, however, an open question whether the Russians will be able to bring
                    new vigour to the country and awaken intellectual life. They have failed to do
                    so in eastern Russia, at Kazan, and elsewhere, where both civilizations—the
                    European and the Asiatic —remain as thoroughly estranged from one another as
                    they were three centuries ago. This estrangement is not merely religious, but
                    social and economical. The followers of Islam, whose common law and religion
                    know only of a temporary possession of the land, which belongs wholly to the
                    Prophet, cannot accept the principles of unlimited property in land which
                    European civilization has borrowed from Roman law; to do so would put an end to
                    all public irrigation works, and to the system by which water is used according
                    to each family’s needs, and so would be fatal to agriculture. When taking
                    possession of Turkestan, the Russians began to grant deeds establishing property
                    rights over land in accordance with Roman law. But a study of the Mohammedan
                    system soon put an end to so erroneous a policy, and Mussulman law is still
                    respected. The Russians have abolished slavery in Turkestan; and their rule has
                    put an end to the interminable intestine struggles, which had weakened and
                    desolated the whole region. The barbarous tortures and executions which rendered
                    Khiva notorious in the East are no longer heard of; and the continual appeals of
                    the khojas for “holy” war against their rivals find no response. But the Russian
                    rule has imposed many new taxes, in return for which Turkestan only gets troops
                    of Russian merchants and officials, who, instead of becoming the exponents of
                    what is best in European civilization, too often accept the worst features of
                    the depraved Mussulman civilization of the higher classes of the country. New
                    tribunals and new justices of the peace are about to be introduced (1887);
                    schools are being diligently spread; but the wants of the natives are set behind
                    those of the children of the Russian officials and merchants and the supposed
                    necessities of Russification. A consulting hospital for Mohammedan women has
                    recently been opened by women graduates in medicine at Tashkend.</p>

                    or seven cities), Little Bokharia, Kashgaria, and so on. In its physical
                    features it forms a connecting link between the Chinese territories and the
                    Aral-Caspian depression. It covers about 465,000 square miles, but has hardly

                    its outer rim. No mountains or hills diversify its surface, which is that of a
                    high plain. All the mountains which enclose it rise to considerable heights, far
                    above the snow line. The steep slopes of the Pamir culminate in Tagharma Peak
                    (25,360 feet). In the north the snowclad Kokshaɫ-tau and Kirghiznyn Ala-tau form

                    mountains and plateaus from the rest of the continent. Even the few passes which
                    lead to it climb to altitudes of 14,000 feet. It is open only towards the east,
                    where it is connected with the Gobi depression. Its position as the highway from
                    China to West Turkestan and the Dzungarian empire has made it known, though only
                    very imperfectly until lately, through Chinese documents, the narratives of the
                    journeys of Buddhist missionaries, and the travels of Marco Polo, Rubruquis, and
                    a few Jesuits. From a remote antiquity it was crossed by caravans going from
                    China to Lake Balkash, Ferghana, and the Oxus. The route, after crossing the
                    Gobi, proceeded either to the Dzungarian Gate, or, <hi rend="italic">via</hi>

                <p>One river only, the Tarim—now lost in the marshes of Lob-Nor—and its tributaries,
                    water this region. It is formed by the confluence of several rivers flowing from
                    the semicircle of mountains which fence in East Turkestan on the south, west,
                    and north. The Kashgar-Daria rises under the name of Kizil-su on the Aɫai. The
                    Yarkand-Daria has its origin in a high valley between the KuenLun and Karakorum
                    Mountains, at the base of Dapsang, from several streams, such as the auriferous
                    Zerafshan, which is fed by the glaciers of the Karakorum pass; after piercing
                    the Kuen-Lun, it enters the plain, where its waters are soon diverted to the
                    fields and gardens of the Yarkand oasis. The Khotan-Daria rises farther east in
                    the same valley, and also pierces the Kuen-Lun, its two branches— the Kara-kash
                    and Urung-kash—being renowned for their “black” and “white” jade. This river
                    only reaches the Tarim during the summer. The Tian-Shan Mountains contain the
                    sources of several feeders of the Tarim; but some of them no longer reach the
                    main stream. The Kizil-Kunghei disappears after having watered Utch-Turfan
                    (Uj-Turfan); the Ak-su meets the Khotan-Daria at its junction with the Tarim;
                    but the Baidu-gol and the Kutcha are lost in Lakes Baba-kul and Sary-kamysh.
                    From the Yuɫduz plateau comes the Haidu-gol, which flows past Kara-Shar and
                    enters the Bagratch-kul Lake, whence it issues under the name of Kontcha-Daria,
                    and, crossing the east of East Turkestan from north to south, joins the marshes
                    of Lob-Nor; thus the long-doubted connexion between these two lakes—the northern
                    and the southern—really exists. The Tarim is navigable for steamers from the
                    confluence of the Yarkand and Khotan rivers all the way to Lob-Nor.<note

                    not bring life to the immense deserts, the aspect of which recalls partly the
                    Aral-Caspian depression and partly the Mongolian Gobi. Their undulating surface
                    is covered with a gravelly soil, out of which all the finer particles have been
                    winnowed by the wind, and it resounds under the hoofs of the passing hordes;
                    grass covers it only in the beginning of spring. Here and there occur clayey
                    deposits with an efflorescence of salt, which is hard in summer but impassable
                    after rains. Then come immense areas of loose sand, which is raised in clouds by
                    storms of wind, and the hills of which, moving on like waves, invade the
                    cultivated fields that have been conquered by laborious effort from the desert.
                    The features with which the traveller in the Sahara, or on the plateau of
                    eastern Iran about Lake Zareh (Hamun) is familiar, are here reproduced on the
                    same large scale. The Takla-makan desert north of Khotan covers 93,000 square
                    miles—an area nearly equal to that of Great Britain. As one approaches Lob-Nor,
                    and thus touches upon territory that has emerged at a still more recent epoch,
                    the desert becomes still drearier and still less passable on account of the
                    shifting sands. Lob-Nor now consists of two basins; but the largest of them,
                    although it has an area four times as large as that of the Lake of Geneva, can
                    hardly be called a lake, since its greatest depth is less than 20 feet, while
                    reeds rise 20 feet above the thin film of water and extend far beyond its
                    shores. In fact the whole of the region, notwithstanding its considerable
                    altitude above the ocean, has but recently emerged from under water. During the
                    later portion of the Tertiary period it was covered with an immense
                    Mediterranean sea, and even during the Post-Pliocene period was occupied by a
                    lake. But, as we see on a smaller scale in Finland and Sweden, where the higher
                    lacustrine depressions are more advanced in the process of desiccation than
                    those situated at lower levels, so in Central Asia the more elevated Tarim
                    region is more advanced in its desiccation than the Balkash basin, and this
                    latter again is in a more advanced stage of the same process than the
                    Aral-Caspian depression. The desiccation of East Turkestan must have gone on,
                    however, within historical times at a much more rapid rate than geologists seem
                    prepared to admit. East Turkestan has not always been the desert it now is. Many
                    cities, in which Greek and Byzantine coins have been found, lie buried beneath
                    the sands, and in one of these Buddhist statues have been discovered. Indeed it
                    is very probable that the great migration of the first centuries of our era
                    resulted from the necessity of abandoning East Turkestan.</p>
                <p>The climate is severe: a cold winter follows a burning summer. A few showers
                    slightly moisten the surface in spring; but the summer and autumn are rainless.
                    The air is continually charged with dust, and often with sand.</p>
                <p>The vegetation of the interior of East Turkestan is very poor, being the same as
                    that of the steppes of West Turkestan. On the sandy hills are some tamarisks and
                    <hi rend="italic">Elaeagnus,</hi> rapidly being used up as fuel; along the
                    rivers are copses of poplars, which have difficulty in maintaining themselves,
                    because no humus gathers in their shade, the dry leaves being blown away by the
                    storms and scattered as dust over the desert; and, finally, along the old beds
                    of rivers and lakes grow dense and rank beds of reeds, where the wild boar has
                    his habitat. Immense areas are covered with <hi rend="italic">Salsolaceae,</hi>
                    and the gravelly ground is clothed in spring with a rich carpet of grass. The
                    oases possess all the plants which are cultivated in West Turkestan,—the
                    mulberry, walnut, pear, apple, apricot, olive, and vine. Cotton, rice, maize,
                    millet, and wheat are grown; and Middendorff's<note anchored="true"

                    remark, that on the edge of the desert we find the best cultivated fields and
                    the richest gardens, is still more applicable to the oases of East than to those
                    of West Turkestan. But outside the oases desolation reigns. Wind freely modifies
                    the surface, carrying away the finest particles of the gravelly soil, breaking
                    down the <hi rend="italic">barkhans</hi> as soon as man has destroyed the
                    vegetation which grew on them, and lifting the sand into the air and whirling it

                <p>As a rule, the mammals are not numerous, and the fauna closely resembles that of
                    the Tian-Shan. It seems to be owing to the loneliness of its deserts that East
                    Turkestan has preserved the wild ancestors of our domestic animals. Besides the

                <p>Raw cotton and silk are exported to a considerable amount; but of manufactured
                    cottons only a rough <hi rend="italic">mata</hi> is sent to Semiryetchensk for
                    the Kirghiz. Some silk wares, carpets, and silk “grain” are exported from
                    Khotan, leather-ware from Yarkand, polished and copper ware from Ak-su, and
                    small iron ware from Kutcha. Stockbreeding is of paramount importance, and
                    cattle, asses, camels, and sheep are reared in considerable numbers. Mineral
                    resources are not wanting, but the mining industry is in a primitive condition.
                    Gold is obtained from alluvial deposits at Kiria, coal at Kashgar, jade in
                    Khotan, and sulphur and saltpetre at Utch-Turfan.</p>
                <p>It is only along the base of the mountains, where there is a fringe of loess, and
                    where streams bring the necessary moisture, that human settlements have sprang
                    up, or rather maintained themselves until now. The series of oases skirts the
                    base of the Tian-Shan and the Kuen-Lun. Kashgar stands at the apex of the angle
                    made by those two ranges, while Yanghi-hissar, Yarkand, Khotan, and Kiria lie
                    along the Kuen-Lun, and Utch-Turfan, Ak-su, Bai, Kutcha, Kurta, Karashar, and
                    Turfan along the Tian-Shan. Many miles of desert separate these oases from each
                    other; and their population could be, and has been, much greater than it is, for
                    there is no lack of water in the streams which rise beneath the snow covering of
                    the mountains. The various oases, which are named after their chief towns, have
                    always been nearly independent of each other. Still, in the course of their much
                    disturbed history, Khotan, Yarkand, Kashgar, and Ak-su, one after another
                    acquired a kind of supremacy over the rest. At present Yarkand and Kashgar are
                    the most important. The city of Yarkand has nearly 60,000 inhabitants; it is
                    surrounded by walls, and has a separate fort, Yanghi-hissar; rains of old
                    settlements are scattered around. Its Chinese merchants carry on an active
                    trade, and the Turkish population are breeders of cattle on an extensive scale.

                    villages, is the chief commercial centre, owing to its position on the highway
                    to Lake Issyk-kul. It is surrounded by forts, one standing at the confluence of
                    the Kashgar and Yarkand rivers. <hi rend="smallcaps">Khotan</hi> (<hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.</hi>) or litchi (also Yu-thian), a very populous city under
                    the Han dynasty of China (206 B.O.-1 A.D.), has much declined of late. It is
                    renowned for its gold mines, and especially for its jade and its musk. Copper
                    kettles, carpets, some silk, and felt ware are manufactured. Sanju (7000
                    houses), Kilian, Pialma, Guma, Kargaɫyk, and Posgan, on the slopes of the
                    Kuen-Lun between Yarkand and Khotan, are the richest parts of the region. Naya,
                    Kiria, Tchira, all on small rivers flowing from the Kuen-Lun, continue the line
                    of oases towards the east, terminating in Tchertcheñ, which now consists of but
                    a few score of houses. The oases at the base of the Tian-Shan are Utch-Turfan
                    (Ust-Turfan), Ak-su (formerly the capital of Sairam), Bai, Kutcha with Shah-yar,
                    Bugur, Kurta, Karashar, and Turfan. Their inhabitants grow coni to a
                    considerable amount, and keep numerous herds of cattle and flocks of sheep. The
                    chief exports are wool, fowls, and the horns of the maral deer. On the lower
                    Tarim, where a few settlements, supported chiefly by fishing, continue to
                    struggle against the encroaching desert, the ruins of formerly populous towns
                    testify that the region was not always the dreary waste it now is.</p>
                <p>The population is mixed, Aryans and Turanians being thoroughly intermingled. On
                    the slopes of the Pamir, about Sary-kol, there is a purely Aryan population of
                    Persian Galtchas. Kirghiz and Kara-Kirghiz inhabit the slopes of the Tian-Shan.
                    Kalmucks occur in the north-east; and in the central parts the population
                    consists of Turkish Sarts and Uzbegs and of Persian Tajak,—the Mongolian element
                    increasing towards the north-east. The language is Turkish, like that spoken in
                    West Turkestan, with several varieties of <hi rend="italic">patois</hi> and a
                    considerable addition of Chinese words. As a rule, the inhabitants of East
                    Turkestan have an air of poverty. There are no rich mosques in their towns, such
                    as those of Samarkand and Bokhara; the houses are of unbaked brick and poorly
                    furnished. The dress is that customary in West Turkestan. But the habits of the
                    people differ to some extent and the women enjoy greater liberty than in other
                    Mohammedan countries: they go in the streets unveiled; free marriages,
                    contracted for short terms, are not unfrequent. As a rule, the position of women
                    is more independent —a feature noticed even by the earliest travellers in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>The aggregate population of East Turkestan, estimated between 575,000 and
                    1,500,000 in 1825, is now (1887) hardly more than 1,000,000. Kuropatkin
                    estimates it at 1,200,000, Forsyth at 600,000. The population of the chief towns
                    may be stated approximately as follows—Yarkand, 60,000; Kashgar, 50,000; Khotan,
                    40,000; Sanju, 35,000; Ak-su, 20,000; Kiria, 15,000; Yanghi-hissar, 10,000;
                    Kargaɫyk, 10,000; Kurta, 6000.</p>
                <p>It appears very probable that at the dawn of history East Turkestan was inhabited
                    by an Aryan population, the ancestors of the present Slavonic and Teutonic
                    races, and that a civilization not inferior to that of Bactriana had already
                    developed at that time in the region of the Tarim.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Such is the conclusion reached by Lassen <hi
                    rend="italic">(Indische Alterthumskunde),</hi> and supported by Μ. Grigorieff
                    (Ritter’s <hi rend="italic">Asien</hi> in Russ. transl.; Addenda to “East
                    Turkestan,” in Russian). In connexion with the objection based upon the
                    sub-boreal character of the regions which were the cradle of the Aryans, as
                    proved by the so-called palaeontology of the Aryan languages, it may be observed
                    that by the end of the Glacial, and during the earlier Lacustrine (PostGlacial)
                    period, the vegetation of Turkestan and of Central Asia was quite different from
                    what it is now. It was Siberian or north European. The researches by Μ. Krasnoff
                    (see above, p. 635) as to the characters of the former flora of the Tian-Shan,
                    and the changes it has undergone in consequence of the extremely rapid
                    desiccation of Central Asia, must be carefully borne in mind in all speculations
                    founded upon the testimony of language as to the original home of the
                    Aryans.</p></note> Our knowledge, however, of the history of the region is very
                    fragmentary until about the beginning of the Christian era. When the Hums
                    (Hiong-nu) occupied west and east Mongolia in 177 B.C., they drove before them
                    the Yue-chi (Yutes, Yetes, or Ghetes), who divided into two hordes, one of which
                    invaded the valley of the Indus, while the other met the Sacae in East Turkestan
                    and drove them over the Tian-Shan into the valley of the Ili. Thus by the
                    beginning of our era the Tarim region had a mixed population of Aryans and
                    Ural-Altaians, some being settled agriculturists and others nomads. There were
                    also several independent cities, of which Khotan was the most important. One
                    portion of the Aryans emigrated and settled in what is now Wakhan (on the Pamir
                    plateau), the present language of which seems very old, dating anterior to the
                    separation of the Vedic and Zend languages. In the 1st century the Chinese
                    extended their rule westwards over East Turkestan as far as Kashgar. But their
                    dominion seems to have been merely nominal, for it was soon shaken off. By the
                    end of the 5th century the western parts fell under the sway of the “White Huns”
                    or Ephthalites, while the eastern parts were under Tangut (Thygun) dominion. The
                    Chinese, however, still retained the region about Lob-Nor. Buddhism penetrated
                    into the country at an early date; but in East Turkestan there were also
                    followers of Zoroastrianism, of Nestorian Christianity, and even of Manichaeism.
                    An active trade was carried on by means of numerous caravans. The civilization
                    and political organization of the country were dominated by the Chinese, but
                    were also influenced to some extent by Graeco-Bactrian civilization. Buddhism
                    spread rapidly in the south-west, and the study of Pali became widely diffused.
                    Our information as to the state of the country from the 2d century to the first
                    half of the 7th is slight, and is chiefly derived from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Journeys</hi> of the Buddhist pilgrim Fa-hien in 399, Song-yun in 518, and
                    Hwen-t’sang in 629. By this time Buddhism had reached its culminating point: in
                    Khotan there were 100 monasteries and 5000 monks, and the Indian sacred
                    literature was widely diffused; but already there were tokens of its decay. Even
                    then the eastern parts of the Tarim basin seem to have been growing less and
                    less populous. To the east of Khotan cities which were prosperous when visited
                    by Song-yun had a century later fallen into ruins, while their inhabitants had
                    migrated westwards. Legend has it that all the inhabitants of Go-lao-lo-tsia
                    were buried in a sandstorm, and this seems to be but a poetical way of
                    representing a phenomenon which was steadily going on in East Turkestan.</p>
                <p>Little is known about these regions during the 7th, 8th, and 9th centuries. In
                    the 7th century the Tibetan king, Srong-btsan, with the help of the western
                    Turks, subjugated the western part of the Tarim basin. During the following
                    century the Mohammedans under Kotaiba, after several excursions into West
                    Turkestan, took Samarkand, Ferghana, Tashkend, and Khokand (712-713), and
                    invaded East Turkestan, penetrating as far as Turfan and China. The Chinese
                    supremacy was not shaken by these invasions. But, on the outbreak of internal
                    disturbances in China, the Tibetans took possession of the western provinces of
                    China, and intercepted the communications of the Chinese with Kashgaria, so that
                    they had to send their troops through the lands of the Hui-khe (Hoei-ke, or
                    Hoei-hu). In 790 the Tibetans were masters of East Turkestan; but their rule was
                    never strong, and towards the 9th century we find the country under the Hoi-he.
                    Who these people were is somewhat uncertain. According to Chinese documents,
                    they came from the Selenga; but most Orientalists identify them with the Uigurs.
                    In the opinion of Μ. Grigorieff, whom we follow in this sketch,<note

                    succeeded the Chinese in the western parts of East Turkestan were the Karluk
                    Turks, who extended farther south-west up to Kashmir, while the north-eastern
                    parts of the Tarim region were subdued by the Uigurs. Soon Mongolian hordes, the
                    Kara-Kitais, entered East Turkestan (llth century), and then penetrated into
                    West Turkestan, Khiva falling under their dominion. During the following century
                    Jenghiz Khan overran China, Turkestan, India, Persia, Bussia, and Hungary;
                    Kashgaria fell under his rule in 1220, though not without strenuous resistance
                    followed by massacres. The Mongolian rule was, however, not very heavy, the
                    Mongols merely exacting tribute. In fact, Kashgaria flourished under them, and
                    the fanaticism of Islam was considerably abated. Women again acquired greater
                    independence, and the religious toleration then established permitted
                    Christianity and Buddhism to spread freely. This state of affairs lasted until
                    the 14th century, when Tughlak Timur, who extended his dominions to the KuenLun,
                    accepted Islam. He transferred his capital from Ak-su to Kashgar, and had a
                    summer residence on the banks of Issyk-kul. His son reigned at Samarkand, but
                    was overthrown by Timur-lang (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Timur),</hi> and the
                    reign of the great conqueror was a fertile source of suffering to the region. To
                    put an end to the attacks of the wild Tian-Shan tribes, he undertook in 1389 his
                    renowned march to Dzungaria, which was devastated; East Turkestan also suffered
                    severely.</p>
                <p>The re-introduction of Islam was of no benefit to the Tarim region. In the 14th
                    and 15th centuries Bokhara and Samarkand became centres of Moslem scholarship,
                    and sent great numbers of their learned doctors to Kashgaria. Rubruquis, who
                    visited East Turkestan in 1254, Marco Polo between 1271 and 1275, and Hoïs in
                    1680, all bore witness to great religious tolerance; but this entirely
                    disappeared with the invasion of the Bokharian mollahs. They created in East
                    Turkestan the power of the <hi rend="italic">khojas,</hi> who afterwards
                    fomented the many intestine wars waged between the rival factions of the White
                    and the Black Mountaineers. In the 17th century a powerful Kalmuck confederation
                    arose in Dzungaria, and extended its sway over the Ili and Issyk-kul basins,
                    having its capital on the Ili. To this power or to the Kirghiz the “Whites” and
                    “Blacks” alternately appealed in their struggles, in which Yarkand supported the
                    latter and Kashgar the former. These straggles paved the way for a Chinese
                    invasion, which was supported by the White khojas of Kashgar. The Chinese
                    entered Dzungaria in 1758, and there perpetrated a terrible massacre, the
                    victims being estimated at one million. The Kalmucks fled and Dzungaria became a
                    Chinese province, with a military colonization of Sibos, Solons, Dahurs, Chinese
                    criminals, and Moslem Dzungars. The Chinese next re-conquered East Turkestan,
                    marking their progress by massacres and transporting 12,500 partisans of
                    independence to the Ili valley. Hereupon the dissentient khojas fled to Khokand
                    and there gathered armies of malcontents and fanatic followers of <pb break="no"

                    overthrowing the Chinese rule—in 1825, in 1830, and in 1847—but their successes
                    were never permanent. After the “rebellion of the seven khojas” in 1847 nearly
                    20,000 families from Kashgar, Yarkand, and Ak-su fled to West Turkestan through
                    the Terek-Davan pass, many of them perishing on the way. In 1857 another
                    insurrection broke out; but a few months later the Chinese again took Kashgar
                    (for the details see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kashgar).</hi> In the course of the
                    Dzungarian outbreak of 1864 the Chinese were again expelled; and Yakub Beg
                    became master of Kashgar in 1872. But five years later he had again to sustain
                    war with China, in which he was defeated, and East Turkestan once more became a
                    Chinese province.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bibliography.—</hi> The literature on Turkestan has of late
                    years become very voluminous, especially in the form of papers scattered through
                    the periodicals published by the European Geographical Societies and other
                    scientific bodies. The reader is referred to the following works as fitted to
                    facilitate research. Vols. vi. and vii. of Elisée Reclus’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Géographie Universelle</hi> contain maps showing the routes of the chief
                    explorers. Prof. Mushketoff's <hi rend="italic">Turkestan</hi> (in Russian, vol.
                    i. 1S86) contains an excellent critical analysis of all explorations of
                    Turkestan and works thereupon, and the information they contain with regard to
                    the physical geography and geology of West Turkestan. Prof. Grigorieff's addenda
                    to Ritter’s <hi rend="italic">Asien</hi> embody the whole of the older and more
                    modern researches into the geography and history of East Turkestan down to 1873.

                    Petersburg, 1875) are most useful works. Prof. Lenz’s paper “Ueber den früheren

                    discusses valuable information borrowed from ancient sources. Mezhoff's <hi

                    library at Tashkend, and his annual “Index" contains full classified lists of
                    Russian geographical literature. Of works of a general character, with
                    descriptions of both regions (apart from travels), the following, arranged in
                    chronological order, are worthy of mention Semenoff's “Tian-Shan,” being vol. i.
