                    applied to instruments employed to record the appearance of celestial objects by
                    photography.</p></note> The fundamental optical principles involved in its

                <p>The credit of the discovery of the telescope has been a fruitful subject of
                    discussion. Thus, because Democritus announced that the milky way is composed of
                    vast multitudes of stars, it has been maintained that he could only have been
                    led to form such an opinion from actual examination of the heavens with a
                    telescope. Other passages from the Greek and Latin authors have similarly been
                    cited to prove that the telescope was known to the ancients. But, as has been
                    remarked by Dr Robert Grant <hi rend="italic">(History of Physical
                    Astronomy,</hi> p. 515), we are no more warranted in drawing so important a
                    conclusion from casual remarks, however sagacious, than we should be justified
                    in stating that Seneca ∙was in possession of the discoveries of Newton because
                    he predicted that comets would one day be found to revolve in periodic orbits.
                    Molyneux, in his <hi rend="italic">Dioptmca Nova,</hi> p. 256, declares his
                    opinion that Roger Bacon (who died <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1294) “did
                    perfectly well understand all kinds of optic glasses, and knew likewise the
                    method of combining them so as to compose some such instrument as our
                    telescope.” He cites a passage from Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Opus Hajus,</hi>
                    p. 377 of Jebb’s edition, 1733, translated as follows :—</p>
                <p>“Greater things than these may be performed by refracted vision. For it is easy
                    to understand by the canons above mentioned that the greatest objects may appear
                    exceedingly small, and the contrary, also that the most remote objects may
                    appear just at hand, and the converse; for we can give such figures to
                    transparent bodies, and dispose them in such order with respect to the eye and
                    the objects, that the rays shall be refracted and bent towards any place we
                    please, so that we shall see the object near at hand or at any distance under
                    any angle we please. And thus from an incredible distance we may read the
                    smallest letters, and may number the smallest particles of dust and sand, by
                    reason of the greatness of the angle under which we see them. . . . Thus also
                    the sun, moon, and stars may be made to descend hither in appearance, and to be
                    visible over the heads of our enemies, and many things of the like sort, which
                    persons unacquainted with such things would refuse to believe.”</p>
                <p>Molyneux also cites from Bacon’s <hi rend="italic">Epistola ad Pamsiensem,</hi>
                    “Of the Secrets of Art and Nature,” chap. 5 :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> Glasses or diaphanous bodies may be so formed
                    that the most remote objects may appear just at hand, and the contrary, so that
                    we may read the smallest letters at an incredible distance, and may number
                    things, though never so small, and may make the stars also appear as near as we
                    please.”</p>
                <p>These passages certainly prove that Bacon had very nearly, if not perfectly,
                    arrived at theoretical proof of the possibility of constructing a telescope and
                    a microscope; but his writings give no account of the trial of an actual
                    telescope, nor any detailed results of the application of a telescope to an
                    examination of the heavens. It has been pointed out by Dr Smith, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Complete System of Optics,</hi> that Bacon imagines some effects
                    of telescopes which cannot be performed by them, and his conclusion is that
                    Bacon never actually looked through a telescope.</p>
                <p>Giambattista della Porta, in his <hi rend="italic">Hagia Naturalis,</hi> printed
                    in 1558, makes the following remarkable statement :—</p>
                <p>“If you do but know how to join the two (viz., the concave and the convex
                    glasses) rightly together, you will see both remote and near objects larger than
                    they otherwise appear, and withal very distinct.”</p>
                <p>Wolfius infers from this passage that its author was the first actual constructor
                    of a telescope, and it appears not improbable that by happy accident Porta
                    really did make some primitive form of telescope which excited the wonder of his
                    friends. Here, however, his interest in the matter appears to have ceased, and
                    he was unable either to appreciate the importance of his discovery or to
                    describe the means by which the object was attained. Kepler, who examined
                    Porta’s account of his concave and convex lenses by desire of his patron the
                    emperor Rudolph, declared that it was perfectly unintelligible. Poggendorff <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gesch. der Physik,</hi> p. 134) throws considerable doubt on the
                    originality of Porta’s statement.</p>
                <p>Thomas Digges, in his <hi rend="italic">Stratioticus,</hi> p. 359, published in
                    1579, states that his father, Leonard Digges,</p>
                <p>“among other curious practices had a method of discovering by perspective glasses
                    set at due angles all objects pretty far distant that the sun shone upon, which
                    lay in the country round about,” and that this was by the help of a manuscript
                    book of Roger Bacon of Oxford, w ho he conceived was the only man besides his
                    father who knew it. There is also the following passage in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantometria</hi> (bk. i. chap. 21) of Leonard Digges<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He died about 1570. His son alludes to his
                    untimely death m the preface to the <hi rend="italic"

                    and again in 1591):—</p>
                <p>“Marvellous are the conclusions that may be performed by glasses concave and
                    convex, of circular and parabolic forms, using for multiplication of beams
                    sometime the aid of glasses transparent, which, by fraction, should unite or
                    dissipate the images or figures presented by the reflection of other.”</p>
                <p>He then describes the effects of magnification from a combination of lenses or
                    mirrors, adding :—</p>
                <p>“But of these conclusions I minde not here to intreate, having at large in a
                    volume<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is no
                    further trace of this volume.</p></note> by itselfe opened the miraculous
                    effects of perspective glasses.”</p>
                <p>It is impossible to discredit the significance of these quotations, for the works
                    in which they occur were published more than twenty years before the original
                    date claimed for the discovery of the telescope in Holland.</p>
                <p>That Roger Bacon had tolerably clear ideas as to the practical possibility of
                    constructing telescopes, and that Leonard Digges had access to some unpublished
                    MSS. of Bacon, and by their aid constructed some form of telescope, seem to be
                    obvious inferences from the preceding evidence. But it is quite certain that
                    previous to 1600 the telescope was unknown, except possibly to individuals who
                    failed to see its practical importance, and who confined its use to “curious
                    practices” or to demonstrations of “natural magic.” The practical discovery of
                    the instrument was certainly made in Holland about 1608, but the credit of the
                    original invention has been claimed on behalf of three individuals, Hans
                    Lippershey and Zacharias Jansen, spectacle-makers in Middelburg, and James
                    Metius of Alkmaar (brother of Adrian Metius the mathematician).</p>
                <p>Descartes, in his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Dioptrics</hi> (1637), attributes
                    the discovery to Metius “about thirty years ago,” whilst Schyraelus de Rheita, a
                    Capuchin friar, in his <hi rend="italic">Oculus Enoch et Elise</hi> (Antwerp,
                    1645), gives the credit to Lippershey about 1609. Peter Borel, physician to the
                    king of France, published at The Hague, in 1655, a work <hi rend="italic">De
                    Vero Telescopii Inventore.</hi> He was assisted in its preparation by William
                    Borel, Dutch envoy at the court of France, and the latter declares, as the
                    result of patient investigation, that <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0147-0136"/> Jansen and his father were the real inventors of
                    the telescope in 1610, and that Lippershey only made a telescope after hints
                    accidentally communicated to him of the details of Jansen’s invention. But the
                    most trustworthy information on the subject is to be got from the researches of
                    Van S winden.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr
                    Moll of Utrecht, in <hi rend="italic">Jοwrn. Roy. Iηst.,</hi> vol. i.,
                    1831.</p></note> Briefly summarized, this evidence is as follows. In the library
                    of the university of Leyden, amongst the MSS. of Huygens there is an original
                    copy of a document (dated 17th October 1608) addressed to the states-general by
                    Jacob Andrianzoon (the same individual who is called James Metius by Descartes),
                    petitioning for the exclusive right of selling an instrument of his invention by
                    which distant objects appear larger and more distinct. He states that he had
                    discovered the instrument by accident when engaged in making experiments, and
                    had so far perfected it that distant objects were made as visible and distinct
                    by his instrument as could be done with the one which had been lately offered to
                    the states by a citizen and spectaclemaker of Middelburg. Among the Acts of the
                    states-general preserved in the Government archives at The Hague, Van Swinden
                    found that on 2d October 1608 the assembly of the states took into consideration
                    the petition of Hans Lippershey, spectacle-maker, a native of Wesel and an
                    inhabitant of Middelburg, inventor of an instrument for seeing at a distance. On
                    4th October a committee was appointed to test the instrument, and on the 6th of
                    the same month the assembly agreed to give Lippershey 900 florins for his
                    instrument. Further, on the 15th December of the same year they examined an
                    instrument invented by Lippershey at their request to see with both eyes, and
                    gave him orders to execute two similar instruments at 900 florins each; but, as
                    many other persons had knowledge of this new invention to see at a distance,
                    they did not deem it expedient to grant him an exclusive privilege to sell such
                    instruments. The dates of these documents dispose effectually of Borel’s
                    statement that Lippershey borrowed the ideas of Jansen in 1610. They also prove
                    that, whilst Metius was in possession of a telescope, with which he may have
                    expeιimented, about the time when Lippershey presented his application for
                    patent rights, yet he makes no pretension that Lippershey borrowed the invention
                    from him. The conclusion is that Lippershey was the first person who
                    independently invented the telescope, and at the same time made the instrument
                    known to the world. The common story is that Lippershey, happening one day,
                    whilst holding a spectacle-lens in either hand, to direct them towards the
                    steeple of a neighbouring church, was astonished, on looking through the nearer
                    lens, to find that the weathercock appeared nearer and more distinct. He fitted
                    the lenses in a tube, in order to adjust and preserve their relative distances,
                    and thus constructed his first telescope. But doubt may be thrown on this
                    traditional account owing to the further statement that the image of the
                    weathercock so viewed was seen turned upside down. All the original Dutch
                    telescopes were composed of a convex and a concave lens, and telescopes so
                    constructed do not invert. The inverting telescope, composed of two convex
                    lenses, was a later invention; still it is not impossible that the original
                    experiment was made with two convex lenses.</p>
                <p>Telescopes seem to have been made in Holland in considerable numbers soon after
                    the date of their invention, and rapidly found their way over Europe. Sirturus,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">De Telescopio</hi> (1618), states that “a Frenchman
                    proceeded to Milan in the month of May 1609 and offered a telescope for sale to
                    Count di Fuentes”; and Lorenzi Pigorna writes,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Lettre d'Comini
                    Illustri,</hi> p. 112, Venice, 1744.</p></note> under date 31st August 1609,
                    that “Galileo had been appointed lecturer at Padua for life on account of a
                    perspective like the one which was sent from Flanders to Cardinal Borghese.”
                    Simon Marius, the German astronomer, appears to have made astronomical
                    observations in 1609 with a telescope which he procured from Holland, and
                    Professor Rigaud of Oxford found from the MSS. of Harriot, the mathematician,
                    that he had been making astronomical observations with a Dutch telescope as
                    early as July 1609. Galileo, in his <hi rend="italic">Nuncius Sidereus,</hi>
                    states that, happening to be in Venice about the month of May 1609, he heard
                    that a Belgian had invented a perspective instrument by means of which distant
                    objects appeared nearer and larger, and that he discovered its construction by
                    considering the effects of refraction. In his <hi rend="italic">Saggiatore</hi>
                    Galileo states that he solved the problem of the construction of a telescope the
                    first night after his return to Padua from Venice, and made his first telescope
                    next day by fitting a convex lens in one extremity of a leaden tube and a
                    concave lens in the other one. A few days afterwards, having succeeded in making
                    a better telescope than the first, he took it to Venice, where he communicated
                    the details of his invention to the public, and presented the instrument itself
                    to the doge Leonardo Donato, sitting in full council. The senate, in return,
                    settled him for life in his lectureship at Padua and doubled his salary, which
                    was previously 500 florins, and which then became treble that which any of his
                    predecessors had enjoyed. Galileo may thus claim to have invented the telescope
                    independently, but not till he had heard that others had done so. In fact the
                    time was ripe; and, as often happens in similar circumstances, only a hint was
                    necessary to complete the latent chain of thought. Galileo devoted all his time
                    to improving and perfecting the telescope. Knowing the theory of his instrument,
                    and possessed of much practical skill, coupled with unwearied patience, he
                    conquered the difficulties of grinding and polishing the lenses, and soon
                    succeeded in producing telescopes of greatly increased power. His first
                    telescope magnified three diameters; but he soon made instruments which
                    magnified eight diameters, and finally one that magnified thirty-three
                    diameters.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This last
                    power could not be exceeded with advantage in this form of telescope till after
                    the invention of the achromatic object-glass.</p></note> With this last
                    instrument he discovered in 1610 the satellites of Jupiter, and soon afterwards
                    the spots on the sun, the phases of Venus, and the hills and valleys on the
                    moon. He demonstrated the rotation of the satellites of Jupiter round the
                    planet, and gave rough predictions of their configurations, proved the rotation
                    of the sun on its axis, established the general truth of the Copernican system
                    as compared with that of Ptolemy, and fairly routed the fanciful dogmas of the
                    philosophers. These brilliant achievements, together with the immense
                    improvement of the instrument under the hands of Galileo, overshadowed in a
                    great degree the credit due to the original discoverer, and led to the universal
                    adoption of the name of the Galilean telescope for the form of the instrument
                    invented by Lippershey.</p>
                <p>Kepler first explained the theory and some of the practical advantages of a
                    telescope constructed of two convex lenses in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catoptrics</hi> (1611). The first person who actually constructed a telescope
                    of this form was Father Scheiner, who gives a description of it in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Rosa Ursina</hi> (1630). William Gascoigne was the first who
                    practically appreciated the chief advantages of the form of telescope suggested
                    by Kepler, viz., the visibility of the image of a distant object simultaneously
                    with that of a small material object placed in the common focus of the two
                    lenses. This led to his invention of the micrometer and his application of
                    telescopic sights to astronomical instruments of precision (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 242). But it was not till about
                    the middle of the 17th century that Kepler’s telescope came into general use,
                    and then, not so much because of the advantages pointed out by Gascoigne, but
                    because its field of view was much larger than in the Galilean telescope. The
                    first powerful telescopes of this construction were made by Huygens, after much
                    labour, in which he was assisted by his brother. With one of these, of 12-feet
                    focal length, he discovered the brightest of Saturn’s satellites (Titan) in
                    1655, and in 1659 he published his <hi rend="italic">Systema Saturnium,</hi> in
                    which was given for the first time a true explanation of Saturn’s ring, founded
                    on observations made with the same instrument. The sharpness of image in
                    Kepler’s telescope is very inferior to that of the Galilean instrument, So that
                    when a high magnifying power is required it becomes essential to increase the
                    focal length. Cassini discovered Saturn’s fifth satellite (Rhea) in 1672 with a
                    telescope of 35 feet, and the third and fourth satellites in 1684 with
                    telescopes made by Campani of 100 and 136 feet focal length. Huygens states that
                    he and his brother <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"

                    length, and he presented one of 123 feet to the Royal Society of London. Auzout
                    and others are said to have made telescopes of from 300 to 600 feet focus, but
                    it does not appear that they were ever able to use them in practical
                    observations. Bradley, on 27th December 1722, actually measured the diameter of
                    Venus with a telescope whose object-glass had a focal length of 212{ feet. In
                    these very long telescopes no tube was employed, and they were consequently
                    termed <hi rend="italic">aerial telescopes.</hi> Huygens contrived some
                    ingenious arrangements for directing such telescopes towards any object visible
                    in the heavens,—the focal adjustment and centring of the eye-piece being
                    preserved by a braced rod connecting the object-glass and eye-piece. Other
                    contrivances for the same purpose are described by La Hire <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Mem. deVAcad.,</hi> 1715) and by Hartsoeker <hi rend="italic">{Miscel.
                    Berol.,</hi> vol. i. p. 261). Telescopes of such great length were naturally
                    difficult to use, and must have taxed to the utmost the skill and patience of
                    the observers. One cannot but pay a passing tribute of admiration to the men
                    who, with such troublesome tools, achieved such results.</p>
                <p>Until Newton’s discovery of the different refrangibility of light of different
                    colours, it was generally supposed that object-glasses of telescopes were
                    subject to no other errors than those which arose from the spherical figure of
                    their surfaces, and the efforts of opticians were chiefly directed to the
                    construction of lenses of other forms of curvature. James Gregory, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Optica Promota</hi> (1663), discusses the forms of images of
                    objects produced by lenses and mirrors, and show s that when the surfaces of the
                    lenses or mirrors are portions of spheres the images are curves concave towards
                    the objective, but if the curves of the surfaces are conic sections the
                    spherical aberration is corrected. He was well aware of the failures of all
                    attempts to perfect telescopes by employing lenses of various forms of
                    curvature, and accordingly proposed the form of reflecting telescope which bears
                    his name. But Gregory, according to his own confession, had no practical skill;
                    he could find no optician capable of realizing his ideas, and after some
                    fruitless attempts was obliged to abandon all hope of bringing his telescope
                    into practical use. Newton was the first to construct a reflecting telescope.
                    When in 1666 he made his discovery of the different refrangibility of light of
                    different colours, he soon perceived that the faults of the refracting telescope
                    were due much more to this cause than to the spherical figure of the lenses. He
                    over-hastily concluded from some rough experiments <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Optics,</hi> bk. i. pt. ii. prop. 3) “that all refracting substances diverged
                    the prismatic colours in a constant proportion to their mean refraction and he
                    drew the natural conclusion “that refraction could not be produced without
                    colour,” and therefore “that no improvement could be expected from the
                    refracting telescope” <hi rend="italic">{Treatise on Optics,</hi> p. 112). But,
                    having ascertained by experiment that for all colours of light the angle of
                    incidence is equal to the angle of reflexion, he turned his attention to the
                    construction of reflecting telescopes. After much experiment he selected an
                    alloy of tin and copper as the most suitable material for his specula, and he
                    devised means for grinding and polishing them. He did not attempt the formation
                    of a parabolic figure on account of the probable mechanical difficulties, and he
                    had besides satisfied himself that the chromatic and not the spherical
                    aberration formed the chief faults of previous telescopes. Newton’s first
                    telescope so far realized his expectations that he could see with its aid the
                    satellites of Jupiter and the horns of Venus. Encouraged by this success, he
                    made a second telescope of 6∣-inches focal length, with a magnifying power of 38
                    diameters, which he presented to the Royal Society of London in December 1671. A
                    third form of reflecting telescope was devised in 1672 by Cassegrain <hi
                    rend="italic">{Journal des Sçavans,</hi> 1672). No further practical advance
                    appears to have been made in the design or construction of the instrument till
                    the year 1723, when John Hadley (best known as the inventor of the sextant)
                    presented to the Royal Society a reflecting telescope of the Newtonian
                    construction, with a metallic speculum of 6-inches aperture and 62∣-inches focal
                    length, having eye-pieces magnifying up to 230 diameters. The instrument was
                    examined by Pound and Bradley, the former of whom reported upon it in <hi
                    rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1723, No. 378, p. 382. After remarking that
                    Newton’s telescope “had lain neglected these fifty years,” they stated that
                    Hadley had sufficiently shown “that this noble invention does not consist in
                    bare theory.” They compared its performance with that of the object-glass of
                    123-feet focal length presented to the Royal Society by Huygens, and found that
                    Hadley’s reflector</p>
                <p>“will bear such a charge as to make it magnify the object as many times as the
                    latter with its due charge, and that it represents objects as distinct, though
                    not altogether so clear and bright. . . . Notwithstanding this difference in the
                    brightness of the objects, we were able with this reflecting telescope to see
                    whatever we have hitherto discovered with the Hugenian, particularly the
                    transits of Jupiter’s satellites and their shadows over his disk, the black list
                    in Saturn’s ring, and the edge of his shadow cast on his ring. We have also seen
                    λvith it several times the five satellites of Saturn, in viewing of which this
                    telescope had the advantage of the Hugenian at the time when we compared them;
                    for, being in summer, and the Hugenian telescope being managed without a tube,
                    the twilight prevented us from seeing in this some of these small objects which
                    at the same time we could discern with the reflecting telescope.” Bradley and
                    Molyneux, having been instructed by Hadley in his methods of polishing specula,
                    succeeded in producing some telescopes of considerable power, one of which had a
                    focal length of 8 feet; and, Molyneux having communicated these methods to
                    Scarlet and Hearn, two London opticians, the manufacture of telescopes as a
                    matter of business was commenced by them (Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi>
                    bk. iii. ch. 1). But it was reserved for James Short of Edinburgh to give
                    practical effect to Gregory's original idea. Born at Edinburgh in 1710 and
                    originally educated for the church, Short attracted the attention of Maclaurin,
                    professor of mathematics at the university, who permitted him about 1732 to make
                    use of his rooms in the college buildings for experiments in the construction of
                    telescopes. In Short’s first telescopes the specula were of glass, as suggested
                    by Gregory, but he afterwards used metallic specula only, and succeeded in
                    giving to them true parabolic and elliptic figures. Short then adopted
                    telescope-making as his profession, which he practised first in Edinburgh and
                    afterwards in London. All Short’s telescopes were of the Gregorian form, and
                    some of them retain even to the present day their original high polish and sharp
                    definition. Short died in London in 1768, having realized a considerable fortune
                    by the exercise of his profession.</p>
                <p>The historical sequence of events now brings us to the discovery of the
                    achromatic telescope. The first person who succeeded in making achromatic
                    refracting telescopes seems to have been Chester Moor Hall, a gentleman of
                    Essex. He argued that the different humours of the human eye so refract rays of
                    light as to produce an image on the retina which is free from colour, and he
                    reasonably argued that it might be possible to produce a like result by
                    combining lenses composed of different refracting media<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same argument was employed by Gregory
                    more than fifty years previously, but had been followed by no practical result.
                    The lens of the human eye is not achromatic (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 601).</p></note> After devoting some time to the
                    inquiry he found that by combining lenses formed of different kinds of glass the
                    effect of the unequal refrangibility of light was corrected, and in 1733 he
                    succeeded in constructing telescopes which exhibited objects free from colour.
                    One of these instruments of only 20-inches focal length had an aperture of 2^
                    inches. Hall was a man of independent <pb break="no"

                    at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a
                    trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to Dollond (Watkin <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>At a meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society held on 9th
                    May 1886 a legal document, signed by Chester Moor Hall, was presented by Mr R.
                    B. Prosser of the Patent Office to the society. On the same occasion Mr Ranyard
                    made the following interesting statement respecting Hall :—</p><p>“Some years
                    ago very little was known about Moor Hall. It was known that, about seven years
                    after the patent for making achromatic object-glasses was granted to Dollond,
                    his claim to the invention was disputed by other instrument-makers, amongst them
                    by a Mr Champness, an instrument-maker of Cornhill, who began to infringe the
                    patent, alleging that John Dollond was not the real inventor, and that such
                    telescopes had been made twenty-five years before the granting of his patent by
                    Mr Moor Hall. John Dollond, to whom the Copley medal of the Royal Society had
                    been given for his invention, was then dead, and his son brought an action for
                    infringing the patent against Champness. There is no report of the case, but the
                    facts are referred to in the reports of subsequent cases. It appears that
                    workmen who had been employed by Mr Moor Hall were examined, and proved that
                    they had made achromatic object-glasses as early as 1733. Dollond’s patent was
                    not set aside, though the evidence with regard to the prior manufacture was
                    accepted by Lord Mansfield, who tried the case, as having been satisfactorily
                    proved. . . . Mr Hall was a bencher of the Inner Temple, and was alive at the
                    time of the action. He was a man of some property, and is spoken of on his
                    tombstone as an excellent lawyer and mathematician. He was not a fellow of the
                    Royal Society, but must certainly have known of the gift of the Copley medal to
                    Dollond. It is very curious the conflicting evidence we have to reconcile, but I
                    think the balance of evidence is in favour of there having been a prior
                    invention of achromatic object-glasses before the date of Dollond’s patent” <hi

                    inventor of the achromatic telescope; but it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that
                    “it was not the person who locked his invention in his scrutoire that ought to
                    profit for such invention, but he who brought it forth for the benefit of

                    1747 Euler communicated to the Berlin Academy of Sciences a memoir in which he
                    endeavoured to prove the possibility of correcting both the chromatic and the
                    spherical aberration of an object-glass. Like Gregory and Hall, he argued that,
                    since the various humours of the human eye were so combined as to produce a
                    perfect image, it should be possible by suitable combinations of lenses of
                    different refracting media to construct a perfect object-glass. Adopting a
                    hypothetical law of the dispersion of differently coloured rays of light, he
                    proved analytically the possibility of constructing an achromatic object-glass
                    composed of lenses of glass and water. But all his efforts to produce an actual
                    objectglass of this construction were fruitless,—a failure which he attributed
                    solely to the difficulty of procuring lenses worked precisely to the requisite
                    curves <hi rend="italic">{Mem. Acad. Berlin,</hi> 1753). Dollond admitted the
                    accuracy of Euler’s analysis, but disputed his hypothesis on the grounds that it
                    was purely a theoretical assumption, that the theory was opposed to the results
                    of Newton’s experiments on the refrangibility of light, and that it was
                    impossible to determine a physical law from analytical reasoning alone <hi
                    rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1753, p. 289). In 1754 Euler communicated to
                    the Berlin Academy a further memoir, in which, starting from the hypothesis that
                    light consists of vibrations excited in an elastic fluid by luminous bodies, and
                    that the difference of colour of light is due to the greater or less frequency
                    of these vibrations in a given time, he deduced his previous results. He did not
                    doubt the accuracy of Newton’s experiments quoted by Dollond, because he
                    asserted that the difference between the law deduced by Newton and that which he
                    assumed would not be rendered sensible by such an experiment.<note

                    to this memoir, but soon afterwards he received an abstract of a memoir by
                    Klingenstierna, the Swedish mathematician and astronomer, which led him to doubt
                    the accuracy of the results deduced by Newton on the dispersion of refracted
                    light. Klingenstierna showed from purely geometrical considerations, fully
                    appreciated by Dollond, that the results of Newton’s experiments could not be
                    brought into harmony with other universally accepted facts of refraction.</p>
                <p>Like a practical man, Dollond at once put his doubts to the test of experiment,
                    confirmed the conclusions of Klingenstierna, discovered “a difference far beyond
                    his hopes in the refractive qualities of different kinds of glass with respect
                    to their divergency of colours,” and was thus rapidly led to the construction of
                    object-glasses in which first the chromatic and afterwards the spherical
                    aberration were corrected <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1758, p.
                    733).</p>
                <p>We have thus followed somewhat minutely the history of the gradual process by
                    which Dollond arrived independently at his invention of the refracting
                    telescope, because it has been asserted that he borrowed the idea from others.
                    Montucla, in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Mathématiques</hi> (pp.
                    448-449), gives the following footnote, communicated to him by Lalande :—</p>
                <p>“Ce fut Ch estermonhall” (an obvious misprint for Chester Moor Hall) “qui, vers
                    1750, eut l’idée des lunettes achromatiques. Il s’adressoit à Ayscough,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ayscough was an optician in
                    Ludgate Hill, London.</p></note> qui faisoit travaillir Bass. Dollond ayant eu
                    besoin de Bass pour un verre que demandoit le duc d’Yorck, Bass lui fit voir du
                    crown-glass et du flint-glass. Hall donna une lunette à Ayscough, qui la montra
                    à plusieurs personnes; il en donna la construction a Bird, qui n’en tint pas
                    compte. Dollond en profita. Dans le procès qu’il y eut entre Dollond et Watkin,
                    au banc du roi, cela fut prouvé; mais Dollond gagna, parce qu’il étoit le
                    premier qui eût fait connoître les lunettes achromatiques.” It is clearly
                    established that Hall was the first inventor of the achromatic telescope; but
                    Dollond did not borrow the invention from Hall without acknowledgment in the
                    manner suggested by Lalande. His discovery was beyond question an independent
                    one. The whole history of his researches proves how fully he was aware of the
                    conditions necessary for the attainment of achromatism in refracting telescopes,
                    and he may be well excused if he so long placed implicit reliance on the
                    accuracy of experiments made by so illustrious a philosopher as Newton. His
                    writings sufficiently show that but for this confidence he would have arrived
                    sooner at a discovery for which his mind was fully prepared. It is, besides,
                    impossible to read Dollond’s memoir <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1758,
                    p. 733) without being impressed with the fact that it is a truthful account, not
                    only of the successive steps by which he independently arrived at his discovery,
                    but also of the logical processes by which these steps were successively
                    suggested to his mind.</p>
                <p>The triple object-glass, consisting of a combination of tw o convex lenses of
                    crown glass with a concave flint lens between them, was introduced in 1765 by
                    Peter, son of John Dollond, and many excellent telescopes of this kind were made
                    by him.</p>
                <p>The limits of this article do not permit a further detailed historical statement
                    of the various steps by which the powers of the telescope were developed.
                    Indeed, in its practical form the principle of the instrument has remained
                    unchanged from the time of the Dollonds to the present day; and the history of
                    its development may be summed up as consisting not in new optical discoveries
                    but in utilizing new appliances for figuring and polishing, improved material
                    for specula and lenses, more refined means of testing, and more perfect and
                    convenient methods of mounting. About the year 1774 William Herschel, then a
                    teacher of music in Bath, began to occupy his leisure hours with the
                    construction of specula, and finally devoted himself entirely to their
                    construction and use. In 1778 he had selected the <hi rend="italic">chef T
                    oeuvre</hi> of some 400 specula which he made for the celebrated instrument of
                    7-feet focal length with which his early brilliant astronomical discoveries were
                    made. In 1783 he completed his reflector of 18 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    ⅞-inches aperture and 20-feet focus, and in 1789 his great reflector of 4-feet
                    aperture and 40-feet focal length. The fame of these instruments was rapidly
                    spread by the brilliant discoveries which their maker’s genius and
                    perseverance<pb break="no"

                    telescope became the only available tool of the astronomer when great light
                    grasp was requisite, as the difficulty of procuring disks of glass (especially
                    of flint glass) of suitable purity and homogeneity limited the dimensions of the
                    achromatic telescope. It was in vain that the French Academy of Sciences offered
                    prizes for perfect disks of optical flint glass. Some of the best chemists and
                    most enterprising glass-manufacturers exerted their utmost efforts without
                    succeeding in producing perfect disks of more than 3 J inches in diameter. All
                    the larger disks were crossed by striae, or were otherwise deficient in the
                    necessary homogeneity and purity.</p>
                <p>Pierre Louis Guinand, a humble watchmaker living near Chaux de Fond in Neuchâtel,
                    Switzerland, was the first who succeeded in making marked progress in the
                    manufacture of optical flint glass. After making preliminary experiments
                    extending over seven years (1784- 90), and nothing daunted by their comparative
                    want of success, he erected a furnace near Les Brenets, and devoted most of his
                    slender earnings (then derived from making the bells, or rather gongs, of
                    repeating watches) to the fulfilment of his ambition. His persistency, courage,
                    and self-denial recall forcibly the story of Palissy. In 1805 he joined the
                    optical establishment of Fraunhofer and Utzschneider and remained with them
                    about nine years. During this period extensive experiments were instituted with
                    remarkable success. It is said that the disks for the Dorpat refractor (9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 inches aperture, with which the observations of
                    Wilhelm Struve were made) were manufactured during this period, though the
                    complete instrument was not delivered till 1823. Fraunhofer had, however,
                    profited so fully by the suggestions of Guinand, and had probably also so far
                    improved on the original methods, that he afterwards succeeded in producing
                    still larger objectglasses. After Fraunhofer’s death in 1826 his successors Merz
                    and Mahler carried out successfully the methods handed down to them by Guinand
                    and Fraunhofer, and produced some large and excellent telescopes, which are
                    hereafter mentioned. Meanwhile Guinand, having returned to his native country in
                    1814, resumed there the manufacture of disks of optical glass, discovered a
                    method of removing striae by breaking and reuniting the portions by heat, when
                    the glass was in a plastic state, and eventually produced perfect disks up to 18
                    inches in diameter. Most of these he disposed of to Lerebours and Secretan,
                    opticians in Paris, by both of whom some fine object-glasses were made.<note

                    sons before his death in 1823. About 1829 Bontemps entered into partnership with
                    one of the sons, and another son carried on his father’s manufacture in
                    partnership with his mother. The latter firm was succeeded by Dauget of Soleure,
                    whose exhibits of optical glass excited so much attention at the London
                    exhibition of 1851. About 1848 Bontemps joined the firm of Chance Brothers of
                    Birmingham, and thus carried the secret of Guinand’s methods to England. It is
                    not a little remarkable that the only firms in the world by whom large disks of
                    optical glass have been produced trace their success to information derived more
                    or less directly from Guinand. MM. Feil of Paris, who are direct descendants of
                    Guinand, and Messrs Chance Brothers of Birmingham are at the present time the
                    only makers of optical glass in disks of larger diameter than 20 inches.</p>

                <p>We now proceed to give an account of the methods and principles of construction
                    of the various kinds of telescopes, and to describe in detail special typical
                    instruments, which, owing to the work accomplished by their aid or the practical
                    advances exemplified in their construction, appear most worthy of record or
                    study.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refracting Telescope.</hi></p>
                <p>In its simplest form the telescope consists of a convex objectlens capable of
                    forming an image of a distant object and of an eyelens, concave or convex, by
                    which the image so formed is magnified. When the axis of the eye-lens coincides
                    with that of the object-glass, and the focal point of the eye-lens is coincident
                    with the principal focus of the object-lens, parallel rays incident upon the
                    object-glass will emerge from the eye-piece as parallel rays. These, falling in
                    turn on the lens of the human eye, are converged by it and form an image on the
                    retina.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the case of
                    short-sighted persons the image for very distant objects (that is, for parallel
                    rays) is formed in front of the retina; therefore, to enable such persons to see
                    distinctly, the rays emerging from the eye-piece must be slightly divergent;
                    that is, they must enter the eye as if they proceeded from a comparatively near
                    object. For normal eyes the natural adaptation is not to focus for quite
                    parallel rays, but on objects at a moderate distance, and practically,
                    therefore, most persons do adjust the focus of a telescope, for most distinct
                    and easy vision, so that the rays emerge from the eye-piece very slightly
                    divergent. Abnormally short-sighted persons require to push in the eye-lens
                    nearer to the object-glass, and long-sighted persons to withdraw it from the
                    adjustment employed by those of normal sight. It is usual, however, in
                    computations of the magnifying power of telescopes, for the rays emerging from
                    the eye-piece when adjusted for distinct vision to be parallel.</p></note> Fig.
                    1 shows the course of the rays when the eye-lens is convex (or positive), fig. 2
                    when the eyelens is concave (or negative) The former represents Kepler’s, the
                    latter Lippershey’s or the Galilean telescope. The magnifying power obviously
                    depends on the proportion of the focal length of the object-lens to that of the
                    eye-lens, that is, magnifying power=F∕e, where F is the focal length of the
                    object-lens and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> that of the eye-lens. Also the diameter
                    of the pencil of parallel rays emerging from the eye-lens is to the diameter of
                    the object-lens inversely as the magnifying power of the telescope. Hence one of
                    the best methods of determining the magnifying power of a telescope is to
                    measure the diameter of the emergent pencil of rays, after the telescope has
                    been adjusted to focus upon a star, and to divide the diameter of the
                    object-glass by the diameter of the emergent pencil. If we desire to utilize all
                    the parallel rays which fall upon an objectglass it is necessary that the full
                    pencil of emerging rays should enter the observer’s eye. Assuming with Sir
                    William Herschel that the normal pupil of the eye distends to one-fifth of an
                    inch in diameter when viewing faint objects, we obtain the rule that the minimum
                    magnifying power which can be efficiently employed is five times the diameter of
                    the object-glass expressed in inches. The defects of the Galilean and Kepler
                    telescopes are due to the chromatic and spherical aberration of the simple
                    lenses of which they are composed (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol.
                    xvii. p. 802 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> The substitution of a positive or
                    negative eye-piece for the simple convex or concave eye-lens, and of an
                    achromatic object-glass for the simple object-lens, transforms these early forms
                    into the modern achromatic telescope. The Galilean telescope with a concave
                    eye-lens instead of an eye-piece still survives as the modern opera-glass, on
                    account of its shorter length, but the object-glass and eye-lens are achromatic
                    combinations.</p>
                <p>The principles of an achromatic combination of prisms or lenses have been
                    explained in <hi rend="smallcaps">Light</hi> (vol. xiv. pp. 592, 595) and
                    further developed in <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 804 <hi
                    rend="italic">sqf.</hi> As a lens may be regarded as built up of a series of
                    thin slices of prisms, divided from each other by planes parallel to the axis of
                    the lens, it will be seen that, if a prism perfectly achromatic for rays of two
                    definite wavelengths, and approximately achromatic for all rays, can be
                    constructed by combining two prisms of different kinds of glass, all that is
                    required to produce an object-glass with similar small chromatic errors is to
                    combine a convex lens of crown glass and a concave one of flint glass as in fig.
                    3, their surfaces being of such curvatures as to form a series of imaginary
                    prisms (such as we have supposed an object-glass to consist of) through any one
                    of which all kinds of light falling on the object-glass parallel to its axis
                    will be refracted very nearly to a common focus F. Accordingly any proposed<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0151-0140"/> object-glass can be tested as regards its optical
                    conditions by “tracing a ray,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> calculating the
                    point at which, after refraction through the two lenses, the ray so traced will
                    cut their common axis. For the analytical solution of this problem it curved
                    surface, which practically is nearly spherical. But the actual differences
                    between the curves which may be required in certain conditions for producing a
                    perfect lens differ so slightly from true spherical surfaces that it is
                    impossible by any previously designed mechanical process to predict whether the
                    resulting figure will be that of a sphere or some other curve very nearly that
                    of a sphere. The mathematician, therefore, who discusses the subject is
                    compelled to adopt spherical curves as the basis of his calculation. On this
                    assumption we may then trace a ray rigidly through any supposed object-glass as
                    follows. Let A, B, A', B' be respectively the points where the refracted ray
                    produced would intersect the optical axis after refraction at the first, second,

                <p>By means of these formulae we can compute B' (the point where a ray, entering the
                    first surface of the object-glass, will intersect the optical axis) for any
                    angle of incidence <hi rend="italic">=a,</hi> when for a ray of that wave-length
                    the indexes of refraction are known for the glass of which the lenses are
                    composed, if the radii of curvature of the lenses are also known. The most
                    perfect object-glass would be one in which the value of B' is the same for two
                    rays of the two selected wave-lengths, through whatever portion of the
                    object-glass they may pass. This, however, is a condition which cannot be
                    mathematically satisfied with spherical surfaces. It is of course possible to
                    find values of the four unknown quantities r, <hi rend="italic">s, r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and s' such that four
                    conditions shall be satisfied. The ordinary approximate method is to find such
                    values of the radii that B' is the same for rays of two different wave-lengths
                    when the incident rays are near the axis, and for mean rays which enter near the
                    margin of the lens; but of course this solution is indeterminate, and only
                    becomes rigid when two radii are assumed. Thus, for any crown lens of any radii
                    of curvature it is possible to find a flint lens to satisfy these conditions.
                    The rigid solution becomes one of successive approximation to such four
                    conditions as the computer may is necessary to assume that the adjacent surfaces
                    of the supposed infinitely numerous prisms form together some continuous
                    consider most desirable. Herschel advocates satisfying the terms depending on
                    the second power of the aberration, Kliigel that the refractions of the rays
                    should be as small as possible; or we may make it a condition that the second
                    and third surfaces shall have the same radius, so that the surfaces may be
                    cemented together. The fourth condition is of course the desired focal length.
                    But for all practical purposes it is sufficient to have placed the reader in a
                    position to test the optical conditions of any combinations that may be

                    construction of object-glasses on paper is of far higher interest as a
                    mathematical exercise than as a practical matter. By a slight departure from the
                    spherical figure — a departure so minute that there are no mechanical means
                    sufficiently delicate to measure it with certainty—the optician may fail to
                    realize true spherical surfaces, and thus on the one hand miss the fine
                    definition which his calculation led him to expect, or on the other hand convert
                    an object-glass which with spherical curves would have large spherical
                    aberration into one perfectly corrected in this respect. Having, therefore, for
                    particular kinds of glass ascertained a good general form of object-glass, it
                    becomes only necessary for the optician to perform an approximate calculation of
                    the curvatures requisite to produce correction of the chromatic aberration, and
                    to trust to the process of final figuring for correction of the final spherical
                    and chromatic aberration. It fortunately happens that in the rigid equations the
                    terms which express the thickness and distance apart of the lenses involve only
                    the focal distances of central rays, and have but a small influence on the
                    ratios of the aberrations of the lenses; and, further, they affect chiefly the
                    focal length of the lens, and have a very small influence on the chromatic
                    aberration. Thus in the preliminary computation the optician may neglect the
                    thickness of the lensesand employ the simple approximate formulae given under

                    length of the combination. The focal lengths of the two lenses which secure the
                    conditions of achromatism having been thus computed, the radii of curvature may
                    be computed for either lens by the usual formula (see <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    >r</hi> to s as experience or more elaborate calculation has shown to be
                    favourable. In the form of object-glass recommended by Sir John Herschel, as
                    fulfilling the most favourable conditions for correction of a spherical
                    aberration for parallel as well as nearly parallel rays, the required curvatures
                    for the exterior surfaces of the crown and the flint lens were found to vary
                    very slightly for a considerable range of the ratio of the dispersive powers of
                    the crown and the flint glass. Assuming <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> (the mean index
                    of refraction) to be 1 ’ 542 for crown glass and V585 for flint glass, Herschel

                    of the second and third surfaces <pb break="no"

                    measured dispersive and refractive power of the glass of the lenses. (The method
                    of determining μ, &amp;c., is given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol.
                    xvii. p. 800. ) The form generally adopted (see fig. 4) in the best modern
                    object-glasses is extremely simple, viz., an equi-convex crown lens and a flint
                    lens whose first surface has the same radius of curvature as the surfaces of the
                    crown lens — this radius depending on the focal length which it is desired to
                    give to the object-glass. Since in order to fulfil the conditions of achromatism
                    the focal lengths of the two lenses have to be proportional to their dispersive
                    powers (for the rays which it is desired to unite), and as in the two
                    descriptions of glass in question the dispersion of flint glass for C to rays
                    between F and G is very nearly twice that of crown glass, the posterior surface
                    of the flint lens becomes nearly a plane. The final correction for achromatism
                    is made, if necessary, by departing slightly from a plane in the curvature of
                    the last surface of the flint lens, and the final correction for spherical
                    aberration in the figuring of the surfaces. In a lecture delivered at the Royal
                    Institution on 2d April 1886 Sir Howard Gπιbb, optician, of Dublin, said:</p>
                <p>“A truly spherical curve is the exception, not the rule, when I tell you that a
                    sensible difference in correction for spherical aberration can be made by half
                    an hour’s polishing, corresponding probably to a difference in the first place
                    of decimals in radii of the curves, you will see that it is practically not
                    necessary to enter upon any calculation for spherical aberration, we know about
                    what form gives an approximate correction; we adhere nearly to that, and the
                    rest is done by figuring of the surface. To illustrate what I mean. I would be
                    quite willing to undertake to alter the curves of the crown or flint lens of any
                    of my objectives by a very large quantity, increasing one and decreasing the
                    other so as to still satisfy the conditions of achromatism, but introducing
                    theoretically a large amount of positive or negative spherical aberration, and
                    yet to make out of the altered lens an object-glass perfectly corrected for
                    spherical aberration. . . . I may remark that it is sometimes possible to make a
                    better objective by deviating from the curves which give a true correction for
                    spherical aberration, and correcting that aberration by figuring, rather than by
                    strictly adhering to the theoretical curves.”</p>
                <p>When an object-glass is designed for use as an ordinary telescope it is usual to
                    select for the rays of different colour to be united those near C and those
                    between F and G, since rays of lower and higher refrangibility produce a
                    comparatively faint impression on the sense of sight. In such a telescope of any
                    considerable aperture the image of a bright star at focus is surrounded by a
                    halo of bluish or violetcoloured light,—a defect which is unavoidable in an
                    object-glass composed of a crown and flint lens on account of the irrationality
                    of their spectra <hi rend="smallcaps">(Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 592). There
                    seems to be no doubt that different eyes are differently impressed by rays of
                    different wave-length.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See Abney and Festing, Bakerian Lecture, <hi rend="italic">Phil.

                    chromatic corrections of the same object-glass: the observer whose eye is
                    abnormally sensitive to violet light will pronounce the chromatic aberration
                    overcorrected in an object-glass which another will consider perfect in this
                    respect, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Probably it is partly owing to
                    this cause that the object-glasses of different makers show systematic
                    differences in their colour correction. An exceedingly sensitive method of
                    testing this correction devised by Professor Stokes is given under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> vol. xvii. p. 804. Another method, due to
                    Professor Harkness and first carried out by Dr Vogel, is the following. Place
                    behind the eye-piece a direct vision prism (c/'. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Optics,</hi> p. 801). The image of a star in the field will then be converted
                    into a narrow spectrum, which, if there were no chromatic aberration, would when
                    focused be represented by a faint coloured straight line, uniformly sharp and
                    narrow. But in an ordinary object-glass only two points in the spectrum can be
                    perfectly focused simultaneously; therefore all its other parts are spread out,
                    forming a coloured band of variable breadth. If we focus on the brightest part
                    of the spectrum, both its extreme ends become spread out into a more or less
                    trumpetshaped form, enabling the observer to note the range of the spectrum over
                    which precise definition can be expected. The amount of this extension w ill
                    depend in some degree on the form of the object-glass, but much more (if the
                    achromatism is fairly well corrected) on the irrationality of the spectra of the
                    glass of which the lenses are composed. If we then focus, for example, on the C
                    line, we shall have the band of light contracted at C and at another point
                    (probably between F and G), widening to a slightly trumpet-shaped form below C,
                    and markedly so above G. This second point of greatest contraction gives the
                    wave-length of the ray which has the same focus as C. If the telescope has a
                    focusing scale, we can also measure directly in this way the change of focus for
                    rays of different colours. The chromatic aberration will be best corrected for
                    the rays of minimum focus, and this minimum focus should for an ordinary
                    telescope correspond with the brightest part of the spectrum, viz., with rays
                    between D and E. A comparison of the chromatic correction of object-glasses by

                <p>Fig. 5, taken from the above-quoted paper, affords most interesting information
                    as to the colour-correction of these three typical object-glasses. The curves of
                    the diagram show the variation of the focal point for rays of different
                    wave-lengths in the case of each object-glass. It will be seen that Fraunhofer
                    has united the rays about C with those of wave-length 525 millionths
                    millimètres, Grubb with those about wave-length 494, and Schroder about
                    wavelength 463. The object-glasses of Grubb and Schroder are com posed of modern
                    glass, which is comparatively colourless, whilst Fraunhofer’s glass is decidedly
                    green in colour. The minimum focus in Fraunhofer’s telescope is placed near D
                    (rather at wave-length 585), because the absorption of the blue and violet rays
                    of the spectrum by the flint lens renders the brightest part of the spectrum
                    less blue than in an objective composed of modern glass by Chance or Feil, which
                    is nearly colourless. This circumstance enabled Fraunhofer to apply a very large
                    over-correction for colour,—that is, to unite as perfectly as possible the red
                    and central part of the spectrum, and to leave the outstanding violet rays to be
                    in great part absorbed by the colour of the glass. The colour-corrections in the
                    object-glasses of Grubb and Schröder are very different in character. In Gnibb’s
                    object-glass the minimum focus is for rays of wave-length about 545, that of
                    Schroder’s is about wave-length 533, which appears to prove that Grubb’s eye is
                    more sensitive to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n153/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0153-0142"/> red and Schroder’s to blue light. Also Grubb’s
                    object-glass unites the red rays very closely with the brightest part of the
                    spectrum, and leaves the blue and violet rays outstanding. Schroder, on the
                    other hand, leaves the red rays outstanding in order to unite the rays between D
                    and F more closely. The conclusion is that to Grubb’s eye the red rays would be
                    obtrusively prominent in Schroder’s telescope, and that he would pronounce the
                    object-glass under-corrected; whilst Schroder’s eye would find the outstanding
                    violet rays too prominent in Grubb’s telescope, and pronounce it over-corrected.
                    The absolute amount of light in the secondary spectrum in viewing the same
                    object depends, <hi rend="italic">caeteris paribus,</hi> upon the square of the
                    aperture; therefore telescopes of large aperture have to be made of greater
                    proportional focal length than those of small aperture, in order to diminish the
                    secondary spectrum. Figs, α, <hi rend="italic">β, y, δ</hi> in the diagram give
                    the form of the spectrum of a star in Schroder’s telescope for various
                    adjustments of the focus; figs, α' and γ' give the corresponding forms for
                    Fraunhofer’s telescope. Fig. α represents the eye-piece focused for the
                    brightest part of the spectrum; fig. <hi rend="italic">β</hi> when the red rays
                    and those near Hα are simultaneously focused; fig. <hi rend="italic">y</hi> when
                    the extreme red rays are in focus, the corresponding focus being a little below
                    Hγ; fig. δ when focused on Hγ.</p>
                <p>When a telescope is to be constructed for photographic purposes the aim should be
                    to unite, as perfectly as possible, the rays near that portion of the spectrum
                    which act most powerfully on the photographic plate to be employed. This latter
                    point has been determined for the various photographic processes by Captain
                    Abney.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Proc. <hi
                    rend="italic">Roy. Soc.,</hi> vol. xxxiii. pp. 164-186.</p></note> The results
                    are shown graphically in fig. 6 for the processes practi cally employed at
                    present in astronomical photography.</p>
                <p>To unite the rays near G or H the angle of the flint prism must be diminished;
                    that is, the focal length of the flint lens must be lengthened as compared -with
                    that of an object-glass of similar construction suited for eye observations; and
                    the rays of greatest photographic action can be united more perfectly than the
                    visible rays.</p>
                <p>If an object-glass is composed of three lenses of different kinds of glass it is
                    theoretically possible to unite three instead of two points of the spectrum,
                    besides improving the correction for spherical aberration. The most important
                    practical applications of such a system have been—(1) the triple object-glass of
                    John Dollond; (2) the application of a convex crown glass in front of an
                    ordinary object-glass in order to alter its chromatic correction from that best
                    suited for eye observations to that best suited for photographic observation.
                    John Dollond’s object-glass is generally described as a concave flint lens
                    between two crown lenses. If the crown lenses are of similar glass, there is no
                    gain as to the correction of the secondary spectrum; it becomes only possible to
                    correct the spherical aberration more perfectly. Very few telescopes with triple
                    object-glasses have been made since the days of John Dollond. But the great and
                    detrimental obtrusiveness of the secondary spectrum in the large object-glasses
                    of the present day can be diminished in no other way, unless very extreme focal
                    lengths are adopted, or some new kinds of glass that can be produced in large
                    disks are discovered, in which the irrationality of their spectra is less, and
                    in which also there is the necessary difference in the relation between
                    refractive index and dispersive power. The cost of a triple object-glass would
                    of course be at least 50 per cent, greater than that of a double object-glass;
                    but, on the other hand, the extreme focal length necessary for large
                    object-glasses might be considerably reduced. Thus the cost saved by a less
                    heavy mounting and a smaller observatory and dome might counterbalance to some
                    extent, if not entirely, the additional cost of the triple objectglass. Dr
                    Schroder has constructed for the present writer an exquisite triple object-glass
                    (three different kinds of glass) of 3⅛-inches aperture and only 18-inches focal
                    length. Its performance with its highest eye-piece of ⅛-inch focus (power 72) is
                    most admirable. It would probably be impossible to construct large telescopes
                    approaching such short focal length, but there is no doubt that a large triple
                    object-glass of 10 or 12 apertures focus would have an enormous advantage in
                    colour correction, and probably in spherical aberration, over a double
                    object-glass of the same aperture and much greater focal length. One peculiarity
                    of such a triple object-glass is that three points in the spectrum can have the
                    same focus, and therefore the point of minimum focus may for the best chromatic
                    adjustment not quite correspond with the focal point for the brightest part of
                    the spectrum; but, obviously, the rays of the whole visible spectrum may thus be
                    brought to intersect the axis much more nearly at the same point. There will
                    probably be a far wider adoption of the triple object-glass in the future,
                    especially as the greater intrinsic brilliancy of the image in shortfocus
                    telescopes is a matter of high importance in the spectroscopic and photographic
                    processes of modern astronomy. On the subject of triple object-glasses the
                    reader is referred to an admirable paper by Professor C. S. Hastings <hi

                <p>Prof. Hastings’s first condition in these computations is that the radius of
                    curvature of none of the surfaces shall exceed one-fifteenth of the focal
                    length. He also neglects the thickness and distance apart of the lenses, since
                    these affect chiefly the focal length, but do not very materially affect the
                    difference of the foci for different rays. The expression for the focal length F

                <p>8’47026 7∙20827 -8’35472; the curvatures are therefore very moderate and
                    perfectly practicable. The constants for the glass of the first and second
                    lenses have been determined by the author with great accuracy (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Amer. Jour.,</hi> vol. XV. p. 273). The third glass is
                    Fraunhofer’s flint 13 (Hastings c, misprinted <hi rend="italic">ν</hi> in his
                    table, in <hi rend="italic">Amer. Jour.,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 131), for which the

                    be, we have the means of making an object-glass very superior to any in
                    existence and equally available for eye and photographic observation. Such an
                    object-glass could be made of much shorter proportional focus than is usual or
                    possible in double object-glasses, not only because of the absence of secondary
                    spectrum but also from the command afforded over the spherical aberration <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n154/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0154-0143"/> by six surfaces. After satisfying the conditions
                    of focal length, the first power of the spherical aberration, and two conditions
                    of achromatism, we have still two available arbitrary conditions, which may be

                    the case in point, the whole may constitute a cemented lens; thus the loss of
                    light at the interior surfaces may be eliminated, and the final perfecting of
                    the spherical aberration be left to the figuring of the surfaces.</p>
                <p>In some recent large double object-glasses, especially those of Alvan Clark, it
                    has been usual to leave a space between the crown and the flint lens sufficient
                    to afford access, through apertures in the cell, for cleaning the inner crown
                    and flint surfaces, without risk of disturbing the lenses and their
                    centring.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    arrangement also helps to equalize the temperatures of the lenses with each
                    other and with the outer air.</p></note> If in fig. 3 we imagine the lenses to
                    be considerably separated and through both lenses trace a ray entering the crown
                    lens parallel to and at some distance from the axis, we shall find that the
                    effect of the separation is to diminish the power of the flint lens, and
                    therefore to change the character of the chromatic aberration. Thus an
                    objectglass over-corrected for colour can be improved in this respect by
                    increasing the distance between the lenses. It has been suggested that a
                    telescope can be made suitable for both eye observation and photographic
                    purposes if means are provided for increasing the distance between the lenses
                    without risk of deranging the centring when the telescope is to be employed for
                    photography. But the great change that would be necessary in such a case cannot
                    be brought about consistently with preservation of the perfection of the
                    corrections for spherical aberration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Any account of the achromatic object-glass would be incomplete without reference
                    to the labours of the Rev. W. Vernon Harcourt and Prof. Stokes. Experiments in
                    the production of optical glass were instituted by the former in 1834; and
                    specimens, exhibited at the meeting of the British Association at Cambridge in
                    1862, were placed in the hands of Prof. Stokes, who determined the optical
                    constants of the numerous specimens of glass which Harcourt produced, and
                    indicated from these results the direction in which fresh experiments should be
                    undertaken. It was discovered that titanic acid extends the blue end of the
                    spectrum more than corresponds to the dispersive power of the glass, whilst
                    boracic acid has the opposite effect <hi rend="italic">(Report Brit.
                    Assoc.,</hi> 1871, p. 38). At a meeting of the British Association at Belfast in
                    1874 a telescope was exhibited whose object-glass was constructed from
                    Harcourt’s glass by Sir Howard Gπιbb of Dublin. The following is Prof. Stokes’s
                    complete and concise account of it.</p>
                <p>“The original intention was to construct the objective of a phosphatic glass
                    containing a suitable percentage of titanic acid, achromatized by a glass of
                    terborate of lead. (The percentage of titanic acid was so chosen that there
                    should be no irrationality of dispersion between the titanic glass and the
                    terborate.) As the curvature of the convex lens would be rather severe if the
                    whole convex power were thrown into a single lens, it was intended to use two
                    lenses of this glass, one in front and one behind, with the concave terborate of
                    lead placed between them. It was found that, provided not more than about
                    one-third of the convex power were thrown behind, the adjacent surfaces might be
                    made to fit, consistently with the condition of destroying the spherical as well
                    as the chromatic aberration. This would render it possible to cement the
                    glasses, and thereby protect the terborate, which was rather liable to tarnish.
                    At the time of Mr Harcourt’s death two disks of the titanic glass had been
                    prepared which it was hoped would be good enough for employment, as also two
                    disks of terborate. These were placed in Mr Grubb's hands. On polishing, one of
                    the titanic disks was found to be too badly striated to be employed; the other
                    was pretty fair. As it would have required a rather severe curvature of the
                    first surface and an unusual convexity of the last to throw the whole convex
                    power into the first lens, using a mere shell of glass to protect the terborate,
                    Professor Stokes thought it more prudent to throw about one-sixth of the whole
                    convex power into the third or crown glass lens, though at the sacrifice of an
                    <hi rend="italic">absolute</hi> destruction of secondary dispersion, which by
                    this change from the original design might be expected to be just barely
                    perceptible. Of the terborate disks, the less striated happened to be slightly
                    muddy, from some accident in the preparation; but, as this signified less than
                    the striee, Mr Grubb deemed it better to employ this disk. The telescope
                    exhibited to the meeting was of about 2J-inches aperture and 28-inches focal
                    length, and was provided with an object-glass of the ordinary kind, by which the
                    other could be replaced, for contrasting the performance, when the telescope was
                    turned on to a chimney seen against the sky or other suitable object, and half
                    the object-glass covered by a screen with its edge parallel to the edges of the
                    object, in the case of the ordinary objective vivid green and purple were seen
                    about the two edges, whereas with the Harcourt objective there was barely any
                    perceptible colour. It was not of course to be expected that the performance of
                    the telescope should be good, on account of the difficulty of preparing glass
                    free from striae, but it was quite sufficient to show the possibility of
                    destroying the secondary colour.”</p>
                <p>An experiment to determine whether the substitution of titanic acid for a portion
                    of the silica in ordinary crown glass would have an effect similar to that which
                    had been observed in the phosphatic series of glasses (viz., whilst somewhat
                    raising the dispersive power, to produce a separation of the colours at the blue
                    as compared with the red end of the spectrum, to an extent ordinarily belonging
                    only to glass of much higher dispersive power) was carried out by Mr Hopkinson
                    at the glass works of Messrs Chance of Birmingham; but it proved unfortunately
                    in this combination that, whilst the dispersive power was increased, as in the
                    phosphatic glasses, the blue end of the spectrum, as compared with the red end,
                    was not spread out more than in ordinary glass of like dispersive power <hi
                    rend="italic">(Report Brit. Assoc.,</hi> 1875, p. 26). It is to be hoped,
                    however, that makers of optical glass will not relax their efforts till
                    astronomers shall be able to obtain refracting telescopes in which the secondary
                    spectrum is nearly if not quite eliminated. Abbe’s new optical glass<note

                    believe that this hope will soon be realized.</p>
                <p>The addition of a convex crown lens in front of the ordinary object-glass, to
                    diminish the colour - correction and change the minimum focus from that for rays
                    between D and E to that for rays near G, was first made by Rutherford of New
                    York. In this way he altered his telescope from one suited for eye observations
                    to one in the best chromatic adjustment for photographic work. The chromatic
                    effect is the same as increasing the convexity of the crown lens, and by proper
                    proportioning of the two radii of curvature it becomes possible also to
                    conserve, and even to further perfect, the destruction of spherical aberration.
                    The great objectglass of 36-inches aperture, now (1887) under construction for
                    the Lick observatory by Messrs Clarke of Boston (Mass. ), is to be provided with
                    an additional crown lens for this purpose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The problem of making a perfectly achromatic object-glass has been solved by Dr
                    Blair <hi rend="italic">(Edin. Trans.,</hi> vol. iii. p. 53) by employing fluid
                    media, and he actually constructed an object-glass consisting of a plano-convex
                    lens and a meniscus lens, both of crown glass with their convexities turned
                    towards each other, the space between the lenses being filled with hydrochloric
                    acid. Unfortunately such combinations are practically useless, not only on
                    account of unavoidable leakage, but also because currents are set up in fluid
                    lenses by changes of temperature, which correspond in effect with want of
                    homogeneity in the flint lens in an ordinary object-glass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eye-Pieces.</hi></p>
                <p>The first substitute for the single lens of the Galilean and Kepler telescopes
                    was the compound eye-piece invented by Rheita. Behind the convex eye-lens of the
                    Kepler telescope he applied a second short telescope, consisting of two convex
                    lenses, their distance being the sum of their focal lengths. The principal
                    effect was to erect the inverted image, and thus to constitute the simplest form
                    of the day eye-piece, or common terrestrial telescope. The next improvement was
                    the Huygenian eye-piece, which consists of two convex lenses (see fig. 7),—the
                    “field-lens,” that next the object-glass, having its focal length to that of the
                    “eye-lens” as 3 to 1; the distance between them is twice the focal length of the
                    latter, the combination being so placed as to form the visible image half-way
                    between the two. This eye-piece is achromatic in the sense in which an eye-piece
                    is said to be so: a colourless image seen through it does not appear bordered
                    with coloured fringes, as is the case with a single lens or Rheita’s eye-piece.
                    This is not because, as in the achromatic object-glass, all the central coloured
                    rays are collected in one focus, which in the case of an eye-piece is a matter
                    of comparatively small consequence, but because it possesses the same magnifying
                    power for rays of all colours on an object of sensible angular diameter, so as
                    not to form overlapping coloured pictures of it on the retina. This condition it
                    is which furnishes the “equation of achromaticity” of an eye-piece. An
                    expression for the magnifying power of a telescope provided with a certain
                    eye-piece is formed in general terms which involve the focal length of its
                    lenses, their distances from each other, and their refractive indexes; and, this
                    being made to vary by the variation of the last-mentioned elements only, the
                    variation is equated to zero. The algebraic working, which even for a two-glass
                    eye-piece is a little complex, is given in H. Lloyd’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise
                    on Light and Vision</hi> (London, 1831), and in an elaborate paper by Littτow in
                    the fourth volume of the <hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Astron. Soc.</hi> (p.
                    599). From the former we extract the following proposition: An eye-glass of two
                    lenses of the same medium is achromatic when the interval between the lenses is
                    an arithmetical mean between their focal length,—a condition which the Huygenian
                    construction evidently satisfies. The rationale of this is obvious,
                    independently of algebraic analysis, by inspection of the course of the rays in
                    fig. 7, where AC, BD are the lenses, PQ the image which would be formed by the
                    object-glass alone, <hi rend="italic">pq</hi> that really formed by the action
                    of the field-glass. The object-glass being supposed achromatic, a ray of white
                    light, as OC, going to form the image of a point Q, will be refracted by the
                    field-glass at C towards the corresponding point <hi rend="italic">q</hi> of the
                    new image, but not as a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0155-0144"/> single white ray; it will be separated into
                    coloured rays, following diderent courses. The red ray Cr being less refracted
                    will fall on a point <hi rend="italic">r</hi> of the eye-glass more remote from
                    its centre B than the violet ray <hi rend="italic">Cv,</hi> and (the
                    prismaticity of the lens increasing from the centre outwards) will in proportion
                    by the second transmission be more bent aside than the violet, and thus a
                    compensation is effected, and the two rays finally emerge parallel, their exact
                    parallelism being secured by the proportion of their focal lengths. The
                    Huygenian eye-piece possesses also other important advantages. The total
                    deflexion of the light, to produce the magnifying power, is equally divided
                    between the two glasses,—the most favourable condition for diminishing that
                    distortion which is always perceived in looking obliquely through a lens; and
                    the field of view is greatly enlarged in proportion to the size of the eye-lens,
                    being such as would require, to produce the same magnifying power, a single lens
                    of the much greater semi-diameter <hi rend="italic">bd,</hi> found by drawing
                    QZ&gt; parallel to çB and erecting <hi rend="italic">bd.</hi> The inconvenience
                    of this eye-piece (whence it is improperly termed a negative eye-piece) is that
                    the image, being formed between its lenses, undergoes a certain amount of
                    distortion by the field-glass, owing to which equal linear portions of it do not
                    correspond precisely to equal angular measures of the distant object. Equal
                    parts of a micrometer applied at the place of the image, so as to be seen at the
                    same time through the eye-lens, will not correspond to precisely equal angular
                    intervals. The common astronomical or positive eye-piece, described by Ramsden
                    <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trails.,</hi> 1783), consists of two plano-convex
                    lenses of equal lengths, having their convexities turned towards each other and
                    separated by two-thirds of the focal length of either, as in fig. 8. This
                    combination is placed behind the image PQ formed by the object-glass, at a
                    distance AP equal to one-fourth of the focal length of A. The first or
                    field-glass, therefore, forms an enlarged image <hi rend="italic">pq,</hi> at a
                    distance one-third of that focal length which places it in the focus of the
                    eye-glass. This eye-piece is not properly achromatic, but its spherical
                    aberration is much less than in any of the other constructions, and it has the
                    advantage of giving a flat field of view, requiring no change of focus to see
                    the centre and borders of the field with equal distinctness. The erecting or
                    terrestrial eye-piece was invented by Dollond. The principle of its construction
                    will be understood from fig. 9. It is convenient for telescopes of ordinary use,
                    because it presents a non-inverted image to the eye, although at some sacrifice
                    of light and definition.</p>
                <p>For an account of the theory of the chromatic and spherical aberration of
                    eye-pieces by Sir George B. Airy, see <hi rend="italic">Trans. PhU. Soc.
                    Camb.,</hi> vol. ii. p. 243 and vol. iii. p. 61. The author’s conclusions are
                    the following. (1) To secure the greatest distinctness with an eye-piece of the
                    Huygenian type, the field-lens should be a meniscus of focal length 3, the radii
                    of its surfaces 11:4, and its convexity towards the object-glass; the eye-lens
                    should be a double convex of focal length 1, the radii of its surfaces 1 :6, and
                    its more convex side towards the field-lens. The distance of the lenses should
                    be 2. There should be a perforated diaphragm at distance 1 from the eye-lens. If
                    a bright object appears yellow or a dark one blue at the edge farthest from the
                    centre of the field, the lenses must be brought a little nearer together. (2)
                    For an eyepiece of Ramsden’s type the two lenses should be plano-convex, of
                    focal length 3, placed at distance 2, their convex surfaces being turned towards
                    each other. (3) For an erecting eye-piece of four lenses the first and fourth
                    (reckoned from the object-glass towards the eye) should be crossed lenses of
                    focal length 3, the radii of their surfaces 1: 6, with their convex surfaces
                    towards each other. The second lens should be a meniscus of focal length 4, the
                    radii of its surfaces 25:11, and its convexity towards the eye. The third lens
                    should be plano-convex, of focal length 4, its plane side towards the eye. The
                    distance of the centre of the second lens from that of the first=4; that of the
                    third from the second=6; and that of the fourth from the third = 5 <hi

                    blue at the edge farthest from the centre of the field, the third and fourth
                    lenses must be together pushed inwards towards the second lens.</p>
                <p>In many telescopes constructed specially for star observation only the
                    object-glass is over-corrected for colour and under-corrected for spherical
                    aberration; both these errors may sometimes be nearly eliminated by a properly
                    constructed Huygenian eye-piece (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Microscope,</hi> vol.
                    xvi. pp. 266-267). But, when a telescope is to be used over a considerable range
                    of field for micrometric measurements, it is obvious that the spherical
                    aberration should be corrected by the object-glass alone. It is possible,
                    however, to improve the appearance of objects somewhat in a telescope in which
                    the chromatic aberration is over - corrected by employing an eye-piece somewhat
                    under-corrected for colour, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa</hi>; but the only
                    satisfactory plan is to have both object-glass and eye-piece as free as possible
                    from both chromatic and spherical aberration. In order to secure this, or a very
                    large field of view, many forms of eye-piece have been devised. Achromatic
                    combinations have been substituted in some cases for the field-lens, in others
                    for the eye-lens, in others for both simple lenses of the Ramsden eye-piece. The
                    best of these combinations which the present writer has tested and which
                    practically fulfil all requirements of the astronomer are due to Dr Hugo
                    Schroder, to whom he is indebted for information as to their construction. Fig.
                    10 represents Schroder’s high power eye-piece, which is admirably suited for
                    micrometer work, not only because there are only two reflecting surfaces in the
                    triple lens of which it is composed, but also because there is a comparatively
                    large distance between the lens and the micrometer web when the latter is in
                    focus. This condition is essential when it is desired to get the best bright
                    illumination of the wires in a dark field (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 248). The triple lens is composed of a dense
                    fluid plano-convex lens between two lenses of soft crown glass. The radii of
                    curvature are—</p>

                <p>The following are the various forms of reflecting telescopes. The Gregorian
                    telescope is represented in fig. 12. AA and BB are concave mirrors having a
                    common axis and their concavities facing each other. The focus of A for parallel
                    rays is at F, that of B for parallel rays at <hi rend="italic">f—</hi> between B
                    and F. Parallel rays falling on AA converge at F, where an image is formed; the
                    rays are then reflected from B and converge at P, where a second and more
                    enlarged image is formed. Gregory himself showed that, if the large mirror were
                    a segment of a paraboloid of revolution whose focus is F, and the small mirror
                    an ellipsoid of revolution whose foci are F and P respectively, the resulting
                    image will be plane and undistorted. The image formed at P is viewed through the
                    eye-piece at E, which may be of the Huygenian or Ramsden type. The focal
                    adjustment is accomplished by the screw S, which acts on a slide carrying an arm
                    to which the mirror B is attached. The practical difficulty of constructing
                    Gregorian telescopes of good defining quality is very considerable, because if
                    spherical mirrors are employed their aberrations tend to increase each other,
                    and it is extremely difficult to give a true elliptic figure to the necessarily
                    deep concavity of the small speculum. Short appears to have systematically
                    conquered this difficulty, and his Gregorian telescopes attained great
                    celebrity. The use of the Gregorian form is, however, practically abandoned in
                    the present day. The magnifying power of the</p>
                <p>F+∕</p>
                <p>telescope is=-—- <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi>, where F and /are respectively the
                    focal lengths of the large and the small mirror, <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the
                    focal length of the eye-piece, and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> the distance between
                    the principal foci of the two mirrors ( = F∕ in the diagram) when the instrument
                    is in adjustment for viewing distant objects. The images are erect.</p>
                <p>The Cassegrain telescope differs from the Gregorian only in the substitution of a
                    convex hyperbolic mirror for a concave elliptical , mirror as the small
                    speculum. This form has two distinct advantages: (1) if spherical mirrors are
                    employed their aberrations have a tendency to correct each other; (2) the
                    instrument is shorter than the Gregorian, <hi rend="italic">caeteris
                    paribus,</hi> by twice the focal length of the small mirror. Fewer telescopes
                    have been made of this than perhaps of any other form of reflector; but in
                    comparatively recent years the Cassegrain has acquired importance from the fact
                    of its adoption for the great Melbourne telescope. The magnifying power is
                    computed by the same formula as in the case of the Gregorian telescope.</p>
                <p>The Newtonian telescope is represented in fig. 13. A A is a concave mirror whose
                    axis is <hi rend="italic">aa.</hi> Parallel rays falling on AA converge on the
                    plane mirror BB, and are thence reflected at right angles to the axis, forming
                    an image in the focus of the eye-piece E.</p>
                <p>The surface <hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> of the large mirror should be a

                <p>The magnifying power <hi rend="italic">∖s=F∣e,</hi> This form is employed in the
                    construction of most modern reflecting telescopes. A glass prism of total
                    reflexion is sometimes substituted for the plane mirror.</p>
                <p>The Herschelian or front view reflector is represented in fig. 14. AA is a
                    concave parabolic mirror, whose axis <hi rend="italic">ac</hi> is inclined to
                    the axis of the tube <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> so that the image of an object in
                    the focus of the mirror may be viewed by an eye-piece at E, the angle <hi
                    rend="italic">bac</hi> being equal to the angle <hi rend="italic">caE.</hi> This
                    form was adopted by the elder</p>
                <p>Herschel to avoid the loss of light from reflexion in the small mirror of the
                    Newtonian telescope. It has several disadvantages. (1) The upper part of the
                    observer’s head must necessarily obstruct some of the rays which would otherwise
                    fall on the large mirror; but when a telescope of very large aperture is
                    employed the loss of light thus occasioned is comparatively insignificant.
                    Moreover, disturbance of the air in front of the telescope is created by heat
                    from the observer’s head and body, and this is fatal to the best definition. To
                    avoid the latter drawback Sir John Herschel <hi rend="italic">(Bncy. Brit.,</hi>
                    8th ed., art. “Telescope,” vol. xxi. p. 128) suggested the employment of a small
                    right-angled prism of total reflexion placed close to the eyelens of the
                    eye-piece, to permit the observer to view the image by looking in a direction at
                    right angles to the eye-piece, and therefore at right angles to the tube. (2) In
                    consequence of the tilting of the mirror aberration is created, and this
                    increases rapidly with increased tilting. The construction is thus limited to
                    telescopes in which the proportion of aperture to focal length is not too great.
                    In Herschel’s 40-feet telescope the proportion was 1 to 10, and the construction
                    would hardly be applicable to modern telescopes, in which the proportion often
                    rises to 1 to 5 or 6. Yet, when exceedingly faint objects have to be observed,
                    this form of telescope has great advantages. Herschel found that some objects
                    which he discovered with such an instrument could not even be seen when the same
                    telescope was used in the Newtonian form. The front view telescope, however, has
                    hardly been at all employed except by the Herschels. But at the same time none
                    but the Herschels have swept the whole sky for the discovery of faint nebulae;
                    and probably no other astronomers have worked for so many hours on end for so
                    many nights as they did, and they emphasize the easy position of the observer in
                    using this form of instrument.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Construction of Object-Glasses.</hi></p>
                <p>The first point is the selection of glass disks of suitable quality. The
                    requisites are (1) general transparency and freedom from mechanical defects,
                    such as specks, air-bubbles, &amp;c.; (2) homogeneity; (3) freedom from internal
                    strain. The disk being roughly polished on the sides, faults of the first class
                    are easily detected by inspection. In order to secure the maximum of light grasp
                    for aperture it is desirable that the glass should be as colourless as possible;
                    if the roughly polished disk is laid upon white paper the amount of
                    discoloration can be readily estimated by comparing the colour of the sheet as
                    seen directly with that seen through the glass. Fraunhofer’s glass was far from
                    colourless, Dollond’s more coloured still; and we have shown that, for purposes
                    w hen extreme light grasp is not an object, the less transparency of such glass
                    to the blue rays of the spectrum affords advantages for a better correction of
                    the chromatic aberration of rays in the brighter part of the spectrum. The
                    amount of light excluded by specks, air-bubbles, or even scratches is quite
                    insignificant; but these blemishes create diffraction phenomena and scattered
                    light in the field, which are very injurious to the performance of the
                    instrument, especially when faint objects are searched for in the neighbourhood
                    of brighter ones. It is essential for a telescope lens that the glass should be
                    perfectly homogeneous; that is, the refractive index must be identical for every
                    part of the disk. This can be tested with extreme delicacy by grinding the disk
                    into the form of a lens and testing it by Töppler’s method,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Poaa. Annal.,</hi> cxxxi.,
                    1867.</p></note> described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics</hi> (vol. xvii. p.
                    805). If the disk is intended for a concave lens and is already so thin that it
                    becomes undesirable to make it thinner at the edges by converting it, in the
                    first place, into a convex lens, it may be tested by placing one of its surfaces
                    in contact with and at right angles to the axis of a crown lens of known
                    perfection, and testing the combination by Töppler’s method. If a glass disk is
                    not properly annealed—that is, if it has been too quickly cooled, so that the
                    outer shell has hardened before the inner portion—the finally solidified mass
                    must be in a state of tension, like that of “Rupert’s drops.” Unless cooled very
                    gradually an optical disk would fly to pieces, but a very much smaller defect in
                    the annealing process would be fatal for refined optical purposes. Changes of
                    temperature would produce changes of curvature, and the lens would also change
                    its form when successive portions of the strained outer shell were removed in
                    the process of grinding and polishing. Fortunately <pb break="no"

                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 613) are visible the disk is unfit
                    for use; but, since few disks are so perfectly annealed as not to show a trace
                    of the black cross, such as show it in no marked degree may be safely employed.
                    Perfect annealing has now become the most difficult portion of the art of making
                    optical glass, and large disks (more particularly of crown glass) are rejected
                    by the optician more frequently for defects in annealing than for any other
                    cause.</p>
                <p>The disks having been selected, their refractive and dispersive powers
                    determined, ami the radii of curvature computed, it remains to convert the disks
                    into lenses with surfaces of the required curvature, and to complete the
                    object-glass. The work consists of five distinct operations—(1) rough grinding
                    by a revolving tool supplied with sand and water; (2) fine grinding with emery;
                    (3) polishing with oxide of iron, rouge, or putty powder, the grinder being
                    faced with fine cloth, satin, paper, or—best of all—pitch; (4) centring; (5)
                    figuring and testing. These processes are essentially of a technical character,
                    and can only be familiar to those who practise the art. The details would be out
                    of place here, but are well described in a lecture delivered by Sir Howard Grubb
                    at the Royal Institution, 6th April 1886, and printed in Wαiure, 27th May
                    1886.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Construction of Specula.</hi></p>
                <p>The composition of metallic specula in the present day differs very little from
                    that used by Sir Isaac Newton. Many different alloys have been suggested, some
                    including silver, nickel, zinc, or arsenic; but that which has practically been
                    found best is an alloy of four equivalents of copper to one of tin, or the
                    following proportions by weight :—copper 252, tin 117 '8. Such speculum metal is
                    exceedingly hard and brittle, takes a fine white polish, and when protected from
                    damp has little liability to tarnish. The process of casting and annealing, in
                    the case of the specula of the great Melbourne telescope, was admirably
                    described by Dr Robinson in <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1869, vol.
                    clix. p. 135. Shaping, polishing, and figuring of specula are accomplished by
                    methods and tools precisely similar to those employed in the construction of
                    lenses. The reflecting surface is first ground to a spherical form, the
                    parabolic figure being given in the final process by regulating the size of the
                    pitch squares and the stroke of the polishing machine. The process of testing is
                    identical with that of an object-glass.</p>
                <p>• Soon after Liebig’s discovery of a process for depositing a film of pure
                    metallic silver upon glass from a salt of silver in solution, Steinheil <hi
                    rend="italic">{Gaz. Univ, cl’Augsburg,</hi> 24th March 1856), and later,
                    independently, Foucault <hi rend="italic">{Comptes Rendus,</hi> vol. xliv.,
                    February 1857), proposed to employ glass for the specula of telescopes, the
                    reflecting surface of the glass speculum to be covered with silver by Liebig’s
                    process. These silver-on-glass specula are now the rivals of the achromatic
                    telescope, and it is not probable that many telescopes with metal specula will
                    be made in the future. The best speculum metal and the greatest care are no
                    guarantee of freedom from tarnish, and, if such a mirror is much exposed, as it
                    must be in the hands of an active observer, frequent repolishing will be
                    necessary. This involves refiguring, which is the most delicate and costly
                    process of all. Every time, therefore, that a speculum is repolished, the future
                    quality of the instrument is at stake; its focal length will probably be
                    altered, and thus the value of the constants of the micrometer also have to be
                    redetermined. Partly for these reasons the reflecting telescope with metallic
                    mirror has never been a favourite with the professional astronomer, and has
                    found little employment out of England. In England, in the hands of the
                    Herschels, Rosse, Lassell, and De la Rue it has done splendid service, but in
                    all these cases the astronomer and the instrument-maker were one. The
                    silver-on-glass mirror has the enormous advantage that it can be resilvered with
                    little trouble, at small expense, and without danger of changing the figure. Its
                    chief work has been done in the hands of Draper and Common, who were the
                    engineers, if not the actual constructors, of their own instruments. Glass is
                    lighter, stiffer, less costly, and easier to work than speculum metal. The
                    silvered mirrors have also some advantage in light grasp over those of speculum
                    metal, though, aperture for aperture, the former are inferior to the modem
                    object-glass. Comparisons of light grasp derived from small, fresh, carefully
                    silvered sm ’ faces are sometimes given which lead to illusory results, and from
                    such experiments Foucault claimed superiority for the silvered speculum over the
                    object-glass. But the present writer lias found from experience and careful
                    comparison that a silvered mirror of. 12-inches aperture mounted as a Newtonian
                    telescope (with a silvered plane for the small mirror), when the surfaces are in
                    fair average condition, is equal in light grasp to a first-rate refractor of
                    10-inches aperture, or area for area as 2: 3. This ratio will become more equal
                    for larger sizes on account of the additional thickness of larger object-glasses
                    and the consequent additional absorption of light in transmission.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mounting of Telescopes.</hi></p>
                <p>The proper mounting of a telescope is hardly of less importance than its optical
                    perfection. Freedom from tremor, ease and delicacy of movement, facility of
                    directing the instrument to any desired point in the heavens, are the primary
                    qualifications. Our limits forbid an historical account of the earlier
                    endeavours to fulfil these ends by means of motions in altitude and azimuth, nor
                    can we do more than refer to mountings such as those employed by the Herschels,
                    or those designed by Lord Rosse to overcome the engineering difficulties of
                    mounting his huge telescope of 6 feet aperture. Both are abundantly illustrated
                    in most popular works on astronomy, and it seems sufficient to refer the reader
                    to the original descriptions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We pass, therefore, directly to the equatorial telescope, the instrument <hi
                    rend="italic">par excellence</hi> of the modern extra-meridian astronomer, and
                    relegate to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Transit Circle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">{q.v.}</hi> a description of those mountings in which the
                    telescope is simply a refined substitute for the sights or pinules of the old
                    astronomers. The equatorial in its simplest form consists of an axis parallel to
                    the earth’s axis, called the “polar axis”; a second axis, at right angles to
                    this, called the “declination axis”; and a telescope fixed at right angles to
                    the latter. In fig. 15 AA is the polar axis; the telescope is attached to the
                    end of the declination axis; the latter rotates in bearings attached to the
                    polar axis, and concealed by the telescope itself. The telescope is
                    counterpoised by a weight attached to the opposite end of the declination axis.
                    The low er pivot of the polar axis rests on a cup bearing at’ C, the upper pivot
                    upon a strong metal casting MM, attached to a stone pier S. A vertical plane
                    passing through AA is therefore in the meridian, and, when the declination axis
                    is horizontal, the telescope moves in the plane of the meridian by rotation on
                    the declination axis only. Thus, if a graduated circle BB is attached to the
                    declination axis, together with the necessary microscopes or verniers V,V for
                    reading it (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Transit Circle), so</hi> arranged that when
                    the telescope is turned on the declination axis till it is parallel to AA the
                    vernier reads 0° or 90°, and when at right angles to AA 90° or 0°, then we can
                    employ the readings of this circle to measure the polar distance or declination
                    of any star seen in the telescope, and these readings will also be true (apart
                    from the effects of atmospheric refraction) if we rotate the instrument through
                    any angle on the axis AA. Thus one important attribute of an equatorially
                    mounted telescope is that, if it is directed to any fixed star, it will follow
                    the diurnal motion of that star from rising to setting by rotation of the polar
                    axis only. If we further attach to the polar axis a graduated circle DD, called
                    the “hour circle,” of which the microscope or vernier R reads 0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> when the declination axis is horizontal, we can
                    obviously read off the hour angle from the meridian of any star to which the
                    telescope may be directed at the instant of observation. If the local sidereal
                    time of the observation is known, the right ascension of the star becomes known
                    by adding the observed hour angle to the sidereal time if the star is west of
                    the meridian, or subtracting it if east of the meridian. Since the equatorial is
                    unsuitable for such observations when great accuracy is required (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Transit Circle),</hi> the declination and hour circles of an
                    equatorial are employed not for determination of the right ascensions and
                    declinations of celestial objects, but for directing the telescope with ease and
                    certainty to any object situated in a known position, and which may or may not
                    be visible to the unaided eye, or to define approximately the position of an
                    unknown object. Further, by causing the hour circle, and with it the polar axis,
                    to rotate by clockwork or some other mechanical contrivance at the same angular
                    velocity as the earth on its axis, but in the opposite direction, the telescope
                    will automatically follow a star from rising to setting.</p>
                <p>Equatorial mountings may be divided into five types. (A) The pivots or bearings
                    of the polar axis are placed at its extremities. The declination axis rests on
                    bearings attached to opposite sides of the polar axis. The telescope is attached
                    to one end of the declination axis, and counterpoised by a weight at the other
                    end, as in fig. 15. (B) The polar axis is supported as in type A; the telescope
                    is placed between the bearings of the declination axis and is mounted
                    symmetrically with respect to the polar axis; no counterpoise is therefore
                    requisite. (C) The declination axis is mounted on the prolongation of the upper
                    pivot of the polar axis; the telescope is placed at one end of the declination
                    axis and counterpoised by a weight at the other end. (D) The declination axis
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n158/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0158-0147"/> is mounted on a forked piece or other similar
                    contrivance attached to a prolongation of the upper pivot of the polar axis; the
                    telescope is mounted between the pivots of the declination axis. (E) The
                    eye-piece of the telescope is placed in the upper pivot of the polar axis; a
                    portion or the whole of the axis of the telescope tube coincides with the polar
                    axis. Mountings of types A and B —that is, with a long polar axis supported at
                    both ends—are often called the “English mounting,” and types C and D, in which
                    the declination axis is placed on the extension of the upper pivot of the polar
                    axis, are called the “German mounting,” from the first employment of type C by
                    Fraunhofer. A description of some of the best examples of each type will
                    illustrate their relative advantages or peculiarities.</p>
                <p>Fig. 15 may be taken as a practical example of the earlier equatorials as made by
                    Troughton in England and afterwards by Gambey for various Continental
                    observatories. In the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans, for</hi> 1824 (part 3, pp.
                    1-412) will be found a description by Sir John Herschel and Sir James South of
                    the equatorial telescope which they employed in their measurements of double
                    stars. The polar axis was similar in shape to that of fig. 15 and was composed
                    of sheets of tinned iron. In Smyth’s celebrated Bedford telescope the polar axis
                    was of mahogany. Probably the best example of this type of mounting applied to a
                    refractor is that made by the elder Cooke of York for Mr Fletcher of Tarnbank;
                    the polar axis is of cast iron and the mounting very satisfactory and
                    convenient, but unfortunately no detailed description has been published. In
                    recent years no noteworthy refractors have been mounted on this plan; but type A
                    has been chosen by Grubb for the great Melbourne reflector, with marked
                    ingenuity of adaptation to the peculiar requirements of the case. Fig. 16 shows
                    the whole instrument on a small scale, and fig.</p>
                <p>17 represents part of it on a larger scale, the upper part of the tube and polar
                    axis being omitted. The figures show the telescope directed to the pole, the
                    hour circle being set 6 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> from the meridian. The
                    polar axis consists of a hollow cone C (fig. 17) of cast iron bolted to a hollow
                    cast-iron cube H, to the lower side of which is attached a short steel axis
                    carrying the driving sector EF and the hour circle R, and terminating in the
                    lower pivot of the polar axis. This pivot <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is terminated
                    by a piece of chilled cast iron polished flat on its lower face, which face
                    revolves in contact with a piece of bell metal, flat on its upper and partly
                    spherical on its lower side, bearing in a correspondingly shaped annulus, formed
                    to receive it in the cast-iron block which is attached to the pier. This
                    arrangement enables the bell-metal cushion to take its own position when the
                    direction of the polar axis is slightly changed in process of adjustment. The
                    pressure of the pivot on tion axis. The counterpoise U is attached to the other
                    extremity. There is an elegant arrangement for diminishing the friction of the
                    declination axis, which our limits do not permit us to describe, and the means
                    for clamping and giving slow motion in declination do not require special
                    notice. The reader is referred for a fuller description to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1869, pp. 127-161. The telescope is of the Cassegrain form,
                    the mirror having a 4-feet aperture and 30⅜-feet focal length.</p>
                <p>The best existing examples of type B are Airy’s equatorial at Greenwich, the
                    equatorial at Liverpool (also designed by Airy), and the photographic equatorial
                    recently erected at the Paris observatory. The polar axis of the Greenwich
                    equatorial consists of six iron tubes arranged so as to form two triangular
                    braced beams connected by very strong elliptical wheels of cast iron, which
                    carry the upper and lower pivots of the polar axis. These tubes are shown in
                    section at the points T, fig. 18, which represents a section through the
                    declination axis in the plane of the equator when the telescope is directed to a
                    star at the equator (for the general arrangement of the mounting, see fig. 19).
                    The driving circle is 6 feet in diameter, and turns freely on the lower pivot of
                    the polar axis, under the action of the driving clock. The hour circle is
                    graduated on the driving circle, and may be set to show sidereal time during its
                    bearings, in the direction at right angles to the polar axis, is relieved by the
                    sector A, which is forced up by the screw <hi rend="italic">d</hi> acting
                    through laminae of steel springs. The end pressure of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    upon its bearings is relieved by a weight. The friction of the upper pivot is
                    relieved by a sector pressed up against it by the action of two weights. In this
                    way, although the moving part of the telescope weighs 18,170 lb, it can be
                    turned with a pressure of 12∣ lb, acting at a radius of</p>
                <p>20 feet. The driving sector EF is 5 feet in radius; its circular rim is
                    accurately toothed to fit a square threaded endless screw E, which is turned by
                    the driving clock. A toothed wheel attached to H and acted on by a pinion
                    connected with a hand-wheel affords an easy means or setting the instrument in
                    hour angle, or moving the telescope quickly in right ascension. The telescope is

                <p>the whole of a night’s work; thus the observer, in order to direct the instrument
                    on a particular object, has only to set an index connected „ with the polar axis
                    to the star’s right ascension upon the hour circle, without the trouble of
                    computing the hour angle at the instant of observation. This convenient
                    arrangement was first introduced by Airy. The whole mounting is very massive,
                    but very inconvenient to use when a great many different objects have to be
                    examined on the same night; but on account of its freedom from tremor and the
                    excellence of its driving clock it should be very suitable for prolonged study
                    of a single object or for long photographic exposures.<note anchored="true"

                    The object-glass will be actually outside the dome when the telescope is pointed
                    near the zenith or near the horizon. The dew-cap, not shown in the model, will
                    be always outside the dome, and it is not impossible that this arrangement may
                    be favourable to good definition, except in case of high wind. When the
                    telescope is not in use the dewcap slides backwards on four rails parallel to
                    the axis of the telescope, and the whole is housed in the position shown in fig.

                    right-angled prism of total reflexion being interposed in the converging cone of
                    rays near the focus. This prism can be turned 180" and an eye-piece inserted on
                    the opposite side from the spectroscope for observations near the zenith or

                <p>A figure of the new photographic telescope erected at the Paris observatory may
                    be seen in <hi rend="italic">Nature,</hi> 13th May 1886. The objectglass is by
                    MM. Paul and Prosper Henry, the mounting by Μ. Gautier. Here Airy’s braced tubes
                    are replaced by hollow metal beams of triangular shape (as for the Liverpool
                    equatorial). The hour circle has two toothed circles cut upon it, one acted upon
                    by a screw attached to the pier and driven by the clock, the other by a second
                    screw attached to the polar axis, which can be turned very slowly by a handle in
                    the observer’s hand. Thus a very slow movement can be given to the telescope in
                    right ascension, independently of the clock. Slow motion in declination can be
                    communicated by a screw acting on a long arm, which can be clamped at pleasure
                    to the polar axis by a convenient handle. An oblong metallic box, fitted with
                    pivots, λvhose bearings are attached to the triangular beams, forms the tube for
                    two parallel telescopes; these are separated throughout their length by a
                    metallic diaphragm. The chromatic aberration of the object-glass of one of these
                    telescopes is corrected for photographic rays, and the image formed by it is
                    received on a highly sensitive photographic plate. The other telescope is
                    corrected for visual rays and its image is formed on the plane of the spider
                    lines of a filar micrometer. The peculiar form of the tube is eminently suited
                    for rigid preservation of the relative parallelism of the axes of the two
                    telescopes, so that, if a certain selected star is retained in bisection by two
                    intersecting wires in the micrometer, by means of the driving clock, aided by
                    small corrections given by the observer in right ascension and declination
                    (required on account of irregularity in the clock movement, error in
                    astronomical adjustment of the polar axis, or changes in the star’s apparent
                    place produced by refraction), the image of a star will continue on the same
                    spot of the photographic plate during the whole time of exposure. Exquisite
                    photographs of star clusters, double stars, the moon, and planets have been
                    obtained by MM. Henry, and they are the most eloquent testimony to the optical
                    perfection of the object-glass and the efficiency of the mounting. They show
                    also that we are entering upon a new era in practical astronomy, in which
                    photography is destined to play a leading part. The Henry photographic
                    object-glass is of 13∙4-inches aperture and only 10 apertures in focal length.
                    The “guiding telescope” is of 9⅜-inches aperture and nearly 12-feet focus. The
                    photographic object-glass, notwithstanding its small proportional focal length,
                    covers a field of 2⅜ <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> in diameter with perfect
                    precision.</p>
                <p>Many more telescopes have been made of type C than of any other, and it is now
                    almost exclusively employed for the mounting of modern refractors. Its essential
                    features are (1) a comparatively short polar axis and (2) a cross-head attached
                    to the extension of the upper pivot of the polar axis, to carry the bearings of
                    the de-clination axis. Fig. 20 shows the Dorpat refractor, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chef d’oeuvre</hi> of Fraunhofer, and the first equa-torial of any importance
                    that was provided with clockwork. AA is the polar axis, B the hour circle
                    graduated on the face and read by the vernier V. C' is the driving clock, which
                    turns an endless screw S, that gears in the toothed edge of the circle B. D is
                    the cross head supporting at its extremities the bearings of the declination
                    axis.</p>
                <p>The wooden telescope tube rests in a strong cradle FF of cast brass, which is
                    screwed to a flange on one end of the declination axis; the declination circle
                    EE,which is attached to its opposite end, serves to clamp the instrument in
                    declination to the arm G. H is a weight acting on a lever which presses the
                    wheels <hi rend="italic">k</hi> (one only seen in the figure) against the upper
                    pivot of the polar axis in order to relieve the friction of that pivot on its
                    bearing. The counterpoise W balances the tube about the polar axis. Μ, M are
                    counterpoise weights which act on levers <hi rend="italic">m,m,</hi> whose
                    fulcra are universal joints at <hi rend="italic">n</hi> attached to the
                    cradle.</p>
                <p>These weights serve to counterpoise the longer end of the tube and to check its
                    flexure. QQ is the finder, a small telescope whose axis is parallel to the great
                    telescope; having a low magnifying power and a large field of view, it serves to
                    direct the large telescope to any object seen in the sky, which otherwise would
                    be difficult to find in the comparatively limited field of the large telescope.
                    The stand TTT is of oak. The instrument is described in detail by Struve <hi
                    rend="italic">(Beschreibung des auf der Sternwarte zu Dorpat befindlichen
                    grossen Refractors von Fraunhofer,</hi> Dorpat, 1825, fol.). The instrument was
                    an enormous advance upon all previous telescopes for micrometric research. In
                    the hands of Struve results were obtained by it which in combined quality and
                    quantity had never before been reached in micrometric research. Its success was
                    such that the type of Fraunhofer’s telescope became stereotyped for many years
                    not only by his successors but throughout Germany. When twelve years afterwards
                    Struve ordered the 15-inch refractor for the new observatory at Pulkowa, the
                    only important change made by Fraunhofer’s successors was, at Struve’s
                    suggestion, the substitution of a stone pier for the wooden stand in the
                    original instrument.</p>
                <p>Both the Dorpat and the Pulkowa refractor are defective in rigidity, especially
                    in right ascension. The declination circle is most inconvenient of access, and
                    slow motion in declination can only be effected when the instrument is clamped
                    by a long and inconvenient handle, so that practically clamping in declination
                    was not employed. The slow motion in right ascension is defective, being
                    accomplished in the Dorpat refractor by changing the rate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n160/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0160-0149"/> of the clock, and in the Pulkowa refractor by a
                    handle which when used affects very injuriously the rate of the clock for the
                    time being. Struve’s skill as an observer was such that he used to complete the
                    bisection on the fixed wire of the micrometer by a pressure of the finger on the
                    side of the tube,—a method of proved efficiency in such hands, but plainly
                    indicative of the want of rigidity in the instrument and of the deficiency of
                    the slow motions (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 245).
                    The driving circle is also much too small, so that a very slight mechanical
                    freedom of the screw in the teeth involves a large angular freedom of the
                    telescope in right ascension, whilst its position at the lower end of a too weak
                    polar axis tends to create instability in right ascension from torsion of that
                    axis. Strange to say, the wooden tube has till very recently retained its place
                    in German mountings.</p>
                <p>About 1840 a great advance was made in the right direction by the Repsolds of
                    Hamburg in the equatorial mounting of the Oxford heliometer. The driving circle
                    was greatly increased in diameter, and placed at the upper end of the polar
                    axis, and both the polar axis and the declination axis were made much stronger
                    in proportion to the mass of the instrument they were destined to carry. (A
                    figure of this instrument is given in the Oxford <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations</hi> for 1850.) About 1850 Thomas Cooke of York began his career
                    as a maker of equatorial telescopes, and gave a new character to the German
                    mounting. Fig. 21 represents a typical equatorial of his design. A strong
                    cast-iron pillar is substituted for Fraunhofer’s stand. On the semi-cylindrical
                    top of the pillar rests the cast-iron box AA, which contains at its upper and
                    lower extremities the bearings of the polar axis. Its mode of connexion with the
                    pillar permits the inclination of the box to be changed for adjustment of the
                    inclination of the polar axis. The strong cross-head C, supporting the bearings
                    of the declination axis, is of cast iron, bolted to a flange on the upper pivot
                    of the polar axis. Fraunhofer’s cradle and wooden tube are abolished, and in
                    their place is a cast-iron cylindrical tube D, flanged at both ends and also at
                    the point where it is bolted to a corresponding flange on the end of the
                    declination axis, all three flanges being cast in one piece with the central
                    tube; the rest of the tube consists of two slightly tapered brass cylinders
                    bolted by strong flanges to the central tube D. The handle F clamps the arm H to
                    the cross-head C at pleasure, and slow motion in declination is communicated by
                    the handles at E and G.</p>
                <p>Two circles at K and M are attached to the upper part of the polar axis. To one
                    of these motion is communicated by the tangent screw at M (turned by the clock
                    N) acting on teeth cut at the edge of the circle. The other is a graduated hour
                    circle read by two opposite microscopes, one of which is seen at P. The endless
                    cord hanging down and holding a sliding ring at Q is employed to give slow
                    motion in right ascension, in some instruments by moving the frame of the
                    driving screw in the direction of the axis of the screw, in others by moving
                    differential wheels which accelerate or retard the velocity of rotation of the
                    driving screw without affecting the rate of the clock. The declination circle RR
                    is attached to the farther end of the declination axis and is inconvenient of
                    access. Cooke’s stand is admirable for its symmetry and simplicity of design,
                    its just apportioning of strength, and a general rigidity with suitability of
                    means to ends.</p>
                <p>It is not a little curious that the obvious improvement of transferring the
                    declination circle as well as the declination clamp to the telescope end of the
                    declination axis was so long delayed; we can ascribe the delay only to a desire
                    to retain the declination circle as part of the counterpoise. We believe that
                    the first important equatorials in which the declination axis was read from the
                    eye end were the 15-inch by Grubb and the 6-inch by Cooke, made for the
                    observatory of Lord Crawford (then Lord Lindsay) at Dun Echt (Aberdeenshire)
                    about 1873. The plan is now almost universally adopted. Telescopes of such
                    dimensions can be conveniently directed to any object by the circles without the
                    observer being under the necessity to climb a special ladder. But when much
                    larger instruments are required the hour circle becomes inaccessible from the
                    floor, and means have to be devised for reading both circles from the eye end.
                    This was first accomplished by Grubb in the great refractor of 27-inches
                    aperture which he constructed for the Vienna observatory, represented in section
                    in fig. 22. The observer’s eye is applied to the small telescope E, which (by
                    means of prisms numbered 1, 2, 3, 4) views the vernier attached to the
                    cross-head simultaneously with the hour circle attached to the upper end of the
                    polar axis. Light to illuminate the vernier and circle is thrown from the lamp L
                    upon prism 4 by the prisms 6 and 5. Prism 1 is in the axis of the declination
                    circle and always reflects rays along that axis, whatever the position of the
                    telescope may be, whilst the prisms 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are attached to the
                    crosshead and therefore preserve their relative positions to each other. Through
                    the eye-piece of the bent<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>In the bent telescope refracting prisms are employed at the corners to
                    change the direction of the rays.</p></note> telescope E' another hour circle
                    attached to the lotver end of the polar axis can be seen; thus an assistant is
                    able to direct the telescope by a handle at H to any desired hour angle. A
                    slight rotatory motion of the telescope E on its axis enables the vernier of the
                    declination circle to be read through prism 1. The leading features of this fine
                    instrument represent those of all Grubb’s large telescopes. The mode of
                    relieving the friction of the declination axis is similar to that employed in
                    the Melbourne telescope and in the account of the Vienna telescope published by
                    Grubb. The end friction of the polar axis is relieved by a ring of conical
                    rollers shown in section beside the principal figure.</p>

                    apparatus similar to that previously described under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 246 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> figs. 16, 17, 20,
                    and 21.</p>
                <p>The lamp near the eye end illuminates the field or the wires at pleasure, as well
                    as the position circle of the micrometer and the declination circle: a separate
                    lamp illuminates the hour circle. An excellent feature (see fig. 24) is the
                    short distance between the eye-piece and the declination axis, so that th&lt;
                    observer has to fol low the eye end in a comparatively small circle; another
                    good point is the flattening of the cast-iron centre-piece of the tube so that
                    the flange of the declination axis is attached as near to the axis of the
                    telescope tube as is consistent with free passage of the cone of rays from the
                    object-glass. For purposes of micrometric research with the ordinary micrometer
                    this instrument is the most elegant, satisfactory, and useful that we know, as
                    was shown by the exceedingly accurate observations of the minor planets Victoria
                    and Sappho for solar parallax, by Gaffe’s method (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Parallax,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 249), made by Dr Engelmann in 1882. The
                    substitution of small incandescent electric lamps for the oil lamps would be an
                    improvement.</p>
                <p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Telescopes of Moderate Size for General Purposes.—</hi> The
                    modern equatorial should for general purposes be capable of carrying
                    spectroscopes of considerable weight, so that the strength of the axis and the
                    rigidity of the instrument generally have to be considerably increased. Grubb
                    has realized our ideas of what such an instrument should be in an equatorial of
                    6-inches aperture which he has recently made for the royal observatory at the
                    Cape of Good Hope. The principal features are its great strength and rigidity,
                    with special precautions to ensure preservation of the instrumental declination.
                    The observations of Victoria and Sappho in 1882 revealed the great deficiency of
                    most modern equatoriale in this respect. That is to say, if a star near the
                    meridian is first made to run along the measuring web of the micrometer, the
                    clockwork then set in action, and the star brought back to the centre of the
                    field by the slow-motion handle in right ascension, it will be found that the
                    perfection of the bisection is no longer preserved. Thus at most observatories
                    the measures of difference of declination when the clockwork was employed were
                    far inferior to those made with the telescope at rest. The reason seems to be
                    that in most equatorials the lower pivot is cylindrical, and enters an ordinary
                    cylindrical bearing which cannot be a perfect fit. Also the crosshead,
                    telescope, counterpoise, &amp;c., generally together overbalance the polar axis
                    about the upper bearing, so that the lower pivot presses upwards in its bearing,
                    and its rotation, under the action of the clock or slow motion coupled with the
                    friction of the surfaces, gives rise to a small rolling freedom which creates
                    the errors in question. In this telescope the lower pivot is of steel, made
                    slightly conical, and carefully ground to fit a long conical bearing, in which
                    it would work very tightly, or even jam, but for spring pressure brought to bear
                    on its lower hardened flat end, which relieves the greater part of the thrust;
                    and the polar axis is accurately balanced about its upper bearing by a weight at
                    the lower end of the polar axis, so that the thrust is exactly in the axis of
                    the cone. The upper pivot (4 inches in diameter) is also of steel, finished with
                    the same care as that of a transit circle, so that the telescope rotates with
                    the precision of a meridian instrument. Unusual rigidity has also been given to
                    the declination clamping arms, and the new slow motion in declination is by far
                    the best yet contrived; it is a recent invention of Grubb’s, and is described
                    below in his own words. The eye end, suitable for heavy spectroscopes, &amp;c.,
                    is fitted to the butt end of the telescope by bayonet joints and tightening
                    screws, so that it can be exchanged for a micrometric eye end with almost as
                    little trouble as the exchanging of an eye-piece. The illumination of the
                    circles and the micrometer is by electric incandescent lamps. The instrument may
                    be adjusted to any latitude and is probably the most practical and serviceable
                    equatorial made. The subjoined description of the new slow motion in declination
                    is taken from <hi rend="italic">Proc. R. Dubl. Soc.,</hi> 1886, p. 107.</p>
                <p>“The slow motion arrangements usually used in equatorials are of either of two
                    forms, viz., (a) an endless screw working into a sector or portion of a toothed
                    circle of long radius, or (ft) a screw applying or pushing directly against an
                    arm, that arm being kept in contact with the screw by a spiral or some other
                    form of spring having a considerable range of motion. The first («) possesses
                    the disadλ <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> antage that, however carefully made,
                    it is impossible it is quite free from ‘loss’ or ‘back lash”; and consequently
                    the position of the telescope is not perfectly determinate in declination, which
                    fault is inconvenient when delicate measures are required. The second (ft) has
                    practically no ‘ back lash,’ as spring keeps the arm in perfect contact with
                    screw, but it has the disadvantage that, whatever range of motion is required,
                    the spring must be capable of working through the same range; consequently the
                    spring will be much stronger in action at one end of the range than the other,
                    unless it be made very long indeed, in which case its action is uncertain and
                    unpleasant. To remedy these defects the author [Grubb] has devised the
                    following, which possesses the advantages of both ABCD (fig.</p>
                <p>25) is a portion of the arms attached to telescope, or cradle, on which is
                    planted the block (ft), forming the bearing of the screw. The nut (n) is in the
                    form of a ball working in a socket on the extremity of the clamp-arm EFG. A
                    short stiff spring (8) is attached to this clamp-arm, bearing, not directly
                    against any part of other arm, but against end of a second screw of same pitch
                    as the main screw, the nut of which (oo) is toothed on edge, and works into a
                    wheel of equal size (pp) on main screw. The point of this second screw,
                    therefore, advances as much in one direction as the frame ABCD is carried in
                    other, according as the milled head is turned; and consequently the point of the
                    screw does not sensibly vary in its position with respect to the clamp-ann EFG.
                    A short stiff spring can therefore be used, and the disadvantage above mentioned
                    disappears.”</p>
                <p>This form of slow motion could be applied with advantage to the right ascension
                    also, and probably to the separation of the segments of heliometers.</p>

                    mounting appears to be unworthy of the well-known excellence of the
                    object-glass. To illuminate the micrometer an assistant is required to hold a
                    lamp in his hand. No convenient means are provided for illuminating the
                    declination axis; and in order to point the telescope in declination the
                    following elaborate process has to be performed :—</p>
                <p>“The instrument is brought into the meridian and set by the observer within a
                    degree by means of coarse divisions painted on the edge of the declination
                    circle. These divisions are rendered visible by lighting one or two of the gas
                    burners of the dome, and viewed by the astronomer with an opera-glass. Then an
                    assistant mounts by a ladder to a high platform and holds a gas lamp near the
                    vernier, and the fine setting is accomplished by the observer seated in the
                    observing chair, the declination clamp and slow-motion screw being convenient to
                    his hand” <hi rend="italic">(Washington Observations,</hi> 1874, Appendix I., p.
                    33).</p>
                <p>The polar and declination axes are of steel, only 7 inches in diameter at the
                    thickest point, and the driving arc, which is far too small, is placed at the
                    lower end of this slender axis. There must thus be considerable liability to
                    tremor in right ascension. However well the instrument may act in specially
                    practised hands with an excellent Clark’s micrometer (art. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Micrometer,</hi> vol. xvi. p. 245), the instrument must be considered wanting
                    in the rigidity and convenience which a modern equatorial should possess. In his
                    official report on the instruments of European observatories Newcomb defends the
                    want of solidity and convenience of this instrument as compared with the Vienna
                    telescope, because its smaller axes (notwithstanding Gmbb’s anti-friction
                    arrangements) permit it to turn more easily and the mounting to be of far
                    simpler design. But at the time of Newcomb’s visit the Vienna telescope had not
                    been brought into work, and cannot have been in proper working order if the
                    motion in declination was so stiff as he describes it, at least when the present
                    writer tested the instrument in Dublin that motion was surprisingly easy.</p>
                <p>The great Pulkowa refractor (fig. 26) erected in 1885 is of 30- inches aperture
                    and 45-feet focal length. The object-glass is by Clark, the mounting by the
                    Repsolds. The tube is cylindrical, of riveted steel plate, graduated in
                    thickness from the centre to its extremities, and bolted by very powerful
                    flanges to a strong short cast-iron central tube, in which, as in Dr Engelmann’s
                    telescope (fig. 23), the attachment to the flange of the declination axis is
                    placed as close as it can be to the axis of the tube without interfering<pb

                    point in the field of view. A new feature in this instrument is the platform at
                    the lower end of the polar axis, where an assistant can view the hour circle by
                    one eye-piece and the declination circle by another (looking up the perforated
                    polar axis), and where he can also set the telescope to any hour angle by one
                    wheel, or to any declination by a second, with the greatest ease. The observer
                    at the eye end can also read off the hour and declination circles and
                    communicate quick or slow motions to the telescope both in right ascension and
                    declination by conveniently placed handles. The eye end presents an appearance
                    too complicated to be figured here; it has a micrometer and its illumination for
                    the position circle, a micrometer head, and a bright or dark field,<note

                    weights which can be removed when a spectroscope or other heavy appliance is
                    added. All these, although making up an apparently complicated apparatus, are
                    conveniently arranged, and are all necessary for the quick and easy working of
                    so large an instrument. We have the authority of Otto Struve for stating that in
                    practice they are all that can be desired. There is in this instrument a
                    remarkably elegant method of relieving the friction of the polar axis. Let AA
                    (fig. 27) be a section of the polar axis; it is then easy to adjust the weight P
                    of the circles, &amp;c., attached to its lower end so that the centre of gravity
                    X of the whole moving parts of the instrument shall be in the vertical (VV) of a
                    line passing through the apex of the hollowed flange <hi rend="italic">pq</hi>
                    at <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> which flange forms part of the polar axis. I f now
                    a wheel W is forced up against <hi rend="italic">q</hi> with a pressure equal to
                    the weight of the moving part of the instrument, the whole weight of the moving
                    part would rest upon W in unstable equilibrium; or if a pressure R, less than W,
                    is employed, we have the end friction on the lower bearing removed to an extent
                    = R sin <hi rend="italic">φ,</hi> and the friction on the bearings of the upper
                    pivot removed to the extent of F cos <hi rend="italic">φ,—</hi> where <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi> is the latitude of the place. The wheel W is therefore
                    mounted on a guided rod, which is forced upwards by suitable levers and weights,
                    and this relief of pressure is precisely proportional to the pressure on the
                    respective bearings. The Repsolds find it unnecessary to relieve the friction of
                    the declination axis.</p>
                <p>Fig. 28 shows the equatorial mounting which Grubb designed for the great
                    object-glass of 36-inches aperture that Messrs Clark have completed for the Lick
                    trustees, and which may be supposed to express Grubb’s latest ideas as to the
                    mounting for a very large telescope. The Repsolds have a large driving circle at
                    the upper end of the polar axis, thus avoiding torsion of the polar axis at the
                    expense of greatly increased length of the cross-head. Grubb by employing a
                    driving arc gets the telescope much closer to the polar axis with an increased
                    radius for driving, and he makes the polar axis a very large hollow steel or
                    cast-iron cylinder in which torsion is insensible. Both Grubb and the Repsolds
                    seem to think that for the tube of the telescope all necessary rigidity can be
                    attained with cylindrical tubes of riveted steel, the thickness of the
                    successive sheets of which diminish from the centre-piece outwards without
                    making the extremities cone-shaped.</p>
                <p>In these very large telescopes the arrangements for giving access to the eye end
                    and for following its diurnal motion have hitherto proved a source of
                    difficulty. The travelling stages of the new Pulkowa telescope are the most
                    manageable and practical that have yet been contrived, but even they leave much
                    to be desired. For energetic work the standing position is best, provided that
                    the eye-piece is situated at the precise height above the stage which is most
                    convenient for the observer, and that the altitude of the observed object is not
                    greater than 60°. For altitudes above 60° a small chair with a back, the top of
                    which is stuffed for the head to rest upon, is the best seat, provided that the
                    observer’s eye can be kept at the height of the eye-piece. Accordingly Gnιbb has
                    suggested the following plan for the observatory at Mount Hamilton, California,
                    which is to cover the Lick telescope. The whole floor, 70 feet in diameter, is
                    to be raised or lowered by water-power under control of the observer by means of
                    electric keys, which act on a secondary piece of mechanism, that in turn works
                    the valves and reversing gear of the water-engines. Other water-engines,
                    similarly connected with keys at the observer’s hands, rotate the dome and
                    perform the quick motions in right ascension and declination.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A woodcut showing these
                    arrangements appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Engineer,</hi> 9th July

                    perfect facility and comfort. There is only one other plan, that of suspending
                    the observer’s chair to the eye end, so that his eye is near the centre of
                    motion of the chair. This is quite practicable for a 36- inch telescope, and one
                    observer, with the necessary guiding keys at hand, could easily work a telescope
                    and dome of the largest dimensions as quickly and with more ease than he could
                    one of 10 or 12 inches aperture. Probably a nervous astronomer would prefer a
                    solid floor to work upon, as in Grubb’s proposal; in the latter case the
                    quickest working can only be accomplished by two persons, one seated on the
                    platform at the foot of the polar axis and doing the rough setting in right
                    ascension and declination, the other meanwhile adjusting the height of the floor
                    and the azimuth of the dome opening.</p>

                    inconvenience from the extended width of the apparatus at the eye end. Were we
                    called upon to design a great refractor we should abolish all such apparatus and
                    provide the observer with a few conveniently placed small handles or keys for
                    electrical connexions, and we should perform all motions of the telescope
                    whatsoever by electromotors. There is no form of energy so convenient for the
                    astronomer. It provides by incandescent lamps the most suitable light for his
                    purpose, perfectly constant, giving off little heat, and unaffected by wind; and
                    such a light can be placed where required without the aid of reflectors or any
                    complicated apparatus, and its intensity can be regulated with ease and
                    precision by changing the resistance of the conductors. Moreover the
                    electromotors can be as powerful or as delicate as we please, and can be placed
                    in the most convenient or suitable positions. The energy of a 5-horse-power
                    steam-engine working for ten hours can be stored in accumulators of no
                    inconvenient dimensions ready for use as required during a whole week or even a
                    month, and can be brought into action in force equivalent to several horsepower
                    to raise or lower the floor or turn the dome, or to perform slow motions
                    requiring no greater energy than that exercised by the finger and thumb, or to
                    illuminate a lamp of ⅜ or ⅛ candlepower. There would be no limit to the rigidity
                    which could be given to such a telescope, as great ease of motion would not have

                    complicated anti-friction apparatus for the declination axis, retaining it only
                    for the polar axis to save wear in the teeth of the driving arc. Finally,
                    instead of making the finder a short telescope attached to the eye end of the
                    instrument, we should give it a focal length equal to that of the great
                    object-glass, attaching the cell of its object-glass rigidly to the cell of the
                    large object-glass and its eye end to the butt end of the main telescope, in
                    order to secure the utmost rigidity in the relations of the axes of the two
                    telescopes. Such a finder would correspond in efficiency to that of the Henry
                    photographic telescope, and would be available as a guiding telescope in
                    photographic work, or for keeping a star exactly on the slit of a
                    spectroscope.</p>
                <p>The first important instruments of type D</p>
                <p>&gt; were Mr LasselΓs reflectors, the largest of which, and the last, is
                    represented in fig. 29. The polar axis is sufficiently rigid, but the long and
                    comparatively slender forks which carry the pivots of the central cradle are
                    elements of instability, especially when the instrument is directed to an object
                    of considerable hour angle. There is practical confession of this instability in
                    the cross-bracing which connects the two forks, and which must be removed if the
                    telescope is pointed to an object between the zenith and the elevated pole.</p>
                <p>The best example of type D is the reflecting telescope of 36-inches aperture
                    designed by Mr. A. A. Common, with which his exquisite photographs of nebulae,
                    &amp;c., were made. The principal preliminary conditions which he laid down as
                    necessary were the following<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Monthly Notices R.A.S.,</hi> vol. xxxix.
                    p. 384.</p></note>:— (1) no tube properly so called, to avoid air-currents in
                    the tube; (2) no mass of metal either below or at the side of the line joining
                    the large and small mirrors, to avoid currents from possible difference of
                    temperature between the mass of metal and the surrounding air; (3) an equatorial
                    mounting capable of direction to any part of the visible heavens and of
                    continued observation past the meridian without reversal; (4) an efficient means
                    of supporting the mirror without flexure; (5) driving clock; circles to find or
                    identify an object, and motions taken to eye end; (6) a mounting which will give
                    the greatest amount of steadiness with the least amount of friction. Fig. 30 is
                    a section of the instrument in the plane of the meridian. DDχ is a cast-iron
                    hollow cylinder, accurately bored out, attached to a strong base block. D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is a cover bolted on the bottom of this cylinder, in
                    the centre of which is a tapering steel pin D <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,
                    which enters a corresponding hole in the bottom of the polar axis E, and serves
                    as the lower pivot of the polar axis. The cylindrical part of the polar axis is
                    accurately turned to a diameter one-eighth of an inch less than the outer
                    cylinder, and the otherwise severe friction on the pin D <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> is relieved by filling in the space between D and E with mercury, so far
                    as sufficient nearly to float the whole moving part of the telescope. The upper
                    elbow-shaped part of the polar axis E <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is flanged
                    and bolted to the lower part. In the section at right angles to that exhibited
                    in fig. 30 this elbow-shaped part is T-shaped, and the cross of the T is bored
                    to receive the declination axis; and, as the elbow puts the polar axis
                    considerably out of balance, the T-shaped head is carried forward of the axial
                    line about 1⅛ inches, so that the whole weight of the telescope above just
                    restores the balance. Two heavy weights X, X counterpoise the eye end F with the
                    four braced tubes T, T which support it. B is the declination circle. It is
                    impossible to describe this fine instrument adequately within our limits; we
                    mention as specially worthy of study the method of supporting the mirror and the
                    eminently ingenious and practical form of the observatory, and refer the reader
                    to Common’s illustrated account of the instrument in <hi rend="italic">Mem.
                    R.A.S.,</hi> vol. xlvi. pp. 173-182.</p>
                <p>There is also an admirable mounting of type D designed by Lord Rosse for his
                    3-foot reflector at Birr Castle, described by him in <hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> vol. clxxi. p. 153. The instrument is planned on the broad lines of
                    Lassell’s telescope (fig. 29), but the badly planned and weak fork of the latter
                    is replaced by a thoroughly rigid bent fork made of boiler plate a quarter of an
                    inch thick, firmly riveted to angle iron of 2⅜ × 2∣ × ⅛ inch scantling along
                    each angle, the whole, as we have proved by trial, being exceedingly rigid. It
                    would be an improvement to adopt Mr Common’s plan of putting the declination
                    axis a little out of the line of prolongation of the polar axis, and thus
                    dispense with the counter-weight; and we should prefer hollow steel tubes with
                    push and pull bracing rather than the angle iron rods and bracing which form the
                    tube.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> of the Royal Dublin Society (vol. ii.
                    p. 362) Grubb describes a “siderostatic telescope,” which forms a good
                    elementary example of type E. In fig. 31 TT is-the tube of a telescope of
                    4-inches aperture, which is mounted to rotate about its axis, the latter forming
                    the polar axis. MM is a plane mirror reflecting rays from a star S to the
                    object-glass, so that its image can be viewed from the eye-piece at E. The star
                    is retained in the field by the clock C. Stars of different declination can be
                    viewed by rotating the mirror on its axis G, and in different hour angles by
                    rotating the tube upon its axis. The instrument in European latitudes cannot
                    command a view of the heavens between the elevated pole and the zenith unless
                    the distance OG is made exceedingly great; even then only a limited range beyond
                    the zenith is possible. The instrument is primarily intended for solar
                    spectroscopy, and thus these drawbacks do not apply. The resulting advantage is
                    that the observer may be in complete darkness and his observations are not
                    interrupted by change of position.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus</hi> for the year 1883, vol. xcvi. pp.
                    735-741, Μ. Loewy gives an account of an instrument which he calls an
                    “equatorial coudé,” designed (1) to attain greater stability and so to measure
                    larger angles than is generally possible with the ordinary equatorial; (2) to
                    enable a single astronomer to point the telescope and make observations in any
                    part of the sky without changing his position; (3) to abolish the usual
                    expensive dome, and to substitute a covered shed on wheels (which can be run
                    back at pleasure), leaving the telescope in the open air, the observer alone
                    being sheltered. These conditions are fulfilled in the manner shown in fig. 32.
                    EP isthe polar axis, rotating on bearings at E and P. The object-glass is at 0,
                    the eye-piece at E. There is a plane mirror at M, which reflects rays converging
                    from the object-glass to the eye-piece at E. A second mirror N, placed at 45° to
                    the optical axis of the object-glass, reflects rays from a star at the pole; but
                    by rotating the box which contains this mirror on the axis of its supporting
                    tube T a star of any declination can be observed, and by combining this motion
                    with rotation of the polar axis the astronomer seated at E is able to view any
                    object whatever in the visible heavens, except those situated between 10 <hi

                    declination circle attached to the box containing the mirror N, both of which
                    can be read or set from E, complete the essentials of the instrument. Its
                    mechanical details present no great difficulty, and are most conveniently
                    arranged. But we entertain grave doubts as to the practical value of the
                    instrument, not on mechanical, but on optical grounds. There must be a certain
                    loss of light from two additional reflexions; but that could be tolerated for
                    the sake of other advantages, provided that the mirrors could be made
                    sufficiently perfect optical planes.</p>
                <p>A few years ago it was very difficult to obtain an optically perfect plane 6
                    inches in diameter, and having obtained it there remained the further difficulty
                    of mounting it so that in all positions it should be free from flexure. By
                    making the mirrors of silvered glass, one-fourth of their diameter in thickness,
                    MM. Henry have not only succeeded in mounting them with all necessary rigidity
                    free from flexure but have given them optically true plane surfaces,
                    notwithstanding their large diameters, viz., 11 and 157 inches. The present
                    writer tested the equatorial coudé on double stars at the Paris observatory in
                    1884, and his last doubts as to the practical value of the instrument were
                    dispelled. He has never seen more perfect optical definition in any of the many
                    telescopes he has employed, and certainly never measured a celestial object in
                    such favourable conditions of physical comfort. The easy position of the
                    observer, the convenient position of the handles for quick and slow motion, and
                    the absolute rigidity of the mounting leave little to be desired. In future
                    instruments the object-glass will be placed outside the mirror N, so that both
                    the silvered mirrors will be protected from exposure to the outer air, and
                    probably will retain the brilliancy of their surfaces for a long period.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Adjustment of the Equatorial.</hi></p>
                <p>Let us take the usual case, that of an equatorial of type C. (1) By means of an
                    azimuth compass, or, better, by the shadow of a plumb line at apparent noon, lay
                    down a meridian line on the upper surface of the stone pier, or other
                    foundation, previously built for the instrument. (2) Employ this meridian line
                    to set up the instrument and with it the polar axis approximately in the azimuth
                    of the meridian, which can be tested by stretching a wire through the centres of
                    the bearings of the polar axis, and dropping a plumb line from the extremities
                    of the wire upon the meridian line. If this is carefully done when the azimuth
                    adjustment is near the middle of its range all desirable accuracy in this
                    preliminary desideratum will be secured. (3) Place the polar axis approximately
                    at the altitude of the pole. This is very easily done for an instrument in which
                    the polar axis is cylindrical or is encased in a box with an upper side parallel
                    to that axis (as in Grubb’s or Cooke’s equatorials). Prepare a right-angled
                    triangle of wood of which the acute angles represent the latitude and
                    co-latitude of the place. Lay the hypothenuse of this triangle upon the line of
                    the instrument parallel to the polar axis (or the wire of operation 2) with the
                    angle equal to the co-latitude next to the elevated pole, and change the
                    inclination of the polar axis till a mason’s level placed on the side of the
                    triangle opposite to the angle of the latitude shows the side in question to be
                    horizontal. (4) Adjust the movable micrometer web to coincidence with the axis
                    of the position circle by bisecting the image of a distant object and reading
                    the number of revolutions or fractions of a revolution at two different readings
                    of the position circle 180° apart. The mean of these two readings is the reading
                    for coincidence with the axis of the position circle. Set the micrometer to this
                    mean. (5) Adjust the polar axis more exactly to the required altitude as
                    follows. Point the telescope to a well-known star not far from the equator and
                    near the meridian, and turn the position circle so that the image of the star by
                    the diurnal motion runs along the web. Read the declination circle. Now reverse
                    the telescope to the other side of the polar axis and bisect the same star
                    again, and again read the declination circle. The mean of the two readings is
                    the star’s instrumental apparent declination; the difference of the two readings
                    is twice the index error. To eliminate this latter it is only necessary to shift
                    the vernier of the declination circle by the screws provided for the purpose,
                    without unclamping in declination, till the circle reads the star’s instrumental
                    apparent declination. This being done, select another star near the meridian and
                    compute its apparent declination (allowing for refraction). Set the telescope to
                    this computed reading and clamp in declination; then cause an assistant to
                    change the altitude of the polar axis (by the screw for the purpose) till the
                    star is bisected by the micrometer wire. (6) Select any convenient known star
                    about six hours from the meridian; compute its apparent declination (allowing
                    for refraction); and set the telescope to this reading in declination. Cause the
                    assistant to turn the slow motion in azimuth till the image of the star is
                    bisected by the micrometer web. (7) Repeat operation 5 and make final
                    corrections if necessary. (8) Repeat operation 6 with stars both east and west
                    of the meridian, and readjust azimuth if necessary. (9) Turn the position circle
                    of the micrometer 90°; place the declination axis nearly horizontal; clamp the
                    telescope in right ascension; and observe the time of transit of a known star
                    across the web of the micrometer. Compute the true hour angle of the star from
                    the known error of the micrometer and the star’s right ascension, and set the
                    vernier so that the hour circle shall read the computer hour angle. By these
                    means, with a previously prepared programme, the writer has frequently
                    completely adjusted an equatorial in less than an hour, so far as operations 4
                    to 9 were concerned.</p>
                <p>There still remain two instrumental errors of the stand. (1) The line joining the
                    optical centre of the lens with the axis of rotation of the position circle may
                    not be at right angles to the declination axis. (2) The declination axis may not
                    be at right angles to the polar axis. In modern equatorials it is usual to leave
                    these adjustments to the maker, as to leave them to the astronomer would be
                    incompatible with the greatest stability of the instrument. In a good instrument
                    these errors will certainly be extremely small and have no influence on its
                    efficiency for practical purposes. The methods for determining their amount are
                    given in most works on practical astronomy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>There remain two important optical adjustments which must be very carefully
                    attended to, viz., the centring of the lenses of the object-glass relative to
                    each other and the centring of the axis of the object-glass relative to that of
                    the eye-piece. The former consists in placing the lenses of the object-glass so
                    that the centres of curvature of their surfaces shall lie in one straight line,
                    which line is the axis of the object-glass. This operation is so delicate and
                    requires such special experience and skill that it should be left to the maker
                    of the object-glass. An elegant method of testing this adjustment was given by
                    Wollaston in <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans.,</hi> 1822, p. 32. If the
                    objectglass itself is perfectly centred, the test of the centring of its axis
                    with I that of the eye-piece is very easy: are the diffraction rings which
                    surround the image of a bright star shown as in fig. 33, or is there flare, that
                    is, are the rings extended on one side as in fig. 34? If the latter is the case,
                    that side of the object-glass towards which the flare is directed is too far
                    from the eye-piece, and should be brought towards it by the appropriate screws
                    or other means provided by the maker. In a good objectglass perfectly centred,
                    on a night of steady definition, a bright star in focus should appear as in fig.
                    33.</p>
                <p>A useful apparatus for the adjustment of centring is a small telescope (fig. 35)
                    whose axis is in the centre of and at right angles to a flat piece of brass in
                    the shape of an equilateral triangle fitted with screws at the three angles. To
                    use this instrument, place the points of the screws on the object-glass as in
                    fig. 36, so that two angles of the triangle are in contact with the inner edge
                    of the cell of the object-glass, and adjust the screw <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    so that the cross-wires in the common focus of the objectglass and eye-piece of
                    the small telescope coincide with the image of the cross-wires of the micrometer
                    of the telescope which mark the axis of rotation of the position circle. Now,
                    keeping the same angles of the brass triangle in contact with the cell, move the
                    small centring telescope round the circumference of the object-glass and note
                    where there is the greatest departure from coincidence. Correct this departure
                    half by the screw <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the small centring telescope and
                    half by the centring screws of the object-glass. The adjustment is perfect when
                    the centring telescope can be moved round the whole periphery of the
                    object-glass in the above manner whilst its cross-wires continue to bisect the
                    cross-wires of the micrometer of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0165-0154"/> the telescope. If after this adjustment has been
                    perfected the diffraction rings are still not circular round the images of
                    stars, the fault is in the centring of the lenses of the object-glass with
                    respect to each other, and the object-glass should be sent to the maker for
                    rectification.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Driving Clock.</hi></p>
                <p>The means employed to cause an equatorial telescope to follow the diurnal motion
                    of a star obviously must not resemble the intermittent motion of an ordinary
                    clock. Numerous devices have been contrived for producing uniform motion. But
                    the limits of this article will only allow us to refer briefly to a few of those
                    most commonly in use. Fig. 37 represents Fraunhofer’s governor. On its axis C is
                    a pinion driven by a train of wheels. The axis carries an arm BB, at the
                    extremities of which, attached by springs <hi rend="italic">f</hi>, <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> ', are the weights D, D'. When these weights acquire a
                    certain velocity of rotation the centrifugal force is sufficient to cause the
                    weights to fly out and rub against the inside of the cylinder AA, and their
                    velocity is checked. Instead of a cylinder, the balls may rub against the inside
                    of a hollow cone, and by raising or lowering the axis C the contact of the
                    weights with the cone may be made to take place when the balls have slightly
                    greater or less velocity, and thus the rate of the clock is regulated. A much
                    better arrangement is a modification of Watt’s governor, employed by Grubb and
                    Cooke. The governor balls <hi rend="italic">g, g</hi> (fig. 38) repose on the
                    points <hi rend="italic">h</hi>, <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the arm KK till
                    they reach their normal velocity, when they fly outwards and bring the point S
                    (tipped with leather) into contact with the friction plate <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi> These clocks are simple in construction and act very well. Newcomb in
                    the Washington equatorial has employed a long suspended conical pendulum; when
                    this pendulum in the least exceeds its normal velocity (that is, its normal
                    departure from the vertical) it establishes an electrical contact which brings
                    friction to bear, and thus reduces the power applied to the pendulum. There is
                    occasional tendency to elliptical motion, and the clock is otherwise
                    troublesome. In the Repsolds’ driving clock of the 30-inch Pulkowa refractor the
                    conical pendulum is reversed, being a heavy weight at the top of a vertical
                    steel rod, kept in conical rotation by a pin at its upper end, which enters a
                    slot in a revolving arm. The rod is in fact a spring of such a form as to cause
                    the revolutions to be nearly or perfectly isochronous whatever the angle of the
                    cone of motion; the clock is therefore, within limits, independent of the power
                    applied to it or the force to be overcome.</p>
                <p>Many forms of air-fans have been suggested; probably the best is the modification
                    of Foucault’s proposed by Hilger (see <hi rend="italic">Monthly Notices
                    R.A.S.,</hi> vol. xlvi. p. 155), which is shown in fig. 39. E is the axis of
                    rotation; C and D are fans that are pulled towards the spindle E by chronometer
                    springs in the boxes A and B. The fans fly out symmetrically when the velocity
                    exceeds 25 or 30 revolutions per second; the increased resistance of the air
                    thus produced checks the velocity of rotation. By means of the small weights W,
                    W attached to arms on the fans Hilger states that it is possible to adjust this
                    governor so that it shall even lose by an increase of the driving weight.</p>
                <p>For the most refined work none of these governors can be said to be perfect; none
                    would be even tolerable as a clock for astronomical time-keeping purposes. It is
                    possible that the elaborate Greenwich driving clock may give better results, but
                    its construction is too complicated to be frequently repeated (see, for a
                    description of it, the Greenwich <hi rend="italic">Observations for</hi> 1868).
                    The only way in which nearly perfect uniform motion can be realized is to
                    control it in some way from a swinging pendulum. This is done in Bond’s spring
                    governor<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Konkoly, <hi
                    rend="italic">Practische Anleitung zur Anstellung astron. Beobachtungen,</hi>
                    Brunswick, 1883.</p></note> and by Grubb, the latter employing the arm of a
                    remontoir train connected with a dead-beat escapement to bring friction to bear
                    on a revolving plate connected with the axis of his governor (see fig. 38). The
                    best existing driving clock is probably that at Lord Crawford’s observatory at
                    Dun Echt.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Notices R.A.S.,</hi> November 1873.</p></note> An account
                    of its performance is given by Dr Copeland in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Viertel-jahrsschr. astron. Gesellsch.,</hi> 16 Jahrg., p. 305. In this clock
                    gain of a hundredth of a second, or even less, introduces increased friction on
                    the revolving disk during the next second, or until the gain has been corrected.
                    A still more perfect clock could probably be made on a similar plan by
                    abolishing the clock weight and making the origin of power an electromotor, the
                    current being cut off in a way similar to that in the Dun Echt clock if the
                    clock of continuous motion gets in advance of the ordinary clock.</p>
