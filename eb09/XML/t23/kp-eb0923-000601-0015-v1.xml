                <p><label type="entry">TABERNACLES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Feast of</hi></label>. The
                    original character of this Hebrew feast, celebrated at the close of the
                    agricultural year as a thanksgiving for the produce of the seasons, but
                    especially for the vintage and olive harvest, has been explained in <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Pentateuch,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 511. As such it is
                    described in the old law of Exod. xxiii. 16, under the name of “the feast of
                    ingathering, at the end of the year” (which, in the old Hebrew calendar, ran
                    from autumn to autumn), “when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the
                    field” (comp. Exod. xxxiv. 22). The same feast is spoken of in Deut. xvi. 13 as
                    “the feast of booths” (E.V. “tabernacles,” whence the current name of the
                    feast), when “thou hast gathered in thy corn and wine” from the corn-floor and
                    the wine-press. No explanation is here given of the name “feast of booths”; but
                    after the exile it was understood that during this feast the people assembled at
                    Jerusalem were to live in booths constructed of branches of trees (Lev. xxiii.
                    39 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> Neh. viii. 14 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> The
                    passage in Nehemiah, describing the celebration of the feast in 444 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> serves as a commentary on the post-exilic law in
                    Leviticus, and from it we learn that the use of booths on that occasion had no
                    foundation in traditional usage, but w as based directly on the law, which then
                    for the first time became generally known.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The expression that the Israelites had not done so since
                            the days of Joshua means that there was no recollection of their having
                            ever done so; for of course it is assumed that Joshua carried out every
                            direction of the law.</p></note> According to the law in question, the
                    booths were to be a memorial of the wilderness wandering (Lev. xxiii. 43), but
                    of this there is no hint in Deuteronomy; and, while it is quite in the style of
                    the later law to attach a new historical reference to an old name like “feast of
                    booths,” it is certain from Exodus that the feast had originally agricultural
                    and not historical significance. As such it is exactly parallel to the vintage
                    feasts of other ancient nations, <hi rend="italic">e.y.,</hi> to the Athenian
                    Oschophoria. And, in particular, it is noteworthy that in Judges ix. 27 we find
                    a vintage feast at Shechem among the Canaanites, from whom the Israelites first
                    learned the ways of agricultural life, and from whom so much of the popular
                    religion was copied. To acts of worship nominally addressed to Jehovah, but
                    really to the Canaanite Baalim, Hosea expressly reckons rites celebrated “on all
                    cornfloors” (ix. 1), expressing thanks for divine gifts of corn, wine, and oil
                    (ii. 8 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> and in their context these allusions leave no
                    doubt that the prophet refers, in part at least, to autumn feasts, in which
                    Jehovah worship was mingled with Canaanite elements (comp. Wellhausen, <hi
                        rend="italic">Prol. zur Gesch. Isr.,</hi> cap. 3, ii.; Eng. trans., p. 92
                        <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> These feasts were local in character, but in
                    northern Israel there was a great autumn feast at the royal sanctuary at Bethel
                    (1 Kings xii. 33), as even in the days of Solomon there was such a feast at
                    Jerusalem (1 Kings viii. 2). In the nature of things the local feasts were the
                    older, and it was the fame of great shrines that gradually tended to draw
                    worshippers from a distance to temples like those of Jerusalem and Bethel.
                    Finally, the Deuteronomic law of the one sanctuary and the course of events
                    which made that law the practical rule of the remnant of Israel put an end to
                    all local religious feasts, but at the same time obscured the old significance
                    of the festal cycle, and made room for the historical interpretation of the
                    celebrations, now concentrated at the temple, which prevailed among the later
                    Jews (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Passover</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Pentecost).</hi> In their later form all the yearly feasts have exact times
                    and rules. In Deuteronomy the autumn feast is not yet tied to a day—it could
                    hardly be so while it was still essentially a harvest thanksgiving—but in the
                    priestly legislation it is fixed to commence on the fifteenth day of the seventh
                    month (Lev. xxiii. 34). In Deuteronomy the feast lasts seven days; Lev. xxiii.
                    36 adds an eighth, and this day ultimately became the most important (John vii.
                    37).</p>
                <p>If we accept the conclusion that the autumn festival was originally a vintage
                    feast celebrated in local sanctuaries, the name “feast of booths” admits of a
                    natural explanation. The Canaanite feast at Shechem and the Hebrew feast at
                    Shiloh (Judges xxi. 21) were partly celebrated abroad in the vineyards, and
                    Hosea also knows such feasts on the open corn-floors. That it was usual to go
                    forth and live in booths during the vintage may be concluded from Isa. i. 8; the
                    same practice still prevails at Hebron (Robinson, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.
                        Res.,</hi> ii. 81). If it was these booths erected among the vineyards that
                    originally gave their name to the feast, we can understand how the book of
                    Nehemiah recognizes the erection of booths within the city of Jerusalem as an
                    innovation. No doubt at all feasts where there was a great concourse of visitors
                    many would be compelled to live in tents; this seems to have been the case even
                    in old Israel (Hos. xii. 9). But that is quite a different thing from the later
                    observance, in which booths or bowers had to be made and used even by those who
                    had houses of their own.</p>
