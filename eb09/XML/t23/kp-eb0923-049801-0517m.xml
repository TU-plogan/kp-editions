                    practice of employing a mark to denote the goods of a particular trader (not
                    necessarily the manufacturer) grew out of the use of signs, which, first affixed

                    England in the reign of Elizabeth. The first reported case was in 1783, when
                    Lord Mansfield decided that the sale by the defendants of a certain medicine
                    under the name or mark of the plaintiff was a fraud. By other decisions it was
                    affirmed that the use of another’s trade-mark was actionable, even without the
                    intent to defraud. The law, however, remained in an unsatisfactory condition
                    till, by the Merchandise Marks Act in 1862, it was made a misdemeanour to forge
                    or counterfeit a trade-mark, while penalties were inflicted for the sale of
                    articles bearing a forged mark.</p>
                <p>In 1875 the Trade Marks Registration Act established for the first time a
                    registry of trade-marks in Britain, greatly facilitating the proof of title. A
                    more precise definition of a trade-mark was also provided. In 1883 this Act was
                    repealed by the Patents, Designs, and Trade Marks Act, in which its principal
                    provisions were incorporated. All proceedings for the registration of
                    trade-marks are now regulated by the Patents Act. A trade-mark may be a name
                    printed or otherwise delineated in some particular or distinctive manner, or a
                    signature, or a device, mark, brand, &amp;c. Registration is compulsory, at
                    least in the sense that the owner cannot prevent infringement or sue for damages
                    for infringement unless he has registered, though it would appear that this
                    disability exists only in the case of a mark capable of being registered under
                    the Act. There are certain <hi rend="italic">indicia</hi> which cannot be
                    registered because they do not fall within the definition of a trade-mark, but
                    which may yet be protected at equity. Registration is deemed equivalent to
                    public use of the mark, and, after the expiration of five years, is conclusive
                    evidence of right to exclusive use. Applications for registration have to be
                    addressed to the comptroller of patents; should he refuse to register, there is
                    an appeal to the Board of Trade. If there is opposition, the matter goes to the
                    High Court of Justice. Registration holds good for fourteen years, at the end of
                    which time it has to be renewed. Special provision is made in the Act for the
                    retention of certain of the ancient privileges of the Cutlers Company of
                    Sheffield. The total number of marks now upon the register is nearly 50,000.</p>
                <p>The Customs Consolidation Act, 1876, forbids the importation of articles of
                    foreign manufacture bearing any mark purporting to be the mark of manufacturers
                    resident in the United Kingdom, or stating or implying that such articles were
                    manufactured in the United Kingdom. The Merchandise Marks Act, 1887,
                    consolidated and amended the law of offences relating to trade-marks and trade
                    descriptions. It repealed the Act of 1862 and replaced it by fuller provisions.
                    It is now an offence to forge a trade-mark, to falsely apply to goods any
                    trade-mark or any mark so nearly resembling a trade-mark as to deceive, to make
                    any die, &amp;c., for the purpose of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n518/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0518-0499"/> forging or for being used for forging a
                    trade-mark, to apply any false trade description to goods, to dispose of or have
                    in possession any die, &amp;c., for the purpose of forging a trade-mark, or to
                    cause any of the above-mentioned things to be done. There are special sections
                    in the Act dealing with its application to watches and watch-cases. Where a
                    watch-case is of foreign manufacture it must, if stamped at an assay office in
                    the United Kingdom, bear a mark differing from the mark placed upon watches
                    manufactured in the United Kingdom. A warranty is implied in the sale of goods
                    bearing a trade-mark or trade description. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Warranty.</hi></p>
                <p>In most foreign countries provisions have long existed for the registration of
                    trade-marks; and they also form one of the classes of” “industrial property” for
                    the protection of which an international convention was formed in 1883. This
                    convention now includes sixteen states,—the more important being Belgium,
                    France, Great Britain, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
                    Switzerland, and the United States. The subjects of all the contracting states
                    enjoy in each state the same rights and privileges as that state grants to its
                    own subjects for the protection of trade-marks. Registration also in one of the
                    states confers certain rights of priority in the others.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> The legislation of the different States
                    and Territories varies considerably, some providing for the registration of
                    trade-marks either with or without protection for unregistered trade-marks,
                    while others provide only for protection without registration. On March 3, 1881,
                    Congress passed an Act “to authorize the registration of trade-marks and to
                    protect the same,” which provides that owners of trade-marks used in commerce
                    with foreign nations or with the Indian tribes, provided such owners be
                    domiciled in the United States or located in any foreign country or tribe which
                    affords similar privileges to citizens of the United States, may obtain
                    registration of trade-marks under the Act. Registration is not compulsory;
                    failure to register a trade-mark, or to renew registration, does not deprive the
                    owner of any remedy he might have at law or in equity; and the courts will,
                    generally speaking, protect the unregistered equally with the registered.</p>
