                    Avon, and on the Midland and Great Western RailAvays, 15 miles south of
                    Worcester and 126 north-Avest of London. It has three principal streets, which
                    are regularly built and Avell paved. The Severn is crossed by an iron bridge
                    with a flattened arch of 170 feet span, erected by Telford in 1824. Of the great

                    of the ancient hermitage and Saxon monastery, there only remain the gate and
                    part of the cloisters. The abbey church, consecrated in 1125, is a magnificent
                    specimen of Early Norman. This elaborate cruciform building consists of nave and
                    side aisles, with transepts united by a grand central tower richly arcaded. The
                    choir terminates in an apse and is surrounded by an ambulatory. One of the most
                    remarkable features of the building is the unique western front, the central
                    part of which is occupied by one vast arch extending from the ground to the
                    roof. Originally it was filled in with Norman windows, but these were removed in
                    the 14th century, when the w hole building underwent restoration in the Middle
                    Decorated style, of which it is one of the finest existing examples. The nave
                    was refilled by tracery windows, and stone groining was substituted for the
                    carved wooden ceiling, a like transformation taking place in the transepts. The
                    old Norman columns in the choir still exist; but above them rises a grand
                    superstructure of Decorated work. The elegant clerestory windows are of the 14th
                    century, with stained glass of the same date. The ambulatory was rebuilt some
                    distance farther out, and from it projected a beautiful series of chapels. The
                    elaborate tombs include those of Sir Robert Fitz-Hamon, the De Spensers, Alan
                    prior of Canterbury, Sir Guy de Brien, and the vault of George duke of Clarence
                    (murdered in the Tower) and his wife Isabella. Edward, prince of Wales, slain
                    after the battle of Tewkesbury (1471) by the Yorkists, is also buried in the
                    church, which has undergone an extensive process of restoration under the
                    direction of Sir Gilbert Scott. In the High Street there are several ancient
                    timbered and gabled houses. Remains of an ancient wall have been discovered
                    adjoining the town. The principal modern buildings are the town-hall, the
                    philharmonic hall, and the corn exchange. There is a free grammar-school and a
                    number of charities, including the dispensary, the rural hospital, and Queen
                    Mary’s, Barnes’s, Richardson’s, and Russell’s almshouses. Formerly Tewkesbury
                    had a woollen trade and an important mustard manufacture, but it is now chiefly
                    dependent on its agricultural trade. The population of the municipal borough
                    (area, 2619 acres) in 1871 was 5409, and in 1881 5100.</p>
                <p>The town is supposed to derive its name from Theoc, a Saxon monk, who founded a
                    hermitage here in the end of the 7th century, which was changed into a monastery
                    by the duke of Mercia in 715, and rebuilt by Sir Robert Fitz-Hamon in 1102. On
                    the death of Fitz-Hamon in 1147 the manor passed to the De Clares, who became
                    merged in the De Spensers, they in turn in the Beauchamps, and the Beauchamps in
                    the Nevilles. At Tewkesbury took place, 4th May 1471, the battle between the
                    Yorkists and Lancastrians which placed the crown on the head of Edward IV.
                    During the Civil War the town was occupied by the Parliamentarians, who were
                    driven out by the Royalists; but it was surprised and captured by the former in
                    1644, after which it remained in their possession. Tewkesbury was first
                    incorporated by Elizabeth in 1574, and when James I. sold the manor to the
                    corporation in 1609 he granted it a new charter with extended privileges. This
                    being lost during the Civil War, a new charter was granted by Charles II.
                    Between 1692 and 1698 the town was without a corporation, but a new charter was
                    granted by William III., which remained the governing charter until the passing
                    of the Municipal Act. Until 1867 Tewkesbury returned two members to the House of
                    Commons; from 1867 to 1885 it returned one; and in 1885 it became merged in the
                    north or Tewkesbury division of Gloucestershire.</p>
