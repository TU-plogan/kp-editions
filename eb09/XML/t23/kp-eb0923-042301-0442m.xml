                <p><label type="entry">TOBACCO</label> consists of the 1eaves of several species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Hicotiaηa</hi> (nat. ord. <hi rend="italic">Solanaceae),</hi>
                    variously prepared for use as a narcotic. While it is principally manufactured
                    for smoking, a large amount is also prepared for chewing, and to a more limited
                    extent it is taken in the form of snuff. Under one or other of these forms the
                    use of tobacco is more widely spread than is that of any other narcotic or
                    stimulant.</p>
                <p>Although the fact has been controverted, there cannot be a doubt that the
                    knowledge of tobacco and its uses came to the rest of the world from America. In
                    November 1492 a party sent out by Columbus from the vessels of his first
                    expedition to explore the island of Cuba brought back information that they had
                    seen people who carried a lighted firebrand to kindle fire, and perfumed
                    themselves with certain herbs which they carried along with them. The habit of
                    snuff-taking was observed and described by Ramon Pane, a Franciscan, who
                    accompanied Columbus on his second voyage (1494-6), and the practice of
                    tobacco-chewing was first seen by the Spaniards on the coast of South America in
                    1502. As the continent of America was opened up and explored, it became evident
                    that the consumption of tobacco, especially by smoking, was a universal and
                    immemorial usage, in many cases bound up with the most significant and solemn
                    tribal ceremonies.</p>
                <p>The term tobacco appears not to have been a commonly used original name for the
                    plant, and it has come to us from a peculiar instrument used for inhaling its
                    smoke by the inhabitants of Hispaniola (San Domingo). The instrument, described
                    by Oviedo <hi rend="italic">(Histoña de las Indias</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Occidentales,</hi> Salamanca, 1535), consisted of a small hollow wooden tube
                    shaped like a Y, the two points of which being inserted in the nose of the
                    smoker, the other end was held into the smoke of burning tobacco, and thus the
                    fumes were inhaled. This apparatus the natives called “tabaco but it must be
                    said that the smoking pipe of the continental tribes was entirely different from
                    the imperfect tabaco of the Caribees. Benzoni, on the other hand, whose <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in America</hi> (1542-56) were published in 1565, says
                    that the Mexican name of the herb was “tabacco.”</p>
                <p>The tobacco plant itself was first brought to Europe in 1558 by Francisco
                    Fernandes, a physician who had been sent by Philip II. of Spain to investigate
                    the products of Mexico. By the French ambassador to Portugal, Jean Nicot, seeds
                    were sent from the Peninsula to the queen, Catherine de’ Medici. The services
                    rendered by Nicot in spreading a knowledge of the plant have been commemorated
                    in the scientific name of the genus <hi rend="italic">Nicotiaηa.</hi> At first
                    the plant was supposed to possess almost miraculous healing powers, and was
                    designated “herba panacea,” “herba santa,” “sana sancta Indorum”; “divine
                    tobacco” it is called by Spenser, and “our holy herb nicotian” by William Lilly.
                    While the plant came to Europe through Spain, the habit of smoking it was
                    initiated and spread through English example. Ralph Lane, the first governor of
                    Virginia, and Sir Francis Drake brought with them in 1586, from that first
                    American possession of the English crown, the implements and materials of
                    tobacco smoking, which they handed over to Sir Walter Raleigh. Lane is credited
                    with having been the first English smoker, and through the influence and example
                    of the illustrious Raleigh, who “tooke a pipe of tobacco a little before he went
                    to the scaffolde,” the habit became rooted among Elizabethan courtiers. During
                    the 17th century the indulgence in tobacco spread with marvellous rapidity
                    throughout all nations, and that in the face of the most resolute opposition of
                    statesmen and priests, the “counter-blaste” of a great monarch, penal enactments
                    of the most severe description, the knout, excommunication, and capital
                    punishment.</p>
                <p>The species of <hi rend="italic">Fhicοtiαnα</hi> number about fifty, but those of
                    which the leaves are used as sources of, tobacco are few. With the exception of
                    two species, one native of New Caledonia, the other proper to Australia, they
                    are all of American origin. They form two well-defined groups, the first of
                    which is characterized by the possession of an elongated corolla tube, red in
                    colour, the plants having a single unbranched stalk which attains a height of
                    from 5 to 7 feet; while to the second group belong such as have a swollen
                    corolla tube of a greenish-yellow colour, and a much-branched stem reaching a
                    height of only from 2 to 5 feet. The type of the first group is the Virginian
                    Tobacco, <hi rend="italic">N. Tabacum,</hi> while the best known representative
                    of the second is the Green Tobacco, A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi
                    rend="italic">rustica.</hi> These two species, together with their numerous
                    varieties, and with the Persian Tobacco, <hi rend="italic">N. persica,—</hi> the
                    source of the famous Tumbeki or Shiraz tobacco,—are the sole sources of
                    commercial tobacco. A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tabacum</hi> is the species from which the tobaccos of Cuba, the United States,
                    and the Philippine Islands, and the Latakia of Turkey, are derived, and it is
                    thus the source of not only the greater proportion of the tobacco of commerce
                    but also the most highly prized and valuable of its varieties. A <hi

                    Hungary, and the East Indies.</p>
                <p>The Virginian tobacco-plant, W. <hi rend="italic">Tabacιιm,</hi> is a coarse
                    rankgrowing annual, with a simple unbranched cylindrical stem which attains a
                    height of 6 feet and upwards, terminating in a panicle of pink flowers. It has
                    alternate simple oblong lanceolate leaves, those at the lower part of the stem
                    being slightly stalked, and of large size, reaching to two feet in length, while
                    the upper are semi-amplexicaul and of variable outline. The seeds are brown in
                    colour, with a rough surface, of minute size, and exceedingly numerous, as many
                    as 40,000 having been counted on a single plant. The whole of the green parts of
                    the plant are covered with long soft hairs which exude a viscid juice, giving
                    the surface a moist glutinous feeling. The hairs are multicellular, and of two
                    kinds, one branching and ending in a fine point, while the other, unbranched,
                    terminates in a clump of small cells. Stomata occur on both surfaces of the
                    leaves, and, with the peculiar hair structure, render the microscopic appearance
                    of the plant highly characteristic.</p>
                <p>Tobacco will flourish over wide areas and in very dissimilar climates, but it is
                    best suited for regions having a mean temperature of not less than 40° F. and
                    where early autumn frosts do not occur. It develops the most highly appreciated
                    qualities in tropical lands possessed of a comparatively dry climate. Tobacco is
                    a most exhausting crop, and requires rich and abundant manuring, the character
                    of which exercises a distinct influence on the quality of the product. A crop
                    grown under such widely different conditions of climate and agriculture as is
                    the case with tobacco must of necessity be subject to varied treatment both in
                    cultivation and in curing, and here we can refer only to the general features of
                    the growing and securing of the crop.</p>
                <p>In European cultivation, the tobacco-seed is sown in a hotbed about the end of
                    March. The seed-beds are kept covered with damp straw or withered leaves till
                    the seedlings appear above the ground, after which the covering is removed, and,
                    to protect the young plants from frost, to which they are extremely sensitive,
                    the beds are covered at night with mats. So soon as the plants can be handled,
                    they are picked out in rows in a garden bed, where they remain protected from
                    night frost till they have developed five or six leaves and have a height of 3
                    to 4 inches. They are then ready for transplanting, by preference in moist
                    weather, into prepared drills 20 to 25 inches apart in the field. The
                    transplanting is done about the end of May, or earlier in localities free from
                    night frosts, and in dry weather the field is plentifully soused with liquid
                    manure. The plants are carefully weeded and attended to, and the soil is
                    frequently stirred with narrow hoes until the period when they show symptoms of
                    flowering. This may be when they are only 3 feet high, or not until« they have
                    reached their proper heightjof 6 or 8 feet; but the flowers must not be allowed
                    to form, except in the case of a few plants left purposely for seed. To obtain
                    fine and strong leaves on the plant is the great object of the cultivator, and a
                    fine tobacco plant ought to have from eight to twelve large succulent leaves.
                    Cultivators commonly diminish the number of leaves by “topping” or breaking off
                    the top, under the idea that the remaining ones will aflbrd the strongest
                    tobacco. Suckers or shoots near the root are carefully removed, and everything's
                    done to concentrate the strength of the plant in the leaves. Every leaf injured
                    by insects is removed, and the crop is watched until the leaves have a yellowish
                    tint and begin to droop, when they are fit to be gathered. This is usually in
                    September, so that the plants, from the time of their insertion on the mounds,
                    have occupied the ground four months, during which time they have been subject
                    to many vicissitudes,—from the attacks of insects, from a disease called
                    “firing,” caused by the long continuance of very wet or very dry weather, and
                    from the occurrence of autumn frosts while the crop is yet in the field.</p>
                <p>In the harvesting of the tobacco crop several distinct’methods are followed. In
                    ordinary European cultivation the ripe leaves are separated from the standing
                    stalks in the field. The three lower root-leaves are first stripped off and
                    laid, face downward, around the root to wilt, after which they are bundled and
                    carried to the barn. Afterwards the remainder of the leaves are separated,
                    working from the top downwards, and, similarly, they are spread on the ground
                    till by λvilting they lose their brittleness. They are then bundled and packed,
                    tops upward, closely on the floor of the barn for some time to sweat, by which
                    the uniform ripening and subsequent favourable drying are promoted. The bundles
                    are carefully watched to prevent overheating, which would blacken and injure the
                    leaves. In the tobacco-growing districts of the United States the entire plant
                    is cut down in the field close to the ground, then the stalks are spitted on
                    long rods or laths, care being taken to keep the leaves from touching each
                    other, and on these rods they are carried and hung in the barn or curing-house
                    for drying.</p>
                <p>The curing of the leaves which follows has for its objects the drying and
                    preservation of the tobacco, and, by a process of slow fermentation, the
                    modification of certain of the leaf constituents, and the development of the
                    characteristic aroma of the substance. Subject to various minor modifications,
                    the process of curing is carried out either slowly by the air-cure process or
                    rapidly by firecuring. The European cultivators, who generally cure by the slow
                    process, either spit the leaves through the middle on a long rod or string them
                    on a cord, taking care to keep each leaf from touching its neighbour. These
                    rods∣or cords of leaves are suspended in a barn or curing-shed in a way which
                    allows the free circulation of the air, and at the same time brings the whole
                    contents of the shed equally under the drying influence of the air currents.
                    When the weather is clear and dry, free circulation of the air is in every way
                    promoted, but on humid days the moist air is excluded and sometimes artificial
                    heat is required to prevent mildew and rotting of the leaves. Under favourable
                    circumstances the tobacco will be dry and ready for further treatment in from
                    six to eight weeks, and the leaves should then have a fine bright warm brown
                    colour.</p>
                <p>In the United States the quick-drying process by artificial heat is employed
                    principally for the preparation of export tobacco. Formerly the heat was
                    obtained by means of an open charcoal fire within the curing-barn, but now the
                    structure is heated by a system of flues which permits of the burning of any
                    kind of fuel. For dark shipping tobacco, the entire plants, cut down close to
                    the ground, are immediately housed, and at once dried off. Red shipping
                    qualities are prepared by leaving the cut stems either in the field or hung on
                    scaffolds in the barns for a few days to wilt and wither in the air, after which
                    they are dried by artificial heat. In the treatment of both dark and red kinds
                    the temperature within the barn is gradually raised till it reaches 170° F., and
                    the drying is complete in from four to five days.</p>
                <p>By whichever way treated, the tobacco-leaf at this stage is brittle, and cannot
                    be handled without crumbling to powder. The contents of the barn are therefore
                    left till moist weather occurs, and then by the admission of atmospheric air the
                    leaf blades absorb moisture and become soft and pliant. In this condition the
                    leaves are stripped from the stems, sorted into qualities, such as “lugs,” or
                    lower leaves, “firsts,” and “seconds.” These are made up into <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n444/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0444-0425"/> “hands,” or small bundles of from six to twelve
                    leaves. Each bundle is tied round with a separate leaf, and in this condition
                    the tobacco is ready for bulking for fermentation.</p>
                <p>For fermentation the tobacco, whether in bundles, hands, or separate leaves, is
                    piled up or bulked on the floor in a barn into a solid stack to the height of 5
                    or 6 feet. Within this stack a process of fermentation is quickly set up, and
                    the temperature of the mass rises steadily till it reaches about 130° F. Great
                    care is now taken to prevent overheating, and to secure the uniform fermentation
                    of all the tobacco. The pile is from time to time taken down and rebuilt, the
                    tobacco from the top going to the bottom, and that exposed at the edges being
                    turned in to the centre. In from three to five weeks the fermentation should be
                    sufficiently carried out, and the leaves then have a nice uniform brown colour.
                    The cured stack may in this condition be piled up in store without fear of
                    further fermentative activity, till, with increasing summer heat, it is subject
                    to the May sweat, which renders further watchfulness necessary.</p>
                <p>The components of tobacco, like those of all vegetable matters, arrange
                    themselves under the three heads of water, mineral acids and bases (which pass
                    into the ash on combustion), and organic substances. According to an
                    investigation carried out by Beauchef in Gay-Lussac’s laboratory, the amount of
                    ash from 100 parts of matter dried at 100° C. is in the roots 6 to 8, in the
                    stems 10 to 13, and in the ribs and leaves 18 to 22 per cent. The greater part
                    of the ash consists of insoluble salts, principally carbonate of lime. The
                    soluble part consists largely of potash salts (KC1, K <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> C0 <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi>, K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> SO <hi

                    remarkable that tobacco contains no soda. In addition to the mineral salts
                    proper, tobacco contains salts of ammonia and nitrates. In the leaf the
                    proportion of nitrates is greater in the rib than in the laminae. In the former
                    it may amount to as much as 10 per cent, (calculating the nitric acid as KNO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>). According to Schloesing <hi rend="italic">{Ann. Chim.
                    Phys.,</hi> [3], xl. 479), the proportion of (combined) nitric acid in tobacco
                    has nothing to do with its combustibility, that is, the length of time a lighted
                    cigar will glow spontaneously. This quality is a function chiefly of the potash
                    present in combination with' organic acids. An incombustible tobacco, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a tobacco which does not keep a glowing ash, contains
                    its organic acids in the form of lime and magnesia salts. The explanation is
                    that, while organic potash salts, being fusible, yield when heated a porous
                    charcoal which glows readily, the corresponding infusible lime salts yield a
                    compact charcoal which is far less combustible. A combustible tobacco can be
                    rendered incombustible by the incorporation of sulphate or chloride of calcium
                    or magnesium. By cultivation experiments in a potash-free soil, it has been
                    ascertained that chloride of potassium used as a manure does not add to the
                    organic potash salts in the leaves, but the sulphate, carbonate, and nitrate do
                    give up their potash for the formation of organic salts.</p>
                <p>Subjoined is an enumeration of the proximate organic components of tobacco
                    leaves, and their relative proportions in 100 parts, according to the numerous
                    analyses made in the laboratories of the French state tobacco factories :—</p>

                <p>Essential oil,—according to Schloesing, an important element in the flavour of
                    tobacco, although its proportion is exceedingly small.</p>
                <p>Nicotianine, a solid camphor-like body to which, according to other authorities,

                <p>Sugar, little in the leaves, more in the stems; in the fermentation it
                    disappears.</p>

                <p>Albuminoids, calculated from the nitrogen not present as nicotine, nitrates, or
                    ammonia, about 25 per cent.</p>
                <p>Excepting the nicotine, the several organic components of the leaves develop,
                    roughly speaking, <hi rend="italic">pari passu</hi> until fructification, when
                    certain components are attracted to the fruit, suffering chemical changes while
                    so moving. The nicotine determines the strength of a tobacco, but not its
                    flavour or aroma. The manure supplied to a tobacco field does not increase the
                    proportion of nicotine, but affects only the weight of the crop. The percentage
                    of nicotine in the leaves may to some extent be modified in cultivation,—plants
                    wide apart developing few leaves, but these thick, fleshy, and rich in nicotine,
                    while closely packed plants throw out numerous but thin and membranous leaves
                    having little nicotine. The proportion of nicotine present increases with the
                    age of the plant. Schloesing found in leaves at various stages of growth the
                    following percentage of nicotine :—May 25 (very young leaves), 0'79; July 18,
                    1*21; Aug. 6, 193; Aug. 27, 2 27; Sept. 8, 3 36; Sept. 25, 4∙32.</p>
                <p>Regarding the changes which take place in the manufactured leaf, we take the case
                    of snuff, because with it the chemical changes are carried farthest, and yet,
                    qualitatively speaking, they are of the same nature as those which smoking
                    tobacco undergoes. In the fermentation begun in curing and continued in the
                    sauced leaf, the malic and citric acids and the nicotine undergo partial
                    oxidation. The oxalate of lime and the pectates remain almost unchanged, and
                    there are formed, of intermediate (not fully oxidized) bodies, ammonia, acetic
                    acid, and black humic acid, the last giving to snuff its dark colour. A little
                    methyl-alcohol is also at the same time formed. At this stage the tobacco-leaf
                    is acid in reaction; but after it is powdered, and again submitted for a
                    prolonged period to a slow fermentation in air-tight boxes, it becomes decidedly
                    alkaline by the ammonia, because, while acetic acid continues to be formed and
                    the ammonia and nicotine remain what they are, the malic and citric acids are
                    progressively destroyed. Unless snuff contains free ammonia it is “flat,” and
                    destitute of pungency.</p>
                <p>As to the composition of tobacco smoke, numerous investigations have been made.
                    Kissling <hi rend="italic">{Dvng. Polyt. Jour.,</hi> ccliv. 234-246),
                    experimenting on cigars, found that a large proportion of the nicotine passes
                    unaltered into the smoke. Dealing with a tobacco containing 3 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 75 per cent, of nicotine, he recovered from the smoke
                    52 Ό2 per cent, of the total nicotine consumed, while in the unconsumed remains
                    of the tobacco the proportion of nicotine was increased to 5'03 per cent. With a
                    second sample of tobacco, having likewise 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75
                    per cent, of nicotine, the smoke yielded only 27 ’ 83 per cent, of the total
                    nicotine consumed, and the percentage in the unconsumed remains was raised to 4
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 51. From a tobacco containing only 0’30 of
                    nicotine he recovered 84’23 of nicotine in the smoke. The composition of tobacco
                    smoke is highly complex, but beyond nicotine the only substances found in
                    appreciable quantities are the lower members of the picoline series.</p>
                <p>The commercial varieties and the sources of supply of leaftobacco are exceedingly
                    numerous. Special qualities of tobacco, as of wines, &amp;c., belong to
                    particular localities, outside of which they cannot be cultivated. These
                    tobaccos are therefore natural monopolies. Moreover, as is also the case with
                    wines, the crops vary in richness and delicacy of flavour with the seasons of
                    their growth, so that in certain years the produce is of much greater value than
                    in others. Further, the properties of certain classes of tobacco render them
                    specially suitable for cigar-making. Others are best fitted for smoking in
                    pipes; and there are numerous qualities which are valuable for snuff-making.
                    National tastes and habits again frequently determine the destination of
                    tobacco. Thus heavy, strong, and full-flavoured cigars and tobaccos are in
                    favour in the United Kingdom, while on the Continent lighter and more
                    brisk-burning qualities are sought after, and the materials consumed in the
                    kalians of Persia and the East are not suitable for use in the short pipes of
                    the Western nations.</p>
                <p>Of cigar tobaccos the most valuable qualities in the world are cultivated in the
                    north-west portions of the island of Cuba. The district of Vuelta Abajo is the
                    source of the highest quality, after which comes the produce of Partidas and
                    Vuelta Arriba. A large portion of the tobacco is made into cigars in the island,
                    but considerable quantities are also exported to Europe and the United States
                    for mixing with commoner qualities to give Havana character to the home-made
                    cigars. In recent years a large export of tobacco from Brazil, especially from
                    the province of Bahia, has sprung up, most of which goes to Germany and Austria
                    for cigar-making. The “seed-leaf" tobacco of Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and
                    Ohio, grown from Havana seed, is devoted to cigar-making in the United States.
                    In the East the most important cigar-tobacco region is the Philippine Islands,
                    from which come the well-known Manila cheroots and cigars and a large quantity
                    of leaf-tobacco of distinctive aroma. Immense quantities of cigar tobacco are
                    also exported from Java and Sumatra, most of which passes through the markets of
                    Amsterdam and Rotterdam. In the Madras presidency and in Burmah cigar tobacco is
                    largely cultivated, the strong heavy qualities of which are well known to the
                    British public in the Burmese, Lunka, and Dindigul cheroots.</p>
                <p>Of ordinary smoking tobacco, among the most esteemed qualities are Varinas or
                    kanaster, grown in the districts of Varinas, Merida, Margarita, &amp;c., in
                    Venezuela. The name kanaster, which covers several varieties of tobacco from
                    South America, is given on account of the wicker baskets (Span, <hi
                    rend="italic">kanwstr(f</hi> in which the material is packed for export. The
                    tobacco regions of the United States—Kentucky, Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio—send
                    great supplies of smoking leaf of various qualities into the European market,
                    especially into the United Kingdom, which is almost exclusively supplied from
                    these sources. Smoking tobaccos of the highest quality, rivalling indeed the
                    cigar tobacco of Cuba in flavour and value, are grown in Turkey, and specially
                    in the province of Salonica. The famous Latakia of the English smokers is
                    produced in the province of Saida, in the northern part of Syria (see <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0445-0426"/><hi rend="smallcaps">Latakia),</hi> and thoughout
                    Asiatic Turkey there is an extensive cultivation and export of smoking
                    tobacco.</p>
                <p>In the manufacture of tobacco for smoking, we have to do with the numerous forms
                    of tobacco used for smoking in pipes, embracing cut smoking mixtures, cake or
                    plug, and roll or spun tobacco. Under this heading come also the cigar and
                    cigarette manufacture.</p>
                <p>The raw material in the warehouses is of various qualities: some is strong,
                    rough, and harsh, and so is unfit for ordinary smoking; other samples are mild
                    and fine, with aromatic and pleasant flavour, but devoid of strength. By a
                    proper mixing and blending the manufacturer is enabled to prepare the smoking
                    mixture which is desirable for his purpose; but certain of the rough, bitter
                    qualities cannot be manufactured without a preliminary treatment by which their
                    intense disagreeable taste is modified. The storing of such tobacco for a
                    lengthened period matures and deprives it of harshness, and the same result may
                    be artificially hastened by macerating the leaves in water acidulated with
                    hydrochloric acid, and washing them out with pure water. The most efficient
                    means, however, of improving strong, ill-tasting tobacco is by renewed
                    fermentation artificially induced by moisture and heat.</p>
                <p>The manufacturer having prepared his mixture of leaves, proceeds to damp them,
                    pure water alone being used in the United Kingdom, whereas on the Continent and
                    in America certain “sauces” are employed, which consist of mixtures of aromatic
                    substances, sugar, liquorice, common salt, and saltpetre, &amp;c., dissolved in
                    water. The primary object is to render the leaves soft and pliant; the use of
                    the sauces is to improve the flavour and burning qualities of the leaves used.
                    When uniformly damped, the leaves are separately opened out and smoothed, the
                    midrib, if not already removed, is torn out, except when “bird’s eye” cut is to
                    be made, in which mixture the midrib gives the peculiar “bird’s eye” appearance.
                    The prepared tobacco, while still moist and pliant, is pressed between cylinders
                    into a light cake, and cut into fine uniform shreds by a machine analogous to
                    the chaff-cutter. The cut tobacco is now roasted, partly with the view of
                    driving off moisture and bringing the material into a condition for keeping, but
                    also partly to improve its smoking quality. The roasting is most simply effected
                    by spreading it on heated slabs, on which it is constantly turned; but such a
                    method does not yield uniform results, and it exposes the workers to a most
                    deleterious atmosphere and noxious fumes. A roasting machine is in use, which
                    consists of a revolving drum in which the tobacco is rotated, gradually passing
                    from one end to the other, and all the time under the influence of a current of
                    heated air passing through it.</p>
                <p>For roll, twist, or pigtail tobacco the raw material is damped or sauced as in
                    the case of cut tobacco. The interior of the roll consists of small and broken
                    leaf of various kinds, called “fillers”; and this is enclosed within an external
                    covering of large whole leaf of bright quality, such leaves being called
                    “covers.” The material is supplied to the twisting machinery by an attendant,
                    and formed into a cord of uniform thickness, twisted, and wound on a drum by
                    mechanism analogous to that used in rope-spinning. From the drum of the twisting
                    machine the spun tobacco is rolled into cylinders of various sizes. These are
                    enclosed in canvas, and around the surface of each stout hempen cord is tightly
                    and closely coiled. In this form a large number, after being cooked or stoved in
                    moist heat for about twenty-four hours, are piled between plates in an hydraulic
                    press, and subjected to great pressure for a month or six weeks, during which
                    time a slow fermentation takes place, and a considerable exudation of juice
                    results from the severe pressure. The juice is collected for use as a
                    sheep-dip.</p>
                <p>Cake or plug tobacco is made by enveloping the desired amount of fillers within
                    covering leaves of a fine bright colour. A large number of such packages are
                    placed in moulds, and submitted to powerful pressure in an hydraulic press, by
                    which they are moulded into solid cakes. Both cake and roll tobacco are equally
                    used for smoking and chewing; for the latter purpose the cake is frequently
                    sweetened with liquorice, and sold as honey-dew or sweet cavendish.</p>
                <p>For cigar-making the finest and most delicately flavoured qualities of tobacco
                    are generally selected. A cigar consists of a core or central mass of fillers
                    enveloped in an inner and an outer cover or robe. The fillers or inner contents
                    of the cigar must be of uniform quality, and so packed and distributed in a
                    longitudinal direction that the tobacco may burn uniformly and the smoke can be
                    freely drawn from end to end. For the inner cover whole leaf of the same quality
                    as the fillers is used, but for the outer cover only selected leaves of the
                    finest quality and colour, free from all injury, are employed. The covers are
                    carefully cut to the proper size and shape with a sharp knife, and, being
                    damped, a pile of them smoothed out are placed together. In making cigars by the
                    hand, the operator rolls together a sufficient quantity of material to form the
                    filling of one cigar, and experience enables him or her to select very uniform
                    quantities. This quantity is wrapped in the inner cover, an oblong piece of leaf
                    the length of the cigar to be made, and of width sufficient to enclose the whole
                    material. The cigar is then rolled in the hand to consolidate the tobacco and
                    bring it into proper shape, after which it is wrapped in the outer cover, a
                    shaped piece made to enclose the whole in a spiral manner, beginning at the
                    thick end of the cigar and working down to the pointed end, where it is
                    dexterously finished by twisting to a fine point between the fingers. The
                    finished cigars are either spread out in the sunlight to be dried, or, where
                    that is impracticable, they are exposed to a gentle heat. They are then sorted
                    into qualities according to their colour, packed and pressed in boxes, in which
                    they are stored for sale. Machinery is now employed for forming and moulding the
                    fillings of cigars.</p>
                <p>Havana cigars are, as regards form, classification, method of putting up, and
                    nomenclature, the models followed by manufacturers of all classes of the goods.
                    Genuine (“legitimas”) Havana cigars are such only as are made in the island; and
                    the cigars made in Europe and elsewhere from genuine Cuban tobacco are classed
                    as “Havanas.” Other brands of home manufacture contain some proportion of Cuban
                    tobacco; and very good cigars may be made in which the name only of that
                    highly-prized leaf is employed. When we come to the inferior classes of cigars,
                    it can only be said that they may be made from any kind of leaf, the more
                    ambitious imitations being treated with various sauces designed to give them a
                    Havana flavour. The highest class of Cuban-made cigars, called “vegueras,” are
                    prepared from the very finest Vuelta Abajo leaf, rolled when it is just half
                    dry, and consequently never damped with water at all. Next come the “regalias,”
                    similarly made of the best Vuelta Abajo tobacco; and it is only the lower
                    qualities, “ordinary regalias,” which are commonly found in commerce, the finer,
                    along with the “vegueras,” being exceedingly high-priced. The cigars, when dry,
                    are carefully sorted according to strength, which is estimated by their colour,
                    and classed in a scale of increasing strength as <hi rend="italic"
                    >claro,</hi><hi rend="italic">Colorado</hi><hi rend="italic">claro,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">madv.ro</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >oscuro.</hi> They are pressed into the cigar boxes for sale, and branded with
                    the name or trade mark of their makers. Cheroots differ from ordinary cigars
                    only in shape, being either in the form of a truncated cone, or of uniform
                    thickness throughout, but always having both ends open and sharply cut across.
                    Cheroots come principally from Manila, but there are now large quantities
                    imported into the United Kingdom from the East Indies and Burmah.</p>
                <p>Cigarettes consist of small rolls of fine cut tobacco wrapped in a covering of
                    thin tough paper specially made for such use. Originally cigarettes were
                    entirely prepared by the smoker himself; but, now that the consumption of
                    cigarettes has attained gigantic proportions, especially in France, they are
                    very largely made with the aid of an elaborate system of automatic machinery.
                    The machines cut the paper, gum its edge, measure out the proper quantity of
                    tobacco, wrap it up, make the gummed edge adhere, cut the ends, and pack the
                    cigarettes in boxes.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of snuff is the most complex, tedious, and difficult undertaking
                    of the tobacco manufacturer; but it is an art now of relatively little and of
                    decreasing importance. The tobacco best suited for snuff-making is thick fleshy
                    leaf of a dark colour, the finest qualities of snuff being made with dark
                    Virginia leaf and the Amersfoort leaf of Holland; but manufacturers work up many
                    kinds with fragments from the making of smoking tobacco, midribs, &amp;c. The
                    varieties and qualities of snuff are many, the differences being dependent on
                    the material employed, the sauces with which it is treated, and the method of
                    manufacture. The sauces for snuff consist of solutions of common salt, with
                    various aromatic substances according to the flavour desired in the finished
                    snuff, and with occasional additions of potash, sal ammoniac, and other salts.
                    The following is an outline of the method adopted in making snuff on the great
                    scale in the state manufacture of France. The tobacco leaves are moistened with
                    about one-fifth of their weight of salt and water (sp. gr. 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 089), made up into blocks, and piled in large
                    rectangular heaps, in quantities of 40 or 50 tons. The temperature gradually
                    rises to 140° F., and sometimes reaches 170°; but the heat must be regulated, or
                    parts of the mass would become black as if charred. The heaps are made up in
                    spring and autumn, and the fermentation is continued for five or six months,
                    when the temperature remains stationary or begins to decline. The heap is then
                    opened, and the tobacco is ground, by which means a pale brown dryish powder <hi
                    rend="italic">{rdpé sec)</hi> is obtained. This is mixed with about four-tenths
                    of its weight of a solution of common salt, and is passed through a sieve, that
                    the powder may be uniformly moistened. It is then packed in large open chests in
                    quantities of from 25 to 50 tons, where it remains for nine or ten months, and
                    undergoes another fermentation, the temperature rising in the centre of the mass
                    to 120° or 130°. During this process the snuff acquires its dark colour and
                    develops its aroma. But it is not uniform in quality throughout, and is removed
                    to a second chest, in such a way as thoroughly to mix all the different parts
                    together, and, after the lapse of two months, it is again turned over; and the
                    process is sometimes repeated a third time. When the snuff is ripe, the contents
                    of the various chests are mixed together in a large room capable of holding 350
                    tons of snuff, where it is left for about six weeks, and the whole mass being
                    uniform in quality is sifted into barrels for the market. The process of
                    manufacture occupies in all from eighteen to twenty months. During these <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n446/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0446-0427"/> repeated fermentations about two-thirds of the
                    nicotine is destroyed, the acidity of the snuff disappears, and the mass becomes
                    distinctly alkaline, notwithstanding that acetic acid is continuously evolved.
                    The destruction of malic and citric acids continues, and the bases thereby set
                    free saturate the acetic acid formed, leaving free ammonia in the snuff. The
                    properties of snuff are dependent on the presence of free nicotine, free
                    ammonia, and the peculiar aromatic principle developed in the fermentation.</p>
                <p>The reduction of tobacco-leaf to a snuff powder is a task of considerable
                    difficulty, owing to the gummy nature of the substance, which tends to coat and
                    clog grinding surfaces. In early times the duly sauced and fermented leaves were
                    made up into “carottes,” —tightly tied up spindle-formed bundles, from the end
                    of which the snuffer, by means of a “snuff rasp,” rasped off his own supply, and
                    hence the name “râpé,” which we have still as “rappee, to indicate a particular
                    class of snuff. The practice of tying up the leaves in the form of carottes is
                    still followed by makers of fine snuff, as the very slow fermentation which goes
                    on within the bundles is favourable to the development of a rich aroma. For
                    pulverization, the leaves are first cut to shreds with a revolving knife, and
                    then powdered either by a kind of mortar and pestle mill, or by falling stampers
                    supplied with knife cutting edges, or more commonly they are treated in a
                    conical mill, in which both the revolving cone and the sides have sharp cutting
                    edges, so that the material undergoes a cutting rather than a grinding action.
                    The snuff from the mill is sifted, and that which remains on the sieve is
                    returned to the mill, the remainder being passed on as <hi rend="italic"
                    >râpé</hi><hi rend="italic">sec</hi> for further treatment as described
                    above.</p>
                <p>In nearly all civilized countries the cιdtivation of tobacco and its manufacture
                    are conducted under state supervision, and form an important source of public
                    revenue. In France, Austria-Hungary, Italy, and Spain the cultivation is a state
                    monopoly, and in other countries the crop is subject to heavy excise duties.
                    Since the time of Charles II. the growth of tobacco in England has been
                    practically prohibited, the original legislative exactment to that effect having
                    been passed with the view of encouraging trade with the young colony of
                    Virginia. When that motive ceased to have force the supposed difficulties of
                    collecting the internal taxation still influenced the legislature to continue
                    their prohibition, and consequently a penalty or prohibitive tax equal to
                    sixteen hundred pounds per acre is exigible on the cultivation of tobacco in the
                    United Kingdom. In Ireland the duty on the cultivation of tobacco was abandoned
                    between 1822 and 1830, and in that interval the cultivation grew till about a
                    thousand acres were under the crop. In 1886 the Government permitted the
                    experimental cultivation of tobacco in England, under certain precautions and
                    restrictions for the security of the revenue. Several proprietors in Kent,
                    Norfolk, and other counties grew experimental patches with such success as to
                    warrant the continuance of the experiment and to prove the entire practicability
                    of cultivating tobacco as an English agricultural crop. The climate is, however,
                    so variable that, were all restrictions removed, and tobacco grown subject only
                    to excise supervision for collecting an equitable tax, it is more than doubtful
                    whether its growth would be a safe and profitable undertaking.</p>
                <p>The influence of tobacco on health and morals has, ever since its introduction
                    into Europe, been a fruitful subject of controversy. On all grounds, except as a
                    medicine, it met the most uncompromising opposition when it first became known;
                    but it was precisely the expectations entertained regardiug its medicinal
                    virtues which were completely disappointed. Burton, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomy of Melancholy,</hi> gives strong expression to the two views: “Tobacco,
                    divine, rare, superexcellent tobacco, which goes far beyond all the panaceas,
                    potable gold, and philosopher’s stones, is a sovereign remedy in all diseases. A
                    good vomit, I confess, a virtuous herb if it be well qualified, opportunely
                    taken, and medicinally used; but, as it is commonly abused by most men, which
                    take it as tinkers do ale, ’ tis a plague, a mischief, a violent purge of goods,
                    lands, health,—hellish, devilish, and damned tobacco, the ruin and overthrow of
                    body and soul.” Burton’s meaning— that tobacco in moderation is a good thing,
                    while its excessive use causes many physical and other evils—has many
                    sympathizers; but the difficulty is to define moderation and excess. Among
                    modern authorities, Dr Jonathan Pereira says, “lam not acquainted with any
                    well-ascertained ill effects resulting from the habitual practice of smoking.”
                    Similarly Sir Robert Christison concludes, “In many individuals who use it
                    habitually, the smoke has an extraordinary power in removing exhaustion,
                    listlessness, and restlessness, especially when brought on by bodily or mental
                    fatigue, and this property is the basis of its general use as an article of
                    luxury.” Dr E. A. Parkes sums up his observations thus: “I confess myself quite
                    uncertain. I can find nothing like good evidence in books; too often a foregone
                    conclusion, without any evidence to back it, is given. I think we must decidedly
                    admit injury from excess; from moderate use I can see no harm, except it may be
                    in youth.” On the other hand, it is asserted by the opponents of tobacco, and by
                    the anti-tobacco societies, that the habitual use of this narcotic 1eads,
                    especially in the young, to decrease of bodily and mental vigour, and specially
                    produces symptoms of anaemia, palpitation, intermittent pulse, and other
                    affections of the heart and circulation. It is an admitted fact that a disease
                    of the vision—tobacco amblyopia—is contracted by smokers, and is not uncommon
                    among those using strong heavy preparations, such as black twist. Allowing that
                    such incidental evils may arise from even comparatively moderate indulgence in
                    tobacco, they are after all as nothing compared to the vast aggregate of gentle
                    exhilaration, soothing, and social comfort, extracted from the Virginian
                    weed.</p>
                <p>With the almost universal prevalence of the use of tobacco, it must be obvious
                    that the amount consumed yearly is very great.</p>

                    increased, as is shown in the accompanying table.</p>
                <p>The customs duty derived from imports of tobacco amounted in 1886 to £9,298,990,
                    and there certainly is a considerable quantity of manufactured tobacco smuggled
                    into the kingdom which comes into no official record. In the United States the
