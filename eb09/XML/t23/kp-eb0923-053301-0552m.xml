                    south-eastern angle, from the time of its foundation as a Greek colony to the
                    present day has always been a considerable emporium of commerce, and at one time
                    was for two centuries and a half the capital of an empire. Its importance is due
                    to its geographical position, because it commands the point where the chief and
                    most direct trade route from Persia and Central Asia to Europe, over the
                    tableland of Armenia by Bayazid and Erzeroum, descends to the sea. Its safety
                    also was secured by the barrier of rugged mountains which separates its district
                    from the rest of Asia Minor, rising to the height of 7000 or 8000 feet above the
                    sea-level. So complete is the watershed that no streams pass through these
                    ranges, and there is hardly any communication in this direction between the
                    interior of Asia Minor and the coast. For the same reason, together with its
                    northern aspect, the climate is humid and temperate, and favourable to the
                    growth of vegetation, unlike that of the inland regions, which are exposed to
                    great extremes of heat in summer and cold in winter. The position which was
                    occupied by the Hellenic and mediaeval city is a sloping table of ground (whence
                    the original name of the place, Trapezus, or the “Tableland ”), which falls in
                    steep rocky precipices on the two sides, where two deep valleys, descending from
                    the interior, run parallel at no great distance from one another down to the
                    sea. The whole is still inclosed by the Byzantine walls, which follow the line
                    of the cliffs, and are carried along the sea-face; and the upper part of the
                    level, which is separated from the lower by an inner cross wall, forms the
                    castle; while at the highest point, where a sort of neck is formed between the
                    two valleys, is the keep which crowns the whole. The fortifications and their
                    surroundings are singularly picturesque, for the towers, some round, some
                    angular, which project from them are in many cases covered with creepers, and
                    the gardens that occupy the valleys below teem with luxuriant vegetation. On
                    each side, about half-way between the keep and the sea, these ravines are
                    crossed by massive bridges, and on the further side of the westernmost of these,
                    away from the city, a large tower and other fortifications remain, which must
                    have served to defend the approach from that quarter. The area of the ancient
                    city is now called the Kaleh, and is inhabited by the Turks; eastward of this is
                    the extensive Christian quarter, and beyond this again a low promontory juts
                    northward into the sea, partly covered with the houses of a well-built suburb,
                    which is the principal centre of commerce. The harbour lies on the eastern side
                    of this promontory, but it is an unsafe roadstead, being unprotected towards the
                    north-east, and having been much silted up, so that vessels cannot approach
                    within a considerable distance of the shore. The neighbourhood of this is the
                    liveliest portion of the city, as it is from here that the caravans start for
                    Persia, and at certain periods of the year long trains of camels may be seen,
                    and Persian merchants conspicuous by their high black caps and long robes. The
                    total population of the place is estimated at 32,000, of whom 2000 are
                    Armenians, 7000 or 8000 Greeks, and the rest Turks.</p>
                <p>The city of Trapezus was a colony of Sinope, but it first comes into notice at
                    the time of the Retreat of the Ten Thousand, who found repose there.
                    Notwithstanding its commercial importance, the remoteness of its position
                    prevented it from being much known to fame either in the Hellenic or the early
                    mediaeval period; its greatness dates from the time of the fourth crusade
                    (1204), when the Byzantine empire λvas dismembered and its capital occupied by
                    the Latins. During the confusion that followed that event a scion of the
                    imperial family of the Comneni, called Alexius, escaped into Asia, and, having
                    collected an army of Iberian mercenaries, entered Trebizond, where he was
                    acknowledged as the legitimate sovereign, and assumed the title of Grand
                    Comnenus. Though only twenty-two years of age, Alexius was a man of ability and
                    resolute will, capable of establishing order in a time of anarchy; and thus he
                    succeeded without difficulty in making himself master of the greater part of the
                    southern coast of the Black Sea. The empire that was thus founded continued to
                    exist until 1461, when the city was taken by Mohammed II., eight years after he
                    had captured Constantinople. The cause of this long duration, and at the same
                    time the secret of its history, is to be found in the isolated position of
                    Trebizond and its district, between the mountains and the sea, which has already
                    been described. By this means it was able to defy both the Seljúks and the
                    Ottomans, and to maintain its independence against the emperors of Nicaea and
                    Constantinople. But for the same reason its policy was always narrow, so that it
                    never exercised any beneficial influence on the world at large. It was chiefly
                    in the way of matrimonial alliances that it was brought into contact with other
                    states. The imperial family were renowned for their beauty, and the princesses
                    of this race were sought as brides by Byzantine emperors of the dynasty of the
                    Palaeologi, by Western nobles, and by Mohammedan princes; and the connexions
                    thus formed originated a variety of diplomatic relations and friendly or
                    offensive alliances. The palace of Trebizond was famed for its magnificence, the
                    court for its luxury and elaborate ceremonial, while at the same time it was
                    frequently a hotbed of intrigue and immorality. The Grand Comneni were also
                    patrons of art and learning, and in consequence of this Trebizond was resorted
                    to by many eminent men, by whose agency the library of the palace was provided
                    with valuable manuscripts and the city was adorned with splendid buildings. The
                    writers of the time speak with enthusiasm of its lofty towers, of the churches
                    and monasteries in the suburbs, and especially of the gardens, orchards, and
                    olive groves. It excited the admiration of Gonzales Clavijo, the Spanish envoy,
                    when he passed through it on his way to visit the court of Timur at Samarkand
                    (Clavijo, <hi rend="italic">Historia del Gran Tamorlan,</hi> p. 84); and
                    Cardinal Bessarion, who was a native of the place, in the latter part of his
                    life, when the city had passed into the hands of the Mohammedans, and he was
                    himself a dignitary of the Roman Church, so little forgot the impression it had
                    made upon him that he wrote a work entitled “The Praise of Trebizond” <hi
                    rend="italic">('</hi> Ε <hi rend="italic">γκώμιοv</hi> T <hi rend="italic"
                    >ραπεζοῦvτος),</hi> which exists in manuscript at Venice. Little was known of
                    the history of the empire of Trebizond until the subject was taken in hand by
                    Prof. Fallmerayer of Munich, who discovered the chronicle of Michael Panaretus
                    among the books of Cardinal Bessarion, and from that work, and other sources of
                    information which were chiefly unknown up to that time, compiled his <hi
                    rend="italic">Geschichte des Kaiserthums von Trapezunt</hi> (Munich, 1827).
                    Finlay’s account of the period, in the fourth volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Greece,</hi> is based on this. From time to time the emperors of
                    Trebizond paid tribute to the Seljuk sultans of Iconium, to the grand khans of
                    the Mongols, to Timur the Tartar, to the Turcoman chieftains, and to the
                    Ottomans; but by means of skilful negotiations they were enabled practically to
                    secure their independence. We find them also at war with many of these powers,
                    and with the Genoese, who endeavoured to monopolize the commerce of the Black
                    Sea. The city was several times besieged, the most formidable attack being that
                    which occurred in the reign of Andronicus I., the second emperor, when the
                    Seljuks, under the command of Melik, the son of the great sultan Ala-ed-din,
                    first assaulted the northern wall in the direction of the sea, and afterwards
                    endeavoured to storm the upper citadel by night. They failed, however, in both
                    attempts; and in the latter, owing to the darkness, and to the occurrence of a
                    violent storm which suddenly swelled the torrents in the ravines, their force
                    was thrown into inextricable confusion, and they were compelled to abandon their
                    camp and make the best of their escape from the country <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi>. So great was the strength of the fortifications that, when Mohammed II.
                    turned his thoughts towards the subjugation of this state, he might have
                    experienced much difficulty in reducing it, and might have been disposed to
                    offer favourable terms, had it not been for the pusillanimous conduct of David,
                    the last emperor, who surrendered the place almost unconditionally.</p>
                <p>Several interesting monuments of this period remain at Trebizond in the form of
                    churches in the Byzantine style of architecture. One of these is within the area
                    of the old city, viz., the church of the Panaghia Chrysokephalos, or Virgin of
                    the Golden Head, a large and massive but excessively plain building, which is
                    now the Orta-hissar mosque. On the further side of the eastern ravine stands a
                    smaller but very well proportioned structure, the church of St Eugenius, the
                    patron saint of Trebizond, now the Yeni Djuma djami, or New Friday mosque. Still
                    more important is the church of Haghia Sophia, which occupies a conspicuous
                    position overlooking<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0553-0534"/> the sea, about two miles to the west of the city.
                    The porches of this are handsomely ornamented, and about a hundred feet from it
                    rises a tall campanile, the inner walls of which have been covered in parts with
                    frescos of religious subjects, though these are now much defaced. But the most
                    remarkable memorial of the Middle Ages that exists in all this district is the
                    monastery of Sumelas, which is situated among the mountains, about 25 miles from
                    Trebizond, at the side of a rocky glen, at a height of 4000 feet above the sea.
                    Its position is most extraordinary, for it occupies a cavern in the middle of
                    the face of a perpendicular cliff a thousand feet high, where the white
                    buildings offer a marked contrast to the brown rock which forms their setting.
                    It is approached by a zigzag path at the side of the cliff, from which a flight
                    of stone steps and a wooden staircase give access to the monastery. The valley
                    below is filled with the richest vegetation, the undergrowth being largely
                    composed of azaleas and rhododendrons. An antiquity of 1500 years is claimed for
                    the foundation of the monastery, but it is certain that the first person who
                    raised it to importance was the emperor Alexius Comnenus III. of Trebizond; he
                    rebuilt it in 1360, and richly endowed it. The golden bull of that emperor,
                    which became thenceforth the charter of its foundation, is still preserved; it
                    is one of the finest specimens of such documents, and contains portraits of
                    Alexius himself and his queen. The monastery also possesses the firman of
                    Mohammed II. by which he accorded his protection to the monks when he became
                    master of the country. (H. F. T. )</p>
