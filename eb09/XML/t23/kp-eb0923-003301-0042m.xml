                    in compensation for the loss of his preferment, 20s. for wages and 20s. for
                    reward. An interesting relic of this period of his career is preserved in the
                    library of the British Museum, in the form of a volume of MS. treatises on
                    music, once belonging to the abbey, on the last page of which appears his
                    autograph, “Thomas Tallys,” with the final letter prolonged into an elaborate
                    flourish—the only specimen of his handwriting now known to exist.</p>
                <p>Not long after his dismissal from Waltham, Tallis was appointed a gentleman of
                    the chapel royal; and thenceforward he laboured so zealously for the advancement
                    of his art that his genius has left an indelible impression upon the English
                    school, which owes more to him than to any other composer of the 16th century,
                    and in the history of which his name plays a very important part indeed.</p>
                <p>One of the earliest compositions by Tallis to which an approximate date can be
                    assigned is the well-known <hi rend="italic">Service in the Dorian Mode,</hi>
                    consisting of the <hi rend="italic">Venite, Te Deum, Benedictus, Kyrie, Nicene
                    Creed, Sanctus, Gloria in Excelsis, Magnificat,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nunc
                    Dimittis,</hi> for four voices, together with the <hi rend="italic">Preces,
                    Responses, Paternoster,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Litany,</hi> for five, all
                    published for the first time, in the Rev. John Barnard’s <hi rend="italic">First
                    Book of Selected Church Music,</hi> in 1641, and reprinted, with the exception
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Venite</hi><pb break="no"

                    Boyce’s <hi rend="italic">Cathedral Music</hi> in 1760.<note anchored="true"

                    beautiful <hi rend="italic">Venite</hi> is a misfortune which cannot be too
                    deeply deplored, since it has led to its consignment to almost hopeless
                    oblivion.</p></note> That this work was composed for the purpose of supplying a
                    pressing need, after the publication of the second prayer-book of King Edward
                    VI. in 1552 there can be no reasonable doubt; and its perfect adaptation to its
                    intended purpose is sufficiently proved by the fact that, for more than three
                    hundred years, its claim to occupy the first and highest place among
                    compositions of its class has been undisputed. Written in the style known among
                    Italian composers as <hi rend="italic">lo stile famigliare, i.e.,</hi> in simple
                    counterpoint of the first species, <hi rend="italic">nota contra notam,</hi>
                    with no attempt at ingenious points of imitation, or learned complications of
                    any kind—it adapts itself with equal dignity and clearness to the expression of
                    the verbal text it is intended to illustrate, bringing out the sense of the
                    words so plainly that the listener cannot fail to interpret them aright, while
                    its pure rich harmonies tend far more surely to the excitement of devotional
                    feeling than the marvellous combinations by means of which too many of Tallis’s
                    contemporaries sought to astonish their hearers, while forgetting all the
                    loftier attributes of their art. In this noble quality of self-restraint the <hi
                    rend="italic">Litany</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Responses</hi> bear a close
                    analogy to the <hi rend="italic">Improperia</hi> and other similar works of
                    Palestrina, wherein, addressing himself to the heart rather than to the ear, the
                    <hi rend="italic">princeps musicae</hi> produces the most thrilling effects by
                    means which, to the superficial critic, appear almost puerile in their
                    simplicity, while those who are able to look beneath the surface discern in them
                    depths of learning such as none but a very highly cultivated musician can
                    appreciate. Of this profound learning Tallis possessed an inexhaustible store;
                    and the rich resources it opened to his genius not only placed his compositions
                    on a level with those produced by the best of his Italian and Flemish
                    contemporaries, but enabled him to raise the English school itself to a height
                    which it had never previously attained, and which, nevertheless, it continued to
                    maintain undiminished until the death of its last representative, Orlando
                    Gibbons, in 1625. Though this school is generally said to have been founded by
                    Dr Tye, there can be no doubt that Tallis was its greatest master, and that it
                    was indebted to him alone for the infusion of new life and vigour which
                    prevented it from degenerating, as some of the earlier Flemish schools had done,
                    into a mere vehicle for the display of fruitless erudition. Tallis’s ingenuity
                    far surpassed that of his most erudite contemporaries; but he never paraded it
                    at the expense either of intrinsic beauty or truthfulness of expression. Like
                    every other great musician of the period, he produced occasionally works
                    confessedly intended for no more exalted purpose than the exhibition of his
                    stupendous skill, one of the most remarkable characteristics of which was the
                    apparent ease with which it disposed of difficulties that, to composers of
                    ordinary ability, would have proved insurmountable. In his canon, <hi
                    rend="italic">Miserere nostri,</hi> the intricacy of the contrapuntal devices
                    seems little short of miraculous; yet, so smooth and flowing is the effect
                    produced by their dizzy involutions, that no one unacquainted with the secret of
                    their construction would suspect the presence of any unusual element in the
                    composition. In his motet, <hi rend="italic">Spem in alium non habui,</hi>
                    written for forty voices disposed in eight five-part choirs, each singer is
                    intrusted with a part, agreeable and interesting in itself, yet never for a
                    moment interfering with any one of the thirty-nine equally interesting parts
                    with which it is associated. These <hi rend="italic">tours de force,</hi>
                    however, though approachable only by the greatest contrapuntists living in an
                    age in which counterpoint was cultivated with a success that has never since
                    been equalled, serve to illustrate one phase only of Tallis’s many-sided genius,
                    which shines with equal .brightness in the eight psalm-tunes (one in each of the
                    first eight modes) and unpretending little <hi rend="italic">Veni Creator,</hi>
                    printed in 1567 at the end of Archbishop Parker’s <hi rend="italic">First
                    Quinquagene of Metrical Psalms,</hi> and many other compositions of like
                    simplicity.</p>
                <p>In 1575 Tallis and his pupil William Byrd—as great a contrapuntist as himself,
                    though by no means his equal in depth of expression—obtained from Queen
                    Elizabeth royal letters patent granting them the exclusive right of printing
                    music and ruling music-paper for twenty-one years; and, in virtue of this
                    privilege, they issued, in the same year, a joint work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Cantiones quae ab argumento Sacrae vocantur, quinque et sex
                    partium,</hi> containing sixteen motets by Tallis and eighteen by Byrd, all of
                    the highest degree of excellence. Some of these motets, adapted to English
                    words, are now sung as anthems in the Anglican cathedral service. But no such
                    translations appear to have been made during Tallis’s lifetime; and there is
                    'strong reason for believing that, though both he and Byrd outwardly conformed
                    to the new religion, and composed music expressly for its use, they remained
                    Catholics at heart to the end of their days.</p>
                <p>Tallis’s contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Cantiones Sacrae</hi> were the
                    last of his compositions published during his lifetime. He did not, indeed, live
                    to witness the expiration of the patent, though Byrd survived it and published
                    two more books of <hi rend="italic">Cantiones</hi> on his own account in-1589
                    and 1591, besides numerous other works. Tallis died November 23, 1585, and was
                    buried in the parish church at Greenwich, where a quaint rhymed epitaph,
                    preserved by Strype, and reprinted by Burney and Hawkins, recorded the fact that
                    he served in the chapel royal during the reigns of Henry VIII., Edward VI.,
                    Mary, and Elizabeth. This was destroyed with the old church about 1710; and it
                    was not until about twenty years ago that a copy was placed in the present
                    building. Portraits, professedly authentic, of Tallis and Byrd were engraved by
                    Vandergucht in 1730, for Nicolas Haym’s projected <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Music,</hi> but never published. One copy only is known to exist.</p>
                <p>Not very many works besides those already mentioned were printed during Tallis’s
                    lifetime; but a great number are still preserved in MS. Unhappily, it is to be
                    feared that many more were destroyed, in the 17th century, during the spoliation
                    of the cathedral libraries by the Puritans. (W. S. R.)</p>
