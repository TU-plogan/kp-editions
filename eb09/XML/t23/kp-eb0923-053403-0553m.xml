                    the familiar ferns of our temperate climates the wide-spreading crown of fronds
                    may be observed to rise at a distance often of a good many inches above the
                    surface of the ground, and from a stem of considerable thickness. The common
                    male fern <hi rend="italic">Nephrodium (Lastraea)</hi> furnishes the commonest
                    instance of this; higher and thicker trunks are, however, occasionally presented
                    by the royal fern <hi rend="italic">(Osmunda regalis),</hi> in which a height of
                    2 feet may be attained, and this with very considerable apparent thickness, due,
                    however, to the origin and descent of a new series of adventitious roots from
                    the bases of each annual set of fronds. Some tropical members and allies of
                    these genera become more distinctly tree-like, <hi rend="italic">e.g., Todea;
                    Pteris</hi> also has some sub-arboreal forms. <hi rend="italic">Oleandra</hi> is
                    branched and shrub-like, while <hi rend="italic">Angiopteris</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Marattia (Marattiaceae)</hi> may also rise to 2 feet or more. But
                    the tree-ferns proper are practically included within the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Cyatheaceae.</hi> This includes five genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cyathea, Alsophila, Hemitelia, Dicksonia, Balantium)</hi> and nearly 200
                    species, of which a few are herbaceous, but the majority arboreal and palm-like,
                    reaching frequently a height of 50 feet or more, <hi rend="italic">Alsophila
                    excelsa</hi> of Norfolk Island having sometimes measured 60 to 80 feet. The
                    fronds are rarely simple or simply pinnate, but usually tripinnate or
                    decompound, and may attain a length of 20 feet, thus forming a splendid crown of
                    foliage. The stem may occasionally branch into many crowns. The genera are of
                    wide geographical range, mostly of course within the tropics of the Old and New
                    World; but South Australia, New Zealand, and the Southern Pacific islands all
                    possess their tree-ferns. In Tasmania <hi rend="italic">Alsophila australis</hi>
                    has been found up to the snow-level, and in the humid and mountainous regions of
                    the tropics tree-ferns are also found to range up to a considerable altitude.
                    The fronds may either contribute to the apparent thickness of the stem by
                    leaving more or less <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n554/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0554-0535"/> of their bases, which become hardened and
                    persistent, or they may be articulated to the stem and fall off, leaving
                    characteristic scars in spiral series upon the stem. The stem is frequently much
                    increased in apparent thickness by the downgrowth of aerial roots, forming a
                    black coating several inches or even a foot in thickness, but its essential
                    structure differs little in principle from that familiar in the rhizome of the
                    common bracken <hi rend="italic">(Pteris).</hi> To the ring or rather netted
                    cylinder of fibro-vascular bundles characteristic of all fern stems scattered
                    internal as well as external bundles arising from these are superadded; and in a
                    treefern these are of course in greater numbers. The outer bundles give off
                    branches to the descending roots from the region where they pass into the
                    leaves.</p>
                <p>Tree-ferns are of course cultivated for their beauty alone; a few, however, are
                    of some economic applications, chiefly as sources of starch. Thus the beautiful
                    <hi rend="italic">Alsophila excelsa</hi> of Norfolk Island is said to be
                    threatened with extinction for the sake of its sago-like pith, which is greedily
                    eaten by hogs; <hi rend="italic">Cyathea medullaris</hi> also furnishes a kind
                    of sago to the natives of New Zealand, Queensland, and the Pacific islands. A
                    Javanese species of <hi rend="italic">Dicksonia (D. chrysotricha)</hi> furnishes
                    silky hairs, which have been imported as a styptic, and the long silky or rather
                    woolly hairs, so abundant on the stem and frond-leaves in the various species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cibotium,</hi> have not only been put to a similar use, but in
                    the Sandwich Islands furnish wool for stuffing mattresses and cushions, which
                    was formerly an article of export. The “Tartarian lamb,” or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agnus scythicus</hi> of old travellers’ tales in China and Tartary, is simply
                    the woolly stock of <hi rend="italic">C. Barometz,</hi> which, when dried and
                    inverted and all save four of its frond-stalks cut away, has a droll resemblance
                    to a toy sheep.</p>
