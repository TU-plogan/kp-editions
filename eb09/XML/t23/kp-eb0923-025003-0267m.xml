                    his rival the Greek “Cato,” the incorruptible Aristides, a purer patriot, a
                    better citizen, but a less sagacious and far-seeing statesman. The two men were
                    in sharp antagonism as to what their country’s policy should be, and it ended in
                    a vote of ostracism which sent Aristides into temporary banishment in 483. The
                    main question between them probably was whether Athens should seek greatness by
                    sea or by land (see vol. xi. p. 99), and the victory of the policy of
                    Themistocles led on to the most brilliant era in Greek history, the maritime
                    supremacy of Athens. Persia, he felt sure, was meditating a great revenge, and
                    Athens must make herself a naval power to avert the blow. Already a small war
                    with the Aeginetan islanders, close to her own shores, had roused her energies,
                    and at the prompting of Themistocles she had built 200 ships and trained a
                    number of seamen. In 480 the storm which Themistocles had clearly foreseen
                    burst; the great king, as he was called, was covering the land with his troops
                    and the sea with his ships. Greece was divided and panic-stricken; Thessaly and
                    all to the north of Baeotia had joined the enemy, and the despair of the
                    remainder of the Greek world was echoed by the oracle of Delphi. There was,
                    however, a word of hope in the memorable phrase of the “wooden wall,”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The wooden wall shall alone
                    remain unconquered to defend you and your children.”</p></note> which, it was
                    generally felt, must point to the fleet, more, however, with a view to flight
                    than to resistance. Salamis, too, was named in the oracle, coupled with the
                    epithet “divine,” which Themistocles cleverly argued portended disaster to the
                    enemies of the Greeks rather than to the Greeks themselves. It was a great
                    achievement when he finally prevailed on his fellowcitizens to quit their city
                    and their homes—it seemed for ever—and to trust themselves to their ships. There
                    had been some sea-fights off the northern shores of Eubaea; the Spartans had
                    fallen at Thermopylae, and Xerxes and his host were now laying waste Attica,
                    not, however, before its inhabitants had conveyed their families to the adjacent
                    island of Salamis, where also the Greek fleet had taken up its station, the
                    Persian armada of 1200 vessels being in harbour at Phalerum. The Athenians from
                    their ships’ saw the flames in which their city, its acropolis and its temples,
                    were perishing, but their spirits rose with calamity, and with one heart, at the
                    bidding of Themistocles, they called back all of their brethren who w ere in
                    temporary banishment, Aristides among them. Nearly two-thirds of the entire
                    fleet was theirs, but for the sake of unity among the allies, who would follow
                    only the lead of Sparta, they acquiesced in its being under the command of a
                    Spartan admiral. It was clear, however, that the fate of Greece now depended on
                    the action of the Athenians and on the prudence and ability of Themistocles, by
                    whom they were guided. The Greeks of the Peloponnese, more particularly the
                    Corinthians, were for moving the fleet from Salamis to the isthmus, as the
                    enemy’s land forces were already in possession of the neighbouring shores of
                    Attica. Seeing the danger of yet further disunion, with the probable result of
                    the breaking up and dispersion of the fleet, and having in vain protested
                    against quitting their present station, Themistocles went straight to the
                    Spartan admiral, Eurybiades, and induced him to call another council. There was
                    much angry debating, till at last the Spartan felt he must yield to the threat
                    of Themistocles that the Athenians would either fight at Salamis or sail away as
                    they were to Italy. But the Peloponnesian Greeks were still dissatisfied, and
                    insisted that they ought to be at the isthmus for the defence of what yet
                    remained <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n268/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0268-0251"/> of Greece; a third council was held, and
                    Themistocles felt that its decision would be against him, when, by a sudden
                    happy thought, he contrived to have a secret message conveyed to the commanders
                    of the Persian fleet through his slave, an Ionian Greek from Asia, a man of
                    intelligence and education, and well acquainted with the Persian language. The
                    communication came in the name of Themistocles, who professed that he wished
                    well to the king, and that now was a good opportunity for attacking and crushing
                    the Greeks, as they were divided among themselves and were bent on flight. The
                    stratagem was successful, and the enemy’s great armada advanced along the coast
                    of Attica that same night, and took up a position which effectually confined the
                    Greek fleet within the narrow<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Not more than a quarter of a mile wide in its narrowest
                    part.</p></note> strait between Salamis and the southern shore of Attica. The
                    Greek captains, not knowing the state of the case, were still wrangling through
                    the night, when just before daybreak the banished Aristides came from Aegina
                    with the news that the Persian fleet was close at hand and that retreat was
                    impossible. “Let us still be rivals,” he said to Themistocles, “but let our
                    strife be which can best save our country.”</p>
                <p>The great victory of Salamis (see vol. xi. p. 100) left Greece mistress of the
                    sea, and was followed by the retreat of Xerxes. Themistocles, it is said,
                    frightened the king back to Asia by another secret message, to the effect that
                    the victorious Greeks were bent on following him up to the Hellespont and
                    burning his bridge of boats, but that he was doing his best to check their
                    ardour, though in reality he had himself advised immediate pursuit of the enemy.
                    We cannot but admire the man’s sagacity and farsightedness in thus laying the
                    king under an obligation which he might some day turn to his own profit, though
                    we cannot but feel that he had some of the worst as well as some of the most
                    splendid characteristics of the Greek. After the victory Themistocles sailed
                    with the Athenian squadron through theAegean, and from some of the islanders who
                    had sided with the enemy he exacted heavy fines, out of which, it appears, he
                    filled his own purse. When the Greeks met at the isthmus to decide according to
                    custom the prizes of merit for the glorious day of Salamis, he received only the
                    second prize, the first being awarded to the Spartan admiral, but by way of
                    compensation he was soon afterwards heartily welcomed at Sparta, and loaded with
                    honours so extraordinary as to imply that even the Spartans themselves
                    recognized him as the first man in Greece. It was not long, however, before he
                    gave them deadly offence. After the victories of Plataea and Mycale in 479 the
                    Athenians went back to their desolate city and began to rebuild and fortify it.
                    Jealous fears of the growing power of Athens were awakened, and the Spartans, as
                    representatives of the Greeks generally, formally protested against the
                    fortification of a Greek city outside the Peloponnese, on the ground that some
                    future Persian invader might make it a base of operations. Themistocles saw the
                    dangers of Spartan opposition, and got the Athenians to commission him to
                    arrange matters along with two other envoys, who, however, were purposely not
                    allowed to arrive at Sparta at the same time as himself. He told the Spartan
                    magistrates that before he could transact business with them he must wait for
                    his colleagues; meanwhile Athens was being fortified, every man, woman, and
                    child putting a hand to the work, and as soon as Themistocles understood that it
                    was sufficiently advanced he declared openly that Athens would brook no sort of
                    interference. The Spartans felt they had been tricked, but they could do
                    nothing. And now Themistocles proceeded to fortify Piraeus, and to enlarge the
                    harbour, thus providing Athens with an excellent naval dockyard, and holding out
                    an inducement to foreigners to settle in the city for the purposes of trade.
                    Twenty war ships, too, were at his suggestion to be built every year, and
                    nothing left undone to make Athens prosperous and powerful.</p>
                <p>A few years afterwards (in 471 probably) we find his political career terminated
                    by a vote of ostracism, due perhaps in part to Spartan influence at Athens, and
                    also to an offensive boastfulness and ostentation which disgusted the sensitive
                    Athenian democracy. He was even charged with corrupt practices and with
                    receiving bribes from Persia. From Argos, whither he had retired as an exile, he
                    was forced to flee by a threat of the Spartans, who alleged that they had proofs
                    of his treasonable complicity in the schemes of their countryman Pausanias, and
                    to take refuge in the island of Corcyra; but here again he was pursued by
                    Spartan and Athenian commissioners, and driven to seek the protection of
                    Admetus, king of the Molossians, the chief people of Epirus. In the court of
                    this half-Greek half-barbarian prince he found a hospitable reception, and he
                    was furnished with the means of crossing the Aegean to Ephesus. Shortly after
                    his arrival in Asia, the son of Xerxes, Artaxerxes, succeeded to the throne of
                    Persia, and to him Themistocles contrived to make himself known as a fugitive
                    from ungrateful Greece, which he had saved, and now ready and willing to advise
                    and assist the king in avenging his father’s defeat. He was treated, it is said,
                    with marked respect, and was liberally pensioned with the revenues of three
                    wealthy towns—Magnesia, Myus, and Lampsacus. It was at the first of these, which
                    was near the coast, and whence he might be supposed to have opportunities for
                    watching the affairs of Greece, that he passed the last year of his life, dying
                    a natural death at the age of 65. The year of his death is not accurately
                    ascertainable; opinions vary between 460 and 447.</p>
                <p>Herodotus, Thucydides, and Plutarch are our chief original sources for the life
                    of Themistocles. The subject is fully treated in the histories of Grote and
                    Thirlwall. (W. J. B.)</p>
