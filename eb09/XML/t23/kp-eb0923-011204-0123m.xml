                    >γράφω)</hi> signifies an instrument to write at a distance. The term is
                    specifically applied to apparatus for communicating intelligence to a .distance
                    in unwritten signs addressed to the eye or ear, and has only recently had
                    application to those wonderful combinations of inanimate matter which literally
                    write at a distance the intelligence committed to them. The chief object of the
                    present article is to explain the principles and practice of the electric
                    telegraph, and we shall allude to other telegraphic systems only to illustrate
                    the general principles of signalling.</p>
                <p>A word expressing an idea may, according to a prearranged plan of signalling, be
                    communicated by voice, by trumpet calls, by gun fire, by gesture or dumb signs,
                    by lamp signals, by flags, by semaphore, or by electric telegraph. The simplest
                    system of word-signalling hitherto practised is that of the nautical flag
                    telegraph, in which each hoist represents a word by a combination of four flags
                    in four distinct positions (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Signals, Naval).</hi> If
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> denote the number of flags, supposed all different, out
                    of which the four to be sent up may be selected, the number of different ideas
                    which can be expressed by a single hoist is n(n - 1)(n - 2)(n - 3), since there
                    are <hi rend="italic">η</hi> varieties out of which the flag for each of the
                    four positions may be independently chosen. To commit to memory so great a
                    number of combinations, which amount to 358,800 if <hi rend="italic">n</hi> =
                    26, would be a vain effort; the operators on each side must therefore have
                    constant recourse to a dictionary, or code, as it is called. For the sake of
                    convenient reference each flag is called by the name of a letter of the
                    alphabet, and all that the operator has to bear in mind is the letter by which
                    each flag is designated. Sometimes the words to be expressed are spelled out by
                    means of the flags as in ordinary language; but, as in most words there are more
                    than four letters, as scarcely any two consecutive words are spelled with four
                    or less than four letters, and as more than four flags at a time cannot be
                    conveniently used, the system of alphabetic signalling frequently requires the
                    use of two hoists for a word, and scarcely ever has the advantage of expressing
                    two words by one hoist. It is therefore much more tedious than code signalling
                    in the nautical telegraph.</p>
                <p>In point of simplicity spoken words may be considered as almost on a par with the
                    nautical telegraph, since each word is in reality spoken and heard almost as a
                    single utterance. Next in order comes the system of spelling out words letter by
                    letter, in which—instead of, as in the nautical telegraph, 358,800 single
                    symbols to express the same number of ideas —26 distinct symbols are used to
                    express by their combinations any number whatever of distinct ideas. Next again
                    to this may be ranked the system by which several distinct successive signals
                    are used to express a letter, and letters thus communicated by compound signals
                    are combined into words according to the ordinary method of language. It is to
                    this last class that nearly all practical systems of electro-telegraphic
                    signalling belong. But some of the earliest and latest proposals for electric
                    telegraphs are founded on the idea of making a single signal represent a single
                    letter of the alphabet; as instances we may name those' early forms in which
                    separate conductors were used for the different letters; a method suggested by
                    Professor W. Thomson<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    his <hi rend="italic">Mathematical and Physical Papers,</hi> vol. ii. p.
                    105.</p></note> in 1858 in which different strengths of current were to be
                    employed to indicate the letters; and the various forms of printing telegraph

                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Historical Sketch of Early Telegraphs.</hi></p>
                <p>Although the history of practical electric telegraphy does not include a period
                    of more than half a century, the idea of using electricity for telegraphic
                    purposes is much older. It was suggested again and again as each new discovery
                    in electricity and magnetism seemed to render it more feasible. Thus the
                    discovery of Stephen Gray and of Wheeler that the electrical influence of a
                    charged Leyden jar may be conveyed to a distance by means of an insulated wire
                    gave rise to various proposals, of which perhaps the earliest was that in an
                    anonymous letter<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From
                    correspondence found among Sir David Brewster’s papers after his death it seems
                    highly probable that the writer of this letter, which was signed “C. Μ.”, was
                    Charles Morrison, a surgeon and a native of Greenock, but at that time resident
                    in Renfrew.</p></note> to the <hi rend="italic">Scots Magazine</hi> (vol. XV. p.
                    73, 1753), in which the use of as many insulated conductors as there are letters
                    in the alphabet was suggested. Each wire was to be used for the transmission of
                    one letter only, and the message was to be sent by charging the proper wires in
                    succession and received by observing the movements of small pieces of paper
                    marked with the letters of the alphabet and placed under the ends of the wires.
                    A very interesting modification was also proposed in the same letter, viz., to
                    attach to the end of each wire a small light ball which when charged would be
                    attracted towards an adjacent bell and strike it. Some twenty years later Le
                    Sage proposed a similar method, in which each conductor was to be attached to a
                    pith ball electroscope. An important advance on this was proposed in 1797 by
                    Lomond,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Arthur
                    Young, <hi rend="italic">Travels in Prance,</hi> p. 3.</p></note> who used only
                    one line of wire and an alphabet of motions. Besides these we have in the same
                    period the spark telegraph of Reiser, of Don Silva, and of Cavallo, the pith
                    ball telegraph of Ronalds, and several <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0124-0113"/> others. Next came the discovery of Galvani and of
                    Volta, and as a consequence a fresh set of proposals, in which voltaic
                    electricity was to be used. The discovery by Nicholson and Carlisle of the
                    decomposition of water and the subsequent researches of Davy on the
                    decomposition of the solutions of salts by the voltaic current were turned to
                    account in the water voltameter telegraph of Summering and the modification of
                    it proposed by Schweigger, and in a similar method proposed by Coxe, in which a
                    solution of salts was substituted for water. Then came the discovery by
                    Romagnesi and by Oersted of the action of the galvanic current on a magnet. Thé
                    application of this to telegraphic purposes was suggested by Laplace and taken
                    up by Ampère, and afterwards by Triboaillet and by Schilling, whose work forms
                    the foundation of much of modern telegraphy. Faraday’s discovery of the induced
                    current produced by passing a magnet through a helix of wire forming part of a
                    closed circuit was laid hold of in the telegraph of Gauss and Weber, and this
                    application was at the request of Gauss taken up by Steinheil, who brought it to
                    considerable perfection. Steinheil communicated to the Göttingen Academy of
                    Sciences in September 1838 an account of his telegraph, which had been
                    constructed about the middle of the preceding year. The currents were produced
                    by a magneto-electric machine resembling that of Clarke. The receiving apparatus
                    consisted of a multiplier, in the centre of which were pivoted one or two
                    magnetic needles, which either indicated the message by the movement of an index
                    or by striking two bells of different tone or recorded it by making ink dots on
                    a ribbon of paper. Among other workers about this time we may mention Masson,
                    Bréguet, Davy, Deval, Billon, Soudalot, and Vorsselman who proposed to use the
                    physiological effects of electricity in working an electric telegraph.<note

                <p>Steinheil appears to have been anticipated in the matter of a recording telegraph
                    by Morse of America, who in 1835 constructed a rude working model of an
                    instrument; this within a few years was so perfected that with some modification
                    in detail it has been largely used ever since (see below). In 1836 Cooke, to
                    whom the idea appears to have been suggested by Schilling’s method, invented a
                    telegraph in which an alphabet was worked out by the single and combined
                    movement of three needles. Subsequently, in conjunction with Wheatstone, he
                    introduced another form, in which five vertical index needles, each worked by a
                    separate multiplier, were made to point out the letters on a dial. Two needles
                    were acted upon at the same time, and the letter at the point of intersection of
                    the direction of the indexes was read. This telegraph required six wires, and
                    was shortly afterwards displaced by the single-needle system, still to a large
                    extent used on railway and other less important circuits. The single-needle
                    instrument is a vertical needle galvanoscope worked by a battery and reversing
                    key, the motions to right and left of one end of the index corresponding to the
                    dashes and dots of the Morse alphabet. To increase the speed of working, two
                    single-needle instruments were sometimes used (double-needle telegraph). This
                    system required two lines of wire, and, along with all multiple-wire systems,
                    soon passed out of use. Similar instruments to the single and double needle ones
                    of Cooke and Wheatstone were about the same time invented by the Rev. H. Highton
                    and his brother Edward Highton, and were used for a considerable time on some of
                    the railway lines in England. Another series of instruments, introduced by Cooke
                    and Wheatstone in 1840, and generally known as “Wheatstone’s step-by-step
                    letter-showing” or</p>
                <p>“ABC instruments,” were worked out with great ingenuity of detail by Wheatstone
                    in Great Britain and by Bréguet and others in France. They are still largely
                    used for private wires, but are being rapidly displaced by the telephone.<note

                    interesting modification of his step-by-step instrument, the object of which was
                    to produce a letter-printing telegraph. But it never came into use; some years
                    later, however, an instrument embodying the same principle, although differing
                    greatly in mechanical detail, was brought into use by Royal E. House of Vermont,
                    U.S., and was very successfully worked on some of the American telegraph lines
                    till 1860, after which it was gradually displaced by the Phelps combination
                    telegraph. The House instrument is not now in use, but various modifications of
                    it are still employed for private lines and for stock telegraphs, such as
                    Calahan’s and the universal stock telegraphs, Phelps’s stock printer, Gray’s
                    automatic printer for private lines, Siemens’s and Phelps’s automatic type
                    printers, &amp;c. (see <hi rend="italic">infra,</hi> pp. 120-121).</p>

                <p>The first requisite for electro-telegraphic communication between two localities
                    is an insulated conductor extending from one to the other. This, with proper
                    apparatus for originating electric currents at one end and for discovering the
                    effects produced by them at the other end, constitutes an electric telegraph.
                    Faraday’s term “electrode,” literally a way for electricity to travel along,
                    might be well applied to designate the insulated conductor along which the
                    electric messenger is despatched. It is, however, more commonly and familiarly
                    called “the wire” or “the line.”</p>
                <p>The apparatus for generating the electric action at one end is commonly called
                    the <hi rend="italic">transmitting apparatus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >instrument,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">sending apparatus</hi> or <hi

                    >transmitter</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sender.</hi> The apparatus used at the
                    other end of the line to render the effects of this action perceptible to any of
                    the senses—eye, ear, or taste, all of which have been used in actual telegraphic
                    signalling—is called the <hi rend="italic">receiving apparatus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">instrument.</hi></p>
                <p>In the aerial or overground system of land telegraphs the main line consists
                    generally of a “galvanized” iron wire from one-sixth to a quarter of an inch in
                    diameter, stretched through the air from pole to pole, at a sufficient height
                    above the ground for security. The supports or insulators, as they are called,
                    by which it is attached to the poles are of very different form and arrangement
                    in different telegraphs, but consist essentially of a stem of glass, porcelain,
                    coarse earthenware, or other non-conducting substance, protected by an
                    overhanging screen or roof. One end of the stem is firmly attached to the pole,
                    and the other bears the wire. The best idea of a single telegraphic insulator
                    may be got from a common umbrella, with its stem of insulating substance
                    attached upright to the top of a pole and bearing the wire supported in a notch
                    on the top outside. The umbrella may be either of the same substance as the
                    stem—all glass or all glazed earthenware, for instance—or of a stronger
                    material, such as iron, with an insulating stem fitted to it to support it
                    below. Very good insulators may be made of continuous glass; but well-glazed
                    porcelain is more generally used, or rather earthenware, which is cheaper, less
                    brittle, and less hygroscopic, and insulates well as long as the glazing is
                    sufficient to prevent the porous substance within from absorbing moisture.</p>
                <p>One of the best forms—Varley’s double <hi rend="smallcaps">cud</hi> insulator <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n125/mode/1up"

                    cups (<hi rend="italic">c,</hi> C), which are moulded and fired separately, and
                    afterwards cemented together. The double cup gives great security against loss
                    of insulation due to cracks extending through the insulator, and also gives a
                    high surface insulation. An iron bolt (<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) cemented into
                    the centre of the inner cup is used for fixing the insulator to the pole or
                    bracket.</p>
                <p>In the underground system the main line generally consists of a copper wire, or a
                    thin strand of copper wires, covered with a continuous coating of gutta percha,
                    india-rubber, or some equivalent insulating substance, served with tarred tape
                    and enclosed in earthenware, iron, or lead pipes laid below the surface of the
                    ground. This system is largely used for street and tunnel work, and to a
                    considerable extent, especially in Germany, for ordinary lines. Each tube
                    generally contains a number of wires, which are either laid up into a cable and
                    covered with a serving of tarred tape or hemp before being drawn into the tube,
                    or—as is more commonly the case in the United Kingdom—simply laid together in a
                    parallel group and tied at intervals with binders, which are removed as the
                    wires are drawn into the tube. On some long underground lines in Germany the
                    insulated wires are laid up into a cable, served with jute or hemp, and sheathed
                    with a continuous covering of iron wires, precisely similar to the submarine
                    cables described below. The cable is laid in a deep trench and coated with
                    bitumen. This form of cable is easily laid, and if properly manufactured is

                    usually manufactured at present, consists of a core <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in
                    the centre of which is a strand of copper wires varying in weight for different
                    cables between 70 and 400 lb to the mile. The stranded form was suggested by
                    Prof. W. Thomson at a meeting of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow in 1854,
                    because its greater flexibility renders it less likely to damage the insulating
                    envelope during the manipulation of the cable. The central conductor is covered
                    with several continuous coatings of gutta percha, the total weight of which also
                    varies between 70 and 400 lb to the mile. With a light core the weight of the
                    gutta percha generally exceeds that of the copper, while in some heavy cores the
                    copper is heavier. The different coatings of gutta percha and of the conductor
                    are usually separated by a thin coating of Chatterton’s compound (a mixture of
                    gutta percha, resin, and Stockholm tar), in order to make them adhere firmly
                    together. This practice has recently been departed from by Messrs Siemens
                    Brothers, who have succeeded by an improved process of manufacture in getting
                    perfect adhesion without the use of the compound. The core is served with a
                    thick coating of wet jute, yarn, or hemp (<hi rend="italic">h</hi>), forming a
                    soft bed for the sheath, which consists of soft iron, or of homogeneous iron,
                    wires of the best quality. The sheathing wires are usually covered with one or
                    two servings of tarred canvas tape (<hi rend="italic">t</hi>), or of tarred
                    hemp, laid on alternately with coatings of a mixture of asphaltum and tar. The
                    weight of the iron sheath varies greatly according to the depth of the water,
                    the nature of the sea bottom, the prevalence of currents, and so on. Fig. 2
                    shows the intermediate type again sheathed with a heavy armour to resist wear in
                    the shallow water near shore. In many cases a still heavier type is used for the
                    first mile or two from shore, and several intermediate types are often
                    introduced, tapering gradually to the thin deepwater type. Captain S. Trot and
                    Mr F. A. Hamilton have proposed<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Journ. Soc. Telegr. Eng.,</hi> vol. xii.
                    p. 495.</p></note> to abandon the iron sheath and substitute a strong double
                    serving of hemp, laid on in such a way as to prevent twisting when the cable is
                    under tension. This suggestion, which is a revival with some modifications of an
                    old idea, is, however, still in the experimental stage.</p>
                <p>We will now describe very briefly a few of the most important processes in the
                    manufacture and submergence of submarine cables.</p>
                <p>which is regulated by the die D, is pressed out of the cylinder by applying the
                    requisite pressure to the piston P. The newly coated wire is passed through a
                    long trough T, containing cold water, until it is sufficiently cold to allow it
                    to be safely wound on a bobbin B'. This operation completed, the wire is wound
                    from the bobbin B' on to another, and at the same time carefully examined for
                    air-holes or other flaws, all of which are eliminated. The coated wire is
                    treated in the same way as the copper strand,— the die D, or another of the same
                    size, being placed at the back of the cylinder and a larger one substituted at
                    the front. A second coating is then laid on, and after it passes through a
                    similar process of examination a third coating is applied, and so on until the
                    requisite number is completed. The finished core changes rapidly in its electric
                    qualities at first, and is generally kept for a stated interval of time before
                    being subjected to the specified tests. It is then placed in a tank of water and
                    kept at a certain fixed temperature, usually 75° Fahr., until it assumes
                    approximately a constant electrical state. Its conductor and dielectric
                    resistance and its electrostatic capacity are then measured. These tests are
                    generally repeated at another temperature, say 50° Fahr., for the purpose of
                    obtaining at the same time greater certainty of the soundness of the core and
                    the rate of variation of the conductor and dielectric resistances with
                    temperature. Should these tests prove satisfactory the core is served with jute
                    yarn, coiled in watertight tanks, and surrounded with salt water. The insulation
                    is again tested, and if no fault is discovered the served core is passed through
                    the sheathing machine, and the iron sheath and the outer covering are laid on.
                    As the cable is sheathed it is stored in large water-tight tanks and kept at a
                    nearly uniform temperature bymeans of water.</p>
                <p>The cable is now transferred to a cable ship, provided with watertight tanks
                    similar to those used in the factory for storing it. The tanks are nearly
                    cylindrical in form and have a truncated cone <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0126-0115"/> fixed in the centre, as shown at C, fig. 6. The
                    cable is carefully coiled into the tanks in horizontal flakes, each of which is
                    begun at the outside of the tank and coiled towards the centre. The different
                    coils are prevented from adhering by a coating of whitewash, and the end of each
                    nautical mile is carefully marked for future reference. After the cable has been
                    again subjected to the proper electrical tests and found to be in perfect
                    condition, the ship is taken to the place where the shore end is to be landed. A
                    sufficient length of cable to reach the shore or the cable-house is paid
                    overboard and coiled on a raft or rafts, or on the deck of a steam-launch, in
                    order to be connected with the shore. The end is taken into the testing room in
                    the cable-house and the conductor connected with the testing instruments, and,
                    should the electrical tests continue satisfactory, the ship is put on the proper
                    course and steams slowly ahead, paying out the cable over her stern. The cable
                    must not be overstrained in the process of submersion, and must be paid out at
                    the proper rate to give the requisite slack. This involves the introduction of
                    machinery for measuring and controlling the speed at which it leaves the ship
                    and for measuring the pull on the cable. The essential parts of this apparatus
                    are shown in fig. 6. The lower end e of the cable in the tank T is taken to the
                    testing room, so that continuous tests for electrical condition can be made. The
                    upper end is passed over a guiding quadrant Q to a set of wheels or fixed
                    quadrants 1, 2, 3,... then to the paying-out drum P, from it to the dynamometer
                    D, and finally to the stern pulley, over which it passes into the sea. The
                    wheels 1, 2, 3, ... are so arranged that 2, 4, 6, ... can be raised or lowered
                    so as to give the cable less or more bend as it passes betweén them, while 1, 3,
                    5,... are furnished with brakes. The whole system provides the means of giving
                    sufficient back-pull to the cable to make it grip the drum P, round which it
                    passes several times to prevent slipping. On the same shaft with P is fixed a
                    brake-wheel furnished with a powerful brake B, by the proper manipulation of
                    which the speed of paying out is regulated, the pull on the cable being at the
                    same time observed by means of D. The shaft of P can be readily put in gear with
                    a powerful engine for the purpose of hauling back the cable should it be found
                    necessary to do so. The length paid out and the rate of paying out are obtained
                    approximately from the number of turns made by the drum P and its rate of
                    turning. This is checked by the mile marks, the known position of the joints,
                    &amp;c., as they pass. The speed of the ship can be roughly estimated from the
                    speed of the engines; it is more accurately obtained by one or other of the
                    various forms of log, or it may be measured by paying out continuously a steel
                    wire over a measuring wheel. The average speed is obtained very accurately from
                    solar and stellar observations for the position of the ship. The difference
                    between the speed of the ship and the rate of paying out gives the amount of
                    slack. The amount of slack varies in different cases between three and ten per
                    cent., but some is always allowed, so that the cable may easily adapt itself to
                    inequalities of the bottom and may be more readily lifted for repairs. But the
                    mere paying out of sufficient slack is not a guarantee that the cable will
                    always lie closely along the bottom or be free from spans. Whilst it is being
                    paid out the portion between the surface of the water and the bottom of the sea
                    lies along a straight line, the component of the weight at right angles to its
                    length being supported by the frictional resistance to sinking in the water. If,

                    angle of immersion depends solely on the speed of the ship; hence in laying a
                    cable on an irregular bottom it is of great importance that the speed should be
                    sufficiently low. This may be illustrated very simply as follows :—suppose <hi
                    rend="italic">a a</hi> (fig. 7) to be the surface of the sea, <hi rend="italic"
                    >be</hi> the bottom, and <hi rend="italic">co</hi> the straight line made by the
                    cable; then, if a hill H, which is at any part steeper than the inclination of
                    the cable, is passed over, the cable touches it at some point <hi rend="italic"
                    >t</hi> before it touches the part immediately below <hi rend="italic">t,</hi>
                    and if the friction between the cable and the ground is sufficient the cable
                    will either break or be left in a long span ready to break at some future time.
                    It is important to observe that the risk is in no way obviated by the increasing
                    slack paid out, except in so far as the amount of sliding which the strength of
                    the cable is able to produce at the points of contact with the ground may be
                    thereby increased. The speed of the ship must therefore be so regulated that the
                    angle of immersion is as great as the inclination of the steepest slope passed
                    over. Under ordinary circumstances the angle of immersion <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi> varies between six and nine degrees.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Telegraph Line.—</hi> The efficiency of the telegraph depends on three qualities
                    of the main line—(1) its conducting quality, (2) its insulation, and (3) its
                    electrostatic capacity.</p>
                <p>1. The conducting quality of a wire or other elongated portion of matter is
                    measured by the quantity of electricity which it allows to flow through it when
                    a stated “electromotive force,” or “difference of electric potentials,” is
                    maintained between its two ends. It may be most naturally, and is in point of
                    fact generally, expressed in terms of resistance to transmission, regarded as a
                    quality inverse to that of conducting power, and expressed numerically by the
                    reciprocal of the measure of the conducting power. An independent explanation
                    and definition of the electrical resistance of a conductor may be given as
                    follows :—the electrical resistance of a conductor is measured by the amount of
                    electromotive force, or difference of potentials, which must be maintained
                    between its ends to produce a stated strength of electric current through
                    it.</p>
                <p>2. The true measure of the insulation of a body is the resistance to conduction
                    offered by its supports. The reciprocal of this, or the conducting power of the
                    supports, measures the defectiveness of the insulation. Since no substance yet
                    known is absolutely a nonconductor of electricity, perfect insulation is
                    impossible. If, however, the supports on which a telegraph wire rests present,
                    on each part and on the whole, so great a resistance to electric conduction as
                    to allow only a small portion of the electricity sent in, in the actual working,
                    at one end to escape by lateral conduction, instead of passing through the line
                    and producing effect at the other end, the insulation is as good as need be for
                    the mode of working adopted. With the good insulation attained in a submarine
                    line, round every part of which the gutta percha is free from flaws, no
                    telegraphic operation completed within a second of time can be sensibly
                    influenced by lateral conduction. A charge communicated to a wire thus insulated
                    under water, at the temperature of the seabottom, is so well held that, after
                    thirty minutes, not so much as half of it is found to have escaped. From this,
                    according to the familiar “compound interest” problem, it appears that the loss
                    must be at the rate of less than five per cent, per two minutes.</p>
                <p>3. In 1849 Werner Siemens proved that “when a current is sent through a submerged
                    cable a quantity of electricity is retained in charge along the whole surface,
                    being distributed in proportion to the tension of each point,”—that is to say,
                    to the difference of potentials between the conductor at any point and the earth
                    beside it. In 1854 Faraday showed the effect of this “electrostatic charge” on
                    signals sent through great lengths of submerged wire, bringing to light many
                    remarkable phenomena and pointing out the “inductive” embarrassment to be
                    expected <hi rend="underline">in</hi> working long submarine telegraphs. In
                    letters<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Published in <hi
                    rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc.</hi> for 1855.</p></note> to Professor Stokes in
                    November and December of the same year, Prof. W. Thomson gave the mathematical
                    theory of these phenomena, with formulae and diagrams of curves, containing the
                    elements of synthetical investigation for every possible case of practical
                    operations. Some of the results of this theory are given at the end of the
                    present article. The conductor of a submarine cable has a very large
                    electrostatic capacity in comparison with that of a land telegraph wire in
                    consequence of the induction, as of a Leyden phial, which takes place across its
                    gutta percha coat, between it and its moist outer surface, which may be regarded
                    as perfectly' connected with the earth,—that is to say, at the same potential as
                    the earth. The mathematical expressions for the absolute electrostatic capacity

                <p><hi rend="italic">Telegraph Testing.</hi><hi rend="italic">Standards of
                    Measurement.—</hi> A brief consideration of the standards according to which the
                    electrical qualities referred to in the last section are measured, and the
                    measurements to be described in this section are made, will render the
                    statements of those qualities and quantities more definite. A complete and
                    universally comparable system of standards for physical measurements can be
                    obtained by adopting arbitrarily as fundamental units those of length, mass, and
                    time, and expressing in terms of these in a properly defined manner the units of
                    all the other quantities. The units now adopted all over the world for
                    electrical measurements take the centimètre as the unit of length, the gramme as
                    the unit of mass, and the mean solar second as the unit of time. There are two
                    systems in use, the electrostatic and the electromagnetic. In the former the
                    mutual forces exerted by two bodies, each charged with static electricity, are
                    taken as the starting-point, and in the latter the mutual forces exerted between
                    a current of electricity and a magnet. The units according to these two systems
                    are definitely related; but as we deal in the present article with the
                    electromagnetic system we give the following brief account of it only.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dyne</hi> or <hi rend="italic">unit force</hi> is that
                    force which, acting on a gramme of matter, free to move, imparts to it a
                    velocity of 1 centimètre per second. <hi rend="italic">Unit qτιantity of
                    magnetism</hi> or <hi rend="italic">unit magnetic pole</hi> is that quantity of
                    magnetism which, when placed at a distance of 1 centimètre from an equal and
                    similar quantity of magnetism or a magnetic pole, repels it with unit force. <hi
                    rend="italic">Unit magnetic field</hi> is a field which, when a unit quantity of
                    magnetism or a unit magnetic pole is placed in it, is acted on by unit force.
                    <hi rend="italic">Unit current</hi> is a current which, when made to flow round
                    a circle of unit radius, produces a magnetic field of 2τr units’ intensity at
                    the centre of the circle, or acts on a unit quantity of magnetism placed at the
                    centre of the circle with 2τr units of force. <hi rend="italic">Unit quantity of
                    electricity</hi> is the quantity conveyed by the unit current in one second. <hi
                    rend="italic">Unit difference of potential</hi> is the difference of potential
                    between the ends of a conductor of unit length when it is placed with its length
                    at right angles to the direction of force in a unit magnetic field and kept
                    moving with a velocity of 1 centimètre per second in the direction at right
                    angles to its own length and to the direction of the magnetic force. <hi
                    rend="italic">Unit electromotive force</hi> is produced in a closed circuit if
                    any unit of its length is held in the manner, and moved in the direction and
                    with the velocity, described in the last section. <hi rend="italic">Unit
                    resistance</hi> is the resistance which, when acted on by unit electromotive
                    force, transmits unit current. <hi rend="italic">Unit capacity</hi> is the
                    capacity of a body which requires unit quantity of electricity to raise its
                    potential by unity. The units above specified are generally referred to as the
                    absolute C.G.S. electromagnetic units of the different quantities. In practice
                    their magnitudes were found inconvenient, and certain multiples and submultiples
                    of them have been adopted as the practical units of measurement: thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">ohm</hi> is equal to 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 9</hi> C.G.S.
                    units of resistance; the <hi rend="italic">volt</hi> is equal to 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 8</hi> C.G.S. units of electromotive force; the <hi
                    rend="italic">ampere</hi> is equal to 10 <hi rend="superscript"> -1</hi> C.G.S.
                    units of current; the <hi rend="italic">coulomb</hi> is equal to 10~ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> C.G.S. units of quantity; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >farad</hi> is the capacity which is charged to a volt by a coulomb, and is
                    equal to 10 <hi rend="superscript"> -9</hi> C.G.S. units of capacity; the <hi
                    rend="italic">microfarad</hi> is the millionth part of the farad, and is equal
                    to 10^^ <hi rend="superscript"> 15</hi> C.G.S. units of capacity.</p>
                <p>We are here chiefly concerned with the units of electromotive force, resistance,
                    and capacity. No universally recognized standard of electromotive force has yet
                    been established, but the want has been to a great extent supplied by the
                    potential galvanometers, electrostatic voltmeters, standard cells, and other
                    instruments devised by Sir W. Thomson and others. The work of Lord Rayleigh, Dr.
                    Fleming, and other experimenters on the Clark and Daniell standard cells has
                    shown conclusively that an electromotive force can be reproduced with certainty
                    within one-tenth per cent, of accuracy by means of either of these cells.
                    Specimens of the standard unit of resistance, or ohm, made of an alloy of
                    platinum and silver, or of platinum and iridium, have been constructed, and can
                    be relied on, if properly taken care of, to remain very nearly accurate from
                    year to year. Similar specimens of the standard unit of capacity or microfarad
                    which remain very nearly constant have been successfully produced. For a fuller

                <p>Telegraph line testing consists mostly of comparisons of the resistance of the
                    conductor and the insulator with sets of standard resistances, and of
                    comparisons of the inductive capacity of the line or cable with standard
                    condensers of known capacity. When, as is sometimes the case, the strength of
                    the current flowing through the line or through a particular instrument is to be
                    determined, it is measured by an electrodynamometer, or by a current
                    galvanometer, properly constructed for indicating currents in absolute measure.
                    In the absence of such an instrument it may be obtained accurately by the use of
                    a standard galvanometer in a known or determined magnetic field, or, taking
                    advantage of Faraday’s discovery of the electro-chemical equivalents, by
                    measuring the amount of silver or of copper deposited by the current when it is
                    made to pass through an electrolytic cell; or the electromotive force per unit
                    resistance of the circuit may be determined by the use of standard resistances
                    and a standard cell. Space does not allow us to do more than simply refer to
                    these methods, the first two at least of which involve accurate and somewhat
                    difficult experimental work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Brit,</hi> shows how comparatively recent is the introduction of anything like
                    absolute measurement in telegraph testing The ordinary test for insulation
                    consists in applying a galvanic battery, with one pole to earth and the other
                    through a galvanometer coil, to the line of telegraph of which the remote end is
                    kept insulated. If the insulation of the whole line were perfect, the
                    galvanometer needle would stand at zero; but, when looked for with a battery of
                    suitable power and a galvanometer of suitable sensibility, indications of a
                    current are always found, unless it is a very short length of very perfectly
                    insulated line that is tested. The absolute measure of the strength of this
                    current divided by the absolute measure of the electromotive force of the
                    battery gives an absolute measure for the insulation of the cable. No
                    telegraphic testing ought in future to be accepted in any department of
                    telegraphic business which has not this definite character, although it is only
                    within the last year that convenient instruments for working in absolute measure
                    have been introduced at all, and the whole system of absolute measurement is
                    still almost unknown to practical electricians.” It was put in practice
                    systematically for the first time in 1859, in experiments by Prof. F.
                    Jenkin.</p></note><hi rend="italic">Measurement of JVire Resistance.—</hi> (1)

                    The effect of an electromotive force in the line itself is nearly eliminated by
                    reversing the battery.</p>
                <p>(2) Let the battery B (fig. 9) be connected through the keys K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and K and the galvanometer G with the line <hi
                    rend="italic">l,</hi> which has its distant end to the earth as before; shunt
                    the galvanometer by a shunt s until a convenient deflexion is obtained, and then
                    take as quickly as possible a series of readings with zinc and copper
                    alternately to the line. Next substitute for <hi rend="italic">l</hi> a set of
                    resistance coils and vary the resistance until the same series of readings is
                    obtained. The resistance introduced for the reproduction of each reading
                    indicates the apparent resistance of the line when that reading was taken. The
                    readings will generally differ because of the existence of a variable
                    electromotive force in the line. If, however, the difference is not very great,
                    the harmonic mean of the arithmetic mean of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n128/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0128-0117"/> resistances, when zinc and copper were
                    respectively to the line, will give nearly the true resistance. Since the
                    deflexions are reproduced by substituting resistances for the line, the
                    galvanometer zero may be off the scale to one side, and hence the total
                    deflexion, and therefore the sensibility, may be made very considerable. In this
                    case the reversing key K is required for keeping the deflexion in the same
                    direction. With a perfectly insulated battery this can be accomplished by
                    putting the galvanometer between the battery and the key K; but the arrangement
                    shown is safer. The most suitable galvanometer for these tests is a dead-beat
                    mirror galvanometer with a long enough suspension to prevent error from the
                    viscosity of the fibre. Such an instrument is much to be preferred to the
                    astatic form, especially when variable earth-currents are present.</p>
                <p>(3) A highly sensitive modification of method (2) is obtained by the use of a
                    differential galvanometer, one coil of which is joined in circuit with the
                    standard resistances and the other coil with the line. The resistances are then
                    adjusted to balance, or to give no permanent deflexion when the battery circuit
                    is closed. Several balances with positive and negative currents must be taken
                    and the results combined as indicated above.</p>
                <p>(4) When an electrometer is employed for testing insulation, as described below,
                    it may be used for the wire resistance also either by substituting it for th,e
                    galvanometer in Wheatstone’s bridge method (fig. 8, G) or by that shown in fig.
                    10. One pole of the battery B is joined to the line through the reversing key K
                    and the resistance R, the other pole being to the earth. The electrometer <hi
                    rend="italic">El</hi> is then applied to the two ends of R and to the end of <hi
                    rend="italic">l</hi> and the earth alternately and the relative deflexion noted.
                    The deflexions should be as nearly as possible equal; that is, R should be as
                    nearly as possible equal to <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> The form of reversing key
                    shown at K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is convenient for this test, as it
                    allows the comparisons to be made quickly; and, as the readings can be always
                    taken to the same side of zero, the whole length of the scale is available for
                    each deflexion. The key consists of two ordinary front and back stop single
                    lever keys fixed together by an insulating piece <hi rend="italic">i</hi> at
                    such a distance apart that the contact stops <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi> and c,
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> are at the corners of a square. Suppose one pole of the
                    battery put to the line and the resistance R adjusted until no change of
                    deflexion is obtained by depressing K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; then R is
                    equal to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> if there is no earth disturbance. Then put the
                    other pole of the battery to the line; turn the levers of K through 90° round
                    the pivot <hi rend="italic">p;</hi> and repeat the adjustment of R for a second
                    determination of <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> Repeat these measurements several
                    times and combine the results in the manner described in method (2). If R is not
                    made equal to Z, the resistances are in the ratio of the corresponding
                    deflexions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Measurement of Insulator Resistance.—</hi> (1) In the direct
                    deflexion method the connexions are the same as those shown in fig. 9, except
                    that the distant end of the line is insulated. Very great care must be taken
                    that the galvanometer and all the connexions between it and the end of the line
                    are so w ell insulated that no sensible part of the observed deflexion is due to
                    leakage through them. In making the test, first earth the line for five minutes;
                    then, with the galvanometer short-circuited, apply the zinc pole of the battery
                    to the line; at the end of from thirty seconds to a minute, depending on the
                    length and capacity of the line, remove the short-circuit plug; and record the
                    deflexion at the end of every ten or fifteen seconds during the whole time
                    (usually from ten to twenty minutes) the test is continued. Again earth the line
                    for an interval equal to that during which the battery was applied; then apply
                    the copper pole of the battery and repeat the readings as before. Using the
                    deflexions as ordinates and the corresponding times as abscissae, construct a
                    smooth curve for both the zinc and the copper test. The galvanometer constant
                    divided by the mean ordinate of these curves at any time gives the insulation at
                    that time. To determine the galvanometer constant, substitute a high resistance
                    R, say one megohm, for the line, and shunt the galvanometer with a shιAιt <hi
                    rend="italic">s.</hi> If the deflexion under these circumstances is <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and G is the galvanometer resistance, the constant is

                <p>s</p>
                <p>(2) The electrometer method is only applicable to lines of considerable inductive
                    capacity, but is particularly well suited for cable testing. The battery B (fig.
                    11) is connected through a reversing key K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to the
                    ends of the resistance slide <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> one end of which is put
                    to earth. The slide generally consists either of 10 or 100 equal resistances,
                    amounting in the aggregate to from 10,000 to 100,000 ohms. The cable can be
                    connected by means of the reversing key K to either pair of quadrants of the
                    electrometer <hi rend="italic">El,</hi> the slider <hi rend="italic">s</hi>
                    being at the same time put to the other pair.</p>
                <p>To determine the constant of the electrometer, connect the earth wire <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> with the cable terminal and the slider with contact 1, and
                    observe the deflexion; this should be the same for both directions of the
                    current through the slide; its value multiplied by 10, when the slide is made up
                    of ten coils, gives the value in scale divisions of the full difference of
                    potential between the ends of the slide. This number added to the zero reading
                    of the electrometer is called the <hi rend="italic">inferred zero.</hi> To find
                    the insulation of the cable, remove the wire <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> put in
                    the short circuit plug j», move the slider to contact 10, and, the distant end
                    of the cable being insulated, apply by means of K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    the zinc pole of the battery to the cable and the copper pole to the earth.
                    Allow sufficient time for the cable to charge—say one minute for a cable of 2000
                    knots—then remove the short-circuit plug and take readings every fifteen or
                    thirty seconds. The difference of these readings from zero gives the fall of
                    potential of the cable due to discharge through the insulating coat. Next earth
                    the cable at both ends for a time equal to the duration of the last test, and
                    after reversing K put the copper pole of the battery to the cable and the zinc
                    pole to the earth and take another series of readings. Subtract these readings
                    from the inferred zero, and, using the differences as ordinates and the
                    corresponding times as abscissae, draw two curves. To find the insulation of the
                    cable at any interval <hi rend="italic">t</hi> after the battery was applied,
                    draw a tangent to the curve at the point corresponding to that time and produce
                    it to cut the axis of the ordinates. Let D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be the
                    ordinate to the point of intersection, and D the ordinate at the time <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi>; then, if C be the capacity of the cable in microfarads and
                    I its insulation in megohms, t_</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ~C(D <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-D)∙</p>
                <p>If the difference between the reading and the inferred zero at the times <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> and Z <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be D and D <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the insulation is given by the equation ∙4343(Z <hi

                <p>when Z <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- <hi rend="italic">t</hi> is reckoned in
                    seconds. This latter is the formula commonly used; it gives the insulation at
                    some time in the interval between the two observations; the exact time depends
                    on the rate of “absorption” of the cable.</p>
                <p>The advantages of the electrometer method of testing cables are the comparative
                    steadiness of the needle during earth-current disturbances, its high sensibility
                    for the detection of small intermittent faults, and the fact that simultaneous
                    tests can be taken from both ends of the cable. In order to test from both ends
                    simultaneously one or other of the following methods may be adopted. Call the
                    ends of the cable A and B, and suppose the operator at A is to begin the test.
                    The operator at B joins the copper pole to the earth and the zinc pole to the
                    line, and leaves the slider of his slide resistance at the earth end of the
                    slide. Then, at a time previously arranged, he watches until he sees the
                    electrometer begin to indicate a charge in the cable, and moves the slider along
                    the slide so as to keep the electrometer near zero. As soon as the electrometer
                    ceases to indicate increase of charge he ceases to move the slider and begins to
                    record the deflexions at regular intervals, the first reading being taken as
                    zero. The other method is to leave the slider permanently to earth and keep the
                    electrometer so insensitive that the deflexion is always within the limits of
                    the scale. Observe the time at which the electrometer begins to be deflected,
                    and from that time onward take readings every thirty seconds during the time of
                    the test. The mean of the readings taken at both ends, reduced to the same
                    sensibility, should be used for calculating the insulation. This method not only
                    eliminates the effects of earthcurrent disturbance but also throws light on the
                    nature and distribution of such disturbances.</p>
                <p>When an electrometer is not available and the line is too much disturbed for good
                    tests to be obtained by the galvanometer method, the folio wing procedure maybe
                    adopted. Join the battery and the galvanometer in series with the cable as for
                    the direct deflexion test. Short-circuit the galvanometer and charge the cable
                    for one minute. Insulate the cable for fifteen seconds; then break the short
                    circuit of the galvanometer; again apply the battery, and take the deflexion
                    produced by the charge. Keep the battery on the cable for fifteen seconds, and
                    during that time take if possible the direct deflexion reading two or three
                    times. Again insulate for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n129/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0129-0118"/> fifteen seconds and repeat the above readings;
                    and continue the same cycle of operations for the whole time of the test. After
                    earthing the cable for the proper interval repeat the above test with the other
                    pole of the battery to the cable. To reduce the charge readings to absolute
                    measure, find the deflexion of the galvanometer needle due to the charge of a
                    condenser of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> microfarads capacity by the testing
                    battery; let <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be this deflexion. Then the deflexion that
                    would be obtained by charging the whole cable would be <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cd∣n,</hi> and, if D be any one of the deflexions during the test, <hi
                    rend="italic">^Dn∣Cd</hi> is the fraction of the whole charge which has been
                    lost in the fifteen seconds immediately preceding this charge; thus <hi

                <p>The method just described takes advantage in a somewhat imperfect manner of both
                    the direct deflexion and the electrometer test; but the galvanometer should have
                    such a long period that the whole of the charge can take place before the needle
                    is sensibly moved from its zero position, and that the vibration of the needle
                    must not be damped to any great extent,—a condition which renders the instrument
                    unsuitable for direct deflexion testing.</p>
                <p>The points with regard to the cable which should be particularly attended to when
                    testing for insulation are—the continuity of the insulation all through the
                    test, that is, there should be no sign of a breakdown for ever so short a time;
                    the rate of polarization with positive and negative current is always the same
                    in a perfect cable, but is seldom so when a fault exists; the absolute
                    insulation with both currents should also be the same if the cable is perfect,
                    but is never so for any length of time when a fault exists. If the insulations
                    show any sign of being defective great care must be taken not to apply a
                    powerful battery to the cable, unless the object is to increase or “break down”
                    the fault. The resistance of a fault is generally diminished by applying the
                    zinc pole of the battery to the cable and increased by applying the copper pole;
                    but if the fault is small it sometimes happens that both currents increase the
                    resistance. Even a very powerful battery may in such a case fail to increase the
                    fault.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Capacitιj Tests.—</hi> The arrangement of the connexions for
                    Thomson’s capacity test are shown in fig. 12. A well-insulated battery B is
                    connected through a reversing key K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to the slide
                    resistance <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> and by means of a key K <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> can be put to a standard condenser C and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to the
                    cable, or the condenser and the cable can be connected together and then both
                    put to earth through the galvanometer G by closing the key K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Any point in the resistance <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>
                    can be put to earth by means of the slider <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> Suppose the
                    middle point put to the earth, then C and L will be charged to equal potentials
                    but of opposite sign. If the connexions to the slide are broken and C is joined
                    to L, the resulting charge will be zero when the capacity C is equal to the
                    capacity L, and when K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is closed no current will
                    flow through G. Similarly, if as is to as L is to C the resulting charge is
                    zero. Hence when, after joining C to L, no deflexion is shown on G when K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is closed—</p>
                <p>L = C^∙</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">sb</hi></p>
                <p>A modification of this test has been suggested by Mr John Gott. The condenser C
                    is joined in series with the cable and one end of the slide is put to earth. The
                    galvanometer G is joined from the end of the cable to the slider s and the
                    position of the latter, which gives no deflexion, is found by successive trials,
                    the cable being discharged and recharged between the trials. A small condenser
                    in the galvanometer circuit is an advantage, as it allows several adjustments to
                    be made without discharging the cable. The most suitable instrument, however, is
                    an electrometer, as it allows the adjustment to be made at once.</p>
                <p>The capacities of condensers may be compared by charging or discharging them
                    through a galvanometer and comparing the deflexions, or, as in De Sauty’s
                    method, by substituting them for two sides of a Wheatstone’s bridge and finding
                    the ratio of the resistances in the other two sides; then, with the galvanometer
                    circuit closed, the battery circuit can be closed without producing any
                    deflexion. The galvanometer circuit must join the condensers at the same points
                    as the bridge resistances. These methods are quite unsuited for telegraph-line
                    testing because of the resistance and the inductive retardation of the line.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tests of a Submerged Cable.—</hi> During the submergence of a
                    cable it is necessary to provide the means of knowing at every instant whether
                    it continues in perfect electrical condition, so that should any fault develop
                    it can be at once detected and further paying out stopped until it is removed.
                    It is also of great importance that the ship and shore should be in telegraphic
                    communication with each other. The arrangements made for these purposes by
                    different electricians vary considerably; but the general principle will be
                    gathered from fig. 13, which includes all that is absolutely necessary for the
                    purpose. The principal testing station is always on board the ship, and from it
                    all the testing operations both on board and on shore are regulated. Referring
                    first to the arrangements on board, B is the testing battery, K the testing key,
                    and G the testing galvanometer; B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is the signalling
                    or “speaking” battery, K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the key, and G <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the galvanometer; R is a resistance box and E the
                    earth-plate—the ship’s side in this case. The battery B is connected through the
                    key K, the resistance R, and the galvanometer G to the cable, as for direct
                    deflexion testing. The shore end of the cable is at the same time connected to
                    one set of plates of a highly insulated condenser C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    and (although this may be omitted) to one pair of quadrants of an electrometer
                    <hi rend="italic">Ek</hi> The other pair of plates of the condenser are put to
                    earth through the signalling key K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. It is
                    convenient also to have a second condenser C, on shore, the capacity of which
                    can be readily varied, so arranged that its capacity can be added to that of C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by depressing the key K, and again discharged
                    through a galvanometer G by releasing the key. The operations are then conducted
                    as follows. The insulation is measured on board ship, alternately with positive
                    and negative currents of from ten to fifteen minutes’ duration, by observing the
                    deflexion on the galvanometer G; and the reading at the end of each minute, or
                    offener, is recorded in a diary. The continuity of the conductor is tested at
                    short intervals—say every five minutes— by the observer on shore depressing the
                    key K and thus adding the capacity of C to the cable. This gives a sudden
                    deflexion on the galvanometer G on board, and at the same time shows that the
                    conductor is continuous and that the observer on shore is attending to his
                    duties. When the shore key K is released, the discharge through G is indicated
                    by a throw deflexion, the amount of which is recorded in the diary and shows the
                    potential to which the shore end of the cable is kept charged. When the
                    electrometer <hi rend="italic">El</hi> is used, a continuous test of the
                    potential at the shore end is obtained, and the development of a fault in the
                    cable is at once indicated. It is convenient for this purpose to dispense with
                    the charge in the electrometer jar and needle and connect the needle to the pair
                    of quadrants which are joined to the cable. The deflexion is then proportional
                    to the square of the potential and is always to one side of zero, so that the
                    whole range of the scale is available for the deflexion. The tests for
                    wire-resistance and capacity are practically the same as those already
                    described. They are in ordinary circumstances of much less importance than the
                    insulation tests. The wire-resistance test is of great value, however, for
                    giving a close estimate of the temperature of the submerged cable, and hence for
                    giving the means of comparing the tests of the submerged cable with those of the
                    cable previous to submersion. In laying short lengths of cable the shore station
                    may be dispensed with and capacity tests relied on for continuity. Communication
                    between ship and shore is carried on by means of the keys K <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 1</hi>, K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, the galvanometer G], and the batteries
                    B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The signalling
                    key on board the ship adds or subtracts the electromotive force of the battery B
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> from the testing battery, and hence varies the
                    potential of the cable. This is shown on shore by the partial charge or
                    discharge of C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> passing through the galvanometer G
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and is interpreted in accordance with the single
                    needle alphabet in the ordinary way. In a similar manner the signalling key on
                    shore varies the charge of C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and so causes slight
                    variations of the testing-current on board the ship, which are read on the
                    galvanometer G <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and interpreted in the same way. The
                    testing is usually suspended during the signalling; but if the message is long
                    an insulation reading is taken every few minutes according to
                    pre-arrangement.</p>
                <p>The galvanometers used at sea require to be constructed so that the rolling of
                    the ship does not deflect the needle, either on account of its inertia and the
                    action of gravity, or of the relative changes in the position of the ship’s
                    magnetism. The best form of marine galvanometer consists of two short bobbins of
                    fine silk-covered wire placed end to end, about an eighth of an inch apart, and
                    having their axes in the same line, with a very light mirror, carrying cemented
                    to its back one or more small magnets suspended between the two bobbins in such
                    a way that the centre of the mirror is in their common axis. The mirror and
                    magnet system weighs from one-half to one grain. It is suspended as shown in
                    fig. 14 by a <pb break="no"

                    centre of inertia of the mirror and needle system <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and
                    is fixed at one end directly to the frame F and at the other end to a light
                    spring <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> The frame F is made thin enough to slide into
                    the opening between the two bobbins, so that the mirror can be easily taken out
                    for adjustment when necessary. So long as the suspending fibre passes through
                    the centre of inertia of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> it is clear that no motion of
                    translation of F can produce rotation of the mirror. When the instrument
                    requires to be highly sensitive, as for testing purposes, it is shielded from
                    the action of the ship’s and the earth’s magnetism by enclosing it in a massive
                    iron case. For signalling purposes the controlling magnet is arranged to produce
                    at the needle a field so strong that the effect of variations of external
                    magnetism is inappreciable.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Testing for Faults.—</hi> Numerous methods have been proposed
                    for the localization of faults in telegraph lines, some of a complex character
                    and adapted to the cases of faults of a kind which fortunately seldom, if ever,
                    occur. We give here a brief outline of the tests for the cases of most common
                    occurrence.</p>
                <p>For the determination of the position of a complete rupture with the conductor
                    insulated both the insulation and the capacity tests are theoretically
                    applicable. The insulation of a line of uniform type and material is inversely
                    as its length; hence if a piece is broken off the insulation is increased. If I
                    be the total insulation before rupture, I <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the
                    insulation of one section after rupture, and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> the total
                    length of the line, the length of the section is IZ∕I <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>. Unfortunately it is difficult to obtain the necessary accuracy in
                    insulation testing on account of the great influence of earth-currents on the
                    result; but apart from this there is always some uncertainty, especially in
                    cables, as to the insulation at the break. For cables a fairly reliable test can
                    be obtained from the capacity even when the insulation at the fault is somewhat
                    imperfect, if it be sufficient to hold the greater part of the charge for a few
                    seconds, since the amount of loss in any short interval can be estimated by a
                    separate test. The capacity of a uniform cable is inversely as its length;
                    hence, if C be the total capacity of the perfect cable and C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the capacity of one section, the length of that section
                    is ZC <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ∕C. When— as is almost always the case—the
                    cable is not quite uniform in electrical quality and in temperature, a table or
                    a curve showing the wire resistance, the insulation, and the capacity up to any
                    point from either end should be kept for reference.</p>
                <p>It is not at all uncommon in cables for one side of a fracture to be partially
                    insulated through the conductor not breaking exactly at the same point as the
                    insulator. In this case, however, the other end will be in most cases almost
                    perfectly earthed and the position of the fault can be very nearly determined by
                    the wireresistance test. When both ends are partially insulated it is very
                    difficult to obtain a near approach to the position of the fault because of the
                    uncertainty as to which side of the break offers the greatest resistance. A
                    first approximation is obtained by finding the wire resistance from both ends
                    and subtracting the total wire resistance of the cable from the sum of these.
                    This gives the sum of the resistances at the fracture, and half of this, if it
                    is not too great, subtracted from the resistance of either section gives an
                    approximation to the resistance of that section up to the break. If, however,
                    the resistance at the fracture is comparable to the total wire resistance of the
                    cable, this method is useless. An approach to the solution of the difficulty can
                    be obtained from capacity tests, the cable being discharged through different
                    resistances at the testing end. But the procedure is very uncertain and
                    difficult, and a full discussion of it would take more space than can be
                    afforded here. The resistance at a fault can sometimes be greatly diminished by
                    repeated application alternately of the positive and negative poles of a
                    powerful battery to the cable, but this should never be resorted to if it can
                    possibly be avoided. The direct deflexion method of taking wire resistance is
                    most suitable for these tests. The resistance seems to diminish gradually after
                    the battery is applied until it reaches a minimum value, after which it again
                    increases. This maximum deflexion should be taken as indicating most nearly the
                    true wire resistance up to the fracture.</p>
                <p>When the fault is a partial earth without fracture, and both ends of the cable
                    are available—as in factory testing, or when a second well-insulated cable can
                    be used—the most satisfactory method is the loop test. In this the two sections
                    of the cable form two sides of the Wheatstone’s bridge; one pole of the battery
                    is put to the junction of the other two sides and the other pole to earth,—that
                    is, practically to the fault. The ratio of the resistances in the bridge when
                    balance is obtained gives the ratio of the resistances of the two sections of
                    the cable, or the ratio of the resistance of one section to the resistance of
                    the other section plus the resistance of the second cable. The total resistance
                    of the cable being known, it is easy to determine the position of the fault.
                    When the fault has a high resistance it is necessary to make a correction for
                    the want of perfect insulation in the sound part of the cable. When both ends of
                    the cable are not available, measure the potential at the testing end and the
                    resistance between that end and the earth, and simultaneously measure, by means
                    of a slide resistance and zero galvanometer or by means of a quadrant
                    electrometer, the potential at the distant end. Then, if V be the potential at
                    the testing end, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> the potential at the distant end, and
                    R the resistance measured, the true resistance of the fault is R(l-∙υ∕V).
                    Another simple, although less perfect method, may be mentioned. Measure the
                    resistance between both ends and the earth and subtract from the sum the true
                    wire resistance of the cable; the difference is twice the resistance of the
                    fault. The imperfection of this method, and indeed of any which involves two
                    observations not made simultaneously, lies in the variable character of the
                    resistance of a fault.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Modern Telegraphs.</hi></p>
                <p>The code of signals introduced by Morse is still employed in the United States
                    and Canada, and the international code in vogue in Europe differs only slightly
                    from it. Currents in one direction only are used, and different combinations of
                    from one to four long and short contacts form the letters, while the numerals
                    are represented by groups of five signals, and punctuation and other special
                    signs by groups of six and sometimes more. The instruments used for land
                    telegraphs on this system are of two types,—“sounders,” which indicate by sound,
                    and “recorders,” which record the signals.</p>
                <p>(1) Recorders vary in details of construction, but all have the same object,
                    namely, to record the intervals during which the current is applied to the line.
                    In the earlier forms of instrument the record was made by embossing lines on a
                    ribbon of paper by means of a sharp stile fixed to one end of a lever, which
                    carried at the other end the armature of an electromagnet. This method of
                    recording is still largely employed in America, and certainly has the advantage
                    of simplicity. The form of instrument almost universally used in Europe makes
                    the record in ink, and hence is sometimes called the “ink-writer.” This method
                    has the advantage of distinctness, and so is less trying to the eyes of the
                    operators. The action of the instrument will be understood from the annexed
                    sketch (fig. 15). Suppose <hi rend="italic">s</hi> to be a strip of paper which
                    is being'pulled towards the left by means of two rollers <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> moved by a train of mechanism. Underneath the
                    roller <hi rend="italic">r</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi> a small wheel
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is kept turning by the same mechanism, and has its
                    lower edge in contact with the surface of ink in the ink-well <hi rend="italic"
                    >w.</hi> When a current is sent through the magnet <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the
                    armature <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is attracted and the lever <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> lifts the ink-wheel <hi rend="italic">i</hi> into contact with the
                    paper, against the surface of which it rolls until the current is broken, thus
                    making a mark the length of which depends on the speed of the mechanism and the
                    time the current flows. As the speed of the mechanism is nearly constant, the
                    relative lengths of the marks depend only on the duration of the current. In
                    this way the letters of the alphabet, or any other understood signs, are
                    indicated by groups of long and short marks, commonly called “dashes” and
                    “dots.”</p>
                <p>(2) Operators who use the record-learn to read the message by the click against
                    its stop, and as this is a less ing instrument soon of the armature fatiguing
                    method of reading, and leaves the hands and eyes free to write, the sound is
                    usually preferred. Thus, when it is not necessary to keep a copy, a much simpler
                    instrument may be employed and the message read by sound. The earliest
                    successful form was Bright’s bell sounder, which consisted of two bells of
                    distinct tone or pitch, one of which was sounded when the current was sent in
                    one direction and the other when it was reversed. This instrument was capable of
                    giving very considerable speed, but it was more complicated than that now in
                    use, which consists only of an electromagnet, with its armature lever arranged
                    to stop <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n131/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0131-0120"/> against an anvil or screw <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> (fig. 16) in such a way as to give a distinct and somewhat loud sound.
                    Dots and dashes are distinguished by the interval between the sounds of the
                    instrument in precisely the same way as they are distinguished when reading from
                    the recorder by sound. The form of sounder commonly used in England is shown in
                    fig. 16; it is one of the simplest possible instruments, is easily adjusted to
                    the current by tightening or slackening the spring <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> and
                    is very little liable to get out of order.</p>
                <p>Another and in βome respects a simpler method of recording is to use a chemically
                    prepared ribbon of paper. Suppose, for instance, the paper ribbon to be soaked
                    in a solution of iodide of potassium and a light contact spring made to press
                    continuously on its surface as it is pulled forward by the mechanism. Then, if a
                    current is sent from the spring to the roller through the paper, a brown mark
                    will be made by the spring due to the liberation of iodine. This was the
                    principle of the chemical telegraph proposed by Edward Davy in 1838 and of that
                    proposed by Bain in 1846. It gives a ready means of recording on the Morse plan
                    at a high rate of speed, and Bain’s telegraph was successfully worked for some
                    years in America. Several ingenious applications of his method have been
                    proposed, as, for example, the copying telegraph of Bakewell and of Cros, by
                    means of which a telegram may be transmitted in the sender’s own handwriting;
                    the pantelegraph of Caselli; the autographic telegraphs of Meyer, Lenoir,
                    Sawyer, and others; and the autographic typo-telegraph of Bonelli. The principle
                    of action of these instruments is this. Suppose two metallic cylinders, one at
                    the sending and the other at the receiving station, to be kept revolving
                    synchronously, and suppose the axis of each to be threaded with a fine screw so
                    that as it revolves rapidly it has a slow side motion. Wrap round the cylinder
                    at the sending station a ribbon of tinfoil, or paper covered with a conducting
                    coating, on which the message is written in varnish or some other insulating
                    substance. Suppose also a ribbon of paper which has been soaked in iodide of
                    potassium to be wrapped round the cylinder at the receiving station. Cause a
                    stile, as in the Bain telegraph, to press on each cylinder and set it in motion.
                    It is evident that so long as the stile at the sending end presses on the clean
                    foil the stile at the receiving end will continue to make a brown mark, but that
                    when it passes over the varnish the mark will be interrupted. In this way, as
                    the two cylinders revolve and move sideways, the series of interruptions made at
                    the receiving end form an exact copy of the varnish marks at the sending end.
                    These instruments are at present but little used.</p>
                <p>It has been found possible to make the Morse ink-writer so sensitive that it can
                    record signals sent over land lines of several hundred miles in length very much
                    faster than they can be transmitted by hand, and this has led to the adoption of
                    automatic methods of transmission. One was proposed by Bain as early as 1846,
                    but it did not come into use. That now employed is, however, practically a
                    development of his idea. It consists in punching, by means of “a puncher,” a
                    series of holes in a strip of paper in such a way that, when the strip is sent
                    through another instrument, called the “transmitter,” the holes cause the
                    circuit to be closed at the proper times and for the proper proportionate
                    intervals for the message to be correctly printed by the receiving instrument or
                    recorder. The most successful apparatus of this kind is that devised by
                    Wheatstone; others have been introduced by Siemens and Halske, Garnier,
                    Humaston, Siemens, and Little.</p>
                <p>In Wheatstone’s automatic apparatus three levers are placed side by side, each
                    acting on a set of small punches and on mechanism for feeding the paper forward
                    a step after each operation of the levers. The punches are arranged as shown in
                    fig. 17, and the levers are adjusted so that the left-hand one moves <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c</hi> and punches a row of holes across the paper (group 1
                    in the figure), the middle one moves <hi rend="italic">b</hi> only and punches a
                    centre hole (2 in the figure), while the right-hand one moves <hi rend="italic"
                    >a, b, cl, e</hi> and punches four holes (3 and 4 in the figure). The whole of
                    this operation represents a dot and a dash or the letter “a.” The side rows of
                    holes only are used for transmitting the message, the centre row being required
                    for feeding forward the paper in the transmitter. The perforation of the paper
                    when done by hand is usually performed by means of small mallets, but at the
                    central telegraph office in London the keys are only used for opening
                    air-valves, the actual punching being done by pneumatic pressure. In this way
                    several thicknesses of paper can be perforated at the same time, which is a
                    great convenience for press work, since copies of the same message have often to
                    be transmitted to several newspapers at the same time. The mode of using the
                    paper ribbon for the transmission of the message is illustrated in fig. 18. An
                    ebonite beam E is rocked up and down rapidly by a train of mechanism and moves
                    the cranks A and B by means of two metal pins <hi rend="italic">p, p.</hi> A and
                    B are in metallic contact with each other through the springs <hi rend="italic"
                    >s, s,</hi> and they carry two light vertical rods M, M <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, the one as much in front of the other as there is space between two
                    successive holes in the perforated ribbon. To the other ends of A, B rods H, H
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are loosely hinged, their ends passing loosely
                    through holes in the ends of the bar P, which is fixed to the divided disk D. By
                    means of two collars K, K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the wheel W, the disk
                    D is made to oscillate in unison with the beam E. The cranks C and C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> are connected with the poles of the sending battery B.
                    The operation is as follows. The paper ribbon R is moved forward by its centre
                    row of holes at the proper speed above the upper ends of the rods M, M <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; should there be no hole in the ribbon it pushes the
                    crank A or B out of contact with the pins <hi rend="italic">p, p</hi> and
                    prevents a current passing to the line. Should, however, a row of holes, like
                    group 1 above, be perforated, the rod M <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will first
                    be allowed to pass through the paper and copper will be put to the line; at the
                    next half stroke of the beam, M will pass through, and as the disk D reverses
                    the battery zinc will be put to the line. Thus for a dot first a positive and
                    then a negative current are sent to the line, the effect of the positive current
                    continuing during the time required for the paper to travel the space bejtween
                    two holes. Again, suppose groups 3 and 4 to be punched. The first part will be,
                    as before, copper to the line; at the next half stroke of the beam M will not
                    pass through, as there is no hole in the paper; but at the third half stroke it
                    passes through and zinc is put to the line. Thus for a dash the interval between
                    the positive and the negative current is equal to the time the paper takes to
                    travel over twice the space between two successive holes. Hence for sending both
                    a dot and a dash reverse currents of short duration are sent through the line,
                    but the interval between the reversal is three times as great for the dash as
                    for the dot. In the receiving instrument the electromagnet is so constructed
                    that the armature, if pulled into any position by either current, remains in
                    that position, whether the current continues to flow or not, until a reverse
                    current is made to act on the magnet. For the dot the armature is deflected by
                    the first current, the ink-wheel being brought into contact with the paper and
                    after a short interval pulled back by the reverse current. In the case of the
                    dash the ink-wheel is brought into contact with the paper by the first current
                    as before and is pulled back by the reverse current after three times the
                    interval. The armature acts on an inking disk on the principle described above,
                    save only that the disk is supplied with ink from a groove in a second wheel, on
                    which it rolls: the grooved wheel is kept turning with one edge in contact with
                    ink in an ink-well. By this method of transmission the battery is always to the
                    line for the same interval of time, and alternately with opposite poles, so that
                    the effect of electrostatic induction is reduced to a minimum. Through the
                    instrumentality of this method as many as 400 words per minute have lately been
                    transmitted by Mr Preece between London and Newcastle, a distance of 278
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The first considerable improvement on the House type-printer, referred to above,
                    was made by D. E. Hughes of Kentucky in 1855. In the Hughes instrument (see fig.
                    19) two trains of clockwork mechanism, one at each end of the line, are kept
                    moving synchronously by powerful spring governors. Each instrument is provided
                    with a key-board, resembling that of a small piano, the key levers of which
                    communicate with a circular row, R, of vertical pins. A horizontal arm A fixed
                    to a vertical shaft in gear with the mechanism sweeps over these pins at the
                    rate of from one to two turns per second. When a key is depressed, slightly
                    raising one of the pins, the battery is put to the line for a short time at that
                    part of the revolution by means of a sledge S carried by the horizontal arm. The
                    current thus sent to the line may be made either to act directly on the printing
                    instrument or to close a local circuit by means of a relay. For simplicity we
                    will suppose direct action. The current then passes through the coils of a
                    powerful electromagnet M, which relieves the printing mechanism. The
                    electromagnet consists of two coils each containing a soft iron core of the same
                    length as the coil. These cores rest on the ends of the two arms of a powerful
                    horse-shoe permanent magnet, and thus become strongly polarized by induction. A
                    soft iron armature is placed across the free ends of the soft iron cores and is
                    pulled by a strong spring, the tension <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n132/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0132-0121"/> of which is adjusted so as to be nearly equal to
                    the magnetic attraction. The current is sent in the proper direction to diminish
                    the power of the magnet and allow the spring to preponderate. A very powerful
                    action is thus obtained by means of a very small current, the actual work being
                    done by motive-power in the instrument itself. After the letter is printed the
                    mechanism short-circuits the magnet and replaces the armature automatically. The
                    printing action is as follows. The type-wheel W is carried round continuously by
                    the clockwork, to which it is attached through a friction sleeve which allows it
                    to be stopped, and pushed backward or forward without stopping the mechanism.
                    Another shaft carrying three cams is arranged so as to be locked into gear with
                    the wheelwork when the armature leaves the poles of the magnet. The cams then
                    come into action in rotation; the first moves the adjustment lever, shown to the
                    left of W in the figure, which pushes a wedge-shaped piece into the teeth of the
                    type-wheel and adjusts it exactly to the proper position for printing; the
                    second cam presses the paper against the type; the third moves forward the
                    paper; a fourth cam replaces the armature of the magnet and relieves the cam
                    shaft, leaving the instrument ready to receive another letter. The whole of this
                    operation occupies only a small fraction of a second. By means of the adjustment
                    lever or “corrector” <hi rend="italic">l</hi> every error in synchronism
                    decidedly less than half the space from letter to letter is perfectly corrected
                    each time an impression is made. Thus, during the time the receiving instrument
                    at one station is in use, its typewheel is kept in perfect agreement with the
                    sending wheel at the other station; and, if the electric action keeps time, a
                    wrong letter cannot be printed unless the rate of the clockwork is at fault by
                    some such amount as one or two per cent. If the two wheels are allowed to run a
                    long time without the electric maintenance of agreement, they will be found more
                    or less at variance, as the pieces of clockwork, however good, cannot be
                    perfect. All that is necessary to bring them into agreement again is to strike
                    several times the key corresponding to a prearranged adjustment signal— that
                    corresponding to the dot type, for instance. The receiver knows (according to
                    the regulated system of working) that it is adjustment, not message, that is
                    being sent; and he turns his type-wheel by hand till it prints dots. He then
                    signals back “O.K.” (“All correct! ”) and is ready to receive the message. If by
                    any accident his type-wheel gets on a wrong letter in the course of a message,
                    he disturbs the sender (who all the time sees the effect of his sending printed
                    before his own eyes) by sending back a few currents on him; he receives dots by
                    way of acknowledgment, and resets his type-wheel to print correctly. This system
                    of telegraphic printing has a great advantage over the step-by-step system in
                    using continuous instead of intermittent currents, and so avoiding the necessity
                    for the rapidly acting electric escapement, which, however skilfully planned and
                    executed, is always liable to failure when worked too rapidly. In Hughes’s
                    instrument almost perfect accuracy and certainty have been attained; and in
                    actual practice it has proved to be decidedly superior to all previous
                    type-printing telegraphs, not only in speed and accuracy, but in less liability
                    to mechanical derangement from wear and tear and from accident. It involves many
                    novel features: the receiving electromagnet is of peculiar construction and
                    remarkable efficiency; the transmitting apparatus has a contrivance to prevent
                    unintentional repetitions of a letter through the operator holding his finger
                    too long on a key; the type-wheel has a lock for each station, to be opened by
                    its own key, one of the letter keys of any of the instruments in the circuit.
                    This instrument was for some years extensively used in the United States, until
                    superseded by G. Μ. Phelps’s modification of it, known as the “American
                    combination printing telegraph,” because it embodied part of Hughes’s and part
                    of House’s instruments. With this modified form somewhat greater speed was
                    obtained, but it was found difficult to drive, requiring the use of steam or
                    some such motive-power. In a subsequent modification introduced in 1875 an
                    electromotor is applied to drive the printing mechanism. This allows a shorter
                    train and stronger wheelwork to be used, secures more certain action, and
                    involves less risk of derangement.</p>
                <p>Hughes’s form was taken up by the French Government in 1860, and is still very
                    largely in use in France.</p>
                <p>Stock and private line telegraphs constitute an important class of instruments,
                    of which Laws’s “gold indicator,” introduced in 1866, may be taken as the
                    forerunner. A brief description of Calahan’s stock telegraph, introduced in
                    1867, will give a general idea of the action of this class of instruments. The
                    printing mechanism consists of two typewheels, on the edge of one of which are
                    the letters of the alphabet and on the edge of the other the numerals from 1 to
                    9 and fractions by eighths up to unity. The type-wheels are placed side by side,
                    but can be turned independently of each other. Beneath them a platen is carried
                    on one end of a lever, whose other end is attached to the armature of an
                    electromagnet. Between the platen and the wheels a ribbon of paper broad enough
                    to cover the edges of both wheels is passed. The instrument is worked by three
                    lines of wire, one for driving each type-wheel and one for printing and feeding
                    the paper forward. The movement of the type-wheel is accomplished by an
                    escapement acted on by closing and opening the circuit of an electromagnet. For
                    the convenience of the sender the transmitting instrument is made in the form of
                    two dials, each resembling the dial of an ABC instrument, round the edge of one
                    of which letters are printed, and round the other the numerals and fractions.
                    Mechanism is provided for opening and closing the circuit, so that by turning a
                    handle (fixed to an axis passing through the centre of the dial) until an index
                    attached to it points to the letter which is to be printed, the type-wheel of
                    the receiving instrument is in the proper position to print that letter, and
                    this is accomplished by depressing a key and closing the third circuit. The
                    printing magnet then raises the platen and presses the paper against the type.
                    Suppose direct United States telegraph stock is to be reported and the price is
                    9∣. The operator turns the index on the letter dial to D and presses the
                    printing key; he next turns the index to period and again presses the printing
                    key; he then turns in succession to U, to period, to S, to period, and prints
                    these; then he turns the index on the figure dial to 9 and prints it, lastly to
                    ⅛ and to period, and prints them. The quotation then reads on the paper ribbon
                    D. U. S. 9∣.</p>
                <p>Various modifications of this instrument have since been introduced. In one form,
                    the “universal stock printer,” two lines of wire are required, and both
                    type-wheels are driven by one wire, the printing magnet being made to change the
                    action from one wheel to the other when the wheels are brought into a particular
                    position. In another, “Phelps’s stock printer,” only one line of wire is
                    required, a polarized armature being used for moving the type-wheels and an
                    ordinary neutral armature for the printing. The rapid reversals which work the
                    polarized armature do not last long enough to move the printing lever, but when
                    a pause is made the printing mechanism is relieved and a letter printed. This
                    instrument is similar in principle to the House apparatus and is capable of
                    working at a considerable speed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Cowper’s writing telegraph is designed to record the message in written
                    characters; its arrangement is as follows :—Two lines of wire are connected, one
                    with each of two small resistance slides, which are placed in such a way that
                    the sliders move in the same plane but in directions at right angles to each
                    other. A pen placed at the point of intersection of the lines of motion of the
                    two sliders is connected with them in such a way that, when it is moved, as in
                    the act of writing, each slider takes up that component of the motion which is
                    in the direction in which it is free to move. The sliders thus vary the
                    resistance in the line circuits by an amount proportional to the motion of the
                    pen, and when a battery is kept joined in the circuit the current varies in the
                    same way. The current is passed through the coils of two electromagnets at the
                    receiving end, each capable of giving motion to a pencil in one line, at right
                    angles to the direction of motion of the other. When the pen at the sending end
                    is moved as in the act of writing a message <pb break="no"

                    corresponding manner on account of the variations of the current, and in this
                    way it writes the message on a slip of paper moving beneath its point.</p>

                    arrangement on the open circuit system for single-current working is shown in
                    fig. 20, in which L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> represents the line, G a simple
                    form of galvanoscope, used simply to show that the currents are going to line
                    when the message is being transmitted, K the transmitting key, B the battery,
                    <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the receiving instrument, and E the earthplate. The
                    complete circuit is from the plate E through the instrument I, the key K, and
                    the galvanoscope G to the line L <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, then through the
                    corresponding instruments to the earth-plate E at the other end, and back
                    through the earth to the plate E. The earth is always, except for some special
                    reason, used as a return, because it offers little resistance and saves the
                    expense and the risk of failure of the return wire. The earth-plate E ought to
                    be buried in moist earth or in water. In towns the water and gas pipe systems
                    form excellent earth-plates. It will be observed that the circuit is not in this
                    case actually <hi rend="italic">open</hi>; the meaning of the expression “open
                    circuit” is “no battery to line.” Under normal circumstances the instruments at
                    both ends are ready to receive, both ends of the line being to earth through the
                    receiving instruments. A signal is sent by depressing the key K, and so changing
                    the contact from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and thus
                    putting the battery to line. On circuits where the traffic is small it is usual
                    to make one wire serve several stations. The connexions at an intermediate or
                    wayside station are shown at W. S is a switch, consisting of three blocks of
                    brass fixed to an insulating base. W may be made the terminal station of L <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> by inserting plug 3, and of L <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> by inserting plug 2, or the instruments may be cut out of circuit by
                    inserting plug 1. In ordinary circumstances the messages from all stations are
                    sent through the whole line, and thus the operator at any station may transmit,
                    if the line is free, by manipulating his key. The greatest inconvenience of this
                    system arises from the varying strength and resistance of the batteries used at
                    the different stations. As, however, delicate recording instruments are seldom
                    required on such circuits little difficulty is experienced.</p>
                <p>(2) The connexions for positive and negative current or singleneedle working on
                    open circuit are shown in fig. 21, in which all the letters have the same
                    meanings as before. But N is a single needle instrument, and K is a reversing
                    key. The levers 1 and 2 press against the stops <hi rend="italic">a</hi> when
                    the line is free; hence the line is to earth at both ends. But, if lever 1 is
                    depressed, one pole of the battery is put to line; if 2 is depressed, the other
                    pole is put to the line. In this way the needles of the receiving instrument may
                    be made to turn to either left or right; and, if we call a motion to the left a
                    dot and a motion to the right a dash, the Morse alphabet may be read from these
                    motions. The connexions for wayside stations are illustrated at W, and will be
                    readily understood from the description given under single-current working
                    above.</p>
                <p>(3) When the line consists in whole or in part of underground or submarine cable
                    the capacity causes a very considerable diminution in the speed of working. This
                    is to some extent got over by putting the earth connexion in the middle of the
                    battery and using double the number of cells, as shown in fig. 22. The stop <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> of the key K is connected through a switch S with one pole
                    of the battery B, and the stop <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in the usual way with
                    the other pole. Suppose the arm c of the switch S to be in contact with 2; then
                    when the key is manipulated it sends alternately positive and negative currents
                    into the line. If the positive is called the signalling current, the line will
                    be charged positively each time a signal is sent; but as soon as the signal is
                    completed a negative charge is communicated to the line, thus hastening the
                    discharge and the return of the relay lever to its insulated stop. This method
                    of working has been already referred to in connexion with Wheatstone’s automatic
                    system.</p>
                <p>The connexions for single-current working on this system are illustrated in fig.
                    23. It differs from the open circuit in only requiring one battery (although, as
                    in the figure, half of it is often placed at each end), in having the receiving
                    instrument between the line and the key, and in having the battery continuously
                    to the line. The battery is kept to the line by the bar c, which short-circuits
                    the keys. When signals are to be sent from either station the operator turns the
                    bar c out of contact with the stop <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and then operates
                    precisely as in open circuit sending. This system is more expensive than the
                    open circuit system, as the battery is always at work; but it offers some
                    advantages on circuits where there are a number of intermediate stations, as the
                    circuit is under a constant electromotive force and has the same resistance no
                    matter which station is sending or receiving. The arrangement at a wayside
                    station is shown at W. When the circuit is long and contains a large number of
                    stations, the sending battery is sometimes divided among them in order to give
                    greater uniformity of current along the line. When only one battery is used the
                    current at the distant end may be considerably affected by the leakage to earth
                    along the line.</p>
                <p>In working long circuits with ordinary instruments inconveniently high battery
                    power is required in order to send sufficient current to produce the signals. In
                    such cases it is usual to employ a local battery to produce the signals and to
                    close the local battery circuit by means of a delicate circuit-closing apparatus
                    called a <hi rend="italic">relay,</hi> which is a very delicate electromagnetic
                    key having its lever attached to the armature of the magnet. The arrangement at
                    a station worked by relay is shown in fig. 24, where L is the line of wire,
                    joined through the key K to one end of the coil of the relay magnet R, the other
                    end of which is put to earth. When a current passes through R the armature A is
                    attracted and the local circuit is closed through the armature at <hi
                    rend="italic">b.</hi> The local battery B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> then
                    sends a current through the instrument I and records the signal. _</p>
                <p>In the form of relay indicated in the figure the armature is held against the
                    stop <hi rend="italic">a</hi> by a spring S. In some cases—as, for example, in
                    Siemens’s polarized relay, shown in fig. 25—the armature <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is put in contact through the pivot <hi rend="italic">h</hi> with one
                    pole N of a permanent magnet <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the other pole s of which
                    is fixed to the yolk y of a horse-shoe electromagnet Μ. The armature is placed
                    between the poles of the electromagnet, a little nearer one pole than the other,
                    so that the magnetic attraction holds the contact lever against the insulated
                    stop without the aid of a spring. This form of relay only answers to currents in
                    one direction, but it is capable of giving great sensibility, and for some
                    purposes—for instance, in some methods of quadruplex working—its directional
                    character is an advantage.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Translation.—</hi> In a precisely similar manner a relay may be
                    made to re-transmit automatically the message over another line, or, what is the
                    same thing, over a continuation of the same line when the whole length is too
                    great for direct working. It is not usual in practice to employ the delicate
                    receiving relay for re-transmitting the message, but it is made to work a
                    coarser instrument, which takes the place of the sounder, or, it may be, the
                    sounder itself, in the local circuit. It is clear that one receiving relay may
                    be used to work a number of re-transmitting keys in the same local circuit, and
                    hence to distribute a message simultaneously over a num ber of branch lines from
                    a central station.</p>

                    solution of this problem was attempted by Gintl of Vienna in 1853 and in the
                    following year by Frischen and by Siemens and Halske. Within a few years several
                    methods had been proposed by different inventors, but none were at first very
                    successful, not from any fault in the principle, but because the effect of
                    electrostatic capacity of the line was left out of account in the early
                    arrangements. The first to introduce a really good practical system of duplex
                    telegraphy, in which this difficulty was sufficiently overcome for land line
                    purposes, was J. B. Stearns of Boston (Mass. ). In order that the line between
                    two stations S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    may be worked on the duplex system it is essential that the receiving instrument
                    at S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> shall not be acted on by the currents sent
                    into the line at S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and similarly that the currents
                    sent into the line at S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> shall not act on the
                    receiving instrument at S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, w hile at the same time
                    these currents must act on the instruments at S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and
                    S <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> respectively. The two methods most commonly
                    employed are the following.</p>
                <p>(1) In fig. 26 B is the sending battery, B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> a
                    resistance equal to that of the battery, R a set of resistance coils, and C a
                    condenser. Suppose the key at station S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> to be
                    depressed; then a current flows into the line through circuit 1, and to earth
                    through circuit 2. Now, if both these currents pass, as indicated in the figure,
                    round the electromagnet of the receiving instrument, but in opposite directions,
                    and if their strengths are properly adjusted, no effect will be produced on that
                    instrument. At station S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, however, the current
                    flows to earth, partly through circuit 1 and partly through circuit 2, but in
                    the same direction round the coils of the receiving instrument. Hence, if the
                    current is strong enough, the receiving instrument at S <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> will be set in action. Similarly, the depression of the key at S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> can be made to produce a signal at S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and yet have no effect on the instrument at S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. The necessary and sufficient condition is that the
                    currents in circuits 1 and 2 at the sending station shall at all times bear a
                    certain fixed ratio to each other, depending on the coils of the receiving
                    instrument at that station. If for simplicity we suppose the resistance of the
                    line to be constant and not to be affected by the transmitting apparatus, and to
                    be of zero electrostatic capacity, the fixed ratio may be obtained by adjusting
                    R in the auxiliary circuit 2. In actual practice the line has capacity, and this
                    is compensated for by supplying to R from the condenser C capacity equivalent to
                    that of the line. C should be of such a form that the capacity in the circuit
                    can be varied, and it must have the same inductive retardation as the line; that
                    is to say, the capacity must be distributed along the resistance R in a manner
                    equivalent to that in w hich the capacity of the line is distributed along its
                    resistance. A rough approximation to this adjustment will answer the purpose for
                    ordinary land line working, but for submarine cable work a very accurate
                    adjustment is necessary. In order that the manipulation of the key may not
                    affect the resistance of the line, the resistance between the point D and E
                    should be as nearly as possible the same for all positions of the key. This
                    implies that the keys shall not at any time break circuit, nor make contact on
                    both the front and the back stops for more than an instant, for an instantaneous
                    break of the circuit would affect the signals being received from the other
                    station. The principle of the “continuity preserving key,” used for duplex
                    working, will be understood from the figure. So long as the key is not depressed
                    the line is kept to earth through the resistance B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>;
                    when the key is pushed down it suddenly changes to the battery B, being at the
                    transition in contact with both B and B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. This
                    produces very little disturbance, because the key is moving quickly at that part
                    of its stroke, and the resistance of the line and receiving instrument is
                    generally much higher than that of B <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. This is
                    called the “differential method.” The principle was first enunciated by
                    Frischen; but its present condition is the result of the labours of a large
                    number of experimenters, among whom may be mentioned Siemens and Halske, Stark,
                    Edlund, Gintl, Nystrom, Preece, Nedden, Farmer, Maron, Winter, Stearns, and
                    Muirhead.</p>
                <p>(2) The second method to which we may here refer is known as the “bridge method”
                    from the similarity of the arrangement (see fig. 27) to that of the Wheatstone
                    bridge. Instead of sending the currents in the two branches of the divided
                    circuit DP and DQ through the two coils of a differentially wound relay or
                    receiving instrument, as in Frischen’s method, two resistances <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are inserted and the instruments are joined
                    between P and Q. It is clear that if the difference of potential between P and Q
                    is unaffected by closing the sending key K no change of current will take place
                    in the instrument circuit. The relative potential of P and Q is not affected by
                    the manipulation of K if the resistance <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is to that of
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> as the resistance of L is to that of R; hence that is
                    the arrangement used. The same remarks with regard to retardation and capacity
                    that were made when describing the differential method apply here also. One very
                    great advantage in this method is that the instrument used between P and Q may
                    be of any ordinary form.</p>
                <p>Most important cables, such as those of the Eastern Telegraph Company and the
                    various Atlantic cables, are worked duplex on Muirhead’s plan. What may be
                    called a mechanical method of duplexing a cable was described by Sir W. Thomson
                    in a patent taken out by him in 1858. In this, as in the ordinary methods, a
                    differentially wound receiving instrument was used, one coil being connected
                    with the cable and the other with the earth; but it differed from other methods
                    in requiring no “artificial” or model cable. The compensation was to be obtained
                    by working the slides of a resistance slide included in the circuit of the
                    compensating coil, either by the sending key or by clockwork relieved by the
                    key, so as to vary the resistance in that circuit according to any law which
                    might be required to prevent the receiving instrument being affected by the
                    outgoing current. Four years later Varley patented his model cable, which was
                    the first near approach to a successful solution of the duplex problem on the
                    principle now adopted. It was not, however, a sufficiently perfect
                    representation of a laid cable to serve for duplexing cables of more than a few
                    hundred miles in length.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>By an interesting modification of the bridge method, which has been applied with
                    excellent results by Dr Muirhead to submarine work, condensers are substituted
                    for <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> one being also placed
                    in the circuit between P and Q. In this case no current flows from the battery
                    through the line or instruments, the whole action being inductive. As we have
                    already stated, the distribution of the capacity along the resistance R must in
                    submarine cable work be made to correspond very accurately with the distribution
                    of the capacity along the resistance of the cable. This is accomplished by Dr
                    Muirhead in the following manner. One side of a sheet of paraffined paper is
                    covered with a sheet of conducting substance, say tinfoil, and over the other
                    side narrow strips of the same substance are arranged gridironwise to form a
                    continuous circuit along the strip. The breadth and thickness of the strip and
                    the thickness of the paraffined paper are adjusted so that the relative
                    resistance and capacity of this arrangement are the same as those of the cable
                    with which it is intended to be used. A large number of such sheets are prepared
                    and placed together, one over the other, the end of the strip of the first sheet
                    being connected with the beginning of the strip of the second, and so on to the
                    last sheet, the whole representing the conductor of the cable. In the same way
                    all the conducting sheets on the other side of the paper are connected together
                    and form the earth-plate of this artificial cable, thus representing the sea.
                    The leakage through the insulator of the cable is compensated for by connecting
                    high resistances between different points of the strip conductor and the earth
                    coating. Faults or any other irregularity in the cable may be represented by
                    putting resistances of the proper kind into the artificial line. This system of
                    duplexing cables has proved remarkably successful.</p>
                <p>Quadruplex telegraphy consists in the simultaneous transmission of two messages
                    from each end of the line. The only new problem introduced is the simultaneous
                    transmission of two messages in the same direction; this is sometimes called
                    “diplex transmission.” The solution of this problem was attempted by Dr J. B.
                    Stark of Vienna in 1855, and during the next ten years it was worked at by
                    Bosscha, Kramer, Maron, Schaak, Schreder, Wartmann, and others. The first to
                    attain success was Edison, and his method with some modifications is still used.
                    One of the latest arrangements is shown in fig. 28, a brief description of which
                    will indicate the general principle involved. K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and
                    K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are two transmitting keys the nature of which
                    will be understood from the illustration; R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and R
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are two differentially wound polarized relays, both
                    of which are supposed to respond to positive currents and to be held against
                    their back-stops by negative currents. When neither key is depressed a current,
                    which for convenience we call - 4, flows to the line; this is sufficient to
                    overcome the pull of the spring T in the relay R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    (the receiving instnιments are supposed to be at the other end of the line), and
                    hence the levers of both relays are held against their back-stops. When K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is depressed a current -1 is sent to the line, and,
                    this being too weak to overcome the spring T, the lever <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0135-0124"/> of R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> moves into
                    contact with the auxiliary lever <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and closes the circuit
                    of the sounder S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. When K <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> only is depressed a current + 4 is sent to the line. This acts on both
                    relays, but is powerful enough to overcome the pull of the spring T <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, and so to move the lever <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and
                    break the circuit of the sounder S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> before it has
                    time to act. Thus K <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> acts on the sounder S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> but not on the sounder S <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>
                    When both keys are depressed a current +1 is sent into the line. This is
                    sufficient to move the lever of R <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> into contact with
                    <hi rend="italic">l</hi> but not to overcome the pull of T <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, and hence the circuit of sounder S <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is
                    closed; it is also sufficient to move the lever of R <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> and close the circuit of S <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. When therefore
                    both keys are down the sounders S <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> and S <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> at the other end of the line are both set in action;
                    the first responds to K <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the second to K <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. Thus all the conditions for the simultaneous
                    transmission of two messages are provided for. It is not necessary to enter
                    again into the question of continuity at the different positions of the keys.
                    The figure illustrates how this diplex system may be duplexed, and hence how
                    quadruplex working can be obtained. It is only necessary to wind the coils of
                    the relay magnets differentially, when, by means of a precisely similar
                    arrangement to that used for simple duplex, the instruments at the sending
                    station are left unaffected by the outgoing currents, but are affected by the
                    incoming currents. The method here indicated is on the differential principle;
                    but it is scarcely necessary to say that the bridge method is equally
                    applicable. A combination of the bridge and the differential methods has been
                    used by Prescott and Smith, and possesses some advantages in certain cases. It
                    is impossible in this article to go into the great variety of detail in
                    arrangement and method with which it is possible to obtain good results.</p>
                <p>The several methods that have been proposed for the transmission of a number of
                    messages in one direction on the same wire are reducible to two classes. In one
                    the time which a revolving contact slider takes to make one revolution is
                    divided into as many intervals as there are sets of sending and receiving
                    instruments on the line, and by means of it the current is closed through the
                    different sets of apparatus in succession. This implies the synchronous movement
                    of the revolving sliders at the two ends of the line. In a sense this may be
                    said to be simultaneous transmission: all the messages are being sent at the
                    same time, but the progress of any one message is slower than it would be if it
                    alone was occupying the whole line in the ordinary way. The method possesses
                    some advantages when the line is capable of being worked at a higher speed than
                    a single operator can attain, or when one of the stations can advantageously be
                    used as a distributing station, for in that case one set of apparatus may be
                    used as an automatic distributor. Multiple telegraphy on this plan was proposed
                    by Thomson in 1858.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Delaunay’s multiple telegraph is the most recent development of the system, and
                    has been lately adopted on some circuits in Great Britain.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In the other class there are joined to the two ends of the line of wire a number
                    of branch circuits, in each of which a set of transmitting and receiving
                    apparatus is included. In the circuit, between the line and each of the sending
                    keys, an electromagnetic vibrator is placed so as to open and close the circuit
                    a great number of times during each signal. The vibrators in the key circuits at
                    one end of the line have all different and, if possible, relatively
                    incommensurable periods. The receivers at the other end of the line consist of a
                    corresponding set of electromagnetic vibrators, mounted on resonators and having
                    exactly the same vibrational periods as those in the key circuits at the sending
                    end. When any one of the keys is manipulated the currents sent into the line
                    have such a pulsatory character that they only affect the receiver, which is
                    capable of vibrating freely in unison with these pulsations. When a number of
                    keys are manipulated at the same time the receivers analyse the resultant wave,
                    each picking out its own component, thus separating the different messages. The
                    “harmonic telegraph” of Mr Elisha Gray of America is a good example of this
                    class.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Working of Submarine Cables.—</hi> The arrangement of the
                    apparatus for working some of the most recent cables is shown in fig. 29. The
                    cable is supposed to be worked duplex; but, if S, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and AC are removed and the key connected
                    directly with C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, the arrangement for simplex
                    working is obtained. The apparatus consists of a sending battery B, a reversing
                    transmitting key K, a slide of small resistance S, three condensers C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>, an artificial cable AC, the receiving instruments I and G, and one or
                    more resistances R for adjusting the leakage current. The peculiar construction
                    of AC has been already referred to. The conductor of the cable is practically
                    insulated, as the condensers in the bridge have a very high resistance; hence no
                    appreciable current ever flows into or out of the line. Two receiving
                    instruments, a siphon recorder and a mirror galvanometer, are shown; one only is
                    absolutely necessary, but it <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> is convenient to
                    have the galvanometer ready, so that in case of accident to the recorder it may
                    be at once switched into circuit by the switch <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> When
                    one of the levers of K is depressed, the condenser C <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and the cable, and the condenser C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and the
                    artificial cable, are simultaneously charged in series; but, if the capacity of
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> bears the same proportion to the capacity of the
                    cable as the capacity of C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> bears to the capacity of
                    the artificial cable, and if the other adjustments are properly made, no charge
                    will be communicated to C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. After a very short
                    interval of time, the length of which depends on the inductive retardation of
                    the cable, the condensers corresponding to C <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> at the other end begin to be charged from the
                    cable, and since the charge of C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> passes through the
                    receiving instrument I or G the signal is recorded. The charging of C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> at the receiving end will take place, no matter what is
                    the absolute potential of the condensers, consequently the incoming signals are
                    not affected by those which are being transmitted from that end. In actual
                    practice the receiving instrument is so sensitive that the difference of
                    potential between the two coatings of the condenser C <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> produced by the incoming signal is only a very small fraction of the
                    potential of the battery B. When the key is relieved the condensers and cables
                    at once begin to return to zero potential, and if the key is depressed and
                    relieved several times in rapid succession the cable is divided into sections of
                    varying potential, which travel rapidly towards the receiving end, and indicate
                    their arrival there by producing corresponding fluctuations in the charge of the
                    condenser C <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. All cables of any great length are
                    worked by reverse currents, the single needle alphabet being used: that is to
                    say, currents in one direction indicate dots and in the other direction
                    dashes.</p>
                <p>The following descriptions of the mirror galvanometer and the siphon recorder
                    are, with some slight alteration, taken from a lecture delivered by Sir W.

                    cable (the short-lived 1858 Atlantic cable) was the mirror galvanometer,<note

                    four light magnets attached to its back (weighing in all less than half a
                    grain), suspended by means of a single silk fibre within the hollow of a bobbin
                    of fine wire,—a suitable controlling magnet being placed adjacent to the
                    apparatus. The action of the instrument is as follows. On the passage of a
                    current of electricity through the fine wire coil the suspended magnets with the
                    mirror attached tend to take up a position at right angles to the plane of the
                    coil, and are deflected to one side or the other according as the current is in
                    one direction or the other. Deflexions to one side are interpreted as dots and
                    to the other side as dashes, and the messages are transmitted in accordance with
                    the international Morse code of signals.</p>
                <p>(2) The spark recorder in some respects foreshadowed the more perfect
                    instrument—the siphon recorder—which was introduced some years later. Its action
                    was as follows. To an indicator, suitably supported, a to-and-fro motion was
                    given by the electromagnetic actions due to the electric currents constituting
                    the signals. The indicator was connected with a Ruhmkorff coil or other
                    equivalent apparatus, designed to cause a continual succession of sparks to pass
                    between the indicator and a metal plate situa,ted beneath it and having a plane
                    surface parallel to its line of motion. Over the surface of the plate and
                    between it and the indicator there was passed, at a regularly uniform speed, in
                    a direction perpendicular to the line of motion of the indicator, a material
                    capable of being acted on physically by the sparks, either through their
                    chemical action, their heat, or their perforating force. The record of the
                    signals given by this instrument was an undulating line of fine perforations or
                    spots, and the character and succession of the undulations were used to
                    interpret the signals desired to be sent.</p>
                <p>(3) The latest form of receiving instrument for long submarine cables is the

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0136-0125"/> his first patent in 1867. Within the three
                    succeeding years great improvements were effected on it, and the instrument has
                    since that date been exclusively employed in working most of the more important
                    submarine cables of the world,—indeed all except those on which the mirror
                    galvanometer method is in use. In the siphon recorder (see fig. 30) the
                    indicator consists of a light rectangular signal coil of fine wire, suspended
                    between the poles of two powerful electromagnets Μ, M so as to be free to move
                    about its longer axis, which is vertical, and so joined that the electric signal
                    currents through the cable pass through it. A fine glass siphon tube is
                    suspended with freedom to move in only one degree, and is connected with the
                    signal-coil and moves with it. The short leg of the siphon tube dips into an
                    insulated ink-bottle, so that the ink it contains becomes electrified, while the
                    long leg has its open end at a very small distance from a brass table, placed
                    with its surface parallel to the plane in which the mouth of the leg moves, and
                    over which a slip of paper may be passed at a uniform rate, as in the spark
                    recorder. The ink is electrified by a small induction electrical machine E
                    placed on the top of the instrument; this causes it to fall in very minute drops
                    from the open end of the siphon tube upon the brass table or the paper slip
                    passing over it. When therefore the signal-coil move3 in obedience to the
                    electric signal currents passed through it, the motion communicated to the
                    siphon is recorded on the moving slip of paper by a wavy line of ink-marks very
                    close together. The interpretation of the signals is according to the Morse
                    code,—the dot and dash being represented by deflexions of the line of dots to
                    one side or other of the centre line of the paper. A very much simpler form of
                    siphon recorder has been devised and brought into use within the last few years.
                    Instead of the electromagnets, two bundles of long barmagnets of square section
                    and made up of square bars of glass-hard steel are used. They are supported
                    vertically on a castiron socket, and on the upper end of each is fitted a soft
                    iron shoe, shaped to concentrate the lines of force and thus produce a strong
                    magnetic field in the space within which the signal-coil is suspended.</p>
                <p>Instruments of this kind have been made to work both with and without
                    electrification of the ink. Without electrification the instrument (see fig. 31)
                    is very simple and compact, and capable of doing good work on cables 500 or 600
                    miles long. When constructed for electrification of the ink they are available
                    for much greater lengths, but for cables such as the Atlantic the original form
                    is still used. The strongest magnetic field hitherto obtained by permanent
                    magnets (of glass-hard steel) is about 3000 C.G.S. With the electromagnets used
                    in the original form of siphon recorder a magnetic field of about or over 5000
                    C.G.S. is easily obtained. Fig. 32 shows a facsimile of part of a message
                    received and recorded by a siphon recorder, such as that of fig. 30, from one of
                    the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cables about 830 miles long.</p>
                <p>(4) The automatic curb sender was designed by Sir W. Thomson Auto-for the purpose
                    of diminishing the effect of inductive embarrass-rnatic ment in long cables. In
                    ordinary hand-sending the end of the curb cable is put to one or the other pole
                    of the battery and to earth sender, alternately, the relative time during which
                    it is to battery and to earth depending to a great extent on the operator. By
                    the auto matic curb sender the cable is put to one or the other pole of the
                    battery and then to the reverse pole for definite proportionate times during
                    each signal. The cable is thus charged first positively and then negatively, or
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> for each signal. This method not only
                    facilitates the discharge of the cable, and so accelerates the return of the
                    index of the receiving instrument to zero, but provides the means of sending
                    positive and negative currents into the cable at the proper times and for the
                    proper intervals. The action of the instrument is regulated, like that of
                    Wheatstone’s automatic transmitter, by a perforated slip of paper. The
                    arrangement of the perforations and the method of using the paper slip are,
                    lmλvever, quite different. The paper is fed forward by a central row of holes,
                    which are therefore continuous. The dots and dashes of the message are
                    represented by the side rows of holes; but the two currents required for a dot
                    are produced wholly by one hole on one side and those for a dash by one hole on
                    the other side. The perforated slip is exactly similar to the message written by
                    the siphon recorder, the side holes occupying the same relative positions as the
                    loops to one side or other of the central line in the record. As the side holes
                    reach a certain point in their passage through the instrument they allow the end
                    of one or the other of two levers to fall; the other end of the lever lifts a
                    light contact spring, forming one lever of a reversing key, and makes electrical
                    connexion between the battery and another set of springs, which also form the
                    levers of a reversing key. The spring is held up, by a flange on the edge of a
                    revolving wheel passing under it, during the time required by the paper to
                    advance through the distance between two central holes. During this interval the
                    current is reversed at the proper time by a pair of adjustable cams fixed to the
                    same spindle as the flanged wheel. This method of transmission has been found
                    quite successful, though it has not been brought into use, as handsending has
                    hitherto proved sufficient for the work required.</p>

                <p>which shows plainly how the current is affected by the length, the resistance,
                    and the capacity of the line. ·</p>
                <p>It is evident from this equation that a finite time is required after the battery
                    has been applied at the sending end for the current to become sensible at the
                    receiving end, the interval being practically equal to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    and also that for similar actions the intervals between operations for one line
                    must be to the corresponding intervals for another line directly as the values
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">kcP</hi> for the two lines.
                    We see, therefore, that for lines of the same type, worked in the same manner,
                    the speed of working will be inversely as the square of the length of the line,
                    or, if the type varies, inversely as the product KQ, where K is the total
                    resistance and Q the total capacity <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n137/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0137-0126"/> of the line. The interval <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> must not be confounded with the time required for each signal: it is a
                    measure of the slowness of transmission; but the number of signals which can be
                    received in a given time, on any one line, depends on the method of working and
                    on the sensibility of the instruments employed. The ratios of the number of
                    signals which can be sent over different lines in a stated time are the same as
                    the ratios of the values of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for these lines. The value
                    of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for the different Atlantic cables varies between a
                    fifth and a quarter of a second, and, as the time required for the current to
                    reach 90 per cent, of its maximum value is ten times <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    an instrument which requires as much as 90 per cent, of the full current to
                    produce a signal and a fall to 50 per cent, between the signals could only
                    receive about one signal every two seconds or between one and two words per
                    minute. The instruments actually used attain to a speed of about twenty times
                    this; but they are capable of showing distinctly a current of a ten-thousandth,
                    or even less, of the maximum current. The value of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> for
                    ordinary land lines is very small, probably not exceeding the five-thousandth
                    part of a second for a circuit 500 miles in length. The current, therefore,
                    rises almost to its full value for each signal when the time of contact is as
                    small as the five-hundredth part of a second, or, on the Wheatstone instrument,
                    when the speed is about 500 words per minute. There is, however, a very sensible
                    increase in the effective resistance of the circuit, especially when iron wire
                    is used, when signals are sent as rapidly as 100 per second, so that higher
                    battery power is required for fast than for slow rates of speed. The difficulty
                    in working land lines at rates up to 300, or even more, words per minute is not
                    to any serious extent electrical, but is in great measure due to material and
                    magnetic inertia in the receiving instruments. Although land lines can be worked
                    at a very high speed when the whole of the wire is insulated on poles, the rate
                    is greatly diminished if a length of underground or of submarine cable is
                    included in the circuit. In practice also the speed depends greatly on the
                    position of the cable in the circuit; for example, the actual speed from Dublin
                    to London, according to Mr Preece, is about twice as great as that from London
                    to Dublin. Mr Culley states that the greatest effect is produced when the cable
                    is in the middle of the circuit. (T. GR.)</p>
