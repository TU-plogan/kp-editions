                    for seeing,” from <hi rend="italic">θΐάομαι).</hi> The invention of a building
                    specially devised for dramatic representations was due to the Athenians (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Drama).</hi> At first representations at the Dionysiac
                    festivals were held on temporary wooden platforms; an accident, however, which
                    occurred in 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> induced the Athenians to begin
                    the construction of a permanent building. This first theatre was not completed
                    till 340 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and during the interval a large number
                    of theatres, designed on the same model, had been erected in many towns of
                    Greece and Asia Minor, though in some cases, as at Sparta, they were used for
                    assemblies of the people and dances rather than for dramatic performances. The
                    great Dionysiac theatre at Athens was placed in the Lenaeum, an enclosure sacred
                    to Dionysus, and its auditorium is scooped out of the rock at the base of the
                    Acropolis on its south-east side. A similar position on the slope of a hill was
                    always chosen by the Greeks, and it was not till the 1st century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that theatres were built by the Romans on a level
                    site.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 shows the plan of the existing theatre at Myra, in the south-east of
                    Lycia, which, though late in date, is built after the old Greek model.<note

                    audience are arranged in concentric tiers, rising like steps one above the other
                    (see fig. 2); these mainly rest on a cavity excavated in the hill-side, and the
                    whole space occupied by the spectators was called the κoιλov (Lat.cαmz). About
                    half-way up the slope is an encircling passage (διά- <hi rend="italic">ζωμa,
                    praecinctio).</hi> Flights of steps divide the seats into wedge-shaped blocks
                    (κepκιδ∈ς, <hi rend="italic">cunei).</hi> At the highest level behind the top
                    row of seats ran a colonnade, forming a covered passage with a gallery at the
                    top. Rows of niches were formed in the back wall of this, and also sometimes in
                    the low wall encircling the <hi rend="italic">διάζωμα</hi>; in these niches a
                    series of large bronze jars (⅞χ∈ια) were set: they were intended to catch and
                    repeat the reverberation of the voices from the stage. Vitruvius (iii. 5) gives

                    in the middle of which was an altar to Dionysus. The stage <hi rend="italic"
                    >(πpοσκψιοv, proscenium)</hi> was a narrow platform, raised 3 to 5 feet above
                    the orchestra, w ith which it communicated by stairs, so that the chorus could
                    move from one place to the other; the centräl part of the stage, where the
                    principal actors usually stood, was the λoγειov <hi rend="italic"

                    κλίμακες,</hi> by which ghosts ascended. At the back of the stage was a lofty
                    wall, which usually reached to the level of the colonnade behind the highest row
                    of seats; this was the <hi rend="italic">σκηvη (scena),</hi> in which were three

                    with three orders of columns and entablatures, forming an architectural façade,
                    which represented a palace or temple, before which the action of the play was
                    supposed to take place. Other movable wooden scenery was in some cases added in
                    front of the permanent scena; or curtains with woven or embroidered figures were
                    hung against it to form a background to the actors <hi rend="italic"

                    time of Sophocles. Various kinds of machinery were used, such as the <hi

                    imitate thunder by stones rolled in metal jars, probably in the ghost-chamber
                    under the stage. Women were not excluded from the Greek tragic drama, but appear
                    to have sat by themselves in the upper rows of seats (Athenaeus, xii. 534).<note

                    in late times the chief priestesses of Athens occupied marble thrones in the
                    προεδρία or front row.</p>
                <p>The remains of the Dionysiae theatre at Athens, the prototype of all later
                    theatres, were excavated in 1862, when the proscenium, orchestra, and lower rows
                    of seats were found in a fair state of preservation. It must have held 30,000
                    people: the cavea reaches from the foot of the Acropolis hill to close under the
                    upper circuit wall. The rock-cut cavern, which was faced with the choragic
                    monument to Thrasyllus (320^ <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> seems to have
                    opened behind the highest row of seats; the face of the rock is here scarped to
                    a curve concentric with the lines of seats. The most interesting discovery was
                    that of a row of 67 marble thrones in the front row, each inscribed with the
                    name of one of the chief Athenian priests or with that of a secular
                    official.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These thrones
                    are of various dates, ranging from the reign of Augustus or even earlier to that
                    of Hadrian; see <hi rend="italic">Papers of the American School of Classical
                    Stu&lt;lies at Athens,</hi> vol. i. p. 123. Similar Greek theatre seats of
                    earlier date still exist in the choirs of some churches in Rome, where they were
                    once used for the episcopal or celebrant’s throne. These were probably brought
                    to Rome during the imperial period for use in the Roman theatres or
                    amphitheatres. The finest example of pure Hellenic work is in S. Pietro in
                    Vincoli; it is decorated with delicate honeysuckle scroll-work in
                    relief.</p></note> The cavea was divided into 13 cunei; a low wall separated the
                    auditorium from the orchestra. The front or “riser” of the stage is decorated
                    with fine reliefs of deities on large marble slabs. These existing features are
                    mostly restorations of the time of Hadrian, but the reliefs themselves are of
                    much earlier date. The floor of the orchestra is very late, formed of roughly
                    laid slabs of stone, with a large central lozenge in marble, which may mark the
                    limits of the thymele, and is apparently part of an earlier pavement.</p>
                <p>The position of the Dionysiac theatre, with many of the chief temples of Athens
                    in sight, and with its glorious view of Mount Hymettus, the blue waters of the
                    Aegean Sea, and the islands of Salamis and Aegina, should not be forgotten in
                    reading the dramas of the great tragedians, with their impassioned appeals to
                    the glories of nature and their allusions to the protective presence of the
                    divine patrons of Attica.</p>
                <p>Outside Athens the largest Greek theatres were those at Megalopolis (Paus., viii.
                    32), Cnidus, Syracuse, Argos, and Epidaurus. By the end of the 4th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> every important Hellenic city possessed its theatre,
                    and new ones were built or old ones restored throughout the whole period of
                    Roman domination. The most perfect existing example is that at Aspendus in
                    Pamphylia,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Texier
                    and Pullan, Asia 3iwιoz∙, London, 1865.</p></note> a building of the 2d century
                    of our era, in which the early Greek model has been closely followed. Aspendus
                    is the only place where the whole scena with its three orders of columns is
                    still standing, and every row of seats exists in almost perfect condition. In
                    this theatre the whole interior appears to have been covered by an awning,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There was also a wooden
                    pent-roof corbelled out over the stage.</p></note> supported along the top of
                    the scena by wooden poles set in rows of perforated corbels like those on the
                    Colosseum in Rome. The earlier Greek theatres were probably unsheltered from the
                    sun. Next to Aspendus, the theatre of Tauromenium, in Sicily (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Taormina),</hi> is the best preserved, at least as far as
                    regards the scena and the upper gallery round the cavea. That at Myra, in Lycia
                    (fig. 1), is also in good preservation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Roman Theatre.·</hi> —In the main the theatres of the
                    Romans were copied closely from those of the Greeks, but in the Greek theatre
                    the orchestra occupied more than a semicircle, while the Romans made it exactly
                    half a circle. The accompanying diagrams (see fig. 3) show the principle on
                    which the plan of each was set out.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Vitruvius, iii. 8 (Greek theatre) and iii. 2 to 7
                    (Roman).</p></note> The Romans also introduced another important change, in many
                    cases constructing theatres on a level site, not scooped out of a hillside as in
                    the case of Hellenic theatres. This necessitated an elaborate arrangement of
                    substructures, with raking vaults to carry the seats of the cavea, and also an
                    additional visible facade with tiers of arches following the semicircle of the
                    auditorium. The design universally adopted for this appears to have been tiers,
                    usually three in number, of open arches, with intermediate <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n241/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0241-0224"/> engaged columns, each tier being of a different
                    order, as is still to be seen in the remains of the theatre of Marcellus in
                    Rome.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This design was
                    also adopted for their amphitheatres, such as the colossea of Rome and Capua,
                    the plan of which resembles the cavea of two theatres set together so as to
                    enclose an oval space.</p></note> The development of the use of the stone arch,
                    and still more the use of concrete for forming vaults, enabled the Romans to
                    erect their theatres on any site. Those in Rome were placed in the level plain
                    of the Campus Martius.</p>
                <p>During the Republican period the erection of permanent theatres with seats for
                    the spectators was thought to savour of Greek luxury and to be unworthy of the
                    stern simplicity of the Roman citizens. Thus in 154 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> Scipio Nasica induced the senate to demolish the first stone theatre
                    which had been begun by C. Cassius Longinus (“tanquam inutile et nociturum
                    publicis moribus,” Liv., <hi rend="italic">Epit.,</hi> 48). Even in 55 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when Pompey began the theatre of which remains still
                    exist in Rome, he thought it wise to place a shrine to Venus Victrix at the top
                    of the cavea, as a sort of excuse for having stone seats below it— the seats
                    theoretically serving as steps to reach the temple. This theatre, which was
                    completed in 52 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is spoken of by Vitruvius as
                    “the stone theatre” <hi rend="italic">par excellence·,</hi> it is said in the
                    Regionary catalogues to have held 40,000 people. It was also used as an
                    amphitheatre for the bloody shows in which the Romans took greater pleasure than
                    in the purer intellectual enjoyment of the drama. At its inauguration 500 lions
                    and 20 elephants were killed by gladiators. Near it two other theatres were
                    erected, one begun by Julius Caesar and finished by Augustus in 13 <hi

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Livy (xl. 51),
                    the theatre of Marcellus was built on the site of an earlier one erected by

                    the theatre of Marcellus are among the most imposing of the buildings of ancient
                    Rome.</p>
                <p>A long account is given by Pliny (7/. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xxxvi. 2 and 24)
                    of a most magnificent temporary theatre built by the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus

                    number of 80,000 people, and was a work of the most costly splendour. Still less

                    24) of two wooden theatres built by C. Curio in 50 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> which were made to revolve on pivots, so that the two together could
                    form an amphitheatre in the afternoon, after having been used as two separate
                    theatres in the morning.</p>
                <p>In some cases the Romans built two theatres close together, one for the Greek and
                    the other for the Latin drama, as is the case at Hadrian’s magnificent villa
                    near Tivoli. The two theatres at Pompeii are still well preserved, and all Roman
                    provincial towns of any importance seem to have possessed at least one theatre,
                    designed with the semicircular orchestra after the Roman fashion (see fig. 3).
                    The theatres built under the Roman rule in Hellenic cities seem, on the other
                    hand, to have been usually constructed on the old Greek model, probably because
                    they were designed by Greek architects. This is the case at Tauromenium,
                    Aspendus, and Myra see (fig. 1). An important exception to this rule is the
                    still well-preserved theatre of Herodes Atticus, at the south-west angle of the
                    Athenian Acropolis, which has a semicircular orchestra. It was built in the
                    reign of Hadrian by Herodes Atticus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    it was connected with the great Dionysiae theatre by a long and lofty porticus

                    of the stoa built by Eumenes II. of Pergamum. In the Roman theatre the

                    with sacred scenes were the favourite kind of drama; no special buildings were
                    erected for these, as they were represented either in churches or in temporary
                    booths. In the 16th century the revival of the secular drama, which, in the
                    reign of Elizabeth, formed so important a part of the literature of England, was
                    carried on in tents, wooden sheds, or courtyards of inns, mostly by strolling
                    actors of a very low class. It was not till towards the close of the century
                    that a permanent building was constructed and licensed for dramatic
                    representations, under the management of Shakesneare and Burbage.<note

                    erected in London for dramatic purposes was built in 1576-77 by the actor James
                    Burbage, who was originally a carpenter by trade. It was constructed of timber,
                    and stood in Holywell Lane, Shoreditch, till 1598, when it was pulled down; it
                    was known as “The Theatre” <hi rend="italic">par excellence.</hi> Of almost
                    equally early date was the ‘ ‘ Curtain” theatre, also in Shoreditch; many
                    explanations of its name have been given, but the real one appears to be that it
                    was so called from the plot of ground, known as “The Curten,” on which it stood.
                    It probably continued in use till the general closing of theatres by order of
                    the parliament in 1642.</p><p>The “Globe” theatre, famous for its association
                    with Shakespeare, was built by James Burbage, who used the materials of “The
                    Theatre,” in the year 1598. Its site was in Southwark, in a district called “The
                    Bankside,” near the old “Bear Gardens.” It was an octagonal structure of wood,
                    with lath and plaster between the main framework. It was burnt in 1613, rebuilt,
                    and finally pulled down and its site built over in 1644. Its name was derived
                    from its sign of Atlas supporting the globe. Near it were two less important
                    theatres, “The Rose,” opened in 1592 by Henslowe, and “The Swan,” opened in 1598
                    and probably owned also by Henslowe; like the Globe, it was an octagonal
                    wood-and-plaster building.</p><p>The ‘ ‘ Blackfriars” theatre, another of the
                    Burbages’ ventures, was built in 1596 (not 1576, as stated by Collier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist, of Dramatic Poetry and Annals of the Stage,</hi> new ed.,
                    1879, vol. i. p. 287), near the old Dominican friary. The “Fortune” theatre was
                    built by Edward Alleyn, the great rival of the Burbages, in 1599-1600, at a
                    total cost, including the site, of £1320. It stood between Whitecross Street and
                    Golding Lane. It existed as late as 1819, when a drawing of it was given by
                    Wilkinson <hi rend="italic">(Bondina illustrata,</hi> 1819). The “Red Bull”
                    theatre was probably originally the galleried court of an inn, which was adapted
                    for dramatic purposes towards the close of Elizabeth’s reign. Other early
                    theatres were the “Hope” or “Paris Garden” theatre, the “Whitefriars” and
                    “Salisbury Court” theatres, and the “Newington” theatre. A curious panoramic
                    view of London, engraved by Visscher in 1616, shows the Globe, the Hope, and the
                    Swan theatres.</p><p>The plan of the first English theatres appears to have had
                    no connexion with those of classical times, as was the case in Italy: it was
                    evidently produced in an almost accidental way by the early custom of erecting a
                    temporary platform or stage in the middle of the open courtyard of an inn, in
                    which the galleries all round the court formed boxes for the chief spectators,
                    while the poorer part of the audience stood in the court on all sides of the
                    central stage. Something similar to this arrangement, unsuitable though it now
                    seems, was reproduced even in buildings, such as the Globe, the Fortune, and the
                    Swan, which were specially designed for the drama. In these and other early
                    theatres there was a central platform for the stage, surrounded by seats except
                    on one side, where there was a “green-room” or</p></note> In <pb break="no"

                    theatrical representation was in the form of “masques,” with processions of
                    grotesquely attired actors and temporary scenic effects of great splendour and
                    mechanical ingenuity. In the reigns of James I. and Charles I. Ben Jonson and
                    the architect Inigo Jones worked together in the production of these “masques,”
                    Jonson writing the words and Inigo Jones devising the scenic effects, the latter
                    being very costly and complicated, with gorgeous buildings, landscapes, and
                    clouds or mountains, which opened to display mimic deities, thrown into relief
                    by coloured lights. These masques were a form of opera, in which Ben Jonson’s
                    words were set to music. Ben Jonson received no more for his libretto than Inigo
                    Jones did for his scenic devices, and was not unnaturally annoyed at the
                    secondary place which he was made to occupy: he therefore revenged himself by
                    writing severe satires on Inigo Jones and the system which placed the literary
                    and mechanical parts of the opera on the same footing. In an autograph MS. which
                    still exists this satirical line occurs—“Painting and carpentry are the soul of
                    masque” (see Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Life of Inigo Jones,</hi> London,
                    1848).</p>
                <p>In Italy, during the 16th century, the drama occupied a more important position,
                    and several theatres w ere erected, professedly on the model of the classic
                    theatre of Vitruvius. One of these, the Teatro 01impico at Vicenza, still
                    exists; it was designed by Palladio, but was not completed till 1584, four years
                    after his death. It has an architectural scena, with various orders of columns,
                    rows of statues in niches, and the three doors of the classic theatre, but the
                    whole is painted with strong perspective effects which are very unclassical in
                    spirit. Scamozzi, Palladio’s pupil, who completed the Teatro Olimpico, built
                    another pseudo-classical theatre in 1588 at Sabbionetta for the duke Vespasiano
                    Gonzaga, but this does not now exist.</p>
                <p>In France the miracle play developed into the secular drama rather earlier than
                    in England. In the reign of Louis XL, about 1467, the “Brothers of the Passion”
                    had a theatre which was partly religious and partly satirical. In the 16th
                    century Catherine de’ Medici is said to have spent incredible sums on the
                    dresses and scenery for the representation of the Italian ballet; and in the
                    middle of the 17th century the regular opera was introduced at Paris.</p>
                <p>At the end of the 18th century the theatres of San Carlo at Naples, La Scala at
                    Milan, and La Fenice at Venice were the finest in Europe; all these have been
                    rebuilt in the present century, but have been eclipsed by the theatres of Paris,
                    St Petersburg, and other capitals, both in size and architectural splendour.</p>
                <p>In the modern theatre the auditorium has changed comparatively little, except
                    that the stalls have gradually encroached upon and almost absorbed the pit. The
                    arrangement of the boxes, stalls, balcony, and gallery are too well known to
                    need description. Few people, have, however, any notion of the immense size and
                    extreme complication of the space and machinery behind the proscenium, of which
                    the visible stage occupies but a very small proportion. The stage-floor slopes
                    upwards away from the audience, so that it may appear deeper than it really is
                    by diminishing the foreshortening.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This device was practised by the mediaeval architects in
                    most European countries, who frequently made the floor of cathedrals and other
                    large churches to slope upwards from west to east, sometimes as much as from two
                    to three feet.</p></note> Its extent behind the most distant plane of scenery is
                    usually quite as great as that which the audience sees. In addition to this
                    extension of the visible stage there are three other enormous spaces filled with
                    the machinery to work the scenery.</p>
                <p>(1) Of these the first consists of the “wings” (Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >coulisses'),</hi> a series of chambers or platforms on each side of the stage,
                    arranged many stories high, and reaching to more than double the height of the
                    proscenium.</p>
                <p>(2) The “dock” or under-space (Fr. <hi rend="italic">dessous),</hi> extending
                    under the whole area of the stage floor, and about equal in height to the
                    proscenium, is divided into three or four stories by successive floors, and
                    contains long rows of immense windlasses (Fr. <hi rend="italic">gril)</hi> for
                    raising and lowering scenery, and also an elaborate arrangement of lifts by
                    which actors can suddenly appear or vanish through the stage floor. A very
                    ingenious device called the “star trap,” invented by an English mechanician (Fr.
                    <hi rend="italic">trappe Anglaise),</hi> allows an actor to vanish through the
                    floor without any opening in it being visible. This is done by making the trap
                    door of thin boards (something like a Venetian blind) fixed on to flexible bands
                    of steel; the weight of the actor makes these open in the middle and let him
                    through, while the steel springs close the opening as soon as they are released.
                    The whole movement is so rapid that the actor seems to sink through the solid
                    floor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Other varieties
                    of this, such as the “vampire trap,” allowan actor to vanish through an
                    apparently solid wall.</p></note> In all mechanical appliances for theatrical
                    purposes England is far ahead of other countries, many of which have adopted
                    English methods.</p>
                <p>(3) The third space, and the largest of all, is that above the proscenium—the
                    “flies” (Fr. <hi rend="italic">dessus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cintre),</hi>
                    extending over the whole of the stage, and reaching sometimes to nearly double
                    the height of the proscenium. This also is divided into many floors, and
                    contains rows of great windlasses, by which scenery can be hoisted up out of
                    sight, without folding or bending it. All these three parts of the building are
                    filled with a complicated but most orderly series of ropes, lifts, and machinery
                    of every sort, of which it is impossible here to give a detailed
                    description.</p>
                <p>The old method of fixing scenery was to slide it in two halves from the wings in
                    grooves formed in the stage floor: these are no longer used, as much more
                    realistic effects can be gained by supporting scenery from the top, or by
                    building it up with supports of its own, so that, instead of a series of painted
                    planes set parallel to the stage front, castles, cathedrals, or even whole
                    streets are actually built upon the stage, and give striking effects of real
                    perspective.</p>
                <p>A rapidly growing tendency now exists to increase the mechanical perfection of
                    the theatre. The extended use of iron instead of wood for the stage floor and
                    the various machines has been a great gain in space and rapidity of working. It
                    is now considered a great object to drop the curtain as seldom as possible, and
                    even the Grand Opera House of Paris is now left far behind in the modern
                    competition for mechanical perfection,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The latest improvement to prevent delay between the scenes has been introduced in
                    the Madison Square theatre in New York city, which has two stages, one above the
                    other. During the performance of a scene the second stage floor is</p>
                <p>“tireynge-howse.” The upper galleries or boxes completely surrounded the stage,
                    even the space over the green-room being occupied by boxes. This being the
                    arrangement, it is easy to see why the octagonal plan was selected in most
                    cases, though not in all,—the Fortune theatre, for example, was square. An
                    interesting specification and contract for the building of the Fortune theatre
                    is printed by Halliwell-Phillipps <hi rend="italic">{op. cU. infra,</hi> p.
                    164). In all its details the Fortune is specified to be like the Globe, except
                    that it is to be square in plan, and with timbers of heavier scantling. The
                    walls are to be of wood and plaster, the roof tiled, with lead gutters, the
                    stage of oak, with a “shadow” or cover over it, and the “tireynge-howse” to have
                    glazed windows. Two sorts of boxes are mentioned, viz., “gentlemen’s roomes” and
                    “twoo-pennie roomes.” A woodcut showing this arrangement of the interior is
                    given in a collection of plays edited by Kirkman in 1672.</p>

                    curtain falls the first stage rises into the upper regions and the second floor
                    goes up to take its place. These floors are accurately balanced by heavy
                    counterpoise weights, so that the whole of these enormous masses are moved with
                    comparatively little force.</p>

                    “green-room” for the actors, and rows of dressing-rooms. An immense deal of
                    storage room is also required, and some of the Parisian theatres have large
                    magazines for this purpose in the suburbs. In many cases also the atelier for
                    the scene painters is far removed from the theatre, and thus far better space
                    and lighting for the work can be provided. Fig. 5 shows the plan of the Drury
                    Lane theatre, in many respects the best arranged in London.</p>
                <p>The painting of theatrical scenery has frequently been the work of artists of
                    very high talent, such as Raphael in Rome, λVatteau, Boucher, and Servandoni in
                    France, and Stanfield in England. Paintings of very high artistic merit and
                    wonderfully decorative effect are now produced for theatrical purposes,
                    especially in France, Germany, and England.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Scene paintings are usually executed in distemper,
                    frequently in an atelier formed in the roof of the theatre; the artist partly
                    works with his canvas laid upon the floor, or, where space allows, the painting
                    is hung against a wall and the artist works from a scaffold, with tiers of
                    boarding arranged so that he can reach to any part of the great
                    canvas.</p></note> In England especially great historical and antiquarian
                    knowledge are brought to the aid of this branch of art. The landscapes in
                    particular are sometimes works of great beauty, and very beautiful effects of
                    lake scenery with trees and mountains reflected in the water are got by setting
                    great sheets of plate glass over the stage floor, slightly inclined, so that a
                    real reflexion is thrown by the landscape painted on the scene behind. Another
                    ingenious device, used by Wagner at Baireuth and also in England for magical
                    scenes, was to form a thin and semitransparent curtain of vapour, which was sent
                    up by a perforated steam-pipe concealed in a groove in the stage.</p>
                <p>The various methods of lighting used are an important item in the production of
                    striking effects. The old system of a row of “foot-lights,” with their
                    unpleasant upward shadow, is now almost obsolete. Dip candles were used till
                    1720, when moulded candles were introduced into French theatres. The next
                    improvement was the lamp of Μ. Argand, with its circular wick. In 1822 gas was
                    first used in a Parisian theatre, next came the oxyhydrogen lime light, used for
                    special effects, and now electric lighting is rapidly superseding all other
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>The old way of producing lightning was to blow lycopodium or powdered resin with
                    bellows through a flame, and this is still used in realistic effects of
                    conflagrations. More effective lightning is now made by flashing the electric
                    light behind a scene painted with clouds, in which a zigzag aperture has been
                    cut out and filled with a transparent substance. Thunder is made by shaking
                    large sheets of iron, by rolling cannon balls above the ceiling of the
                    auditorium, and by clapping together a series of planks strung together on two
                    ropes. Wind is imitated by a machine with a cogged cylinder, which revolves
                    against coarse cloth tightly stretched. The sound of rain is produced by shaking
                    parched peas in a metal cylinder.</p>
                <p>The orchestra is now usually arranged either below or above the proscenium, so
                    that the musicians are not visible. The prompter is placed at one side, in the
                    wings, so as to avoid the disfigurement of the hood-like box which formerly used
                    to cut the front line of the stage into two halves. This is, however, less
                    convenient for the actors.</p>
                <p>Till the middle of the present century little trouble or expense was laid out on
                    dresses and accessories. Certain conventional costumes, made of cheap stuff,
                    were used for each part, with but little regard to historical correctness.
                    Armour and weapons were made of pasteboard covered with metal foil, and stage
                    jewellery was made of small cup-like pieces of tin formed with many facets. Now,
                    however, no trouble or expense is spared to get the costumes and various
                    properties archaeologically correct: real jewels and the richest stuffs are
                    often used for the dresses, as well as real furniture of the most costly sort
                    for the furnishing of the scenic rooms. As much as £20,000 is sometimes spent
                    before the play can be presented. All this splendour and realism is very hostile
                    to the true interests of the drama; magnificent scenery and costly accessories
                    are expected by the audience, rather than good acting. In some scenes, such as
                    the ball in the first act of Romeo and Juliet, as recently represented at the
                    Lyceum, the words and acting of the chief performers were almost lost in the
                    general bustle and splendour of the scene. Frequently, too, the noise of setting
                    up some elaborate scene behind almost drowns the voices of the actors in front
                    of the drop scene.</p>
                <p>Another serious cause of the present low state of acting in England is the fact
                    that a popular play sometimes runs for several hundred nights without a break,
                    thus reducing the performers to the condition of machines. The modern system of
                    expending large sums on dresses and decoration naturally prevents that frequent
                    change of subject which is so desirable, and which in France is provided for by
                    the rules of the Théâtre Français, where acting of a very high order of merit
                    still survives.</p>
                <p>The present system, aided by the enormous size to which London has unhappily
                    grown, has completely changed the character of the audience. Instead of an
                    audience largely composed of <hi rend="italic">habitués,</hi> who by their
                    constant attendance at the theatre had gained some knowledge of what acting
                    ought to be, and were prepared to show their disgust at clap-trap or ranting, we
                    have now practically a fresh and ignorant audience every night, who, by their
                    applause of what is worst and their coldness to real refinement of acting, do
                    much to lower the dramatic standard and demoralize the actors.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Law Relating to Theatres.</hi></p>
                <p>The regulation of the theatre by legislation can be traced back to the time of
                    the lower empire, in which it depended almost wholly upon constitutions of
                    Theodosius and Valentinian, incorporated in the Theodosian Code (tit. xv. 5, 6,
                    7), and a century later to a large extent adopted by Justinian. In the whole of
                    this law there is an evident attempt at a compromise between the doctrines of
                    Christianity and the old Roman love of public spectacles of all kinds. It deals
                    less with theatrical representations proper than with gladiatorial contests and
                    chariot races.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word
                    <hi rend="italic">ludi</hi> seems sometimes to include, sometimes to exclude,
                    dramatic performances. Its meaning in a particular instance depends on the
                    context.</p></note> The Theodosian Code provided that the sacraments were not to
                    be administered to actors save where death was imminent, and only on condition
                    that the calling should be renounced in case of recovery. Daughters of actors
                    were not to be forced to go on the stage, provided that they lived an honest
                    life. An actress was to be allowed to quit the stage in order to become a nun.
                    There were also numerous sumptuary regulations as to the dress of actors. None
                    of the law which has been mentioned so far was adopted by Justinian, but what
                    follows was incorporated in <hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> xi. 40 (“De Spectaculis
                    et Scenicis”), which consists entirely of extracts from the Theodosian Code of a
                    very miscellaneous nature. Provision was made for the exhibition of public games
                    and theatrical spectacles by magistrates, practically confining them to
                    exhibiting in their own cities. Statues of actors were not to be placed in the
                    public streets, but only in the proscenium of a theatre. A governor of a
                    province was entitled to take the money raised for public games for the purpose
                    of repairing the city walls, provided that he gave security for afterwards
                    celebrating the games as usual. In <hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> iii. 12, 11 (“De
                    Feriis”) is a constitution of Leo and Anthemius forbidding dramatic
                    representations on Sunday. The <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> (iii. 2) classed
                    all who acted for hire (“omnes propter pecuniam in scenam prodeuntes”) as
                    infamous persons, and as such debarred them from filling public offices. A mere
                    contract to perform, not fulfilled, did not, however, carry infamy with it. By
                    the 51st of the <hi rend="italic">Novellae</hi> actresses could retire from the
                    stage without incurring a penalty, even if they had given sureties or taken an
                    oath.</p>
                <p>In England, as in other countries of western Europe, theatrical legislation was
                    of comparatively recent introduction. Such legislation was unnecessary as long
                    as the theatre was under the control of the church and actors under its
                    protection (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama).</hi> The earliest regulations were
                    therefore, as might be expected, made by the church rather than by the state.
                    The ecclesiastical ordinances were directed chiefly against the desecration of
                    churches, though they sometimes extended to forbidding attendance of the
                    faithful as spectators at plays of a harmless kind.<note anchored="true"

                    The same law forbade plays to be acted by the clergy, even under the plea of
                    custom, as in Christmas week, and followed the Code of Justinian in enjoining
                    the clergy not to consort with actors or be present at plays (see the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decretals</hi> of Gregory, iii. 1, 12, and 15, “De Vita et
                    Honestate Clericorum”). As lately as 1603 canon lxxxviii. of the canons of the
                    Church of England enacted that churchwardens were not to suffer plays in
                    churches, chapels, or churchyards.</p>
                <p>The Reformation marks the period of transition from the ecclesiastical to the
                    non-ecclesiastical authority over the drama. Precautions began to be taken by
                    the crown and the legislature against the acting of unauthorized plays, by
                    unauthorized persons, and in unauthorized places, and the acting of plays
                    objectionable to the Government on political or other grounds. The protection of
                    the church being withdrawn, persons not enrolled in a fixed company or in
                    possession of a licence from the crown or justices were liable to severe
                    penalties as vagrants. The history of the legislation on this subject is very
                    curious. An Act of the year 1572 (14 Eliz. c. 5) enacted that “all fencers,
                    bearwards, common players of interludes, and minstrels (not belonging to any
                    baron of this realm, or to any other honourable person of greater degree),”
                    wandering abroad without the licence of two justices at the least, were subject
                    “to be grievously whipped and burned through the gristle of the right ear with a
                    hot iron of the compass of an inch about.” This statute was superseded by 39
                    Eliz. c. 4, under which the punishment of the strolling player is less severe,
                    and there is no mention of justices. The jurisdiction of justices over the
                    theatre disappears from legislation from that time until 1788. In 39 Eliz. c. 4
                    there is a remarkable exception in favour of persons licensed by Dutton of
                    Dutton in Cheshire, in accordance with his claim to liberty and jurisdiction in
                    Cheshire and Chester, established in favour of his ancestor by proceedings in
                    <hi rend="italic">quo warranto</hi> in 1499. The stricter wording of this Act as
                    to the licence seems to show that the licence had been abused, perhaps that in
                    some cases privileges had been assumed without authority. In 14 Eliz. c. 5 the
                    privileges of a player attached by service of a noble or licence from justices,
                    in the later Act only by service of a noble, and this was to be attested under
                    his hand and arms. The spirit of the Acts of Elizabeth frequently appears in
                    later legislation, and the unauthorized player was a vagabond as lately as the
                    Vagrant Act of 1744, which was law till 1824. He is not named in the Vagrant Act
                    of 1824. The Theatre Act of 1737 narrowed the definition of a player of
                    interludes, for the purposes of punishment as a vagabond, to mean a person
                    acting interludes, &amp;c., in a place where he had no legal settlement.</p>
                <p>Before the Restoration there were privileged places as well as privileged
                    persons, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the court, the universities, and the inns
                    of court. ∖Vith the Restoration privilege became practically confined to the
                    theatres in the possession of those companies (or their representatives)
                    established by the letters patent of Charles II. in 1662 (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Drama).</hi> In spite of the patents other and unprivileged
                    theatres gradually arose. In 1735 Sir John Barnard introduced a bill “to
                    restrain the number of playhouses for playing of interludes, and for the better
                    regulation of common players.” On Walpole’s wishing to add a clause giving
                    parliamentary sanction to the jurisdiction of the lord chamberlain, the mover
                    withdrew the bill. In 1737 Walpole introduced a bill of his own for the same
                    purpose, there being then six theatres in London. The immediate cause of the
                    bill is said to have been the production of a political extravaganza of
                    Fielding’s, <hi rend="italic">The Golden Rump.</hi> The bill passed, and the Act
                    of 10 Geo. II. c. 28 regulated the theatre for more than a century. Its effect
                    was to make it impossible to establish any theatre except in the city of
                    Westminster, and in places where the king should in person reside, and during
                    such residence only. The Act did not confine the prerogative within the city of
                    Westminster, but as a matter of policy it was not exercised in favour of the
                    non-privileged theatres, except those where the “legitimate drama” was not
                    performed. The legitimate drama was thus confined to Coveut Garden, Drury Lane,
                    and the Haymarket from 1737 to 1843. In the provinces patent theatres were
                    established at Bath by 8 Geo. III. c. 10, at Liverpool by 11 Geo. III. c. 16,
                    and at Bristol by 18 Geo. III. c. 8, the Act of 1737 being in each case repealed
                    <hi rend="italic">pro tanto.</hi> The acting of plays at the universities was
                    forbidden by 10 Geo. II. c. 19. It is not a little remarkable that the
                    universities, once possessing unusual dramatic privileges, should not only have
                    lost those privileges, but have in addition become subject to special
                    disabilities. The restrictions upon the drama were found very inconvenient in
                    the large towns, especially in those which did not possess patent theatres. In
                    one direction the difficulty was met by the lord chamberlain granting annual
                    licences for performances of operas, pantomimes, and other spectacles not
                    regarded as legitimate drama. In another direction relief was given by the Act
                    of 1788 (28 Geo. III. c. 30), under which licences for occasional per formances
                    might be granted in general or quarter sessions for a period of not more than
                    sixty days. The rights of patent theatres were preserved by the prohibition to
                    grant such a licence to any theatre within 8 miles of a patent theatre. During
                    this period (1737-1843) there were several decisions of the courts which
                    confirmed the operation of the Act of 1737 as creating a monopoly. The exclusive
                    rights of the patent theatres were also recognized in the Music Hall Act of
                    1752, and in private Acts dealing with Covent Garden and Drury Lane, and
                    regulating the rights of parties, the application of charitable funds, &amp;c.
                    (see 16 Geo. III. cc. 13, 31; 50 Geo. III. c. ccxiv; 52 Geo. III. c. xix; 1 Geo.
                    IV. c. lx. ). The results of theatrical monopoly were beneficial neither to the
                    public nor to the monopolists themselves. In 1832 a select committee of the
                    House of Commons recommended the legal recognition of “stage-right” and the
                    abolition of theatrical monopoly. The recommendations of the report as to
                    stage-right were carried out immediately by Bulwer Lytton’s Act, 3 and 4 Will.
                    IV. c. 15 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Copyright).</hi> But it was not till 1843
                    that the present Theatre Act, 6 and 7 Vict. c. 68, was passed, a previous bill
                    on the same lines having been rejected by the House of Lords. The Act of 1843
                    inaugurated a more liberal policy, and there is now complete “free trade” in
                    theatres, subject to the conditions imposed by the Act. The growth of theatres
                    since that time has been enormous. In 1885 there were forty-six licensed under
                    the Act in London, Liverpool coming next with ten. Nor does the extension seem
                    to have been attended with the social dangers anticipated by some of the
                    witnesses before the committee of 1832.</p>
                <p>The suppression of objectionable plays was the ground of many early statutes and
                    proclamations. While the religious drama was dying out, the theatre was used as
                    a vehicle for enforcing religious and political views not always as orthodox as
                    those of a miracle play. Thus the Act of 34 and 35 Hen. VIII. c. 1 made it
                    criminal to play in an interlude contrary to the orthodox faith declared, or to
                    be declared, by that monarch. Profanity in theatres seems to have been a crying
                    evil of the time. The first business of the Government of Edward VI. was to pass
                    an Act reciting that the most holy and blessed sacrament was named in plays by
                    such vile and unseemly words as Christian ears did abhor to hear rehearsed, and
                    inflicting fine and imprisonment upon any person advisedly contemning,
                    despising, or reviling the said most blessed sacrament (1 Edw. VI. c. 1). A
                    proclamation of the same king in 1549 forbade the acting of interludes in
                    English on account of their dealing with sacred subjects. In 1556 the council
                    called attention to certain lewd persons in the livery of Sir F. Leke
                    representing plays and interludes reflecting upon the queen and her consort and
                    the formalities of the mass. The same queen forbade the recurrence of such a
                    representation as the mask given by Sir Thomas Pope in honour of the princess
                    Elizabeth at Hatfield, for she “misliked these follies.” By the Act of
                    Uniformity, 1 Eliz. c. 2, it was made an offence punishable by a fine of a
                    hundred marks to speak anything in the derogation, depraving, or despising of
                    the Book of Common Prayer in any interludes or plays. In 1605 “An Act to
                    restrain the Abuses of Players” made it an offence punishable by a fine of £10
                    to jestingly or profanely speak or use certain sacred names in any stage play,
                    interlude, show, may-game, or pageant (3 Jac. I. c. 21). In consequence of the
                    appearance of players in the characters of the king of Spain and Gondomar, an
                    ordinance of James I. forbade the representation on the stage of any living
                    Christian king. The star chamber in 1614 fined Sir John Yorke for representing a
                    Catholic drama in his house. The first Act of the reign of Charles I. forbade
                    acting on Sunday (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sunday).</hi> Puritan opposition to
                    the theatre culminated in the ordinance of the Long Parliament (see vol. vii. p.
                    434). After the Restoration there are few royal proclamations or ordinances, the
                    necessary jurisdiction being exercised almost entirely by parliament and the
                    lord chamberlain. One of the^few post-Restoration royal proclamations is that of
                    February 25, 1665, restraining any but the company of the Duke of York’s theatre
                    from entering at the attiring house of the theatre.</p>
                <p>Preventive censorship of the drama by an officer of state dates from the reign of
                    Elizabeth, and is perhaps the only example of censorship of the press still
                    existing in the United Kingdom (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Press Laws).</hi> Such
                    a censorship is not unknown in other countries, and it seems to have existed
                    even in republican Rome, if one may judge from Horace’s line,—</p>
                <p>“Quae neque in aede sonent certantia judice Tarpa."</p>
                <p>The master of the revels appears to have been the dramatic censor from 1545 to
                    1624, when he was superseded by the lord chamberlain. In some cases the
                    supervision was put into commission. Thus with Tilney, the master of the revels
                    in 1581, were associated by order of the privy council a divine and a statesman.
                    In other cases it was delegated, as to Daniel the poet by warrant in 1603. The
                    proposal to give statutory authority to the jurisdiction of the lord chamberlain
                    led, as has been already stated, to the withdrawal of Sir John Barnard’s bill in
                    1735, and to considerable debate before the bill of 1737 became law. Lord
                    Chesterfield’s objection to the bill in the House of Lords was not unreasonable.
                    “If the players,”</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0245-0228"/>
                <p>said he, “are to be punished, let it be by the laws of their country, and not by
                    the will of an irresponsible despot.” The discretion reposed by the Acts of 1737
                    and 1843 in the lord chamberlain has been, according to the report of a select
                    committee of the House of Commons in 1866, on the whole wisely exercised. On the
                    other hand, there have been instances where perhaps both he and his subordinate
                    officer, the examiner of stage plays, have been somewhat nice in their
                    objections. Thus, during the illness of George III., <hi rend="italic">King
                    Lear</hi> was inhibited. George Colman, when examiner, showed an extraordinary
                    antipathy to such words as “heaven” or “angel.” The lord chamberlain’s powers
                    are still occasionally exerted in the interests of public decency, less
                    frequently for political reasons. Before 1866 the lord chamberlain appears to
                    have taken into consideration the wants of the neighbourhood before granting a
                    licence, but since that year such a course has been abandoned.</p>
                <p>The existing law of theatres is mainly statutory. It will be convenient to treat
                    it as it regards the building, the performance, and the licensing of the
                    building and of the performance. A theatre may be defined with sufficient
                    accuracy for the present purpose as a building in which a stage play is
                    performed for hire. It will be seen from the following sketch of the law that
                    there are a considerable number of different persons, corporate and
                    unincor-f&gt;orate, with jurisdiction over ‘ theatres. A consolidation of the aw
                    seems urgently required, and the placing of jurisdiction in the hands of a
                    central authority for the United Kingdom. The committee of 1866 recommended the
                    transfer to the lord chamberlain of the regulation of all places of amusement,
                    and an appeal from him to the home secretary in certain cases, as also the
                    extension of his authority to preventive censorship in all public
                    entertainments; but no legislation resulted. Several bills for the amendment of
                    the law have been recently introduced, but hitherto without success in the face
                    of more burning political questions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Building.—</hi> A theatre (at any rate to make it such a
                    building as can be licensed) must be a permanent building, not a mere tent or
                    booth, unless when licensed by justices at a lawful fair by § 23 of the Act of
                    1843. It must, if in the metropolis, conform to the regulations as to structure
                    contained in the Metropolitan Building Acts and the Metropolis Management Acts,
                    especially the Act of 1878 (41 and 42 Vict. c. 32). This Act makes a certificate
                    of structural fitness from the Board of Works necessary as a condition precedent
                    for licence in the case of all theatres of a superficial area of not less than
                    500 square feet licensed after the passing of the Act, gives power to the board
                    in certain cases to call upon proprietors of existing theatres to remedy
                    structural defects, and enables it to make regulations for protection from fire.
                    Such regulations were issued by the board on May 2, 1879. As to theatres in
                    provincial towns, the Towns Improvement Act, 1847, and the Public Health Act,
                    1875, confer certain limited powers over the building on municipal corporations
                    and urban sanitary authorities. In many towns, however, the structural
                    qualifications of buildings used as theatres depend upon local Acts and the
                    bylaws made under the powers of such Acts. To a more limited extent the rules
                    made by justices may enforce certain structural requirements.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Performance.—</hi> To constitute a building where a performance
                    takes place a theatre, the performance must be (a) of a stage play, and (5) for
                    hire, (a) By § 23 of the Act of 1843 the word “stageplay” includes tragedy,
                    comedy, farce, opera, burletta, interlude, melodrama, pantomime, or other
                    entertainment of the stage, or any part thereof. The two tests of a stage play
                    appear to be the excitement of emotion and the representation of action. The
                    question whether a performance is a stage play or not seems to be one of degree,
                    and one rather of fact than of law. A <hi rend="italic">ballet d'action</hi>
                    would usually be a stage play, but it would be otherwise with a <hi
                    rend="italic">ballet divertissement.</hi> § 14 empowers the lord chamberlain to
                    forbid the acting of any stage play in Great Britain whenever he may be of
                    opinion that it is fitting for the preservation of good manners, decorum, or the
                    public peace to do so. § 15 imposes a penalty of £50 on any one acting or
                    presenting a play or part of a play after such inhibition, and avoids the
                    licence of the theatre λvhere it appears. Regulations of police respecting the
                    performance are contained in 2 and 3 Vict. c. 47, and in many local Acts. A
                    performance may also be proceeded against as a nuisance at common law, if, for
                    instance, it be <hi rend="italic">contra bonos mores</hi> or draw together a
                    great concourse of vehicles, or if so much noise be heard in the neighbourhood
                    as to interfere with the ordinary occupations of life. Very curious instances of
                    proceedings at common law are recorded. In 1700 the grand jury of Middlesex
                    presented the two playhouses and also the bear-garden on Bankside (the “Paris
                    garden” of <hi rend="italic">Henry VIII.</hi>, act v. sc. 3) as riotous and
                    disorderly nuisances. In 1819 certain players were prosecuted and convicted
                    before the court of great sessions of Wales for acting indecent open-air
                    interludes at Berriew in Montgomeryshire. Performances on Sunday, Good Friday,
                    and Christmas day are illegal (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sunday).</hi>
                    Regulations as to the sale of intoxicating liquors during the performance are
                    made by the Licensing Acts and other public general Acts, as well as by local
                    Acts and rules made by justices. It is frequently a con dition of the licence
                    granted to provincial theatres that no exciseable liquors shall be sold or
                    consumed on the premises. The Children’s Dangerous Performances Act, 1879 (42
                    and 43 Vict. c. 34), forbids under a penalty of £10 any public exhibition or
                    performance whereby the life or limbs of a child under the age of fourteen shall
                    be endangered. It also makes the employer of any such child indictable for
                    assault where an accident causing actual bodily harm has happened to the child,
                    and enables the court on conviction of the employer to order him to pay the
                    child compensation not exceeding £20. (5) The performance must be for hire.</p>
                <p>§ 16 of the Act of 1843 makes a building one in which acting for hire takes
                    place, not only where money is taken directly or indirectly, but also where the
                    purchase of any article is a condition of admission, and where a play is
                    performed in a place in which exciseable liquor is sold. In a recent case of
                    Shelley <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Bethell <hi rend="italic">(Law Reports,</hi>
                    12 Queen’s Bench Division, 11) it was held that the proprietor of a private
                    theatre was liable to penalties under the Act, though he lent the theatre
                    gratuitously, because tickets of admission were sold in aid of a charity.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Licensing of Building.—</hi> By § 2 of the Act of 1843 all
                    theatres (other than patent theatres) must be licensed. By § 7 no licence is to
                    be granted except to the actual and responsible manager, who is to be bound by
                    himself and two sureties for due observance of rules and for securing payment of
                    any penalties incurred. The metropolitan theatres other than the patent theatres
                    (as far at least as they are included in the boroughs named in the Act of 1843)
                    are liceused by the lord chamberlain. By § 4 his fee on grant of a license is
                    not to exceed 10s. for each month for which the theatre is licensed. The lord
                    chamberlain appears to have no power to make suitable rules for enforcing order
                    and decency. He can, however, by § 8, suspend a licence or close a patent
                    theatre where any riot or misbehaviour has taken place.</p>
                <p>Provincial theatres fall under three different licensing authorities. The lord
                    chamberlain licenses theatres in Windsor and Brighton, and theatres situated in
                    the places where the queen occasionally resides, but only during the time of
                    such occasional residence (§ 3). Theatres at Oxford and Cambridge, or within 14
                    miles thereof, are licensed by the justices having jurisdiction therein, but
                    before any such licence can come into force the consent of the chancellor or
                    vice-chancellor must be given. The rules made by the justices for the management
                    of the theatre are subject to the approval of the chancellor or vice-chancellor,
                    who may also impose such conditions upon the licence as he thinks fit. In case
                    of any breach of the rules or conditions, he may annul the licence (§ 10). All
                    other provincial theatres are licensed by four or more justices at a special
                    session held within twenty-one days after application for a licence shall have
                    been made to them (§ 5). The fee is not to exceed 5s. for each month for which
                    the theatre is licensed (§ 6). The justices, like the lord chamberlain, appear
                    to have no discretion as to granting a licence. Their act is purely ministerial
                    and confined to ascertaining that the applicant is the actual and responsible
                    manager, and that he and his sureties are of sufficient substance to provide the
                    requisite bonds. § 9 gives the justices authority to make at the special session
                    suitable rules for enforcing order and decency at the theatres licensed by them,
                    and of rescinding or altering such rules at a subsequent special session. It
                    also gives a secretary of state power to rescind or alter such rules, and to
                    make other rules. In case of riot or breach of the rules, the justices may order
                    the theatre to be closed, and it thereupon becomes an unlicensed house.
                    Penalties are imposed by the Act for keeping or acting in an unlicensed theatre,
                    and for producing or acting in an unlicensed play.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Licensing Performance.—</hi> A stage play must be duly licensed
                    before performance. § 12 of the Act of 1843 prescribes that a copy of every new
                    play and of every addition to an old play, and of every new prologue or epilogue
                    or addition thereto (such copy to be signed by the master or manager), shall be
                    sent to the lord chamberlain, and, if the lord chamberlain does not forbid it
                    within seven days, it may be represented. § 13 empowers the lord chamberlain to
                    fix a scale of fees for examination; the fee is now two guineas for a play of
                    three or more acts, one guinea for a play of less than three acts. All plays
                    represented previously to the Act are held to be licensed. A play once licensed
                    is licensed once for all, unless the licence be revoked under § 14. The
                    examination is the duty of a special officer of the lord chamberlain’s
                    department, the examiner of stage plays.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Music Halls.—</hi> Music was at no time the object of
                    restrictions as severe as those imposed upon the drama. The present Music Hall
                    Act (25 Geo. II. c. 36) was passed in 1752, probably in consequence of the
                    publication in 1750 of Fielding’s <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Causes of
                    the late Increase of Robbers.</hi> It is remarkable that two works of the same
                    writer should from opposite causes have led to both theatre and music hall
                    legislation of lasting importance. The Act was originally passed for a term of
                    three years, but was made perpetual by 28 Geo. II. c. 19. It applies only to
                    music halls within 20 miles of London and Westminster. Every such music hall
                    must be licensed at the Michaelmas quarter sessions, the licence to be signified
                    under the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n246/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0246-0229"/> hands and seals of four or more justices. The
                    licence may be granted for music or dancing or both. Public notice of the
                    licence is to be given by affixing over the door the inscription “Licensed
                    pursuant to Act of Parliament of the twenty-fifth of King George the Second.”
                    The penalty for keeping an unlicensed music hall is £100. Music halls beyond the
                    radius of 20 miles from London and Westminster are usually governed by local
                    legislation, which in most cases follows, <hi rend="italic">mutatis
                    mutandis,</hi> the lines of the Act of 1752. The music hall, like the theatre,
                    must generally fulfil certain structural requirements. In one important respect
                    the law is more lenient to the music hall than to the theatre. A licence is
                    necessary for a single performance of a stage play, but it is only habitual
                    music or dancing that requires a music hall licence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotland.—</hi> In Scotland the theatre has always exercised a
                    smaller amount of influence than in England, and there has been little
                    exclusively Scotch legislation on the subject. An Act of 1555, c. 40,
                    discountenanced certain amusements of a semi-theatrical kind by enacting that no
                    one was to be chosen Robert Hude (sic), Little John, abbot of Unreason, or queen
                    of May. A proclamation of James VI. in 1574, and an Act of 1579, c. 12, followed
                    the lines of English legislation by making persons using unlawful plays, such
                    <hi rend="superscript"> as</hi> jugghry <hi rend="superscript"> or</hi> f <hi
                    rend="superscript"> as</hi> t <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d loose,
                    punishable as vagabonds. In 1574 the General Assembly claimed to license plays,
                    and forbade representations on Sunday. As in England, the licensing power seems
                    then to have passed from the church to the crown, for in 1599 James VI. licensed
                    a theatre at Edinburgh. The Act 1672, c. 21, exempted comedians while upon the
                    stage from the sumptuary provisions of the Act respecting apparel. The
                    chamberlain of Scotland, while such an office existed, appears to have exercised
                    a eertain police jurisdiction over theatres. The Theatre Act of 1843 extends to
                    Scotland, as did also the previous Act of 1737.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ireland.—</hi> Theatrical legislation, as far as it went, was
                    based upon English models. Thus ridicule of the liturgy was forbidden by 2 Eliz.
                    c. 2 (Ir. ): common players of interludes and wandering minstrels were deemed
                    vagabonds, 10 and 11 Car. I. c. 4 (Ir.). In 1786 an Act was passed to enable the
                    crown to grant letters fatent for one or more theatres in Dublin city and
                    county, 26 Geo.</p>
                <p>II. c. 57 (Ir.). The preamble alleges that the establishing of a well-regulated
                    theatre at the seat of government will be productive of public advantage and
                    tend to improve the morals of the people. Exceptions from the restrictions of
                    the Act were made in favour of entertainments for the benefit of the Dublin
                    lying-in hospital and exhibitions of horsemanship or puppet-shows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">United States.—</hi> Public entertainments, dramatic or
                    otherwise, are usually under the control of the municipal authorities. In some
                    States, such as New York and Massachusetts, there is State legislation,
                    requiring places of public entertainment to be licensed by the proper authority.
                    In many States it is a condition of the licence that intoxicating liquors shall
                    not be sold in such places. Other conditions, more or less usual, are that there
                    shall be no Sunday or dangerous performances, that acrobats shall be properly
                    protected, and that female waiters shall not be employed. Structural
                    qualifications are in some cases made necessary. Thus in 1885 the New York
                    legislature passed an Act containing many minute provisions for ensuring the
                    safety of theatres against fire. A characteristic piece of legislation is the
                    New York Act of 1873, c. 186, enacting that no citizen is to be excluded from a
                    theatre by reason of race, colour, or previous condition of servitude. This Act
                    of course merely carries out the important principle affirmed in art. xiv. of
                    the amendments to the constitution of the United States. See <hi
