                    in 1660, was chosen fellow in 1662, and became B.D. in 1667. For a short time he
                    studied medicine, but in 1659 w as privately ordained. In 1667 he was presented
                    to the living of Holywell-cum-Needingworth, Huntingdonshire, by the earl of
                    Manchester, to whose son he had been tutor, and in 1670 to that of St Peter’s
                    Mancroft, Norwich. In 1680 he received the degree of D.D., and was presented by
                    Charles II. to the important cure of St Martin’s-in-the-Fields. Tenison,
                    according to Burnet, “endowed schools, set up a public library, and kept many
                    curates to assist him in his indefatigable labours.” Being a strenuous opponent
                    of the Church of Rome, and “Whitehall lying within that parish, he stood as in
                    the front of the battle all King James’s reign.” In 1678, in a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Discourse of Idolatry,</hi> he had endeavoured to fasten the practices of
                    heathenish idolatry on the Church of Rome, and in a sermon which he published in
                    1681 on <hi rend="italic">Discretion in Giving Alnis</hi> was attacked by Andrew
                    Pulton, head of the Jesuits in the Savoy. Tenison’s reputation as an enemy of
                    Catholicism led the duke of Monmouth to send for him before his execution in
                    1685, when Bishops Ken and Turner refused to administer the Eucharist; but,
                    although Tenison spoke to him in “a softer and less peremptory manner” than the
                    two bishops, he was, like them, not satisfied with the sufficiency of Monmouth’s
                    penitence. Under William, Tenison was in 1689 named a member of the
                    ecclesiastical commission appointed to prepare matters towards a reconciliation
                    of the Dissenters, the revision of the liturgy being specially entrusted to him.
                    A sermon which he preached on the commission was published the same year. He
                    appears to have been better satisfied with the religious sentiments of Nell
                    Gwynn on the approach of death than with those of the duke of Monmouth, for in
                    1691 he preached her funeral sermon, in which he represented her as truly
                    penitent,—a charitable judgment which did not meet with universal approval. The
                    general liberality of Tenison’s religious views commended him to the favour of
                    William, and, after being made bishop of Lincoln in 1691, he was promoted to the
                    primacy in December 1694. He attended Mary during her last illness and preached
                    her funeral sermon in Westminster Abbey. When William in 1695 went to take
                    command of the army in the Netherlands, Tenison was appointed one of the seven
                    lords justices to whom his authority was delegated. Along with Burnet he
                    attended William on his deathbed, and it was from their hands that he received
                    the Eucharist. He crowned Queen Anne, but during her reign was not in much
                    favour at court. He was a commissioner for the Union in 1706. A strong supporter
                    of the Hanoverian succession, he was one of the three officers of state to whom
                    on the death of Anne was entrusted the duty of appointing a regent till the
                    arrival of George I., whom he crowned on 31st October 1714. Tenison died at
                    London on 14th December of the following year. Besides the sermons and tracts
                    above mentioned, and various others on different points of the Popish
                    controversy, Tenison was the author of <hi rend="italic">The Creed of Mr Hobbes
                    examined</hi> (1670) and <hi rend="italic">Baconia, or Certain Genuine Remains
                    of Lord Bacon</hi> (1679).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Life and Times of the Most Rev. Father in
                    God, Dr Thomas Tenison, late Archbishop of Canterbury,</hi> appeared without
                    date not long after his death. See also Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    his own Time</hi> and Macaulay’s <hi rend="italic">History of England.</hi></p>
