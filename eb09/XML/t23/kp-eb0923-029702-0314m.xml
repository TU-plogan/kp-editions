                    become one of the chief commercial centres of the ancient world. Since the Roman
                    conquest the seat of the Roman provincial government had been here. Here, as in
                    Corinth, the conditions were favourable for the reception of Christianity. The
                    population was not purely Greek, but cosmopolitan, a mixture of divers
                    nationalities. Such a population is always more susceptible to religious
                    novelties for good and for evil than one of old, firmly established national
                    growth. The apostle Paul experienced this to his great joy and satisfaction here
                    also, as he for the first time set foot on the shores of Europe with the message
                    of Jesus Christ. It was about the year 52 or 53 that he, on his arrival from
                    Philippi, preached the gospel of Christ in the rich merchant city. As in other
                    places, he began with the Jews. There was a Jewish congregation at Thessalonica,
                    as at all the great ports and trading centres of the Mediterranean, with their
                    own synagogue and regular service. For three Sabbaths Paul stood up in the
                    synagogue, proving by the Scriptures that Jesus was the promised and expected
                    Messiah (Acts xvii. 1-3). He had not much success with the Jews, but this was
                    more than compensated by the number of “devout Greeks” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> Gentiles who already had some connexion with Judaism) whom he won
                    to a belief in Christ. He found hearing especially with the chief women (Acts
                    xviii. 4). But Paul had also converted a not smaller number of real heathens.
                    Indeed, they must have constituted the majority of the Christian church there
                    formed, for in his first epistle he says quite generally that his readers, in
                    consequence of his preaching, had turned from idols to the one true God (1
                    Thess. i. 9).</p>
                <p>Paul’s stay in Thessalonica was short. The plots of the Jews soon obliged him to
                    leave the town, and he betook himself to Beraea (Acts xvii. 10), thence to
                    Athens (Acts xvii. 15), and finally to Corinth (Acts xviii. 1). The two epistles
                    were written to the church of Thessalonica during a stay of a year and a half in
                    Corinth (Acts xviii. 11), about 53-54, not before this in Athens, as is asserted
                    in the subscription of both epistles in the Codex Alexandrinus and other MSS.
                    For when Paul wrote the first epistle some time had elapsed since the formation
                    of the church: some members were already dead (1 Thess. iv. 13), and Paul had
                    worked for some time, not only in Macedonia, but also in Achaia (i. 7, 8). On
                    the other hand, the church appears to be comparatively young; the conversions
                    are still spoken of everywhere in Macedonia and Achaia (i. 9). All this points
                    to the conclusion that the first epistle was written in Corinth, and this is
                    confirmed by the opening salutation (i. 1), in which Silvanus (Silas) and
                    Timotheus are named as joint authors, for they were in Corinth with Paul (Acts
                    xviii. 5).</p>
                <p>The first epistle gives us a very clear picture of the disposition and state of
                    such a young church, composed of former heathens. They had received with
                    enthusiasm the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Bringer of salvation, the Saviour in
                    the approaching day of judgment (i. 9, 10). But the realization of this
                    salvation is now awaited with impatience, and a sense of disappointment is
                    experienced because some members of the church have died without having seen the
                    advent of the Lord (iv. 13). At the same time many there are still living in
                    gross heathen sins and vices (iv. 1-8). Paul had sent back Timotheus from Athens
                    to Thessalonica in order to advise the young inexperienced church, and to obtain
                    news concerning it (iii. 1-5). He has just returned to Paul (iii. 6), and the
                    information received through this source is the occasion of the first
                    epistle,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to
                    Acts xvii. 14-15 and xviii. 5, Silas and Timotheus had remained behind in
                    Beraea, and first met Paul again in Corinth. But according to 1 Thess. iii. 1-5
                    it must be understood that Timotheus was in Athens with Paul, and had been sent
                    thence to Thessalonica.</p></note> designed to supply the place of Paul’s
                    personal presence and bring new exhortation and instruction from the apostle to
                    the young church, which still much needed guidance.</p>
                <p>We have no information concerning the effect of this letter. It is conceivable,
                    however, that the church required yet further advice and direction from the
                    apostle, and so far it is not remarkable that Paul saw the need for a second
                    similar letter of teaching and exhortation. This second epistle also, if it is
                    genuine, was written during Paul’s stay of a year and a half at Corinth, very
                    soon after <pb break="no"

                    conjoined names of Silvanus and Timotheus, who were still with Paul, while we
                    must understand from Acts xviii. 18 that after Paul’s departure from Corinth
                    they ceased to be his companions. The occasion of this epistle seems especially
                    to have arisen from the circumstance that the church had been put into fear and
                    anxiety about the advent of Christ, perhaps by a pretended letter from Paul. Two
                    passages point to the existence of such a thing: in ii. 2, Paul says that the
                    church shall not let itself be alarmed “by word or by letter as from us” (i.e.,
                    nominally coming from us), and in iii. 17 again Paul lays emphasis on his
                    signature by his own hand as the token (of genuineness) to be noticed in each
                    letter. In any case the chief aim of the epistle is to tranquillize the church
                    concerning the advent of Christ, which is not yet immediately imminent. He
                    particularly exhorts them not to let themselves be shaken in mind, as that the
                    day of Christ is at hand (ii. 1, 2). For before this day comes the “man of sin”
                    must first appear, who seats himself in the temple of God, and gives himself out
                    for God (ii. 3-5). And he too is for the present kept back by another power (ii.
                    6, 7). Only when the latter is taken out of the way shall “that wicked” be
                    revealed, and the great falling away shall follow (ii. 8-12).</p>
                <p>The genuineness of the two epistles has not remained unquestioned by the newer
                    criticism. Baur declared himself against the genuineness of both epistles,<note

                    of both epistles.</p>
                <p>The final decision of the newer criticism is justified by the evidence. No real
                    difficulties can be brought against the genuineness of the first epistle, but
                    they certainly can against that of the second. W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi>
                    hen Baur finds that the epistles lack the characteristic Pauline ideas, he is
                    only so far right that the doctrine of justification by faith is not dealt with,
                    for which, however, no occasion arises. It has been asserted that there are
                    traces of imitation of the epistles to the Corinthians, but the points of
                    resemblance are^not such as to justify this conclusion. The connexion of the
                    passage in 1 Thess. ii. 16 (the wrath of God is already come upon the Jews) with
                    the destruction of Jerusalem rests on an arbitrary, nay false, interpretation.
                    And it cannot be maintained on impartial examination that in 1 Thess. ii. 14,
                    15, the Jewish churches of Palestine are set forth in a way unlike Paul, as an
                    example for the heathen churches.</p>
                <p>The objections to the second epistle are much weightier, though here also not all
                    the arguments adduced by hostile critics are valid. It has been often said that
                    the author, like the author of the Apocalypse, regards Nero as the Antichrist,
                    expecting him to reappear as the arch-enemy of Christ. But this interpretation
                    of the short statement of our epistle cannot be proved. The assumption that
                    before the dawn of salvation godlessness would reach its height, through the
                    appearance of an arch-enemy of God and His church is, so to speak, a dogmatic
                    postulate which rests on the prophecies of Daniel and other prophets of the Old
                    Testament. And, in so far as the picture of this archenemy is endowed with
                    historical features, they can quite as well have been drawn from Caligula as
                    from Nero. For Caligula had already laid claim to the honours of a god, and
                    because of this appeared to the Jews to be the embodiment of godlessness. The
                    assumption of such an Antichrist would not be striking in Paul. Even if it is
                    correct (as is generally and with reason taken for granted) that by the
                    hindrance which keeps back the appearance of Antichrist (2 Thess. ii. 6, 7) the
                    established might of the Roman emperor and empire is to be understood, this view
                    would be quite in keeping with Paul’s views about the Roman dominion (Rom. xiii.
                    1-7). Yet it must be conceded that the statements on this head create real
                    difficulty, if we compare them with those of the first epistle, in which all
                    stress is laid on the fact that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the
                    night, and that man must be prepared for it at any moment (1 Thess. v. 1-11). In
                    the second epistle it is pointed out with equal emphasis that the day of the
                    Lord is not immediately imminent, and that certain events must come first (2
                    Thess. ii. 1-10). It is certainly very striking that Paul, so soon after the
                    admonitions of the first kind, should have given the quieting assurances of the
                    second. And 2 Thess. ii. 2 and iii. 7 can hardly be explained except by the
                    supposition that the readers had been thrown into alarm by a pretended epistle
                    from Paul. Could this have been dared in that early time, almost under the eyes
                    of the apostle? Finally, it is not to be denied that the style of the second
                    epistle is different from that of the first, and that the contents often appear
                    a mere imitation, except in the eschatological passages on account of which it
                    was written. It must therefore be admitted that weighty if not conclusive
                    considerations have been produced against its genuineness. <hi rend="smallcaps"
