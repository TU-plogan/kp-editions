                <p><label type="entry">TURKEY</label>, an abbreviation for <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Turkey-Cock</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Turkey-Hex</hi> as the case may be, a
                    well-known large domestic gallinaceous bird. How it came by this name has long
                    been a matter of discussion, for it is certain that this valuable animal was
                    introduced to Europe from the New-World, and in its introduction had nothing to
                    do with Turkey or with Turks, even in the old and extended sense in which that
                    term was applied to all Mahometans. But it is almost as unquestionable that the
                    name was originally applied to the bird which we know as the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">GuineaFowl (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.),</hi> and there is no
                    doubt that some authors in the 16th and 17th centuries curiously confounded
                    these two species. As both birds became more common and better known, the
                    distinction was gradually perceived, and the name “Turkey” clave to that from
                    the New World— possibly because of its repeated call-note—to be syllabled <hi
                    rend="italic">turk, turk, turk,</hi> whereby it may be almost said to have named
                    itself <hi rend="italic">(cf. Notes and Queries,</hi> ser. 6, iii. pp. 23, 369).
                    But even Linnaeus could not clear himself of the confusion, and unhappily
                    misapplied the name <hi rend="italic">Meleagris,</hi> undeniably belonging to
                    the Guinea-Fowl, as the generic term for what we now know as the Turkey, adding
                    thereto as its specific designation the word <hi rend="italic">gallopavo,</hi>
                    taken from the <hi rend="italic">Gallοpava</hi> of Gesner, who, though not
                    wholly free from error, was less mistaken than some of his contemporaries and
                    even successors.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    general idea of what India then was. One of the earliest German names for the

                    but to Calicut on the Malabar coast (<hi rend="italic">cf. Notes and

                <p>The Turkey, so far as we know, was first described by Oviedo in his <hi

                    few years later. Oviedo’s earlier work is only known to the present writer by

                    1527. He, not unnaturally, includes both Curassows and Turkeys in one category,
                    calling both “Pavos” (Peafowls); but he carefully distinguishes between them,
                    pointing out among other things that the latter make a wheel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(hacen la rueda)</hi> of their tail, though this was not so grand or so
                    beautiful as that of the Spanish “Pavo,” and he gives a faithful though short
                    description of the Turkey, The chief point of interest in his account is that he
                    speaks of the species having been already taken from New Spain (Mexico) to the
                    islands and to Castilla del Oro (Darien), where it bred in a domestic state
                    among the Christians. Much labour has been given by various naturalists to
                    ascertain the date of its introduction to Europe, to which we can at present
                    only make an approximate attempt;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The bibliography of the Turkey is so large that there is
                    here no room to name the various works that might be cited. Recent research has
                    failed to add anything of importance to what has been said on this point by
                    Buffon <hi rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> ii. pp. 132-162), Pennant <hi
                    rend="italic">(Arctic Zoology,</hi> pp. 291-300),—an admirable summary,—and
                    Broderip <hi rend="italic">(Zoological Recreations,</hi> pp. 120-137)—not that
                    all their statements can be wholly accepted. Barrington’s essay <hi
                    rend="italic">(Miscellanies,</hi> pp. 127-151), to prove that the bird was known
                    before the discovery of America and was transported thither, is an ingenious
                    piece of special pleading which his friend Pennant did him the real kindness of
                    ignoring.</p></note> but after all that has been written it is plain that
                    evidence concurs to show that the bird was established in Europe by 1530—a very
                    short time to have elapsed since it became known to the Spaniards, which could
                    hardly have been before 1518, when Mexico was discovered. The possibility that
                    it had been brought to England by Cabot or some of his successors earlier in the
                    century is not to be overlooked, and reasons will presently be assigned for
                    supposing that one of the breeds of English Turkeys may have had a northern
                    origin;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In 1672 Josselin
                    <hi rend="italic">(New England's Rarities,</hi> p. 9) speaks of the settlers
                    bringing up “great store of the wild kind” of Turkeys, “which remain about their
                    houses as tame as ours in England.” The bird was evidently plentiful down to the
                    very seaboard of Massachusetts, and it is not likely to have been domesticated
                    by the Indian tribes there, as, according to Hernandez, it seems to have been by
                    the Mexicans. It was probably easy to take alive, and, as we know, capable of
                    enduring the voyage to England.</p></note> but the often quoted distich first
                    given in Baker’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> (p. 298), asserting that
                    Turkeys came into England in the same year—and that year by reputation 1524—as
                    carps, pickerels, and other commodities, is wholly untrustworthy, for we know
                    that both these fishes lived in the country long before, if indeed they were not
                    indigenous to it. The earliest documentary evidence of its existence in England
                    is a “constitution” set forth by Cranmer in 1541, which Hearne first printed
                    (Leland’s <hi rend="italic">Collectanea,</hi> ed. 2, vi. p. 38). This names
                    “Turkey-cocke" as one of “the greater fowles” of which an ecclesiastic was to
                    have “but one in a dishe,” and its association with the Crane and Swan precludes
                    the likelihood of any confusion with the Guinea-Fowl. Moreover the comparatively
                    low price of the two Turkeys and four Turkey-chicks served at a feast of the
                    serjeants-at-law in 1555 (Dugdale, <hi rend="italic">Origines,</hi> p. 135)
                    points to their having become by that time abundant, and indeed by 1573 Tusser
                    bears witness to the part they had already begun to play in “Christmas
                    husbandlie fare.” In 1555 both sexes were characteristically figured by Belon
                    <hi rend="italic">(Oyseaux,</hi> p. 249), as was the cock by Gesner in the same
                    year, and these are the earliest representations of the bird known to exist.</p>
                <p>There is no need to describe here a bird so familiar and in these days so widely
                    distributed. As a denizen of our poultry - yards (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Poultry,</hi> vol. xix. p. 646) there are at least two distinct breeds, though
                    crosses between them are much commoner than purely-bred examples of either. That
                    known as the Norfolk breed is the taller of the two, and is said to be the more
                    hardy. Its plumage is almost entirely black, with very little lustre, but the
                    feathers of the tail and some of those of the back have a brownish tip. The
                    chicks also are black, with occasionally white patches on the head. The other
                    breed, called the Cambridgeshire, is much more variegated in colour, and some
                    parts of the plumage have a bright metallic gloss, while the chicks are
                    generally mottled with brownish grey. White, pied, and buff Turkeys are also
                    often seen, and if care be taken they are commonly found to “breed true.”
                    Occasionally Turkeys, the cocks especially, occur with a top-knot of feathers,
                    and one of them was figured by Albin in 1738. It has been suggested with some
                    appearance of probability that the Norfolk breed may be descended from the
                    northern form, <hi rend="italic">Meleagris gallopaυo</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >americana,</hi> while the Cambridgeshire breed may spring from the southern
                    form, the <hi rend="italic">M. mexicana</hi> of Gould (Proc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zool. Society,</hi> 1856, p. 61), which indeed it very much resembles, especi
                    ally in having its tail-coverts and quills tipped with white or light
                    ochreous,—points that recent North-American ornithologists rely upon as
                    distinctive of this form. If this supposition be true, there would be reason to
                    believe in the double introduction of the bird into England at least, as already
                    hinted, but positive information is almost wholly wanting.<note anchored="true"

                    form of wild Turkey, whose habits have been described in much detail by all the
                    chief writers on North-American birds, is now extinct in the settled parts of
                    Canada and the eastern States of the Union, where it was once so numerous; and
                    in Mexico the southern form, which would seem to have been never abundant since
                    the conquest, has been for many years rare. Further to the south, on the borders
                    of Guatemala and British Honduras, there exists a perfectly distinct species,
                    <hi rend="italic">M</hi>. <hi rend="italic">ocellata,</hi> whose plumage almost
                    vies with that of a Peacock in splendour, while the bare skin which covers the

                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Meleagris</hi> is considered to enter into the Family
                    <hi rend="italic">Phasianidae,</hi> in which it forms a Subfamily <hi

                    Miocene of Colorado, and two, one much taller and the other smaller than the
                    existing species, from the Post-Pliocene of New Jersey. Both the last had
                    proportionally long and slender legs. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
