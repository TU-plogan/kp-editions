                    (1800-1886), poet and colonial statesman, was born October 18, 1800, at
                    Bishop-Mid-dleham, in the county of Durham. His ancestors had been small
                    landowners for some generations, and both his studious father, who late in life
                    emerged for a time from a recluse existence to make an efficient secretary to
                    the Poor Law Commission, and his original warm-hearted mother were interesting
                    persons. His mother died while he was yet an infant, and he was chiefly
                    educated'by his father, who, finding him less quick and deeming him less
                    intelligent than his two elder brothers, allowed him to go to sea as a
                    midshipman. Eight months summed up his naval career; it had taken much less to
                    disgust him with it. After obtaining his discharge he was appointed to a
                    clerkship in the storekeeper’s office, and had scarcely entered upon his duties
                    ere he was attacked by typhus fever, which carried off both his brothers, then
                    living with him in London. In three or four years more his office was abolished
                    while he was on duty in the West Indies. On his return he found his father
                    happily married to a lady whose interest and sympathy proved of priceless value
                    to him. Through her he became acquainted with her cousin Isabella Fenwick, the
                    neighbour and intimate friend of Wordsworth, who introduced him to Wordsworth
                    and Southey. Under these influences he lost his early admiration for Byron,
                    whose school, whatever its merits, he at least was in no way calculated to
                    adorn, and his intellectual powers developed rapidly. In October 1822 an article
                    from his pen on Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Irish Melodies</hi> appeared in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review.</hi> A year later he departed for London
                    to seek his fortune as a man of letters, and met with such rapid success, though
                    not precisely in this capacity, as has but rarely attended an unknown young man.
                    He became editor of the <hi rend="italic">London Magazine,</hi> to which he had
                    already contributed, and in January 1824 obtained, through the influence of Sir
                    Henry Holland, an appointment in the Colonial Office, insuring him, not only an
                    ample salary, but considerable influence in this department of public affairs.
                    The general standard of the office was probably at that time low; at all events
                    Taylor was immediately entrusted with the preparation of confidential state
                    papers, and his opinion soon exercised an important influence on the decisions
                    of the secretary of state. He visited Wordsworth and Southey, travelled on the
                    Continent with the latter, and at the same time, mainly through his friend and
                    official colleague, the Hon. Hyde Villiers, became intimate with a very
                    different set, the younger followers of Bentham, without, however, adopting
                    their opinions,—“young men,” he afterwards reminded <pb break="no"

                    ruined by their independence, but who ended by obtaining all their hearts’
                    desires, except one who fell by the way.” The reference is to Hyde Villiers, who
                    died prematurely, and for whose sister, afterwards Lady Theresa Lewis, Taylor
                    was an unsuccessful suitor. He actively promoted the emancipation of the slaves
                    in 1833, and became an intimate ally of Sir James Stephen, then counsel to the
                    Colonial Office, afterwards under-secretary, by whom the Act of Emancipation was
                    principally framed. His first drama, <hi rend="italic">Isaac Comnenus,</hi> was
                    published anonymously in 1827. Though highly praised by Southey, it made little
                    impression on the public. <hi rend="italic">Philip van Artevelde,</hi> the
                    subject of which had been recommended to him by Southey, was begun in 1828,
                    published in 1834, and, aided by a laudatory criticism from Lockhart’s pen,
                    achieved extraordinary success. <hi rend="italic">Edιviη the Fair</hi> (1842)
                    was less warmly received. In the interim he had married (1839) the daughter of
                    his former chief Lord Monteagle, and, in conjunction with Stephen, had taken a
                    leading part in the abolition of negro apprenticeship in the West Indies. <hi
                        rend="italic">The Statesman,</hi> a volume of essays suggested by his
                    official position, had been published in 1836, and about the same time he had
                    written in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly</hi> the friendly advertisements of
                    Wordsworth and Southey, subsequently published under the somewhat misleading
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Notes from Books.</hi> In 1847 he was offered the
                    under-secretaryship of state, which he declined. <hi rend="italic">Notes from
                        Life</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Eve of the Conquest</hi> appeared in
                    this year, and <hi rend="italic">Notes from Books</hi> in 1849. An experiment in
                    romantic comedy, <hi rend="italic">The Virgin Widow,</hi> afterwards entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">A Sicilian Summer,</hi> was published in 1850. “The
                    pleasantest play I had written,” says the author; “and I never could tell why
                    people would not be pleased with it.” His last dramatic work was <hi
                        rend="italic">St Clement’s Eve,</hi> published in 1862. In 1869 he was made
                    K.C.M.G. He retired from the Colonial Office in 1872, though continuing to be
                    consulted by Government. His last days were spent at Bournemouth in the
                    enjoyment of universal respect; and the public, to whom he had hitherto been an
                    almost impersonal existence, became familiarized with the extreme
                    picturesqueness of his appearance in old age, as represented in the photographs
                    of his friend Mrs Cameron. He died on March 27, 1886.</p>
                <p>Sir Henry Taylor is pre-eminently the statesman among English poets. When he can
                    speak poetically in this character he is impressive, almost great; when he deals
                    with the more prosaic aspects of policy he is dignified and weighty, without
                    being altogether a poet; when his theme is entirely unrelated to the conduct of
                    public affairs or private life he is usually little more than an accomplished
                    man of letters. An exception must be made for the interesting character of Elena
                    in <hi rend="italic">Philip van Artevelde,</hi> and for Artevelde’s early love
                    experience, which reproduces and transfigures the writer’s own. The circumstance
                    of <hi rend="italic">Philip van Artevelde</hi> being to a great extent the
                    vehicle of his own ideas and feelings explains its great superiority to his
                    other works. It is subjective as well as objective, and to a certain extent
                    lyrical in feeling, though not in form. Though more elaborate than any of his
                    other dramas, it seems to smell less of the lamp. He has thoroughly identified
                    himself with his hero, and the only fault to be found with this noble picture of
                    a consummate leader and statesman is the absence of the shadow required for a
                    tragic portrait. The blame allotted to Artevelde is felt to be merely
                    conventional, and the delineation of uniform excellence becomes monotonous. The
                    hero of <hi rend="italic">Edwin the Fair,</hi> Dunstan, the ecclesiastical
                    statesman, the man of two worlds, is less sympathetic to the author and less
                    attractive to the reader. The character is nevertheless a fine psychological
                    study, and the play is full of historical if not of dramatic interest. <hi
                        rend="italic">Isaac Cοmηeηus</hi> is more Elizabethan in tone than his other
                    dramas. Comnenus is like a preliminary sketch for Van Artevelde; and the picture
                    of the Byzantine court and people is exceedingly lively. The idea of the revival
                    of romantic comedy in <hi rend="italic">The Virgin Widow</hi> is excellent, but
                    the play lacks the humour which might have made it a success. The length of the
                    speeches, even when not set speeches, is a drawback to all these dramas.
                    Taylor’s lyrical work is in general laboriously artificial. It is therefore
                    extraordinary that he should have produced two songs (“Quoth tongue of neither
                    maid nor wife” and “If I had the wings of a dove”) which it would hardly be an
                    exaggeration to call worthy of Shakespeare. His character as an essayist repeats
                    his character as a dramatist. The essays published under the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Statesman</hi> occupy a peculiar place in literature. They
                    have serious faults, especially the too obvious imitation of Bacon, but they
                    nevertheless are original in their point of view, and their wisdom is the result
                    of a different kind of observation from that which qualifies the bulk of
                    essayists on human life. When writing as one of these Taylor is less removed
                    from the commonplace, though many of his remarks are admirable. As a literary
                    critic he seems unable to get beyond Wordsworth and the select circle of poets
                    admired by the latter. His essays on Wordsworth did much to dispel the
                    conventional prejudices of the day, but will not advance the study of the poet
                    where his greatness is already recognized. His strictures on Byron and Shelley
                    are narrow and not a little presumptuous. Presumption, indeed, the last fault to
                    have been expected in so grave and measured a writer, is one of those of which
                    he most freely accuses himself in the autobiography published a year before his
                    death. It is not otherwise apparent in this highly interesting book, which,
                    sinning a little by the egotism pardonable in a poet and the garrulity natural
                    to a veteran, is in the main a pleasing and faithful picture of an aspiring
                    youth, an active maturity, and a happy and honoured old age. (R. G.)</p>
