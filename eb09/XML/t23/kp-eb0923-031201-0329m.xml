                <p><label type="entry">THOMSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1834-1882),
                    author of <hi rend="italic">The City of Dreadful Night,</hi> was born at Port
                    Glasgow, in Renfrewshire, on November 23, 1834, the eldest child of a mate in
                    the merchant shipping service. His mother was a deeply religious woman of the
                    Irvingite sect, and it is not improbable that it was from her the son inherited
                    his sombre and imaginative temperament. On her death, James, then in his seventh
                    year, was procured admission into the Caledonian Orphan Asylum, from which he
                    went out into the world as an assistant army schoolmaster. At the garrison at
                    Ballincollig, near Cork, he encountered the one brief happiness of his life: he
                    fell passionately in love with, and was in turn as ardently loved by, the
                    daughter of the armourer-sergeant of a regiment in the garrison, a girl of very
                    exceptional beauty and cultivated mind. Two years later, when Thomson was at the
                    training college at Chelsea, he suddenly received news of her fatal illness and
                    death. The blow prostrated him in mind and body; and the former endured a hurt
                    from which it never really recovered. Henceforth his life was one of gloom,
                    disappointment, misery, and poverty, rarely alleviated by episodes of somewhat
                    brighter fortune. While in Ireland he had made the acquaintance of Mr Charles
                    Bradlaugh, then a soldier stationed at Ballincollig, and it was under his
                    auspices (as editor of the <hi rend="italic">London Investigator)</hi> that
                    Thomson first appealed to the public as an author, though actually his earliest
                    publication was in <hi rend="italic">Tails Edinburgh Magazine</hi> for July
                    1858, under the signature “Crepusculus.” In 1860 was established the paper with
                    which Mr Bradlaugh has been so long identified, <hi rend="italic">The National
                    Reformer,</hi> and it was here, among other productions by James Thomson, that
                    appeared (1863) the powerful and sonorous verses “To our Ladies of Death,” and
                    (1874) his chief work, the sombre and imaginative <hi rend="italic">City of
                    Dreadful Night.</hi> In October 1862 Thomson left the army, and through Mr
                    Bradlaugh (with whom for some subsequent years he lived) gained employment as a
                    solicitor’s clerk. In 1869 he enjoyed what has been described as his “only
                    reputable appearance in respectable literary society,” in the acceptance of his
                    long poem, “Sunday up the River,” for <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi>
                    on the advice, it is said, of Charles Kingsley. In 1872 Thomson went to the
                    Western States of America, as the agent of the shareholders in what he
                    ascertained to be a fraudulent silver mine; and the following year he received a
                    commission from <hi rend="italic">The New York World</hi> to go to Spain as its
                    special correspondent with the Carlists. During the two months of his stay in
                    that distracted country he saw little real fighting, and was himself prostrated
                    by a sunstroke. On his return to England he continued to write in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Secularist</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The National
                    Reformer,</hi> under the at last well-known initials “B. V.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bysshe Vanolis: “Bysshe,” as
                    the commonly used Christian name of Shelley, Thomson’s favourite writer; and
                    “Vanolis,” an anagram of Novalis, the pseudonym of F. von <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Habdenbebg (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.).</hi></p></note> In 1875 he severed
                    his connexion with <hi rend="italic">The National Reformer,</hi> owing to a
                    disagreement with its editor; henceforth his chief source of income (1875-1881)
                    was from the monthly periodical known as <hi rend="italic">Cope’s Tobacco
                    Plant.</hi> Chiefly through the exertions of his friend and admirer, Mr Bertram
                    Dobell, Thomson’s best known book, <hi rend="italic">The City of Dreadful Night,
                    and other Poems,</hi> was published in April 1880, and at once attracted wide
                    attention; it was succeeded in the autumn by <hi rend="italic">Vane’s Story, and
                    other Poems,</hi> and in the following year by <hi rend="italic">Essays and
                    Phantasies.</hi> All his best work was produced between 1855 and 1875 (“The Doom
                    of a City,” 1857; “Our Ladies of Death,” 1861; <hi rend="italic">Weddah and
                    Om-el-Bonain∙.</hi> “The Naked Goddess,” 1866-7; <hi rend="italic">The City of
                    Dreadful Night,</hi> 1870-74). In his latter years Thomson too often sought
                    refuge from his misery of mind and body in the Lethe of opium and alcohol. His
                    mortal illness came upon him in the house of a poet friend; and he was conveyed
                    to University College hospital, in Gower Street, where shortly after he died
                    (June 3, 1882). He was buried at Highgate cemetery, in the same grave, in
                    unconsecrated ground, as his friend Austin Holyoake.</p>
                <p>To the productions of James Thomson already mentioned may be added the posthumous
                    volume entitled <hi rend="italic">A Voice from the File, and other Poems</hi>
                    (1884), which has the advantage of Mr Bertram Dobell’s valuable prefatory memoir
                    and an etched portrait of the poet. This volume contains much that is
                    interesting, but nothing to increase Thomson’s reputation. If an attempt be made
                    to point to the most apparent literary relationship of the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">The City of Dreadful Night,</hi> one might venture the suggestion
                    that James Thomson was a younger brother of De Quincey. If he has distinct
                    affinity to any writer it is to the author of <hi rend="italic">Suspiria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Profundis</hi>; if we look further
                    afield, we might perhaps discern shadowy prototypes in Leopardi, Heine, and
                    Baudelaire. But, after all, Thomson holds so unique a place as a poet that the
                    effort at classification may well be dispensed with. If he maintains his own
                    lonely little height, it will be as a distinct individuality. His, it is
                    absolutely certain, was no literary pessimism, no assumed gloom. The poem
                    “Insomnia” is a distinct chapter of biography; anil in “Mater Tenebrarum” and
                    elsewhere among his writings self-revelative passages are frequent. The merits
                    of Thomson’s poetry are its imaginative power, its sombre intensity, its
                    sonorous music; to these characteristics may be added, in his lighter pieces, a
                    Heine-like admixture of strange gaiety, pathos, and caustic irony. Much the same
                    may be said of his best prose. His faults are a monotony of epithet, the not
                    infrequent use of mere rhetoric and verbiage, and perhaps a prevailing lack of
                    the sense of form; to these may be added an occasional vulgar recklessness of
                    expression, as in parts of <hi rend="italic">Vane’s Story</hi> and in some of
                    his prose writings. Time will reduce his noteworthy work within a narrow
                    compass, but within that limit it will be found as remarkable as it is
                    unique.</p>
