                    and, to quote the translation of part of the passage in Willughby’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Ornithology</hi> (p. 129), “there is no bird secures her young
                    ones better from the <hi rend="italic">Monkeys,</hi> which are very noisom to
                    the young of most Birds. For when she perceives the approach of those Enemies,
                    she so settles her self in her Nest as to put her Bill out at the hole, and
                    gives the <hi rend="italic">Monkeys</hi> such a welcom therewith, that they
                    presently pack away, and glad they scape so.” Indeed, so remarkable a bird must
                    have attracted the notice of the earliest European invaders of America, the more
                    so since its gaudy plumage was used by the natives in the decoration of their
                    persons and weapons. In 1555 Belon <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Nat. Oyseaux,</hi>
                    p. 184) gave a characteristic figure of its beak, and in 1558 Thevet <hi
                    rend="italic">(Singularitez de la France Antarctique,</hi> pp. 88-90) a somewhat
                    long description, together with a woodcut (in some respects inaccurate, but
                    quite unmistakable) of the whole bird, under the name of “Toucan,” which he was
                    the first to publish. In 1560 Gesner <hi rend="italic">(Icones Avium,</hi> p.
                    130) gave a far better figure (though still somewhat incorrect) from a drawing
                    received from Ferrerius, and suggested that from the size of its beak the bird
                    should be called <hi rend="italic">Burhynchus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ramphestes.</hi> This figure, with a copy of Thevet’s and a detailed
                    description, was repeated in the posthumous edition (1585) of his larger work
                    (pp. 800, 801). By 1579 Ambroise Paré <hi rend="italic">(Oeuvres,</hi> ed.
                    Malgaigne, iii. p. 783) had dissected a Toucan that belonged to Charles IX. of
                    France, and about the same time Léry <hi rend="italic">(Voyage fait en la Terre
                    du Bresil,</hi> chap. xi.), whose chief object seems to have been to confute
                    Thevet, confirmed that writer’s account of this bird in most respects. In 1599
                    Aldrovandus <hi rend="italic">(Ornithologia,</hi> i. pp. 801-803), always ready
                    to profit by Gesner’s information, and generally without acknowledgment, again
                    described and repeated the former figures of the bird; but he corrupted his
                    predecessor’s <hi rend="italic">Ramphestes</hi> (which was nearly right) into
                    <hi rend="italic">Ramphastos,</hi> and in this incorrect form the name, which
                    should certainly be <hi rend="italic">Rhamphestes</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rham-phastas,</hi> was subsequently adopted by Linnaeus and has since been
                    recognized by systematists. Into the rest of the early history of the Toucan’s
                    discovery it is needless to go.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>One point of some interest may, however, be noticed. In 1705
                    Plot (<hi rend="italic">N. H. Oxfordshire,</hi> p. 182) recorded a Toucan found
                    within two miles of Oxford in 1644, the body of which was given to the
                    repository in the medical school of that university, where, he said, “it is
                    still to be seen.” Already in 1700 Leigh in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lancashire</hi> (i. p. 195, Birds, tab. 1, fig. 2) had figured another which
                    had been found dead on the coast of that county about two years before. The bird
                    is easily kept in captivity, and no doubt from early times many were brought
                    alive to Europe. Besides the one dissected by Pare, as above mentioned, Joh.
                    Faber, in his additions to Hernandez’s work on the Natural History of Mexico
                    (1651), figures (p. 697) one seen and described by Puteus (Dal Pozzo) at
                    Fontainebleau.</p></note> Additional particulars were supplied by many
                    succeeding writers, until in 1834 Gould completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monograph</hi> of the family<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Of this the brothers Sturm in 1841 published at Nuremberg a
                    German version.</p></note> (with an anatomical appendix by Sir R. Owen), to
                    which, in 1835, he added some supplementary plates; and in 1854 he finished a
                    second and much improved edition. The latest systematic compendium on Toucans is
                    Cassin’s “Study of the Ramphastidae,” in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>
                    of the Philadelphia Academy for 1867 (pp. 100-124).</p>
                <p>By recent systematists 5 genera and from 50 to 60 species of the Family are
                    recognized; but the characters of the former have never been satisfactorily
                    defined, much less those of numerous subdivisions which it has pleased some
                    writers to invent. There can be little doubt that the bird first figured and
                    described by the earliest authors above named is the <hi rend="italic">R.
                    toco</hi> of nearly all ornithologists, and as such is properly regarded as the
                    type of the genus and therefore of the Family. It is one of the largest,
                    measuring 2 feet in length, and has a wide range throughout Guiana and a great
                    part of Brazil. The huge beak, looking like the great claw of a lobster, more
                    than 8 inches long and 3 high at the base, is of a deep orange colour, with a
                    large black oval spot near the tip. The eye, with its double iris of green and
                    yellow, has a broad blue orbit, and is surrounded by a bare space of deep orange
                    skin. The plumage generally is black, but the throat is white, tinged with
                    yellow and commonly edged beneath with red; the upper tail-coverts are white,
                    and the lower scarlet. In other species of the genus, 14 to 17 in number, the
                    bill is mostly particoloured—green, yellow, red, chestnut, blue, and black
                    variously combining so as often to form a ready diagnosis; but some of these
                    tints are very fleeting and often leave little or no trace after death.
                    Alternations of the brighter colours are also displayed in the feathers of the
                    throat, breast, and tail-coverts, so as to be in like manner characteristic of
                    the species, and in several the bare space round the eye is yellow, green, blue,
                    or lilac. The sexes are almost alike in coloration, and externally differ
                    chiefly in size, the males being largest. The tail is nearly square or
                    moderately rounded. In the genus <hi rend="italic">Pteroglossus,</hi> the
                    “Aracaris” (pronounced Arassarí), the sexes more or less differ in appearance,
                    and the tail is graduated. The species are smaller in size, and nearly all are
                    banded on the belly, which is generally yellow, with black and scarlet, while
                    except in two the throat of the males at least is black. One of the most
                    remarkable and beautiful is <hi rend="italic">P. beauharnaisi,</hi> by some
                    authors placed in a distinct genus and called <hi rend="italic">Beauharnaisius
                    ulocomus.</hi> In this the feathers of the top of the head are very singular,
                    looking like glossy curled shavings of black horn or whalebone, the effect being
                    due to the dilatation of the shaft and its coalescence with the consolidated
                    barbs. Some of the feathers of the straw-coloured throat and cheeks partake of
                    the same structure, but in a less degree, while the subterminal part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lamina</hi> is of a lustrous pearly-white.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This curious peculiarity naturally attracted
                    the notice of the first discoverer of the species, Poeppig, who briefly
                    described it in a letter published in Froriep’s <hi rend="italic">Notizen</hi>
                    (xxxii. p. 146) for December 1831.</p></note> The beak is richly coloured, being
                    green and crimson above and lemon below. The upper plumage generally is dark
                    green, but the mantle and rump are crimson, as are a broad abdominal belt, the
                    flanks, and many crescentic markings on the otherwise yellow lower parts.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Readers of Mr Bates’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Naturalist on the River Amazons</hi> will recollect the account
                    (ii. p. 344) and illustration there given of his encounter with a flock of this
                    species of Toucan. His remarks on the other species with which he met are also
                    excellent.</p></note> The group or genus <hi rend="italic">Selenodera,</hi>
                    proposed by Gould in 1837 (<hi rend="italic">Icones Avium,</hi> pt. 1), contains
                    some 6 or 7 species, having the beak, which is mostly transversely striped, and
                    tail shorter than in <hi rend="italic">Pteroglossus.</hi> Here the sexes also
                    differ in coloration, the males having the head and breast black, and the
                    females the same parts chestnut; but all have a yellow nuchal crescent (whence
                    the name of the group). The so-called Hill-Toucans have been separated as
                    another genus, <hi rend="italic">Andigena,</hi> and consist of some 5 or 6
                    species chiefly frequenting the slopes of the Andes and reaching an elevation of
                    10,000 feet, though one, often placed among them, but perhaps belonging rather
                    to <hi rend="italic">Pteroglossus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">A. bailloni,</hi>
                    remarkable for its yellow-orange head, neck, and lower parts, inhabits the
                    lowlands of southern Brazil. Another very singular form is <hi rend="italic">A.
                    laminirostris,</hi> which has affixed on either side of the maxilla, near the
                    base, a quadrangular ivory-like plate, forming a feature unique in this or
                    almost in any Family of Birds. The group <hi rend="italic">Aulaco-rhamphus,</hi>
                    or “Groove-bills,” with a considerable but rather uncertain number of species,
                    contains the rest of the Toucans.</p>
                <p>The monstrous serrated bill that so many Toucans possess was by Buffon, after his
                    manner, accounted a grave defect of Nature, and it must be confessed that no one
                    has given what seems to be a satisfactory explanation of its precise use, though
                    on evolutionary principles none will now doubt its fitness to the bird’s
                    requirements. Solid as it looks, its weight is inconsiderable, and the perfect
                    hinge by which the maxilla is articulated adds to its efficiency as an
                    instrument of prehension. Swainson (<hi rend="italic">Classif. Birds,</hi> ii.
                    p. 138) imagined it merely “to contain an infinity of nerves, disposed like
                    net-work, all of which lead immediately to the nostrils,” and add to the
                    olfactory faculty. This notion seems to be borrowed from Trail <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Trans. Linn. Society,</hi> xi. p. 289), who admittedly had it from Waterton,
                    and stated that it was “an admirable contrivance of nature to increase the
                    delicacy of the organ of smell;” but Sir R. Owen’s description shews this view
                    to be groundless, and he attributes the extraordinary development of the
                    Toucan’s beak to the need of compensating, by the additional power of
                    mastication thus given, for the absence of any of the grinding structures that
                    are so characteristic of the intestinal tract of vegetable-eating birds—its
                    digestive organs possessing a general simplicity of formation. The question is
                    one worth deciding, and would not be difficult to decide by those who have the
                    opportunity. The nostrils are placed so as to be in most <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0497-0478"/> forms invisible until sought, being obscured by
                    the frontal feathers or the backward prolongation of the horny sheath of the
                    beak. The wings are somewhat feeble, and the legs have the toes placed in pairs,
                    two before and two behind. The tail is capable of free vertical motion, and
                    controlled by strong muscles, so that, at least in the true Toucans, when the
                    bird is preparing to sleep, it is reverted and lies almost flat on the back, on
                    which also the huge bill reposes, pointing in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>As may be inferred from the foregoing, the Toucans are a Neotropical form, and by
                    far the greater number inhabit the northern part of South America, especially
                    Guiana and the valley of the Amazons. Some three species occur in Mexico, and
                    several in Central America. One, <hi rend="italic">R. vitellinus,</hi> which has
                    its headquarters on the mainland, is said to be common in Trinidad, but none are
                    found in the Antilles proper. The precise place of the Family in the
                    heterogeneous group <hi rend="italic">Picariae</hi> cannot yet be determined.
                    Its nearest allies perhaps exist among the <hi rend="italic">Capitonidae</hi>;
                    but none of them are believed to have the long feather-like tongue which is so
                    characteristic of the Toucans, and is, so far as known, possessed besides only
                    by the <hi rend="italic">Momotidae (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Motmot,</hi>
                    vol. xvii. p. 3). But of these last there is no reason to deem the Toucans close
                    relatives, and, according to Swainson <hi rend="italic">(ut supra,</hi> p. 141),
                    who had opportunities of observing both, the alleged resemblance in their habits
                    has no existence. Those of the Toucans in confinement have been well described
                    by Broderip and Vigors <hi rend="italic">(Zool. Journal,</hi> i. p. 484; ii. p.
                    478), and indeed may be partially observed in many zoological gardens. Though
                    feeding mainly on fruits, little seems amiss to them, and they swallow grubs,
                    reptiles, and small birds with avidity. They are said to nest in hollow trees,
                    and to lay white eggs. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
