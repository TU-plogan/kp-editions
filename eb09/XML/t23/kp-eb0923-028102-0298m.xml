                    later.” She was one of a large family—eight sons and three daughters. Her father
                    was a Spanish gentleman of good family, whose time was chiefly occupied with
                    devotional reading and works of charity. Teresa’s mother, his second wife, was a
                    beautiful woman, confined generally to a sofa by delicate health. From her her
                    daughter appears to have inherited both delicacy of health and a remarkably
                    susceptible imagination. She delighted in the books of knight-errantry which
                    abounded in the library, and her children sat up at night in their nursery -over
                    the same romances. But Teresa’s imagination was judiciously diverted by her
                    father to another form of heroism. She was soon as deep in the histories of the
                    martyrs as she had been in the tales of chivalry. She learned from these
                    histories that martyrs passed straight to heaven without any detention in
                    purgatory; and, being eminently practical as well as imaginative, she resolved
                    to secure that blessing for herself. When she was seven years old, she started
                    off with her little brother to go and seek martyrdom in the country of the
                    Moors. They had reached the bridge on the stream which runs through the town,
                    when an uncle met them and brought them back. Balked thus of their desire, they
                    played at hermits, making themselves cells in the garden, and giving away their
                    pocket-money to beggars. Teresa lost her mother early, and as she grew up the
                    vanities and flirtations of a pretty girl took the place of these pious
                    imaginations. Her father deemed it best to send her to be educated in an
                    Augustinian convent in the town, but without any thoughts of her adopting a
                    religions life. She would probably have married like her sisters, had it not
                    been for an attack of illness. She was sent away for change of air on a visit to
                    one of her sisters, and on her way home spent some days with a saintly uncle,
                    who was on the eve of entering a monastery, and who strongly urged her to
                    withdraw from the world. Her father was greatly opposed to the step, but Teresa
                    was not to be turned from what she conceived to be her duty. She was only
                    eighteen when she left home one morning, and applied for admission at the
                    Carmelite convent of the Incarnation. She was disappointed at first at the
                    slackness of discipline. The sisters mixed freely in the society of Avila,
                    receiving visits and returning them, and often absenting themselves from the
                    cloister for months at a time. For the first three years she was constantly
                    subject to attacks of sickness, fainting fits, and paroxysms of pain, but she
                    prayed to St Joseph, after which she became comparatively better, though her
                    nervous system was completely shaken. But she appears afterwards to have
                    accommodated herself with tolerable success to the worldliness of her
                    environment, though not without intervals of religious misgiving. “For twenty
                    years,” she says, “I was tossed about on a stormy sea in a wretched condition,
                    for, if I had small content in the world, in God I had no pleasure. At prayer
                    time I watched for the clock to strike the end of the hour. To go to the oratory
                    was a vexation to me, and prayer itself a constant effort.” At one time she
                    abandoned prayer altogether, as she found it impossible to fix her thoughts, and
                    she abhorred the hypocrisy of mechanically repeating a form of words. It was in
                    the year 1554 (her noviciate dated from 1534), when she was thus nearly forty,
                    that the event known as her conversion took place, and the second part of her
                    life began. The death of her father roused her to serious reflexion, and one
                    day, as she entered the oratory, she was struck by the image of the wounded
                    Christ, placed there for an approaching festival. The blood was depicted as
                    streaming over the face from the thorns and running from the side and the hands
                    and feet. The spectacle of suffering pierced Teresa’s breast; she fell in tears
                    at the feet of the figure, and felt every worldly emotion die within her. The
                    shock threw her into a trance, and these trances, accompanied by visions,
                    recurred frequently in the subsequent part of her life. They have since been
                    adduced as Divine attestations of her saintship, but the sisterhood in the
                    convent set them down to possession by a devil; her new departure was due in
                    their eyes to no worthier motive than the desire to be peculiar and to be
                    reputed better than other people. Teresa herself was very humble, and thought
                    their explanation might be true; she took her case to her confessor and to the
                    provincial-general of the Jesuits. The latter put her under a course of
                    discipline: she was to flog herself with a whip of nettles, to wear a haircloth
                    plaited with broken wires that would tear the skin, and to meditate daily on the
                    details of Christ’s passion. One day, while thus occupied, her trance came upon
                    her, and she heard a voice say, “Thou shalt have no more converse with men, but
                    with angels.” After this the trance or fit always returned when she was at
                    prayers, and she felt that Christ was close to her. Presently she was able to
                    see him, “exactly as he was painted rising from the sepulchre.” Her confessor
                    directed her to exorcise the figure, and she obeyed with pain, but, it is
                    needless to say, in vain. The visions grew more and more vivid. The cross of her
                    rosary was snatched from her hand one day, and when returned it was made of
                    jewels more brilliant than diamonds, visible, however, to her alone. She had
                    often an acute pain in her side, and fancied that an angel came to her with a
                    lance tipped with fire, which he struck into her heart. The 27th of August is
                    kept sacred in Spain to this mystery, which has also formed a favourite subject
                    of Spanish painters; it forms the frontispiece of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0299-0282"/> the biography which is put into the hands of
                    Catholics. She had also visions of another description: she was shown hell with
                    its horrors, and the devil would sit upon her breviary, belabour her with blows,
                    and fill her cell with imps. For several years these experiences continued, and
                    the verdict as to their source still remained far from unanimous. Meanwhile, on
                    the broad stage of the world, the Reformation continued to spread and establish
                    itself; and this great falling away became the subject of much searching of
                    hearts to pious Catholics. Teresa reflected like the rest, and her experience
                    led her to find the real cause of the catastrophe in the relaxation of
                    discipline within the religious orders. If the ancient rules could be restored,
                    it appeared to her that the evil might be stemmed; and she formed the project of
                    founding a house in which all the original rules of the Carmelite order before
                    its relaxation would be observed. She met, not unnaturally, with great
                    opposition from the authorities of the order, and in particular from the
                    prioress and sisters of the Incarnation, who looked upon the step as a reflexion
                    upon themselves. Nevertheless, she persevered with her scheme, being encouraged
                    to appeal to the pope by certain priests who saw the benefit which would accrue
                    to the church from her zeal. A private house in Avila was secretly got ready to
                    serve as a small convent, and, when the bull arrived from Rome, Teresa went out
                    on leave from the Incarnation and installed four poor women in the new house
                    dedicated to her patron St Joseph. It was on the 24th of August 1562 that mass
                    was said in the little chapel and the new order constituted. It was to be an
                    prder of Descalzos or Barefoots, in opposition to the relaxed parent body, the
                    Calzados. The sisters were not to be literally shoeless, but to wear sandals of
                    rope; they were to sleep on straw, to eat no meat, to be strictly confined to
                    the cloister, and to live on alms without regular endowment. After lodging her
                    four sisters, Teresa returned to the Incarnation, as in duty bound; but, when
                    the secret was discovered, Carmelites and townspeople were alike furious.
                    Violence, however, was prevented, and the matter was referred to the council of
                    state at Madrid. Philip II. referred it again to the pope, and after six months
                    a fresh bull arrived from Pius V. The provincial of her order now gave her leave
                    to remove and take charge of her sisterhood. The number of thirteen, to which on
                    grounds of discipline she had limited the foundation, was soon filled up, and
                    Teresa spent here the five happiest years of her life. Her visions continued,
                    and, by command of her ecclesiastical superiors, she wrote her autobiography
                    containing a full account of these experiences. She herself, however, profoundly
                    as she believed in their reality, saw the danger which attaches to such
                    experiences, and was far from basing any claim to holiness upon them. One of her
                    visions about this time is interesting as illustrating what is called her
                    mysticism. She fancied that she was a mirror without frame and without
                    dimensions, with Christ shining in the centre of it, and the mirror itself, she
                    knew not how, was in Christ. Teresa was now encouraged to carry her work still
                    further, for the church was girding itself to the work of the
                    Counter-Reformation. The general of the order visited her at Avila, and gave her
                    powers to found other houses of Descalzos, for men as well as women. The last
                    fifteen years of her life were spent mainly in journeys with this end and in the
                    continually growing labour of organization. She travelled in a rude cart in all
                    weathers, and the story of her hardships and misadventures impresses us with the
                    strength of will that animated her old and shaken frame. Convents were founded
                    at Medina, Malaga, Valladolid, Toledo, Segovia, and Salamanca, and two at Alva
                    under the patronage of the famous duke. Then she had three years of rest, as
                    prioress of her old convent of the Incarnation. She next went to Seville to
                    found a house, thus overstepping for the first time the boundaries of the
                    Castiles, to which her authorization limited her. The latent hostility of the
                    old order was aroused; the general ordered the immediate suppression of the
                    house at Seville, and procured a bull from Gregory XIII. prohibiting the further
                    extension of the reformed houses (1575). But the movement against her came from
                    Italy, and was resented by Philip and the Spanish authorities as undue
                    interference; and, after a fierce struggle, during which Teresa was two years
                    under arrest at Toledo, the Carmelites were divided into two bodies in 1580, and
                    the Descalzos obtained the right to elect their own provincial-generals (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carmelites).</hi> The few remaining years of Teresa’s life were
                    spent in the old way, organizing the order she had founded, and travelling about
                    to open new convents. Sixteen convents and fourteen monasteries were founded by
                    her efforts; she wrote a history of her foundations, which forms a supplement to
                    her autobiography. At Burgos, during the whole of a wet autumn and winter, she
                    endured terrible privations. Her own nuns, too, were not always as single-minded
                    and obedient as the ideal sisterhood of her hopes had been. Those at St Joseph
                    in Avila mutinied for a meat diet; the prioress at Medina answered her
                    impertinently. Her last journey of inspection was cut short at Alva, where she
                    died on the 29th of September 1582, and was laid in her first, but not her last,
                    resting-place. A violet odour and a fragrant oil were said to distil from her
                    tomb; and when it was opened nine months afterwards the flesh was found
                    uncorrupted. A hand cut off by a fervent brother was found to work miracles, and
                    the order became convinced that their founder had been a saint. It was resolved
                    in 1585 to remove her remains to Avila, where she was born, the sisters at Alva
                    being consoled by permission to retain the mutilated arm. But the family of the
                    duke of Alva procured an order from the pope enjoining that the body should be
                    restored to Alva, and she was accordingly laid there once more in a splendid
                    tomb. But even then she was not allowed to rest: she was again disentombed, to
                    be laid in a more magnificent coffin, and the greed of reverential relic-seekers
                    made unseemly havoc of her bones.</p>
                <p>Teresa was canonized by Gregory XV. in 1622. The honour was doubtless largely due
                    to her asceticism and mystic visions. She called herself Teresa de Jesus, to
                    signify the closeness of her relation to the heavenly Bridegroom, who directed
                    all her actions. Though she deprecated excess of ascetic severity in others, she
                    scourged herself habitually, and wore a peculiarly painful haircloth. But her
                    life shows her to have been, besides, a woman of strong practicality and good
                    sense, full of natural shrewdness, and with unusual powers of organization. “You
                    deceived me in saying she was a woman,” writes one of her confessors; “she is a
                    bearded man.” She was brave in the face of difficulties and dangers, pure in her
                    motives, and her utterances, some of which have been quoted, have the true
                    ethical ring about them. Her MSS. were collected by Philip II. and placed in a
                    rich case in the Escorial, the key of which the king carried about with him.
                    Besides her autobiography and the history of her foundations, her works (all
                    written in Spanish) contain a great number of letters and various treatises of
                    mystical religion, the chief of which are <hi rend="italic">The Way of
                    Perfection</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Castle of the Soul.</hi> Both describe
                    the progress of the soul towards perfect union with God.</p>
                <p>Her works, edited by two Dominicans, were first published in 1587, and have since
                    appeared in various editions. They were soon afterwards translated into Italian,
                    French, and Latin; an English translation of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and
                    works (except the letters) by A. woodhead appeared in 1669. More recently
                    various translations of the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> have appeared,—by John
                    Dalton (1851), who also translated the <hi rend="italic">Way of Perfection,</hi>
                    and by David Lewis (1870), followed in 1871 by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foundations</hi> from the same hand. Biographies appeared soon after her death
                    by the Jesuit Ribera, who bad been her confessor (1602), and by Diego de Yepez,
                    confessor to Philip II. (1599). Details are also given in Ribadeneyra's <hi
                    rend="italic">Flos Sanctorum</hi> and in Alban Butler’s <hi rend="italic">Lives
                    of the Saints.</hi> A separate biography, with preface by Archbishop Manning,
                    appeared in 1865, and an interesting and sympathetic account of her life is
                    given in the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi> for October 1883. (A.
