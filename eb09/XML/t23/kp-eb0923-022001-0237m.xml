                    generally called the Isis, a usage to which Camden perhaps gave currency, who
                    derives the word Tamesis or Thames from the junction of the names of the two
                    rivers, the Thame and Isis. The total length of the river from Thames Head to
                    London Bridge is 170 miles, and to Sheerness 228 miles. It drains an area of
                    6100 miles. It becomes navigable 24 miles from its source, near Lechlade, its
                    waters having been greatly augmented by the junction of the Colne, Leach, and
                    Churn; here also is the junction with the Thames and Severn Canal. The height of
                    its source above sea-level is 370 feet, and that of the stream at Lechlade 250
                    feet, the average fall between Lechlade and London Bridge (146 miles) being 21
                    inches per mile. The course is remarkably equable throughout. Above Teddington,
                    19 miles from London Bridge, the tidal wave may be said to cease, and thence up
                    to Lechlade navigation is carried on by the aid of locks. A small steamer plies
                    as high as Oxford. While at Lechlade the daily flow of the ordinary summer level
                    is about 100 million gallons, the flow at Teddington is about 380 million
                    gallons. There are seven hours of ebb tide and five hours of flow tide. From the
                    Nore to London Bridge, a distance of 40 miles, the tidal wave travels in two
                    hours, and in other two hours it reaches Teddington. The width of the river at
                    Teddington is 250 feet, and at London Bridge the width at high tide is 800 feet,
                    the depth being 30 feet, while at low tide the width is 650 feet and the depth
                    12 feet. Large barges can ascend the river 150 miles above London Bridge,
                    vessels of 200 tons as high as the bridge, and of 400 tons to the Pool, below
                    which, at Irongate and St Katherine’s wharf, deep-sea steamer navigation
                    commences, while vessels of any tonnage can come as high as Deptford.</p>
                <p>The Thames leaves the Gloucestershire and Wiltshire border near Buscot, after
                    which it separates successively Berks and Oxford, Berks and Bucks, Middlesex and
                    Surrey, and, finally, at its estuary, Essex and Kent. Below Lechlade it has a
                    winding course, passing near Farringdon and Bampton. After receiving the
                    Windrush, it passes near the grounds of Blenheim, whence it receives from the
                    left the Evenlode, and at Oxford it receives from the left the Cherwell. It then
                    flows in a southerly direction to Abingdon, where it receives on the right the
                    Ock from the valley of the White Horse, and has a junction with the Wilts and
                    Berks Canal. Turning in an easterly direction it is joined, about a mile after
                    passing Dorchester, by its principal affluent the Thame. Thence, through an
                    opening of the Chiltern Hills, it passes Bensington, and turns southwards by
                    Wallingford and Reading, where it receives the Kennet from the right. It then
                    bends northward to Henley, eastward to Great Marlow, and southward to
                    Maidenhead, where it receives from the right the Loddon. Winding in
                    a-βouth-eastβrly direction it passes Eton, Windsor, Datchet, Staines, and
                    Chertsey, receiving at Staines the Colne from the left. Flowing through the
                    grounds of Hampton Court it reaches Kingston and Teddington, where its bulk is
                    increased by the tidal λvave. From Richmond, where it receives the Mole, it
                    begins to pass the villas and suburbs of London. At Gravesend, 27 miles below
                    London, it has a width of half a mile, and at the Nore lighthouse, 50 miles
                    below London Bridge, the estuary widens to nearly 10 miles. In the tidal reaches
                    the principal affluents of the Thames are the Mole at Richmond, the Brent at
                    Brentford, the Wandle at Wandsworth, the Lea at Blackwall, the Roding at Barking
                    Creek, the Ingrebourne at Rainham, and the Medway at Sheerness. The land
                    adjoining the river is greatly subject to floods, and from above London there
                    were in ancient times wide stretches of marsh land covered by shallow lagoons.
                    The embankments below London Bridge date possibly from the time of the Romans,
                    but their origin is the subject of much dispute (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >London,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 840). Between London Bridge and Chelsea the bed of
                    the river has been altered artificially, and flooding is prevented by a marine
                    wall (see <hi rend="smallcaps">London,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 823). The Thames
                    occupies the bed of a much larger prehistoric river, the gravels of which adjoin
                    its banks at a considerable distance.</p>
                <p>The scenery, though scarcely to be called picturesque, and in a certain sense
                    monotonous, has a peculiar charm from the richness of its sylvan beauty and its
                    pleasant alternation of hill and dale. The number of islands that occur in the
                    course of the river add to its interest, and afford convenient seclusion for the
                    erection of boathouses and tents. The Thames vies with the Tyne as the principal
                    river for boat-racing in England, and of course greatly surpasses the latter
                    river as regards amateur boat-racing, the principal fixtures in which are the
                    Oxford and Cambridge boat race and the Henley regatta. The river affords about
                    one half of the water supply of London, and is the principal outlet for its
                    sewage. It is under the government of conservators, originally constituted in
                    1857, but their duties have been extended by several subsequent Acts.</p>
