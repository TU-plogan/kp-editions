                    <hi rend="italic">(ή</hi> Tρῳἁς), or land of Troy, is the north-western
                    promontory of Asia Minor. The name “Troad” is never used by Homer,—who calls the
                    land, like the city, T <hi rend="italic">ροίη,—</hi> but is already known to
                    Herodotus. The Troad is bounded on the north by the Hellespont and the
                    westernmost part of the Propontis, on the west by the Aegean Sea, and on the
                    south by the Gulf of Adramyttium. The eastern limit was variously defined by
                    ancient writers. In the widest acceptation, the Troad was identified with the
                    whole of western and southwestern Mysia, from the Aesepus, which flows into the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n599/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0599-0578"/> Propontis a little west of Cyzicus, to the
                    Caicus, which flows into the Aegean south of Atarneus. But the true eastern
                    boundary is undoubtedly the range of Ida, which, starting from near the
                    south-east angle of the Adramyttian Gulf, sends its north-western spurs nearly
                    to the coast of the Propontis, in the region west of the Aesepus and east of the
                    Granicus. Taking Ida for the eastern limit, we have the definition which, as
                    Strabo says, best corresponds with the actual usage of the name Troad. Ida is
                    the key to the physical geography of the whole region; and it is the peculiar
                    character which this mountain-system imparts to the land west of it that
                    constitutes the real distinctness of the Troad from the rest of Mysia. Nature
                    has here provided Asia Minor with an outwork against invaders from the
                    north-west; and as in the dawn of Greek legend the Troad is the scene of the
                    struggle between Agamemnon and Priam, so it was in the Troad that Alexander won
                    the battle which opened a path for his further advance.</p>
                <p>The length of the Troad from north to south—taking a straight line from the
                    north-west point, Cape Sigeum (Yeni Shehr), to the south-west point, Cape Lectum
                    (Babà-Calessi) —may be roughly given as forty miles. The breadth, from the
                    middle point of the west coast to the main range of Ida, is not much greater.
                    The whole central portion of this area is drained by the Mendere (the ancient
                    Scamander), which rises in Ida and is by far the most important river of the
                    Troad. The basin of the Mendere is divided by hills into two distinct parts, a
                    southern and a northern plain. The southern—anciently called the Samonian plain
                    —is the great central plain of the Troad, and takes its modern name from
                    Bairamitch, the chief Turkish town, which is situated in the eastern part of it
                    near Ida. It is of an elongated form, the extent from north to south being large
                    in proportion to the average width, and is enclosed by hills which, especially
                    towards the south, are low and undulating. From the north end of the plain of
                    Bairamitch the Mendere winds in large curves through deep gorges in metamorphic
                    rocks, and issues into the northern plain, stretching to the Hellespont. This is
                    the plain of Troy, which has an average length of seven or eight miles from
                    north to south, with a breadth of some two or three from east to west. The hills
                    which enclose it on the south and east are quite low, and towards the east the
                    acclivities are in places so gentle as to leave the limits of the plain somewhat
                    indefinite. Next to the basin of the Mendere, with its two plains, the best
                    marked feature in the riversystem of the Troad is the valley of the Touzla, the
                    ancient Satniois. The Touzla rises in the western part of Mount Ida, south of
                    the plain of Bairamitch, from which its valley is divided by hills; and, after
                    flowing for many miles almost parallel with the south coast of the Troad, from
                    which, at Assus, it is less than a mile distant, it enters the Aegean about ten
                    miles north of Cape Lectum. Three alluvial plains are comprised in its course.
                    The easternmost of these, into which the river issues from rugged mountains of
                    considerable height, is long and narrow. The next is the broad plain, which is
                    overlooked by the lofty site of Assus, and which was a fertile source of supply
                    to that city. The third is the plain at the embouchure of the river on the west
                    coast. This was anciently called the Halesian (Άλ <hi rend="italic">ήσιον</hi>)
                    plain, partly from the maritime salt-works at Tragasae, near the town of
                    Hamaxitus, partly also from the hot salt-springs which exist at some distance
                    from the sea, on the north side of the river, where large formations of
                    rock-salt are also found. Maritime salt-works are still in operation at the
                    mouth of the river, and its modern name (Touzla = salt) preserves the ancient
                    association. A striking feature of the southern Troad is the high and narrow
                    plateau which runs parallel with the Adramyttian Gulf from east to west, forming
                    a southern barrier to the valley of the Touzla, and walling it off from a thin
                    strip of seaboard. This plateau seems to have been formed by a volcanic upheaval
                    which came late in the Tertiary period, and covered the limestone of the south
                    coast with two successive flows of trachyte. The lofty crag of Assus, washed by
                    the sea, is like a tower standing detached from this line of mountainwall. The
                    western coast is of a different character. North of the Touzla extends an
                    undulating plain, narrow at first, but gradually widening. Much of it is covered
                    with the valonia oak <hi rend="italic">(Quercus Aegilops),</hi> one of the most
                    valuable products of the Troad. Towards the middle of the west coast the
                    adjacent ground becomes higher, with steep acclivities, which sometimes rise
                    into peaks; and north of these, again, the seaboard subsides towards Cape Sigeum
                    into rounded hills, mostly low.</p>
                <p>The timber of the Troad is supplied chiefly by the pineforests on the slopes of
                    Mount Ida. But nearly all the plains and hills are more or less well wooded.
                    Besides the valonia oak, the elm, willow, cypress, and tamarisk shrub abound.
                    Lotus, galingale, and reeds are still plentiful, as in Homeric days, about the
                    streams in the Trojan plain. The vine, too, is cultivated, the Turks making from
                    it a kind of syrup and a preserve. In summer and autumn water-melons are among
                    the abundant fruits. Cotton, wheat, and Indian corn are also grown. The Troad
                    is, indeed, a country highly favoured by nature—with its fertile plains and
                    valleys, abundantly and continually irrigated from Ida, its numerous streams,
                    its fine west seaboard, and the beauty of its scenery. Under a good government,
                    it could not fail to be exceedingly prosperous. Under Turkish rule, the natural
                    advantages of the land suffice to mitigate the poverty of the sparse population,
                    but have scarcely any positive result.</p>
                <p>In the Homeric legend, with which the story of the Troad begins, the people
                    called the Troes are ruled by a king Priam, whose realm includes all that is
                    bounded by “Lesbos, Phrygia, and the Hellespont” <hi rend="italic">(Il.,</hi>
                    xxiv. 544), <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, the whole “Troad,” with some extension
                    of it, beyond Ida, on the north-west. According to Homer, the Achaeans under
                    Agamemnon utterly and finally destroyed Troy, the capital of Priam, and
                    overthrew his dynasty. But there is an Homeric prophecy that the rule over the
                    Troes shall be continued by Aeneas and his descendants. From the “Homeric” Hymn
                    to Aphrodite, as well as from a passage in the 20th book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> (75-353)—a passage undoubtedly later than the bulk of
                    the book—it is certain that in the seventh or sixth century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> a dynasty claiming descent from Aeneas reigned in the Troad, though
                    the extent of their sway is unknown. The Homeric tale of Troy is a poetic
                    creation, for which the poet is the sole witness. The analogy of the French
                    legends of Charlemagne warrants the supposition that an Achaean prince once held
                    a position like that of Agamemnon. We may suppose that some memorable capture of
                    a town in the Troad had been made by Greek warriors. But we cannot regard the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> in any closer or more exact sense as the historical
                    document of a war. The geographical compactness of the Troad is itself an
                    argument for the truth of the Homeric statement that it was once united under a
                    strong king. How that kingdom was finally broken up is unknown. Thracian hordes,
                    including the Treres, swept into Asia Minor from the north-west about the
                    beginning of the seventh century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and it is
                    probable that, like the Gauls and Goths of later days, these fierce invaders
                    made havoc in the Troad. The Ionian poet Callinus has recorded the terror which
                    they caused further south.</p>
                <p>A new period in the history of the Troad begins with the foundation of the Greek
                    settlements. The earliest <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0600-0579"/> and most important of these were Aeolic. Lesbos
                    and Cyme in Aeolis seem to have been the chief points from which the first
                    Aeolic colonists worked their way into the Troad. Commanding positions on the
                    coast, such as Assus and Sigeum, would naturally be those first occupied; and
                    some of them may have been in the hands of Aeolians as early as the 10th century
                    B.C. It appears from Herodotus (v. 95) that about 620 B.C. Athenians occupied
                    Sigeum, and were resisted by Aeolic colonists from Mytilene in Lesbos, who had
                    already established themselves in that neighbourhood. Struggles of this kind may
                    help to account for the fact noticed by Strabo, that the earlier colonies had
                    often migrated from one site in the Troad to another. Such changes of seat have
                    been, he observes, frequent causes of confusion in the topography; and the fact
                    has an important bearing on attempted identifications of the more obscure
                    ancient sites.</p>
                <p>Among the Greek towns in the Troad, three stand out with especial
                    prominence—Ilium in the north, Assus in the south, and Alexandria Troas in the
                    west. The site of the Greek Ilium is marked by the low mound of Hissarlik
                    (“place of fortresses”) in the Trojan plain, about three miles from the
                    Hellespont. The early Greek settlers in the Troad naturally loved to take
                    Homeric names for their towns. The fact that Homer places the town of Dardania
                    far inland, on the slopes of Ida, did not hinder the founders of the Aeolic
                    Dardanus from giving that name to their town on the shores of the Hellespont.
                    The site of the historical Thymbra, again, cannot be reconciled with that of the
                    Homeric Thymbra. Similarly, the choice of the name Ilion in no way justifies the
                    assumption that the Greek settlers found that spot identified by tradition with
                    the site of the town which Homer calls Ilios. It does not even warrant the
                    hypothesis that they found a shrine of Athene Ilias existing there. For them, it
                    would be enough that the sounding name could be safely appropriated,—the true
                    site of Homeric Ilias being forgotten or disputed,—and that their town was at
                    least in the neighbourhood of the Homeric battlefields. The Greek Ilium may have
                    been founded about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It is noticeable that no
                    ancient writer suggests a later date than the time of Croesus (<hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi>. 550 B.C.); and Strabo says that the establishment of the colony at
                    Hissarlik—after previous occupation of a different site—took place “in the time
                    of the Lydians” (έπί Λυδῶ <hi rend="italic">v</hi>). It would be reasonable to
                    infer that the Greek Ilium preserved some well-marked traces of Lydian
                    influence, perhaps in architecture or art, perhaps in manners or traditions. The
                    traces of Lydian workmanship found in the excavations at Hissarlik are thus
                    easily explained, without recourse to the shadowy hypothesis of a distinct
                    Lydian settlement on the spot. When Xerxes visited the Trojan plain, he “went up
                    to the Pergamon of Priam,” and afterwards sacrificed to the Ilian Athene
                    (Herod., vii. 42). It is doubtful whether the “Pergamon” meant was at the Greek
                    Ilium, or at another site (to be mentioned presently), Bunárbashi; strong
                    reasons in favour of the latter have lately been adduced by Mr George
                    Nikolaides, in his Ίλιάδος <hi rend="italic">Στρατηγική ∆ιaσκεvή.</hi> In the
                    4th century Ilion is mentioned among the towns of the Troad which yielded to
                    Dercyllidas (399 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), and as captured by Charidemus
                    (359 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> It possessed walls, but was a petty place,
                    of little strength. In 344 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Alexander, on landing
                    in the Troad, visited Ilium. In their temple of Athene the Ilians showed him
                    arms which had served in the Trojan war, including the shield of Achilles.
                    Either then, or after the battle of Granicus, Alexander directed that the town
                    should be enlarged, and should have the rank of “city,” with political
                    independence, and exemption from tribute. The battle of Ipsus (301 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) added north-western Asia Minor to the dominions of
                    Lysimachus, who executed the intentions of Alexander. He gave Ilium a wall 5
                    miles in circumference, incorporating with it some decayed towns of the
                    neighbourhood, and built a handsome temple of Athene. In the 3d century B.C.
                    Ilium was the head of a federal league (<hi rend="italic">κοινόν</hi>) of free
                    Greek towns, which probably included the district from Lampsacus on the
                    Hellespont to Gargara on the Adramyttian Gulf. Twice in that century Ilium was
                    visited by Gauls. On the first occasion (278 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) the
                    Gauls, under Lutarius, sought to establish a stronghold at Ilium, but speedily
                    abandoned it as being too weak for their purpose. Forty years later (218 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Gauls were brought over by Attalus I. to help him in
                    his war against Achaeus. After deserting his standard they proceeded to pillage
                    the towns on the Hellespont, and finally besieged Ilium, from which, however,
                    they were driven off by the troops of Alexandria Troas. At the beginning of the
                    2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Ilium was in a state of decay. As
                    Demetrius of Scepsis tells us, the houses “had not even roofs of tiles,” but
                    merely of thatch. Such a loss of prosperity is sufficiently explained by the
                    incursions of the Gauls and the insecure state of the Troad during the latter
                    part of the 3d century. The temple of the Ilian Athene, however, retained its
                    prestige. In 192 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Antiochus the Great visited it
                    before sailing to the aid of the Aetolians. In 190 B.C., shortly before the
                    battle of Magnesia, the Romans came into the Troad. At the moment when a Roman
                    army was entering Asia, it was politic to recall the legend of Roman descent
                    from Aeneas. Lucius Scipio and the Ilians were alike eager to do so. He offered
                    sacrifice to the Ilian Athene; and after the peace with Antiochus (189 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> the Romans annexed Rhoeteum and Gergis to Ilium,
                    “not so much in reward of recent services, as in memory of the source from which
                    their nation sprang.” The later history of Ilium is little more than that of
                    Roman benefits. A disaster befell the place in 85 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> when Fimbria took it, and left it in ruins; but Sulla presently
                    caused it to be rebuilt. Augustus, while confirming its ancient privileges, gave
                    it new territory. Caracalla (211-217 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> visited
                    Ilium, and like Alexander paid honours to the tomb of Achilles. The latest coins
                    found on the site are those of Constantius II. (337-361). In the 4th century, as
                    some rhetorical “Letters” of that age show, the Ilians still did a profitable
                    trade in attracting tourists by their pseudo-Trojan memorials. After the 4th
                    century the place is lost to view. But we find from Constantine Porphyrogenitus
                    (911-959) that in his day it was one of the places in the Troad which gave names
                    to bishoprics.</p>
                <p>While the Greek Ilium at Hissarlik owed its importance to a sham pretension,
                    which amused sight-seers and occasionally served politicians, Assus, on the
                    south coast, has an interest of a more genuine kind, and is, indeed, a better
                    type of ancient town-life in the Troad. Its situation is one of the most
                    magnificent in all the Greek lands. The seaward faces of the isolated and
                    sea-washed rock on which Assus stood are carved to south and south-west into
                    terraces. The natural cleavage of the trachyte into joint planes had already
                    scarped out shelves which it was comparatively easy for human labour to shape;
                    and so, high up on this cone of trachyte, the Greek town of Assus was built,
                    with its colonnades, baths, theatre, its public walks and its monuments of the
                    dead, mounting tier above tier, till the summit of the crag λvas crowned with a
                    Doric temple of Athene. The view from the summit is not only very beautiful but
                    also of great historical interest. In front is Lesbos, one of whose towns,
                    Methymna, is said to have sent forth the founders of Assus, as early, perhaps,
                    as 1000 or 900 B.C. The whole south coast-line of the Troad is seen, and in the
                    south-east the ancient territory <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0601-0580"/> of Pergamum, from whose masters the possession of
                    Assus passed to Rome by the bequest of Attalus III. (133 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> The great heights of Ida rise in the east. Northward the Touzla is
                    seen winding through its rich valley from a rocky defile in the east to the
                    oak-forests in the western hills. This valley was traversed by the road which St
                    Paul must have followed when he came overland from Alexandria Troas to Assus,
                    leaving his fellow-travellers to proceed by sea. The north-west gateway of
                    Assus, to which this road led, is still flanked by two massive towers, of
                    Hellenic work, and of an age which leaves no doubt that they are the same
                    between which St Paul entered the town. On the shore below, the ancient mole at
                    which he embarked for Mytilene with his companions can still be traced by large
                    blocks under the clear water. Assus affords the only harbour on the 50 miles of
                    coast between Cape Lectum and the east end of the Adramyttian Gulf; hence it
                    must always have been the chief shipping-place for the exports of the southern
                    Troad. Too much off the highways to become a centre of import trade, it was thus
                    destined to be a commercial town, content with a modest provincial prosperity.
                    The great natural strength of the site protected it against petty assailants;
                    but, like other towns in that region, it has known many masters,— Lydians,
                    Persians, the kings of Pergamum, Romans, and Ottoman Turks. From the Persian
                    wars to about 350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Assus enjoyed at least partial
                    independence. It was about 348-345 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> that Aristotle
                    spent three years at Assus with Hermeas, an ex-slave who had succeeded his
                    former master Eubulus as despot of Assus and Atarneus. Aristotle has left some
                    verses from an invocation to Arete (Virtue), commemorating the worth of Hermeas,
                    who had been seized by Persian treachery and put to death. Under its Turkish
                    name of Beihram, Assus<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The name Assus probably means “dwelling,” “town,” being connected with the

                    India to Dacia. Homer supplies an example in his “steep Pedasus” on the
                    Satniois, and it has been suggested by Mr J. T. Clarke that Pedasus may have
                    been identical in site with the later Assus.</p></note> is still the commercial
                    port of the southern Troad, being the place to which loads of valonia
                    (acorn-cups for tanning) are conveyed by camels from all parts of the country.
                    The recent excavations at Assus, conducted by explorers representing the
                    Archaeological Institute of America, have yielded results far more valuable for
                    the history of Greek art and architecture than any excavations yet undertaken in
                    the Troad. The sculptures form one of the most important links yet discovered
                    between Oriental and early Greek art, especially in respect of the types of
                    animals. The later Hellenic town-walls of Assus also well repay the new study
                    which they have received. With their ramparts, towers, and posterns they form
                    the finest and most instructive extant specimen of Greek military engineering.
                    The director of the exploration, Mr J. T. Clarke, published in 1882 an excellent
                    report on the work so far as it had then been carried.</p>
                <p>Alexandria Troas stood on the west coast at nearly its middle point, a little
                    south of Tenedos. It was built by Antigonus, perhaps about 310 B.C., and was
                    called by him Antigonia Troas. Early in the next century the name was changed by
                    Lysimachus to Alexandria Troas, in honour of Alexander’s memory. As the chief
                    port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, and
                    the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. The site is now
                    covered with valonia oaks; but the circuit of the old walls can be traced, and
                    in several places they are fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of
                    about 6 English miles, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals.
                    Remains of some ancient buildings, including a bath and gymnasium, can be traced
                    within this area. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand.
                    A Roman colony was sent to the place, as Strabo mentions, in the reign of
                    Augustus. The abridged name “Troas” (Acts xvi. 8) was probably the current one
                    in later Roman times. The site is now called Eski Stambul.</p>
                <p>Many classical sites of less note in the Troad have been identified with more or
                    less certainty. Neandria seems to be rightly fixed by Mr F. Calvert at Mount
                    Chigri, a hill not far from Alexandria Troas, remarkable for the fine view of
                    the whole Troad which it commands. Cebrene has been conjecturally placed in the
                    eastern part of the plain of Bairamitch, Palaescepsis being further east on the
                    slopes of Ida, while the new Scepsis was near the site of Bairamitch itself. The
                    evidence for this, however, is ambiguous. At the village of Kulaklee, a little
                    south of the mouth of the Touzla, some Corinthian columns and other fragments
                    mark the temple of Apollo Smintheus and (approximately) the site of the Homeric
                    Chryse. Colonae was also on the west coast, opposite Tenedos. Scamandria
                    occupied the site of Eneh, in the middle of the plain of Bairamitch, and
                    Cenchreae was probably some distance north of it. The shrine of Palamedes,
                    mentioned by ancient writers as existing at a town called Polymedium, has been
                    discovered by Mr J. T. Clarke on a site hitherto unvisited by any modern
                    traveller, between Assus and Cape Lectum. It proves to have been a sacred
                    enclosure <hi rend="italic">(temenos)</hi> on the acropolis of the town; the
                    statue of Palamedes stood on a rock at the middle of its southern edge. Another
                    interesting discovery has been made by Mr Clarke,—viz., the existence of very
                    ancient town walls on Gargarus, the highest peak of Ida.</p>
                <p>The modern discussion as to the site of Homeric Troy may be considered as dating
                    from Lechevalier’s visits to the Troad in 1785-86. Homer describes Troy as “a
                    great town,” “with broad streets,” and with a high acropolis, or “Pergamus,”
                    rising above it, from which precipitous rocks descend abruptly to the plain
                    beneath. These are the precipices over which the Trojans proposed to hurl the
                    wooden horse, “when they had dragged it to the summit.” Homer marks the
                    character of the acropolis by the epithets “lofty,” “windy,” and more forcibly
                    still by “beetling.” One site in the Trojan plain, and one only, satisfies this
                    most essential condition. It is the hill at its southern edge called the Bali
                    Dagh, above the village of Bunár-bashi. It has a height of about 400 feet, with
                    sheer precipices descending on the south and south-west to the valley of the
                    Scamander (Mendere). Remains found upon it—though it has never yet been
                    thoroughly explored— show it to have been the site of an ancient city. Homer
                    describes two natural springs as rising a little to the north-west of Homeric
                    Troy. A little to the north-west of Bunárbashi these springs still exist. “This
                    pair of rivulets are the immutable mark of nature by which the height towering
                    above is recognized as the citadel of Ilium” (E. Curtius).</p>
                <p>The low mound of Hissarlik—the site of the Greek Ilium—stands only 112 feet above
                    the level of the open plain in which it is situated. To call it “beetling” (ὸ
                    <hi rend="italic">ϕ</hi> ρυόεσσα) would have been a travesty of poetical licence
                    on which no poet could have ventured, and to describe it as “lofty” or “windy”
                    would have been not less strange. There are no natural springs near it, such as
                    Homer mentions. The Aeolic settlers, having called the place Ilion, naturally
                    persisted in maintaining its identity with Troy. Polemon, a native of the Greek
                    Ilium, who lived about 200 B.C., declared that his fellowtownsmen could show the
                    very stone on which Palamedes <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n602/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0602-0581"/> had given lessons in the game of draughts. The
                    only other ancient writer who is known to have admitted the Ilian claim is
                    Hellanicus of Lesbos (c. 482-397 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> who, as Strabo
                    remarks, wished “to gratify the Ilians, as is his wont.” Like the Ilians,
                    Hellanicus was of Aeolian origin; and in compiling the local legends of various
                    places he is known to have been wholly uncritical, merely repeating what was
                    told to him as he had heard it. On the other hand, the claim of the Greek Ilium
                    to stand on the site of Troy was decisively rejected by the general consent of
                    those ancient writers who had any claim to critical authority. The orator
                    Lycurgus (c. 332 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> speaks of the site of Troy as
                    desolate, and this at a moment when the recent visit of Alexander the Great to
                    the Greek Ilium (334 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) had drawn attention to the
                    claim made by its inhabitants. Demetrius, a native of Scepsis in the Troad, who
                    flourished about 160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> wrote a book entitled
                    Τρωϊκός Διάκοσμος (“The Marshalling of the Trojans ”), an exhaustive commentary
                    on the catalogue of the Trojan forces in the second book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> Demetrius knew the topography of the Troad as
                    thoroughly as he knew the text of Homer. The extant notices of his work, which
                    had a great reputation in antiquity, warrant the belief that he was not only
                    learned but acute. In the <hi rend="italic">Diacosmus,</hi> which was the chief
                    work of his life, he must have bestowed much thought on the question as to the
                    site of Homeric Troy,—the central point of his subject. He pronounced decidedly,
                    as we know from Strabo, against the claim of the Greek Ilium. It has been
                    suggested that Demetrius rejected the Ilian claim because, as a native of
                    Scepsis, he was jealous of Ilium,—a suggestion which is not only absurd in
                    itself, since it assumes that such a motive would have induced Demetrius to mar
                    his life’s work, but also betrays ignorance of Strabo’s text. Scepsis was not a
                    possible claimant of the contested honour, since it was not in the plain of Troy
                    but in the plain of Bairamitch; and further, Demetrius had already provided in
                    another manner for the Homeric dignity of Scepsis by making it the royal seat of
                    Aeneas on the strength of its position relatively to Lyrnessus. The verdict of
                    Demetrius against the Ilian claim was also the general verdict of the other
                    ancient writers consulted by Strabo, as the latter’s language shows. From the
                    passage in which Strabo notices the various definitions of the Troad (xiii. § 4)
                    it appears that among such writers were the following historians and geographers
                    :—Charon of Lampsacus (flor. 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>), Damastes of
                    Sigeum (400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Scylax of Caryanda (350 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Ephorus of Cyme (340 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.),</hi> Eudoxus of Cyzicus (130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> It is to
                    such writers as these that Strabo refers when he indicates the general consent
                    of his authorities. In favour of the claim of the Greek Ilium, on the other
                    hand, there are only two literary witnesses, and these, as we have seen, are
                    alike worthless. Equally valueless from a critical point of view is the fact
                    that the Ilian claim was sometimes allowed by soldiers or statesmen who wished
                    to utilize Trojan memories. They required an official Troy, and they cared not
                    where they found it. Nothing could more curiously illustrate the extreme poverty
                    of the case for the Greek Ilium than the fact that some of its advocates have
                    been reduced to arguing as if Alexander and Lucius Scipio, when they led their
                    armies through the Troad, had been conducting archaeological excursions, and as
                    if their acquiescence in a convenient local myth had the weight of independent
                    critical testimonies.</p>
                <p>In negativing the Ilian claim the conclusion of ancient criticism has been
                    confirmed by a great preponderance of modern opinion. Since Lechevalier visited
                    the Troad in 1785-86 an overwhelming majority of competent judges have favoured
                    his belief that the Bali Dagh above Bunár-bashi was the Pergamus of the Homeric
                    poet’s conception. Before Leake’s visit this opinion had been expressed by
                    Choiseul-Gouffier, Morritt, Hawkins, Gell, and Hamilton. Leake spoke with a
                    decision which derives additional weight from the habitual sobriety of his acute
                    judgment, and from the care with which, in this case, he had examined the
                    alleged objections to the view which he finally adopted. He remarks that no one
                    accustomed to observe the sites of ancient Greek towns could fail to fix on
                    Bunár-bashi “for the site of the chief place of the surrounding country.” So Mr
                    Tozer, in his <hi rend="italic">Highlands of Turkey,</hi> says: “A person
                    accustomed to observe the situation of Hellenic cities would at once fix on this
                    as far more likely to have recommended itself to the old inhabitants of the
                    country than any other in the neighbourhood.” Count von Moltke has expressed the
                    same opinion, that “he knew no other site in the Trojan plain for a chief town
                    of ancient time.” Another supporter of Bunárbashi is Forchhammer. Another is
                    Kiepert. The opinion of Ernst Curtius has been already cited. But space
                    precludes more names; it is enough to say that the correspondence of the Bali
                    Dagh with the Homeric Pergamus—a correspondence absolutely unique in the Trojan
                    plain—has been recognized with virtual unanimity by modem travellers who have
                    patiently inspected the scenery of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> having
                    competent knowledge, and being free from bias in favour of a theory formed
                    before their visit. Partial excavations on the summit of the Bali Dagh have been
                    more than once undertaken, with the result of discovering ancient walls.
                    Pottery, too, has been found there, part of which is allowed on all hands to be
                    probably as old, at least, as 900 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But the Bali
                    Dagh has never yet been explored with any approach to thoroughness.</p>

                    Hissarlik has been to lay bare the remains of the Greek Ilium, and also, below
                    these, some prehistoric remains of a rude and poor kind. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Troy,</hi> his first book on the subject, the explorer held that the remains of
                    the Greek Ilium ceased at a depth of 6 feet below the surface, and that all the
                    other remains, down to 52½ feet, were prehistoric. He distinguished the latter
                    into five groups, representing five prehistoric “cities” which had succeeded
                    each other on the site; and in his second work, <hi rend="italic">Ilios,</hi> he
                    added to these a sixth prehistoric city, on the strength of some scanty vestiges
                    of supposed Lydian workmanship, found at a depth of 6½ feet. In both books,
                    Homeric Troy was identified with the third prehistoric city from the bottom,
                    which was supposed to have been destroyed, though not totally, by fire.
                    Professor Jebb was the first to show (1) that the lines of demarcation between
                    the alleged prehistoric strata, as drawn in <hi rend="italic">Ilios,</hi> could
                    not be accurate, and (2) that, if any part of the prehistoric remains could be
                    supposed to represent Homeric Troy, it must be that part which Dr Schliemann had
                    called the second city from the bottom, and the destruction of which by fire
                    appeared to have been total. In 1882 the architects employed by Dr Schliemann
                    proved that the stratification given in <hi rend="italic">Ilios</hi> had in fact
                    been incorrect. The errors, too, affected precisely that region of the deposit
                    which was most important to the Trojan hypothesis, viz., the lower strata. In Dr
                    Schliemann’s third volume, <hi rend="italic">Troja,</hi> these errors were
                    admitted; and Troy was now identified, no longer with the third city, but with
                    the second, of which the supposed area was now enlarged. Another fact to which
                    the English critic had drawn attention was that the remains of the Greek Ilium
                    must extend to a considerably greater depth than 6 feet below the surface.
                    Further examination confirmed this view also. It showed that the remains on the
                    mound at Hissarlik belong to the following periods or groups. (1) At the top,
                    the remains of the Greek Ilium as it existed in the Roman age, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> as rebuilt <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0603-0582"/> after its destruction by Fimbria in 85 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> (2) A city which, like the former, extended beyond
                    the mound of Hissarlik (its acropolis) over the adjacent plain. This corresponds
                    with the Greek Ilium of the Macedonian age, as embellished and enlarged by
                    Lysimachus, <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 300 B.C. (3) A smaller city, probably
                    confined to the mound. Here we may recognize the Greek Ilium as it existed
                    before the Macedonian age. It was a small and poor place, as appears from the
                    known incidents of its history in the 5th and 4th centuries <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> owing its chief importance to the shrine of Athene Ilias. (4) A
                    petty town or village, confined to the mound, and poorly built. The evidence of
                    architecture fails to decide whether it was Hellenic or not; if Hellenic, it
                    might represent the primitive settlement of the Aeolic colonists, perhaps <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>. 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was a small house in
                    this village that Dr Schliemann at first identified with Priam’s palace. The
                    ground-plan shows four rooms, of which the largest measured 24 feet 4 inches by
                    12 feet. (5) A large town, to which the mound was only acropolis, and which
                    extended to some distance south and south-east over the plain. These remains are
                    unquestionably prehistoric. (6) A few remains of a small settlement which, if
                    indeed distinct from No. 5, preceded it. The reason for distinguishing 6 from 5
                    is that some of the acropolis buildings of 5 are above those of 6, and seem to
                    have been built on carefully levelled ground. Apart from architectural evidence,
                    objects found in the excavations prove that the remains of the historical age
                    extend much below 6 feet. One of these was a terra-cotta disk, stamped with the
                    head of a warrior, in an advanced style of workmanship, found at 26 feet 3
                    inches below the surface (<hi rend="italic">Troy,</hi> p. 294). Another is a
                    terracotta ball, found at 26 feet, which cannot be older than <hi rend="italic"
                    >c.</hi> 360 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Then, at 20 feet, was found another
                    terra-cotta, marked with the Greek letter P. A piece of ivory, belonging to a
                    seven-stringed lyre, and therefore not older than <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 660
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was found at 26 feet. Thus we have at Hissarlik
                    the remains of the Greek Ilium in three successive phases,—Roman, Macedonian,
                    and Aeolic, and below these the remains of at least one prehistoric settlement,
                    the age and origin of which are unknown.</p>
                <p>We can no longer either prove or disprove that these prehistoric remains are
                    those of a town which was once taken after a siege, and which originally gave
                    rise to the legend of Troy. But most certainly it is not the “lofty” Troy of
                    which the Homeric poet was thinking when he embodied the legend in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> The conception of Troy which dominates the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> is based on the site at Bunárbashi, and suits no other.
                    The sole phrase in the epic which favours Hissarlik occurs in book xx. (216 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq</hi>.), where Dardania is said to have been built on the spurs
                    of Ida, when Ilios “had not yet been built in the plain and this phrase occurs
                    in a passage which, as the best recent critics agree, is one of the latest
                    interpolations in the <hi rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> having been composed after
                    the Greek Ilium had actually arisen “in the plain.” Its purpose was the same as
                    that which appears in the Hymn to Aphrodite, viz., to glorify reputed
                    descendants of Aeneas, and it probably belongs to the same age, the 7th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The tactical data of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad—</hi> those derived from the incidents of the war—cannot be treated with
                    such rigour as if the poem were a military history. But Nikolaides has shown
                    that they can at least be brought into general agreement with the site at
                    Bunárbashi, while they are hopelessly incompatible with Hissarlik. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> makes it clear that the general description of the
                    Trojan plain was founded on accurate knowledge. At this day all the essential
                    Homeric features can be recognized. And it is probable that the poet who created
                    the Troy of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> knew, personally or by description,
                    a strong town on the Bali Dagh above Bunár-bashi. The legend of the siege may or
                    may not have arisen from an older town at Hissarlik, which had then disappeared.
                    The poet might naturally place his Troy in a position like that of the existing
                    strong city on the Bali Dagh, giving it a “beetling” acropolis and handsome
                    buildings, while he also reproduced the general course of the rivers and that
                    striking feature,—an indelible mark of the locality,—the natural springs at the
                    foot of the hill, just beyond the city gates on the north-west. But, while he
                    thus imagined his Troy in the general likeness of the town on the Bali Dagh, he
                    would retain the privilege of a poet who was adorning an ancient legend, and
                    whose theme was a city that had long ago vanished. Instead of feeling bound to
                    observe a rigorous accuracy of local detail, he would rather feel impelled to
                    avoid it; he would use his liberty to introduce some traits borrowed from other
                    scenes known to him, or even from imagination. To this extent, and in this
                    sense, his topography would be eclectic. Such a consideration might suffice to
                    explain the fact, well known to those who have studied this question on the
                    spot, that neither Bunárbashi nor any other one site can be harmonized with
                    every detail of the poem. The recommendations of Bunárbashi are, first, that it
                    satisfies the capital and essential conditions, while no other site does so, and
                    secondly, that the particular difficulties which it leaves unsolved are
                    relatively slight and few. This character of Homeric topography becomes still
                    easier to understand, if, as most critics would now concede, our <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> contains work of various hands and ages. Few questions,
                    perhaps, of equal literary interest have been so much confused by inattention to
                    the firδt conditions of the problem. The tale of Troy, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad</hi> gives it, is essentially a poetical creation; and we have no
                    evidence other than the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> That is, our sole data are
                    (1) of the mythical class, (2) of inadequate precision, and (3) of uncertain
                    origin. But they show a general knowledge of the ground; and the question is how
                    far particular features of the ground can be recognized in the poem. It may be
                    doubted whether the case admits of any solution more definite than that which
                    has been indicated above.</p>

                <p>According to Greek legend, the oldest town in the Troad was that founded by
                    Teucer, who was a son of the river Scamander and the nymph Idaea. Tzetzes says
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n604/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0604-0583"/> that the Scamander in question was the Scamander
                    in Crete, and that Teucer was told by an oracle to settle wherever the
                    “earth-born ones” attacked him. So when he and his company were attacked in the
                    Troad by mice, which gnawed their bow-strings and the handles of their shields,
                    he settled on the spot, thinking that the oracle was fulfilled. He called the
                    town Sminthium and built a temple to Apollo Sminthius, the Cretan word for a
                    mouse being <hi rend="italic">sminthius.</hi> In his reign Dardanus, son of Zeus
                    and the nymph Electra, daughter of Atlas, in consequence of a deluge, drifted
                    from the island of Samothrace on a raft or a skin bag to the coast of the Troad,
                    where, having received a portion of land from Teucer and married his daughter
                    Batea, he founded the city of Dardania or Dardanus on high ground at the foot of
                    Mount Ida. On the death of Teucer, Dardanus succeeded to the kingdom and called
                    the whole land Dardania after himself. He begat Erichthonius, who begat a son
                    Tros by Astyoche, daughter of Simois. On succeeding to the throne, Tros called
                    the country Troy and the people Trojans. By Callirrhoe, daughter of Scamander,
                    he had three sons,—Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymede. From Ilus and Assaracus sprang
                    two separate lines of the royal house,—the one being Ilus, Laomedon, Priam,
                    Hector; the other Assaracus, Capys, Anchises, Aeneas. Ilus went to Phrygia,
                    where, being victorious in wrestling, he received as a prize from the king of
                    Phrygia a spotted cow, with an injunction to follow her and found a city
                    wherever she lay down. The cow lay down on the hill of the Phrygian Até; and
                    here accordingly Ilus founded the city of Ilios. It is stated that Dardania,
                    Troy, and Ilios became one city. Desiring a sign at the foundation of Ilios, Hus
                    prayed to Zeus and as an answer he found lying before his tent the Palladium, a
                    wooden statue of Pallas, three cubits high, with her feet joined, a spear in her
                    right hand, and a distaff and spindle in her left. Ilus built a temple for the
                    image and worshipped it. By Eurydice, daughter of Adrastus, he had a son
                    Laomedon. Laomedon married Strymo, daughter of Scamander, or Placia, daughter of
                    Atreus or of Leucippus. It was in his reign that Poseidon and Apollo, or
                    Poseidon alone, built the walls of Troy. In his reign also Hercules besieged and
                    took the city, slaying Laomedon and his children, except one daughter Hesione
                    and one son Pod-arces. The life of Podarces was granted at the request of
                    Hesione; but Hercules stipulated that Podarces must first be a slave and then be
                    redeemed by Hesione; she gave her veil for him; hence his name of Priam (from
                    <hi rend="italic">pτiasthai</hi> to buy). Priam married first Arisbe and
                    afterwards Hecuba and had fifty sons and twelve daughters. Among the sons were
                    Hector and Paris, and among the daughters Polyxena and Cassandra. To recover
                    Helen, whom Paris carried off from Sparta, the Greeks under Agamemnon besieged
                    Troy for ten years. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Achilles, Agamemnon, Ajax, Hector,
                    Helen, Paris.)</hi> At last they contrived a wooden horse, in whose hollow belly
                    many of the Greek heroes hid themselves. Their army and fleet then withdrew to
                    Tenedos, feigning to have raised the siege. The Trojans conveyed the wooden
                    horse into Troy; in the night the Greeks stole out, opened the gates to their
                    returning friends, and Troy was taken.</p>
