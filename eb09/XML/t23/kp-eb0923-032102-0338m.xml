                    and summer there is hardly a field, a copse, or a garden that is not the resort
                    of a pair or more; and the brown-backed bird with its spotted breast, <pb

                    pausing to detect the movement of a worm, and vigorously seizing the same a
                    moment after, is one of the most familiar sights. Hardly less well known is the
                    singular nest built by this bird—a deep cup, lined with a thin but stiff coating
                    of fragments of rotten wood ingeniously spread, and plastered so as to present a
                    smooth interior—in which its sea-green eggs spotted with black are laid. An
                    early breeder, it builds nest after nest during the season, and there can be few
                    birds more prolific. Its ravages on ripening fruits, especially strawberries and
                    gooseberries, excite the enmity of the imprudent gardener who leaves his crops
                    unprotected by nets, but he would do well to stay the hand of revenge, for no
                    bird can or does destroy so many snails, as is testified to the curious observer
                    on inspection of the stones that it selects against which to dash its
                    captures,—stones that are besmeared with the slime of the victims and bestrewn
                    with the fragments of their shattered shells. Nearly all the young Thrushes
                    reared in the British Islands—and this expression includes the storm-swept isles
                    of the Outer Hebrides, though not those of Shetland—seem to emigrate as soon as
                    they are fit to journey, and at a later period they are followed by most of
                    their parents, so that many parts of the kingdom are absolutely bereft of this
                    species from October to the end of January. On the continent of Europe the
                    autumnal influx of the birds bred in the North is regarded with much interest,
                    as has been already stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 765),
                    for they are easily ensnared and justly esteemed for the table, while their
                    numbers make their appearance in certain districts a matter of great
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The second species to which the name applies is distinguished as the

                    tints, and conspicuous in flight by the white patches on its outer
                    tail-feathers. Of bold disposition, and fearless of the sleety storms of spring,
                    as of predatory birds, the cock will take his stand on a tall tree, “like an
                    enchanter calling up the gale” (as Knapp happily wrote), and thence with loud
                    voice proclaim in wild and discontinuous notes the fervour of his love for his
                    mate; nor does that love cease when the breeding-season is past, since this
                    species is one of those that appear to pair for life, and even when, later in
                    the year, it gathers in small flocks, husband and wife may be seen in close
                    company. In defence of nest and offspring, too, few birds are more resolute, and
                    the Daw, Pie, or Jay that approaches with an ill intent speedily receives
                    treatment that causes a rapid retreat, while even the marauding cat finds the
                    precincts of the “master of the coppice” <hi rend="italic">(Pen</hi><hi

                    Thrush, unsuitable for its stealthy operations. The connexion of this bird with
                    the mistletoe, which is as old as the days of Aristotle, is no figment, as some
                    have tried to maintain. Not only is it exceedingly fond of the luscious viscid
                    berries, but it seems to be almost the only bird that will touch them. Of other

                    would be commonly called Thrushes, and it must be borne in mind that in
