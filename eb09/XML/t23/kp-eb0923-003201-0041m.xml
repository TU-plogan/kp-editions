                    well educated, and got him a place as a lawyer’s clerk. Being much excited by
                    the first events of the Revolution, he gave up his desk to enter a printer’s
                    office, and by 1791 he was overseer of the printing <pb break="no"

                    >Moniteur.</hi> While thus employed he conceived the idea of the <hi
                    rend="italic">journal-afiiche,</hi> and from January to May 1791 he placarded a
                    large printed sheet on all the walls of Paris twice a week under the title of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ami des Citoyens.</hi> This enterprise of his, of which
                    the expenses were defrayed by the Jacobin Clul}, made him well known to the
                    revolutionary leaders; and he made himself still more conspicuous in organizing
                    the great “Fête de la Liberté” on April 15, 1792, in honour of the released
                    soldiers of Château-Vieux, with Collot d’Herbois. On July 8, 1792, he was the
                    spokesman of a deputation of the section of the Place Royale which demanded from
                    the legislative assembly the reinstatement of Pétion and Manuel, and he was one
                    of the most active popular leaders in the attack upon the Tuileries on 10th
                    August, on which day he was appointed secretary or clerk to the revolutionary
                    commune of Paris. In this capacity he exhibited an almost feverish activity; he
                    perpetually appeared at the bar of the assembly on behalf of the commune; he
                    announced the massacres of September in the prisons in terms of praise and
                    apology; and he sent off the famous circular of 3d September to the provinces,
                    recommending them to do likewise. At the close of the month he resigned his post
                    on being elected, in spite of his youth, a deputy to the Convention by the
                    department of Seine-et-Oise, and he commenced his legislative career by
                    defending the conduct of the commune during the massacres. He took his seat upon
                    the Mountain, and showed himself one of the most vigorous Jacobins, particularly
                    in his defence of Marat; he voted for the execution of the king, and was elected
                    a member of the Committee of General Security on January 21, 1793. After a short
                    mission in the western provinces he returned to Paris, and took an active part
                    in the <hi rend="italic">coups d’etat</hi> of 31st May and 2d June, which
                    resulted in the overthrow of the Girondins. For the next few months he remained
                    comparatively quiet, but on September 23, 1793, he was sent with Ysabeau on his
                    famous mission to Bordeaux. This was the very month in which the Terror was
                    organized under the superintendence of the Committees of Public Safety and
                    General Security, and Bordeaux was one of the cities selected to feel its full
                    weight. Tallien showed himself one of the most vigorous of the proconsuls sent
                    over France to establish the Terror in the provinces; though with but few
                    adherents, he soon awed the great city into quiet, and kept the guillotine
                    constantly employed. It was at this moment that the romance of Tallien’s life
                    commenced. Among his prisoners was Theresa, Comtesse de Fontenay, the daughter
                    of the great Spanish banker Cabarrus, the most beautiful and fascinating woman
                    of her time, and Tallien not only spared her life but fell deeply in love with
                    her. She quickly abated the fierceness of his revolutionary ardour, and from the
                    lives she saved by her entreaties she received the name of “Our Lady of Pity.”
                    This mildness, however, displeased the members of the committees; Tallien was
                    recalled to Paris; and Madame de Fontenay was imprisoned there. Danton and his
                    friends had but just fallen, and the members of the committees were half afraid
                    to strike again at the moderates, so Tallien was spared for the time, and was
                    even elected president of the Convention on March 24, 1794. But the Terror could
                    not be maintained at the same pitch: Robespierre began to see that he must
                    strike at many of his own colleagues in the committees if he was to carry out
                    his theories, and Tallien was one of the men condemned with them. They
                    determined to strike first, and on the great day of Thermidor it was Tallien
                    who, urged on by the danger in which his beloved lay, opened the attack upon
                    Robespierre. The movement was successful; Robespierre and his friends were
                    guillotined; and the young Tallien, as the leading Thermidorian, was elected to
                    the Committee of Public Safety. Now came the great months of his career: he
                    showed himself a vigorous Thermidorian; he was instrumental in suppressing the
                    Revolutionary Tribunal and the Jacobin Club; he attacked Carrier and Lebon, the
                    proconsuls of Nantes and Arras; and he fought bravely against the insurgents of
                    Prairial. In all these months he was supported by his Theresa, whom he married
                    on December 26, 1794, and who became the leader of the social life of Paris. His
                    last political achievement was in July 1795, when he was present with Hoche at
                    the destruction of the army of the émigrés at Quiberon, and ordered the
                    executions which followed. After the close of the Convention Tallien’s political
                    importance came to an end, for, though he sat in the Council of Five Hundred,
                    the moderates attacked him as terrorist, and the extreme party as a renegade.
                    Madame Tallien also got tired of him, and became the mistress of the rich banker
                    Ouvrard. Bonaparte, however, who is said to have been introduced by him to
                    Barras, took him to Egypt in his great expedition of June 1798, and after the
                    capture of Cairo he edited the official journal there, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decade Egyptienne.</hi> But Menou sent him away from Egypt, and on his passage
                    he was captured by an English cruiser and taken to London, where he had a good
                    reception among the Whigs and was well received by Fox. On returning to France
                    in 1802 he got a divorce from his unfaithful spouse (who eventually married the
                    Prince de Chimay), and was left for some time without employment. At last,
                    through Fouché and Talleyrand, he got the appointment of consul at Alicante, and
                    remained there until he lost the sight of one eye from yellow fever. On
                    returning to Paris he lived on his half-pay until 1815, when he received the
                    especial favour of not being exiled like the other regicides. His latter days
                    were spent in the direst poverty; he had to sell his books to get bread. He died
                    at Paris on November 16, 1820.</p>
