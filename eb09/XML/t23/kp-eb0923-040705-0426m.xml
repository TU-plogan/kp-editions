                    have been the work of Cyclopean masons. Its period of greatest splendour was
                    during the 11th and 10th centuries B.c.; but the city continued to exist till
                    about 468 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when it was destroyed through the
                    jealousy of the inhabitants of the neighbouring Argos,<note anchored="true"

                    statement, believing that Tiryns ceased to exist some centuries earlier, in
                    spite of the strong evidence given by the inscription on the bronze column (now
                    in Constantinople), formed by three twisted serpents, which once supported the
                    golden tripod dedicated to Apollo out of the spoils from Plataea. Tiryns occurs
                    in the list of allied states present at that battle; moreover, recent
                    discoveries have brought to light remains of an important building of about 600
                    B.c.</p></note></p>
                <p>Excavations made in 1884-85 by Schliemann and Dörpfeld over part of the rock on
                    which Tiryns stood have exposed a most interesting building, quite unique as an
                    example of a Greek palace of the 11th or 10th century B.C., and of special
                    interest from the way in which it closely illustrates the Homeric palaces of
                    Alcinous and Odysseus, and throws a new light on scenes such as the slaughter of
                    the suitors <hi rend="italic">(Od.,</hi> xxi. and xxii.).</p>
                <p>The rock on which Tiryns is built is of an irregular oval shape, about 330 yards
                    long by 112 at the widest part, and is surrounded by a very massive wall,
                    varying from 30 to 40 feet in thickness and averaging when complete about 50
                    feet in height, measuring from its base outside. Inside, the wall was probably
                    not more than 10 or 12 feet high above the ground, so the masonry acts as a
                    retaining wall to a considerable depth of earth which covers the rock (see fig.
                    2 below). The wall is built of very large hammer-dressed blocks, some as much as
                    10 feet long by 3 feet 3 inches or 3 feet 6 inches wide, with smaller ones to
                    fill up the interstices. The whole was bedded, not in mortar, but in clay, which
                    has mostly been washed out of the joints; originally the surface was probably
                    protected with a coating of stucco. The only important gateway, which was on the
                    east side, away from the sea, probably resembled the “lion gate” at Mycenae. The
                    other entrances are mere slits in the wall. One of these and the chief gate are
                    shown in fig. 1. Internally the area of the city was divided by cross walls into
                    three parts at successive levels. The lowest and middle divisions have not yet
                    been excavated; the upper part at the south end of the rock was completely
                    exposed in 1884-85 by Schliemann and Dörpfeld, and the almost complete plan of
                    the various structures clearly made out. This division contains the palace of
                    the ruler of Tiryns, a building which shows careful and skilful construction,
                    elaborate decoration, and a well-arranged plan, suitable to the wants of a
                    wealthy autocratic chief, who lived in a manner which partly recalls the luxury
                    of an Oriental king, and also resembled the feudal state of a mediaeval baron,
                    surrounded by a crowd of vassals. From the main gate, which was defended by a
                    tower, a strong passage led between the outer wall and an inner one to an inner
                    gate, thence to a propylaeum or double porch, with two wooden columns on each
                    side,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The arrows in fig.
                    1 show the way from the city gate to the palace court and hall.</p></note>
                    adjoining which were chambers for guards. Then came another similar, but smaller
                    propylaeum, and opposite to that was the entrance to the great court (αύλή),
                    nearly 53 by 70 feet, in which stands the altar to Zeus Herceus, with a circular
                    pit beneath it to catch the victims’ blood. This court was surrounded by wooden
                    columns supporting a roof, like a mediaeval cloister; on the south side are
                    chambers for attendants <hi rend="italic">(θa</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi

                    round it—possibly the <hi rend="italic">όρσοθύρη</hi> of Homer <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Od.,</hi> xxii. '126), through which one of the suitors escaped and so got
                    arms from the treasury or armoury, which was on an upper floor (see <hi
                    rend="italic">Od.,</hi> xxii. 142 and xxi. 5). On the west side of the hall are
                    a number of small chambers <hi rend="italic">(θαλάμοι)</hi> for the unmarried
                    men, and a bath-room about 12 by 10 feet, with its floor formed of one great
                    slab of stone, sloped so as to drain out at one side through a pipe which passes
                    through the wall. The women’s part of the house is of equal importance to that
                    of the men, and has its hall and two open courts with pillars. It is approached
                    in a very circuitous way,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    passage which winds round the back of the men’s hall, and so leads by a long
                    flight of steps, cut in the rock, to the little postern door in the semicircular
                    bastion. The many small rooms in this part of the palace were probably the
                    bedrooms of the women and married couples of the chiefs family. A staircase at
                    16 led to an upper floor, like the <hi rend="italic">κΚΐμαξ υψηλή</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">Od.</hi> xxi. 5. The circuit wall round the palace is more
                    strongly constructed than the rest On the south side it is built in two offsets,
                    forming a level platform for the garrison halfway up. In the upper and thinner
                    part of the wall two narrow passages at different levels are formed in its
                    thickness. They are roofed by projecting courses of stone in large blocks. The
                    wall on the east side has a similar intermediate platform, on to which open a
                    series of small chambers formed in the mass of the upper wall (see fig. 2). At
                    the top level the wall was covered by a colonnade of wood pillars resting on
                    circular stone blocks. This supported a flat roof and was open to the inside of
                    the city. The back of the colonnade was built of brick, and is now missing, as
                    are all the brick parts of the city, owing to the bricks having been only
                    sun-dried.</p>
                <p>The methods of construction employed in the Tiryns palace are of the highest
                    interest. The foundations and about 3 feet of the walls above the ground are
                    made of large blocks of stone bedded in clay; above this the wall was of brick,
                    sun-dried, and covered with stucco. The upper story was probably of wood. Some
                    of the thresholds of the doors were massive blocks of stone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(λiιvos</hi> oüðós); others were of wood <hi rend="italic">(δρtivos
                    oiδ6s').</hi> Wood was also used for all the columns, d∞rposts, and antae <hi
                    rend="italic">{πapaστdδes),</hi> and in some cases the walls of the rooms were
                    lined with wood, carefully fixed by dowels, the holes for which still
                    exist.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The marks of the
                    wooden wall linings are specially clear in the little bath-room.</p></note> The
                    doors had pivots of bronze revolving in well-fitted bronze cup-like sockets let
                    into the thresholds. In the megaron and other rooms the floors are of good
                    concrete, decorated with a simple series of incised lines, coloured blue and
                    red. The stucco of the internal wall is decorated with bold and very effective
                    patterns—birds and scroll-work of· semi-Oriental style; in many cases the
                    motives are obviously taken from textile ornaments, as in the most archaic style
                    of vase painting. One example of rich and costly decoration remains,—part of a
                    frieze of white alabaster, sculptured in relief with rosettes and interlacing
                    patterns, and studded with jewel-like pieces of blue glass or enamel, the <hi

                    probably bring to light the dwellings of the citizens who garrisoned the place.
                    The great bulk of the Tirynthians must have lived in houses outside the citadel,
                    but under the shelter of its protection, just as in mediaeval Italy villages
