                    Kathodos (descent), the second Nesteia (fast), and the third Kalligeneia

                    procession from Halimus to Athens, but this assumption seems to rest entirely on
                    an interpretation of the name Anodos, and it loses all probability when we
                    observe that the day was by others called Kathodos.<note anchored="true"

                    because the women ascended to the Thesmophorium, which (according to the
                    scholiast) stood on a height. But no ancient writer mentions a procession from
                    Halimus. For the name <hi rend="italic">Kathodos,</hi> see Schol., <hi

                    statement that at one part of the festival (commonly assumed, by the writers who
                    accept the statement, to be the Anodos) the women carried on their heads the
                    “books of the law,” we have only the authority of the scholiast on Theocritus,
                    iv. 25, who displays his ignorance by describing the women as virgins (see
                    below), and saying that they went in procession to Eleusis. The statement may
                    therefore be dismissed as an etymological fiction. Aristophanes, <hi

                    book-carrying.</p></note> Probably both names referred to the descent of Demeter

                    by the heat of the sun, and they did not invoke Kalligeneia (which seems to mean
                    that they did not celebrate the last day of the festival); at Syracuse, during

                <p>The above was nearly all that was known about the Thesmophoria down to 1870. In

                    rend="italic">Museum</hi> (N. F. 25, p. 548 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> a
                    scholion on Lucian <hi rend="italic">(Dial. Meretr.,</hi> ii. 1), which he
                    discovered in the Vatican MS. Palatinus 73, and which furnishes some curious
                    details about the Thesmophoria. It also explains two obscure and corrupt
                    passages of Clemens Alexandrinus and Pausanias, the true meaning of which had
                    been divined by Lobeck <hi rend="italic">(Aglaophamιιs,</hi> p. 828 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.}.</hi> The substance of the scholion is this. When Proserpine
                    was carried off by Pluto, a swineherd called Eubuleus was herding his swine at
                    the spot, and his herd was engulfed in the chasm down which Pluto had vanished
                    with Proserpine. Accordingly at the Thesmophoria it was customary, in memory of
                    Eubuleus, to fling pigs into the “chasms of Demeter and Proserpine.” (These
                    “chasms” may have been natural caverns or perhaps vaults. The scholiast speaks
                    of them also as <hi rend="italic">adyta</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    days, descended into the caverns, and, frightening away the serpents by clapping

                    victim was with the Khonds, like the pig with the Greeks, a sacrifice to the
                    Earth goddess. See W. Macpherson, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of Service in

                    corrupt, but the following seems to be the sense. The ceremony above described
                    was called the arretophoria, and was supposed to exercise the same quickening
                    and fertilizing influence on men as on fields. Further, along with the pigs,
                    sacred cakes made of dough, in the shape of serpents and of phalli, were cast
                    into the caverns, to symbolize the productivity of the earth and of man.

                <p>The custom described in this important scholion is clearly the same as that
                    referred to by Clemens Alexandrinus <hi rend="italic">(Protrep.,</hi> § 17) and
                    Pausanias (ix. 8, 1). From the latter we learn that the pigs were sucking pigs,
                    and from the former (if we adopt Lobeck’s emendation <hi rend="italic">μεyiρoιs
                    ζωvτas</hi> for <hi rend="italic">μεyapiζovτεs)</hi> that they were thrown in
                    alive. From Pausanias we may further perhaps infer (though the passage is
                    corrupt) that the remains of the pigs thrown down in one year were not fetched
                    up till the same time next year (cp. Paus., X. 32, 14). The question remains, At
                    what point of the Thesmophoria did the ceremony described by the scholiast on
                    Lucian take place? Rohde thinks that it formed part of the ceremonies at
                    Halimus, his chief ground being that Clemens <hi rend="italic">(Protrep.,</hi>
                    34) and Arnobius (v. 28) mention phalli in connexion with the “mysteries at
                    Halimus”; but it is not certain that these mysteries were the Thesmophoria. The
                    legend of Eubuleus seems to show that the ceremony commemorated the descent of
                    Proserpine to the nether world; and, if we are right in our interpretation of
                    the name Kathodos as applied to the first day of the Thesmophoria proper, the
                    ceremony described would naturally fall on that day. Further, if our
                    interpretation of Pausanias is correct, the same day must have witnessed the
                    descent of the living pigs and the ascent of the rotten pork of the previous
                    year. Hence the day might be indifferently styled Kathodos or Anodos (“descent”
                    or “ascent”); and so in fact it was.</p>
                <p>It is usual to interpret Thesmophorus “lawgiver” and Thesmophoria “the feast of
                    the lawgiver.” But the Greek for ‘ ‘ lawgiver” is not Thesmophorus but
                    Thesmothetes (or Nomothetes, when <hi rend="italic">nomos</hi> displaced <hi
                    rend="italic">thesmos</hi> in the sense of “law”). If we compare such names of
                    festivals as Oschophoria, Lampadephoria, Hyαro-phoria, Scirophoria (“the
                    carryings of grapes, of torches, of water, of umbrellas”) with the corresponding
                    Oschophorus, Lampade-phorus, Hydrophorus, also Thallophorus and Kanephorus, we
                    can scarcely help concluding that Thesmophoria must originally have meant in the
                    literal and physical sense the carrying of the <hi rend="italic">thesmoi,</hi>
                    and Thesmophorus the person who so carried them; and, in view of the ceremony
                    disclosed by the scholiast on Lucian (compared with the analogous ceremony
                    observed by the Arrephoroi at Athens), we are strongly tempted to suppose that
                    the women whom he calls Antletriai may have been also known, at one time or
                    other, as Thesmophoroi, and that the <hi rend="italic">thesmoi</hi> were the
                    sacra which they carried and deposited on the altar. The word would then be used
                    in its literal sense, “that which is set down.” How the name Thesmophorus should
                    have been transferred to the goddess from her ministers is of course a
                    difficulty, which is hardly disposed of by pointing to the epithets Amallophorus
                    (“sheaf-bearing”) and Melophorus (“apple-bearing”), which were applied to men as
                    well as to the goddess.</p>
                <p>As to the origin of the Thesmophoria, Herodotus (ii. 171) asserts that they were
                    introduced into Greece from Egypt by the daughters of Danaus; while, according
                    to Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(Fragments,</hi> p. 55, ed. Dübner), the feast was
                    introduced into Athens by Orpheus the Odrysian. From these statements wo can
                    only infer the similarity of the Thesmophoria to the Orphic rites and to the
                    Egyptian representation of the sufferings of Osiris, in connexion with which
                    Plutarch mentions them. The Thesmophoria would thus form one of that class of
                    rites, widely spread in Western Asia and in Europe, in which the main feature
                    appears to be a lamentation for the annual decay of vegetation or a rejoicing at
                    its revival. This seems to have been the root, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> of
                    the lamentations for Adonis and Attis. See W. Mannhardt, <hi rend="italic"
