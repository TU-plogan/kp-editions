                    Woodhouselee, Scottish judge, was the eldest son of William Tytler (see below),
                    and was born at Edinburgh on 15th October 1747. After passing through the High
                    School, he was sent in 1763 to a school at Kensington taught by Dr Elphinston,
                    the translator of Martial’s <hi rend="italic">Epigrams.</hi> He returned to
                    Edinburgh in 1765, skilled in Latin versification, and with a competent
                    knowledge of Italian, and a taste for drawing and natural history. He was called
                    to the bar in 1770. His first work, a supplement to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionary of Decisions,</hi> undertaken on the suggestion of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0739-0714"/> Lord Kames, was published in 1778, and a
                    continuation appeared in 1796. In 1780 Tytler was appointed conjoint professor
                    of universal history in the university of Edinburgh, becoming sole professor in
                    1786. In 1782 he published <hi rend="italic">Outlines</hi> of his course of
                    lectures, afterwards extended and republished under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of General History.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> has passed through many editions, and has been translated into
                    several European languages as well as into Hindustani. The lectures themselves
                    were published in 1834 in Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Family Library.</hi> In
                    1790 Tytler was appointed judge-advocate of Scotland, and while holding this
                    office he wrote a <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Law of Courts-Martial.</hi>
                    In 1801 he was raised to the bench, taking his seat (1802) in the court of
                    session as Lord Woodhouselee. He died at Edinburgh on 5th January 1813.</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, he was the author of several papers in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mirror,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Lounger,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh</hi>; he also wrote
                    <hi rend="italic">Life and Writings of Dr John Gregory; Essay on the Principles
                    of Translation,</hi> 1790; a dissertation on <hi rend="italic">Final
                    Causes,</hi> prefixed to his edition of Derham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physico-Theology,</hi> 1799; a political pamphlet entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ireland profiting by Example,</hi> 1799; an <hi rend="italic">Essay</hi> on
                    Laura and Petrarch; and <hi rend="italic">The Life and Writings of Henry Home,
                    Lord Kames,</hi> 1807.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Patrick Fraser Tytler</hi> (1791-1849), as the son of
                    Lord Woodhouselee and grandson of William Tytler, may be said to have inherited
                    a taste for literary and historical pursuits. He was born at Edinburgh on 30th
                    August 1791, and was educated chiefly at the High School and university, being
                    called to the bar in 1813. His earliest literary effort appears to have been a
                    chapter or two contributed to Alison’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in France</hi>
                    (1815); and his first independent essays were papers in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Blackwood's Magazine.</hi> Inheriting the family talent for music, and with a
                    facility in throwing off humorous little poems and songs, he made several
                    contributions to Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Select Melodies of Scotland,</hi>
                    1824. In 1819 he published the <hi rend="italic">Life of James Crichton of
                    Cluny, commonly called the Admirable Crichton,</hi> a second edition appearing
                    in 1823. This was followed by a <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Sir Thomas Craig of
                    Riccarton,</hi> 1823; an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Revival of Greek
                    Literature in Italy,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Life of John Wickliff,</hi>
                    published anonymously, in 1826. The <hi rend="italic">History of Scotland</hi>
                    was undertaken at the suggestion of Sir Walter Scott, and occupied Tytler for
                    nearly twenty years, in the course of which he removed to London for convenience
                    of research. The first volume appeared in 1828, and the ninth and last in 1843.
                    The original investigations on which the work was founded gave it an authority
                    which no previous history of Scotland possessed, and the clear and graphic style
                    made it interesting and popular. The last few years of his life were spent in
                    physical prostration and mental depression, and he died at Great Malvern on 24th
                    December 1849.</p>
                <p>During the progress of his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> a large amount of other
                    work came from his pen, as the following list shows :— <hi rend="italic">Lives
                    of Scottish Worthies,</hi> for Murray’s <hi rend="italic">Family Library,</hi> 3
                    vols., 1831-33; <hi rend="italic">Historical View of the Progress of Discovery
                    in America,</hi> 1832, and <hi rend="italic">Life of Sir Walter Raleigh,</hi>
                    1833, for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Cabinet Library·, Life of Henry
                    VIII.</hi>, 1837; <hi rend="italic">England under the Reigns of Edward VI. and
                    Mary,</hi> from original letters, 2 vols., 1839; article “Scotland” in the
                    seventh edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica</hi>
                    (afterwards published separately as a school history); <hi rend="italic">Notes
                    on The Darnley Jewel,</hi> 1843; on the <hi rend="italic">Portraits of Mary
                    Queen of Scots,</hi> 1845 (privately printed); and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of
                    the War carried on in Scotland and Ireland, 1689-91, by General Mackay,</hi>
                    edited in conjunction with Hog and Urquhart, and presented to the Bannatyne and
                    Maitland Clubs in 1833.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">William Tytler</hi> (1711-1792), of Woodhouselee, writer
                    on historical and antiquarian subjects, was the son of Alexander Tytler, writer
                    in Edinburgh, and was born in that city on 12th October 1711. He was educated at
                    the High School and the university, and, having adopted his father’s profession,
                    was in 1744 admitted into the society of Writers to the Signet. While
                    successfully practising as a lawyer, he found time to devote attention to
                    historical investigation. In 1759 he published an <hi rend="italic">Inquiry,
                    Historical and Critical, into the Evidence against Mary Queen of Scots, and an
                    Examination of the Histories of Dr Robertson and Mr Hume with respect to that
                    Evidence.</hi> This work, which warmly defended the character of the queen, met
                    with great success. Four editions, the later ones considerably enlarged, were
                    published in the author’s lifetime; and it was translated into French. In 1783
                    he published the <hi rend="italic">Poetical Remains of James the First, King of
                    Scotland,</hi> to which he added a dissertation on the life and writings of the
                    royal author. He wrote an essay on “Scottish Music,” which was appended to
                    Arnot’s <hi rend="italic">History of Edinburgh.</hi> His “Dissertation on the
                    Marriage of Queen Mary to the Earl of Bothwell” and “Observations on the Vision,
                    a Poem,” appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Society of
                    Antiquaries of Scotland</hi> (1791-92). A paper in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lounger,</hi> on “Defects of Modern Female Education,” and an <hi rend="italic"
                    >Account of Fashionable Amusements in Edinburgh in the Seventeenth Century</hi>
                    complete the list of his works. He died at Edinburgh on 12th September 1792.</p>
