                <p><label type="entry">TEHERAN</label>, or, more properly, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tehran</hi> (lat. 35° 40' N., long. 51° 25' E.), for about a century the
                    recognized capital of Persia, has little to distinguish it, in general outward
                    appearance, from other large cities of the country, though in quite recent years
                    Parisian streets or boulevards, and even Western architecture for single houses,
                    in the midst of mud-brick palaces or plain mud hovels, have been incongruously
                    introduced. Formerly a kind of polygon some 4 miles in circumference—with its
                    mean “shahr panah” or wall, its clumsy and uneven ditch, and its six gates, two
                    facing north, two south, one east, and one west, —Teheran has now been extended
                    to an outer ditch and wall, thrown out on each side beyond the ancient limit.
                    The bazaars are good, though hardly of the first class; the caravanserais
                    deserve honourable mention; and the telegraph and arsenal are respectable
                    institutions. The streets are for the most part narrow and wretchedly paved. The
                    “Ark,” or citadel, contains the royal and better description of public
                    buildings, and connecting its encircling wall with the city gates are four
                    principal thoroughfares, of which the parallel avenues from the Nâsiriya and
                    Daulat entrances are the more notable. Between these two gates, in a
                    parallelogram extending from one to the other and including both, is the
                    gas-lighted Top Maidan, or “Place des Canons,” in the centre of which is a large
                    reservoir. European professors are to be found in the king’s college, where some
                    250 students, more or less, are taught mathematics, engineering, military
                    tactics, music, telegraphy, painting, together with the Arabic, English, French,
                    and Russian languages. Among the not very remarkable mosques—to some of which
                    <hi rend="italic">madrasahs,</hi> or colleges, are attached—may be specially
                    mentioned the Masjid-i-Shah, or king’s mosque, with its handsome enamelled
                    front, and the Masjid-i-Mâdar-i-Shah, or mosque of the king’s mother. Water is
                    freely supplied to the town by means of the underground canals, or <hi
                    rend="italic">hanats,</hi> from the near mountain ranges. Public baths abound,
                    but the Europeans use those of the Armenian and not of the Mohammedan community.
                    The British legation stands in a handsome garden of great size, in which are
                    placed the houses of the secretaries, which resemble English villas. In the
                    summer season the representatives of Western powers and other Europeans move out
                    to the slope of the mountain range north of Teheran,—the British residents to
                    Gulhak, a village about 7 miles from the city. A prominent feature in the
                    landscape at Gulhak and the neighbouring summer quarters, as at Teheran itself,
                    is Demavend, the noblest and most graceful of Persian mountains.</p>
                <p>The present population of Teheran may be taken at 160,000 at most. According to a
                    late authority (Bassett, 1887) the European inhabitants are reckoned at about
                    100 only; the Jews number some 2500; and there are 150 Gabrs or Parsis, a sorry
                    remnant of the old fireworshippers. In 1872 there were said to be 1000
                    Armenians, mainly traders and artisans. In 1872 there were but four legations in
                    Teheran—those of England, France, Russia, and Turkey. Since that year
                    representatives have been added from Holland, Austria, Germany, and the United
                    States. The French have summer quarters at Tejrish and the Russians at
                    Zargandah, at no great distance from the English Gulhak.</p>
                <p>Morier supposes Teheran to be the Tabors of the Theodosian Tables, and recognizes
                    it also in the account of the journey of the Castilian ambassadors to Timur.
                    Porter, too, relates that in 1637 the secretary of the Holstein ambassadors
                    mentions Teheran as “one of the towns which enjoy the privilege of maintaining
                    no soldiers.” Again, in the 17th century, it was visited by Pietro della Valle
                    and by Sir Thomas Herbert,—the latter spelling it “Tyroan.” Most writers affirm
                    that Teheran, though not of recent origin, can barely be held of repute till
                    Agha Muhammad made it his residence in about 1788, taking to himself the title
                    of shah, as first of the Kajar kings, in 1796. Yet there is evidence that in the
                    previous century it was a royal resort, if nothing more, in Herbert’s statement
                    that “the Toune is most beautified by a vast garden of the kings, succinct with
                    a great towered mud-wall larger than the circuit of the city.” Du Pré (who
                    visited it in 1808) states that it had been pillaged and nearly destroyed by the
                    Afghans,—evidently at their invasion of Persia in 1728. Since Agha Muhammad’s
                    time Teheran has been the usual seat of the Kajar dynasty, a circumstance to be
                    attributed to the political advantages of its geographical position.</p>
