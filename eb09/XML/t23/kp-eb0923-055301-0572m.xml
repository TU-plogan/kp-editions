                    regard to birds and spiders. Though noted for his learning and acute
                    observation, his studies in geographical distribution cannot be said to have led
                    to any very definite results. It is rather on account of his contributions to
                    aetiology that he deserves to be remembered, though his work in this department
                    has been to a great extent overlooked. In the first of his larger works, <hi
                    rend="italic">Biologie oder Philosophie der lebenden Natur,</hi> which appeared
                    from 1802-1805, he gave clear expression to the theory of “descent with
                    modification.” He believed that simple forms (Protists), which he termed
                    “zoophytes,” were “the primitive types from which all the organisms of the
                    higher classes had arisen by gradual development.” ‘ ‘ Every living creature has
                    a potentiality of endless modification of adapting its structure to the changes
                    in the external world.” He also maintained that each species has its day or
                    period, at the end of which it does not become extinct, but has simply ceased to
                    be, because it has become something else. That he stated the theory of descent
                    with much clearness, and with a sufficient background of actual knowledge of
                    forms, must be acknowledged by all; the only difficulty relates to the question
                    of priority. The first volume of his biology was published in 1802, but he
                    states that this had been written about 1796. Now it was not till 1801 that
                    Lamarck first began to free himself from the traditional dogma of the
                    immutability of species, and to publish his views of evolution. Neither Goethe
                    nor Oken can be said to have done much more than follow up the ironical
                    insinuations of Buffon (1753-76) and the ingenious suggestions of Erasmus
                    Darwin, whose <hi rend="italic">Zoonomia</hi> was translated <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n573/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0573-0554"/> into German between 1795 and 1797, while both
                    Treviranus and Lamarck tackled the problem not merely of the theory of descent
                    but of the mechanism of evolution. On this point the merits of Lamarck certainly
                    outweigh those of his contemporary. Treviranus laid down as a fundamental
                    proposition “that all living forms are the results of physical influences which
                    are still in operation, and vary only in degree and direction.” Like many after
                    him, he directed attention to the influence of the male elements in
                    fertilization as a source of variation, but laid emphasis only on the
                    intra-organismal power of adaptation to surroundings. Whatever opinion he
                    entertained in regard to the priority and the importance of the contribution
                    made by Treviranus to the theory of evolution, it is at least certain that he
                    was a learned naturalist and an acute thinker. His most important later work of
                    a synthetic nature was entitled <hi rend="italic">Erscheinungen und Gesetze des
