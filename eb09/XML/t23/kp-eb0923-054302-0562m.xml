                    evils occasioned during and by the great schism of the papacy, and by the
                    dissolution of lay and clerical morals to which the pagan temper of the
                    Renaissance had largely contributed. But the councils of Pisa, Constance, Basel,
                    Ferrara-Florence, and the Lateran had met and parted without attempting to deal
                    effectually with any of the practical scandals and abuses in the church which
                    were sapping the loyalty and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0563-0544"/> affection it had formerly enjoyed; and these
                    repeated failures, by destroying all hope of redress at the hands of the
                    constituted authorities, precipitated the crash of the Reformation, which was in
                    its inception scarcely concerned with doctrinal issues directly, but aimed
                    mainly at faults of administration and morals.</p>
                <p>Consequently a largely new problem presented itself for solution, and
                    necessitated a fundamental change in the attitude of those concerned. Hitherto,
                    whatever may have been the fierceness and bitterness of the disputes which the
                    15th-century councils had attempted to allay, they were, so to speak, family
                    quarrels between members of the same great household, accustomed to the same
                    mode of looking at religious questions, acknowledging the same hierarchy, and
                    accepting the same standards, and thus with a vast body of agreement to go upon
                    as a basis of reconciliation, leaving only comparatively minor details to be
                    adjusted. But the German and Swiss Reformation had generated new communions,
                    novel alike in their polity and much of their theology, and in active revolt,
                    not merely against this or that detail or abuse, but against the Roman Catholic
                    Church in its entirety, hierarchical, doctrinal, and political. The movement had
                    not been confined long to its earlier limits, but had spread over all western
                    Europe, had virtually conquered Holland and Scandinavia, was making great
                    strides in France and England, and was beginning to threaten even Italy and
                    Spain. Thus, the task was no longer the comparatively simple one of satisfying
                    the demands of friendly remonstrants, but of winning back alienated nations,
                    and, if that were too much to hope for, at least of saving the remnant of the
                    Roman obedience from further disintegration. And for this purpose it was no
                    longer sufficient, as it would have been a few years earlier, to discuss
                    administrative details alone, but a review of the whole theological fabric of
                    Latin Christianity, no part of which had been left wholly unimpeached, became a
                    necessary factor in any possible scheme of reconciliation. True, a precedent had
                    been set in the theological discussions at the council of Ferrara-Florence, with
                    its abortive effort to reunite Oriental and Latin Christendom, but the area and
                    number of differences to be reconciled upon that occasion were incomparably
                    smaller than those which had subsequently arisen, and the situation was thus one
                    of extreme difficulty and delicacy, since there was always the danger of
                    alienating many who had continued loyal so far, if very large concessions were
                    made to the revolted Protestants, not a few of whom, besides, had already passed
                    beyond the possibility of reconciliation. But, on the other hand, Luther had
                    himself appealed to a general council from the bull “Exsurge Domine” launched at
                    him by Leo X. in 1520, and his demand was taken up by the emperor and the
                    princes of Germany, whether Catholics or Protestants, as the only conceivable
                    means of terminating a crisis whose religious and political results might prove
                    far more serious than even the least hopeful ventured to forecast. There was
                    thus steady pressure from one side put upon the Roman curia to obtain the
                    convocation of such a council, while scarcely less resistance to the proposal
                    was offered by two very unlike parties in the Roman Church itself. For not only
                    did those oppose it who were interested in the maintenance of the principal
                    abuses complained of, and who feared that sweeping measures might be taken for
                    their abolition, but some of the ablest champions of internal reforms, such as
                    Cardinals Sadolet, Contarini, and Reginald Pole, were equally hostile to it, for
                    the very different reason that they believed any such council likely to contain
                    a majority determined on making it as abortive as those great synods had been
                    which were fresh in the memory of all. Accordingly, this section gave its voice
                    for the alternative scheme of proceeding by way of less formal conferences, at
                    which mutual explanations and concessions might be made by Catholics and
                    Protestants, whereby a <hi rend="italic">modus vivendi</hi> could be
                    established, with less chance of the whole effort being wrecked by the intrigues
                    of those who desired nothing less than practical reforms. A fresh difficulty was
                    presented by the opposition of the German princes to the assemblage of the
                    council at Rome or anywhere outside Germany, as they distrusted the probable
                    action of the Italian element, certain to preponderate in that event; and, as
                    the curia was equally bent on holding it within the sphere of direct papal
                    influence, this dispute made it impracticable to agree even on the preliminaries
                    during the pontificates of Hadrian VI. and Clement VII. The diet of Spires in
                    1529 renewed the demand for a general council, to be held in some large German
                    city; and the diet of Augsburg in 1530 summoned the Lutherans to return into
                    Catholic communion at once and unconditionally, leaving their doctrines
                    (formulated in the Confession of Augsburg that very year) to be judged of in a
                    future council, which the emperor Charles V. pledged himself to obtain within a
                    brief space. Clement V1I., then pope, was displeased at this initiative on the
                    emperor’s part, but offered to convoke a council in some Italian city, such as
                    Mantua or Milan, belonging to the empire, and outside the States of the
                    Church,—expressing his wish that Charles V. should personally attend it. But he
                    hampered this proposal with conditions which made it valueless for the main
                    object of such an assembly, by declaring that no theological questions upon
                    which the church had spoken could be reopened, and that, if Protestants were to
                    be admitted to the council at all, it must be, not as disputants, but as on
                    their trial, and pledged beforehand to submit to the decisions of the council.
                    No result, consequently, followed upon this step, nor was an embassy which
                    Clement sent in 1533 to the German princes and to the kings of France and
                    England with very similar provisions more successful, for it merely drew out a
                    peremptory rejection of the scheme from the Protestants assembled at Schmalkald,
                    by the emperor’s desire, for the purpose of discussing it. So the matter rested
                    till the accession of Alexander Farnese to the papal throne as Paul III. in
                    1534. A much abler man than his predecessor, he was also more alive to the
                    imperative need of at least appearing to approve some measure of reform, if the
                    church was to be saved from impending dangers (indeed, a report on this subject,
                    drawn up at his desire by a committee of cardinals in 1536, is one of the most
                    important documents of the era), and he was thought to be favourable to the
                    project of a council, whereas there is little doubt that Clement VII. had
                    weighted his acceptance of the plan with impossible conditions, in order to
                    avoid its realization, yet so as to let the responsibility of refusal rest with
                    others than himself. Paul III. sent Vergerio as envoy into Germany, to confer
                    with the emperor and the princes, offering to convoke a council at Mantua, and
                    urging the danger of attempting to hold it in Germany, by reason of the violent
                    lengths to which the Anabaptists were then proceeding. But, while the Catholic
                    princes were content with this offer, it was refused by the Protestants, and the
                    ambassadors of France and England supported them in their attitude. Vergerio,
                    who had also a fruitless interview with Luther, returned to Rome early in 1536,
                    but Paul III. was not discouraged by his failure, and proposed, in a consistory
                    on April 8, to convoke a council at Mantua. This plan was in turn upset, not
                    only by the continued resistance of the Protestants, but by the refusal of the
                    duke of Mantua to permit the use of his city for such a purpose, unless upon
                    conditions which the pope was unwilling to accept. Notice was accordingly given
                    of a council to be opened <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n564/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0564-0545"/> at Vicenza on May 1, 1538, and legates were
                    despatched thither to make the preliminary arrangements, and to preside so soon
                    as the members should assemble. But when the appointed time was only five days
                    off not one bishop had arrived, and the pope was forced to prorogue the council
                    again and again. Meanwhile, the method which Contarini and Sadolet had
                    recommended, that of conferences between the Catholics and Protestants, was
                    being acted on in Germany, and meetings of this nature were convened
                    successively at Haguenau, Worms, and Ratisbon, at the last of which, in 1541,
                    Contarini was present as legate of the pope, and showed so much tact,
                    moderation, and sympathy that he succeeded in securing a large measure of
                    agreement upon the controversies in dispute, notably on the vexed question of
                    Justification. But, as his concessions and explanations were promptly repudiated
                    at Rome, no practical result followed. In 1542 Paul III. sent Morone as his
                    envoy to the diet of Spires to offer Trent as his final concession of the place
                    of assembly, on the ground that its position in Tyrol, and its being part of the
                    dominions of the king of the Romans, ought to meet all the reasonable
                    requirements of the German princes. Ferdinand, king of the Romans, who presided
                    at the diet, was content with this offer, as were the Catholic princes
                    generally, but the Protestants continued to object, and refused any council
                    which should not be completely free from papal influence and authority. However,
                    the pope issued, on May 22, 1542, a bull appointing the meeting of the council
                    for November 1 following. He sent three legates to Trent to make
                    preparations,—Morone, Parisio, and Reginald Pole; but they did not reach the
                    city till three weeks later than the appointed date for opening the council, and
                    so few bishops arrived during seven months from that time that it was necessary
                    to prorogue the assembly. In fact, the idea of the council was distasteful to a
                    very large proportion of the Latin clergy, especially such as apprehended danger
                    to their private interests from the reforming plans of the pope, and also such
                    as were alarmed lest serious religious innovations might be made in order to
                    conciliate the Protestants. While this delay continued, another diet at
                    &gt;Spires in 1544 resulted in great advantages to the Lutherans, who availed
                    themselves of the political straits of Charles V. to extort several important
                    concessions from him. The obnoxious edicts passed against them at Worms and
                    Augsburg were rescinded; they were permitted to retain such ecclesiastical
                    property as they had seized; they were made eligible for such civil and
                    ecclesiastical offices as had been previously barred against them; and general
                    toleration for the time being was established. This policy was extremely
                    distasteful to the pope, who addressed a brief to the emperor, strongly
                    remonstrating against it, and renewing his offer of a council. Charles V., who
                    had not been a free agent in the matter, was much of the pope’s mind, and
                    proceeded to relieve himself of one difficulty in the way of reversing his
                    action, by concluding peace with Francis I. of France on September 8, 1544.
                    Hereupon Paul III. directed public thanksgivings to be offered throughout the
                    whole Latin Church, and issued a bull removing the suspension of the council,
                    and summoning it to meet at Trent on March 15,1545. Unable from age and illness
                    to be present himself, as he had wished, he named Giammaria del Monte, bishop of
                    Palestrina (afterwards Pope Julius I1I.), Marcello Cervini (afterwards Pope
                    Marcellus IL), and Reginald Pole as his legates. The experience of former
                    abortive openings was repeated, for they found but one bishop awaiting them, and
                    so few continued to arrive that a fresh prorogation was forced upon the legates,
                    and the pope, in the bull authorizing this action, added a proviso that no
                    proxies should be received, but that all bishops summoned should attend in
                    person, under severe penalties for contumacy. On November 7, 1545, the legates
                    received final instructions to open the council upon December 13, and did so
                    with solemn ceremonial, but only as a formal initiative of the proceedings, for
                    the first session was postponed till January 7, 1546. When that time arrived, no
                    more than some five and twenty archbishops and bishops, five generals of
                    religious orders, and the ambassadors of King Ferdinand had assembled, and none
                    of the conciliar officers had yet been nominated, nor any programme of procedure
                    sketched out. The most important question arising under this last head was
                    whether the voting should be taken by nations, as at the council of Constance,
                    or by individuals, and the matter was referred to the pope, who gave his
                    decision for the latter, as at once the more ancient (since Constance and Basel
                    were the only precedents for the national vote) and the more convenient.
                    Moreover, this ruling secured from the outset a working majority of Italian
                    bishops in the assembly, at once by reason of the small size of the average
                    Italian diocese, and of the greater ease with which Trent could be reached from
                    Italy than from any other country which sent representatives thither, besides
                    enabling the pope to swell the majority (as in the Vatican council three
                    centuries later) with bishops <hi rend="italic">in partibus,</hi> having no
                    dioceses or jurisdiction, thus amply justifying the objection taken all along by
                    the German Protestants to the assemblage of the council anywhere outside
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>Some preliminaries had to be settled before the second session, and the plan of
                    holding private “general congregations,” where theologians of non-episcopal rank
                    could sit and share in the discussion and preparation of the decrees to be
                    proposed and voted on in public session, was at once adopted and observed
                    thenceforward. And first, the question was raised whether any persons except
                    bishops should be allowed to vote upon matters of doctrine. The decision was
                    that the vote should be allowed to the generals of religious orders also, and
                    that the right of the proxies of absent bishops to vote should be referred to
                    the pope. The title to be given to the council at the head of the decrees in
                    each session was then discussed, and a proposal to add the words “representing
                    the church universal” (as at Basel and Constance) to the usual formula “general
                    and oecumenical” was rejected at the instance of the legates, as indirectly
                    menacing to papal autocracy. The legates also privately informed the pope that
                    the majority of the members desired to take up the question of practical reforms
                    before that of doctrine, and that it might be necessary to yield the point to
                    avoid scandal or the imputation of sympathy with abuses, but that they would
                    insist, in that case, on making the measures of reform apply all round, to
                    princes and laymen as well as to ecclesiastics, which would probably damp the
                    ardour of its advocates.</p>
                <p>The actual business of the second session (January 7, 1546) was confined to the
                    promulgation of a decree touching the discipline to be observed by the members
                    of the council during its progress, as well in the matters of their private
                    devotion and their food as in the conduct of the debates. The congregations
                    which preceded the third session were mainly occupied with debating the thorny
                    question of the order in which the discussion of faith and of discipline was to
                    come, and it was at last agreed to take them simultaneously.</p>
                <p>So few additional bishops had arrived up to this time that it was judged
                    inexpedient to promulgate any decrees in the third session (February 4, 1548),
                    and little was done except the public recitation of the
                    Niceno-Constantinopolitan creed as the authoritative confession of the Roman
                    Church, and, as the council worded it, “that firm and only foundation against
                    which the gates of hell shall not prevail.” A fortnight after this third session
                    Martin Luther died (February 18, 1546), just as the situation in Germany was
                    becoming more strained, and the emperor, alarmed at the rapid advance of
                    Reformed opinions and practices (notably in the Palatinate, where the elector
                    had made large concessions), was taking measures for suppressing the religious
                    revolt by force of arms. The canon of Scripture was proposed in the
                    congregations before the fourth session as the subject for discussion, and the
                    three following questions were raised :—(1) Were all the books of both
                    Testaments to be approved and received? (2) Was there to be a fresh inquiry into
                    their canonical character before giving such approval? (3) Should there be any
                    distinction drawn between the books, as being some of them read merely for moral
                    instruction, and others for proving the doctrines of Christian belief? The first
                    of these questions was decided affirmatively. The second led to much debate<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n565/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0565-0546"/>; the conclusion arrived at was that a secret
                    examination of the evidence should be made, but not suffered to appear in the
                    public acts of the council. The third question was decided negatively. These
                    congregations were the first wherein theological experts and canonists, not
                    being members of the council, were admitted to a share in the discussions. The
                    nature and function of tradition was also debated at this time, and the legates
                    informed the pope that there was a strong tendency in the council to set it
                    aside altogether, and to make Scripture the sole standard of appeal. Another
                    burning question debated was that of vernacular translation and lay study of
                    Scripture. The result, in the fourth session (April 8, 1546), was the
                    promulgation of two decrees, the first of which enacts, under anathema, that
                    Scripture and tradition are to be received and venerated equally, and that the
                    deutero-canonical books are part of the canon of Scripture. The second decree
                    declared the Vulgate to be the sole authentic and standard Latin version, and
                    gave it such authority as to supersede the original texts; forbade the
                    interpretation of Scripture contrary to the sense received by the church, "or
                    even contrary to the unanimous consent of the fathers”; imposed various
                    restrictions upon printers and vendors of Bibles; made licences to read any
                    Biblical manuscript or publication compulsory; and prohibited the application of
                    Scripture language to profane and superstitious purposes. The subjects next
                    taken up were the doctrine of original sin and the reformation of abuses
                    concerned with preachers and lecturers, which were made the matter of two
                    decrees in the fifth session (June 17, 1546). The most noticeable point in the
                    former is the saving clause, whereby the tenet of the Immaculate Conception of
                    the Blessed Virgin is excepted from decision, and left open; the latter enjoins
                    the erection of a lectureship of Scripture in all cathedrals, collegiate
                    churches, and monasteries, imposes the duty of preaching upon all bishops and
                    persons with cure of souls, lays down stringent rules as to preaching licences,
                    and forbids the “questors” (that is, the collectors of alms commissioned by the
                    mendicant orders) to preach anywhere. There was a treaty concluded between the
                    pope and the emperor a few days after this session, to make war against the
                    German Protestants on the express ground of their refusal to submit to the
                    council, and from this may be dated the end of any serious effort in the council
                    itself to deal with the question of reconciliation, although the original motive
                    for its convocation. Moreover, so little interest was felt even by the Roman
                    episcopate in the proceedings at Trent that, instead of fresh accessions coming
                    to recruit the small numbers present, constant defections took place, and a
                    proposal to stop this by forbidding any bishop to quit Trent without formal
                    permission was carried. The doctrine of Justification, made a burning question
                    by the prominence given to it in Lutheran theology, was next taken up, and, this
                    being, so to speak, a new controversy, with few precedents to guide the council,
                    the discussion was proportionably protracted. It is noteworthy that Luther’s
                    views found some supporters, and the resignation of the legateship at this time
                    by Reginald Pole, and his departure from the council, never to return, is
                    attributed to his dissatisfaction with the conclusions arrived at upon this
                    subject in its decree. The disciplinary question discussed at this time was that
                    of the obligation of residence, especially as regards bishops; and decrees upon
                    both these subjects were promulgated in the sixth session (January 13,
                    1547),—that on Justification being a formal dogmatic treatise in sixteen
                    chapters, thirty-three canons; that on residence reviving former canons, and
                    imposing new penalties, but avoiding the solution of a question hotly debated in
                    the council, whether the residence of bishops was obligatory <hi rend="italic"
                    >jure divino,</hi> or merely by ecclesiastical precept. Meanwhile, Charles V.
                    was victorious in his war with the Protestants, and had all Germany in his
                    power, but, instead of using the opportunity, as the pope expected, to put down
                    the Reformers, he alleged that the recent war had not been one of religion, and
                    assumed an attitude of toleration. Hereupon Paul III., in order to break up this
                    truce, sent instructions to the legates to press on decrees displeasing to the
                    Protestants, judging that the emperor’s well-known interest in the council would
                    cause him to be accounted responsible for its measures, and thus lose all credit
                    for his recent forbearance. In the seventh session, held on March 3, 1547, two
                    decrees were promulgated,—one defining the sacraments as seven in number, and as
                    being all channels of grace, also adding special canons concerning baptism and
                    confirmation; the other dealing with pluralities, unions of benefices, repair of
                    churches, and kindred matters, but with no great stringency. A more important
                    part of the business of this session was the open declaration of a measure which
                    the pope and the legates had been privately planning for some time, the
                    transference of the council from Trent to some city more directly under papal
                    control; for, while Trent sufficed for headquarters as against Protestants, yet
                    it was found that a virtual coalition between the Spanish, French, and German
                    bishops to resist the Italians interfered with the intentions of the papal
                    court, and could be most effectively broken up by a change of place. Occasion
                    was accordingly taken from an outbreak of disease, alleged to be infectious, at
                    Trent to issue a bull transferring the council to Bologna, which was read in the
                    seventh session, while the promulgation of a decree in accordance with it formed
                    the whole business of the eighth session (March 11, 1547). When it had been
                    passed, the legates produced a brief which they had obtained more than two years
                    before, empowering them to transfer the council as they pleased. But, while they
                    themselves quitted Trent the next day, and were followed by the majority of the
                    bishops, those of the emperor’s party continued in session at Trent, and refused
                    to leave it without the permission of their sovereign, though they abstained
                    from all conciliar action, in order to avoid the charge of schism. Charles V.,
                    incensed at the pope’s action, sent a mandate approving and confirming their
                    conduct. The ninth session, held at Bologna (April 21, 1547), and the tenth also
                    (June 2, 1547), were merely formal, nothing being done save to prorogue the
                    council. The practical result of this split in the council was to relieve the
                    Protestants from imminent peril; for, while the emperor’s successes enabled him
                    to put severe pressure upon them to submit to its decrees, it was itself
                    incapacitated for valid action, as neither the bishops at Bologna nor those at
                    Trent could claim to be the whole council, nor demand acceptance of their acts
                    as binding. Hence Charles V. was urgent for the return of the entire body to
                    Trent, and threatened, in case of refusal, to go to Rome, and hold the council
                    there himself. And he took an even more peremptory step by constituting himself
                    arbiter of the whole controversy, appointing Julius Pflug, bishop of Naumburg, a
                    prelate known to be friendly to the Lutherans, Michael Holding, called Sidonius,
                    afterwards bishop of Merseburg, and John Agricola, a Lutheran writer of some
                    mark, to draft an eirenicon upon the points in dispute, which was published
                    under the title of the "Interim,” by the emperor’s authority, at the diet of
                    Augsburg, May 15, 1548. It proved, however, inefficacious, and was formally
                    repudiated and answered by the Catholic princes and states of the empire, and
                    yet more peremptorily by the Protestants, its only result being the
                    “In-terimistic controversy.” It was succeeded by another formulary concerning
                    reformation, accepted by the diet. While the emperor was endeavouring to force
                    the “Interim” upon his dominions, the pope, on his part, strove to remove the
                    dead-lock of the divided council, and convoked a committee to consist of members
                    of both the Bolognese and the Tridentine sections to confer upon ecclesiastical
                    reforms. But the bishops at Trent, having communicated with the emperor, and
                    waited three weeks for his sanction, refused to leave that city, and the pope
                    was compelled to direct the legates at Bologna to dismiss the bishops assembled
                    there, and to announce the suspension of the council, which was accordingly done
                    upon September 17, 1549. Paul III. died on November 10, 1549, and was succeeded
                    on February 7, 1550, by Cardinal del Monte, the chief legate at the council, who
                    took the title of Julius III. The break in the continuity of the council
                    occasioned by these proceedings lasted till May 1, 1551, when the eleventh
                    session was held at Trent under the presidency of Cardinal Crescenzio, sole
                    legate in title, but with two nuncios, Pighini and Lippomani, as co-ordinate
                    assessors. It was merely formal, as was also the twelfth session, on September
                    1, 1551. Just at this time Henry II., king of France, having quarrelled with the
                    pope about the duchy of Parma, sent an envoy to the council at Trent, with
                    letters styling it a “convention,” denying its oecumenical character, declaring
                    that it was not accessible to himself or to the French bishops, and notifying a
                    protest against the validity of its proceedings, which he desired might be
                    registered, and a copy of the register returned to him. No reply was made to
                    this demand; so Henry dismissed the papal nuncio from his court, and published a
                    manifesto to justify himself, at the same time that, in order to repel any
                    charge of sympathy with the Protestants, he promulgated a severe edict against
                    them. But the absence of French bishops, and the comparatively scanty attendance
                    from Germany, threw matters more than ever into the hands of the Italian
                    majority, as appeared from the decrees promulgated in the thirteenth session
                    (October 11, 1551), and indeed from the attitude taken up by the legates just
                    before it. For the obstinate refusal of the Protestants to attend or even
                    recognize the council was on the point of giving way, and the imperial
                    ambassadors demanded a safe-conduct for such as might present themselves, with
                    some warranty that it should be really safe. They also desired the postponement
                    of any decision on the doctrine of the Eucharist, and especially as regards the
                    communion of the laity in the chalice. The pope expressed himself willing to
                    grant both these demands, but no real attention was paid to either of them. As
                    respects the attendance of the Protestants, the letters of Francis Vargas,
                    fiscal (attorney-general) in Spain to Charles V., and his agent at the council,
                    state plainly that the legates merely pretended to desire it, and were secretly
                    doing everything to prevent it, while the very points as to which delay had been
                    promised were made the subject of the decrees in the above-named session. The
                    decree on the Eucharist was specially directed against Lutheran and Zwinglian
                    opinions then recently broached, and was couched in eight chapters with eleven
                    canons appended. It reasserted the doctrine of Transubstantiation, already
                    defined by the fourth Lateran council in 1216, while, by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n566/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0566-0547"/> the third of the canons, which declares that the
                    whole sacrament is entire in each kind, it indirectly, though effectively, ruled
                    against the grant of the chalice to the laity; and in fact the Reformed thesis
                    that they were entitled to it by divine right, and could not be debarred from it
                    without sin, was unanimously condemned in the previous congregation. Some
                    unimportant decrees affecting the criminal jurisdiction of bishops, and for
                    referring the trials of bishops themselves to the pope, were enacted at the same
                    time; but more noteworthy was a decree for postponing the decision upon lay and
                    infant communion, and for granting a safe-conduct to the Protestants, which was
                    the last business transacted upon this occasion. But the safe-conduct was worded
                    so as to excite general and reasonable suspicion on the part of those to whom it
                    was offered, and Vargas, who was no friend to their opinions, comments freely
                    upon its deceptive ambiguity. In the fourteenth session (November 25, 1551)
                    decrees upon penance and extreme unction, prepared in the congregations, and
                    embodied in twelve chapters upon the former and three on the latter topic,
                    followed severally by fifteen and four canons, were promulgated. Some
                    disciplinary enactments affecting the clergy, and corrective of minor abuses,
                    were enacted at the same time, the most important provisions being the abolition
                    of the papal dispensations exempting their holders from the jurisdiction of the
                    ordinary, and the restriction of the action of titular bishops. But the
                    reforming party in the council was much discontented with the inadequacy of
                    these measures, which added little to the very small progress made so far in the
                    revival of discipline. Although no Protestant theologians had yet presented
                    themselves at Trent, representatives of the duke of Würtemberg arrived at this
                    time, who were instructed to lay the Wurtemberg Confession before the council,
                    and to say that Protestant divines who could give explanations of it were
                    waiting some forty miles from Trent, and were prepared to attend the council so
                    soon as a safe-conduct exactly conformable with that granted to the Bohemians by
                    the council of Basel was issued, and on the further conditions that the
                    discussions actually going on should be suspended and all the matters so far
                    decided be reopened, that the pope should cease to preside by legates or
                    otherwise, but declare his own submission to the decrees of the council, and
                    absolve the bishops from their oath of allegiance to himself in order to secure
                    their liberty of action. The envoys refused to treat with the legates at all,
                    and conducted their negotiations through the imperial ambassadors. Crescenzio
                    was very angry, and refused all concession, even going so far as to abstract the
                    conciliar seal, lest the safe-conduct might be granted; but pressure was put
                    upon him by the imperial ambassadors, and he was forced to consent to the
                    admission of the Protestant envoys at a private congregation to be held in his
                    own house, though he resisted the demand for introducing them to a public
                    session. And, when the safe-conduct was recast, it was found to differ seriously
                    from that proposed as its model, especially by failing to give the Protestants
                    the rights of session and suffrage, of observiug their own religion in their
                    houses, and of being guaranteed against insults to their creed. To the
                    remonstrances made in consequence the legate returned a peremptory reply,
                    refusing to make any further change, and only the instances of the emperor, then
                    at Innsbruck, but three days’ journey from Trent, induced the Protestant envoys
                    to remain a little longer, to find if any better terms could be obtained. Some
                    more Protestant envoys from Strasburg and other cities, and from Maurice of
                    Saxony, arrived early in 1552, and were admitted to a congregation held on
                    January 24, where they renewed the demands already mentioned, and required also
                    that the decrees of Constance and Basel, declaring the pope inferior and subject
                    to a general council, should be reaffirmed. They were promised an answer in due
                    time, and the fifteenth session was held the next day (January 25, 1552),
                    wherein the council was prorogued, and a safe-conduct more in accordance with
                    the Protestant demands was drawn up and published. It is remarkable, however,
                    for one omission, and for one significant clause. The omission is that of
                    toleration for the private exercise of their religion; the insertion is a
                    proviso pledging the council not to avail itself, “for this one occasion,” of
                    any laws or canons whatever, “especially those of Constance and Siena,” as
                    against the Protestants. The reference is to the canon of Constance by means of
                    which John Huss was tried and burnt, declaring a safe-conduct no protection
                    against trial for heresy, even if the accused has come in reliance on the
                    safe-conduct, and would not have come without it, which canon was reaffirmed at
                    the council of Siena in 1423. While the negotiations occasioned by these
                    proceedings were in course, war broke out anew in Germany, and Maurice of Saxony
                    obtained considerable successes over the emperor, took Augsburg, and was
                    marching down upon Tyrol, so that Charles V. fled in haste from Innsbruck, and
                    the legate convened the sixteenth session (April 28, 1552) of the council,
                    wherein a decree was promulgated suspending it for two years in consequence of
                    the perils of war. There was a general stampede from Trent at once, and the
                    legate Crescenzio, then very ill, had just strength to reach Verona, where he
                    died three days after his arrival.</p>
                <p>So ended what is styled by some historians, and correctly, the first council of
                    Trent, for, although the usual computation recognizes only one such council, yet
                    an interruption of ten years, a widely changed personality, and a marked
                    alteration in tone make the resumed synod virtually another assembly, and one by
                    no means entitled to the degree of respect which the ability and learning of
                    many members of that first convoked won for it. When the council dispersed,
                    Julius III. at once in consistory repeated the policy of Paul III., and
                    nominated a committee to prepare a scheme of reform, but it never took action of
                    any kind; and at the close of the two years’ suspension of the council the
                    question was put in consistory as to the resumption of the sessions, and
                    decided, with the pope’s approval, in the negative. Julius III. died on March
                    23, 1555, and was succeeded on April 11, 1555, by Cardinal Marcello Cervini, one
                    of the former legates at the council, a man of high reputation for personal
                    devoutness and freedom from that sympathy with abuses which marked too many of
                    the dignitaries of the time. He took the title of Marcellus IL, and his first
                    public utterance was to intimate his purpose of reassembling the council, and of
                    carrying out a plan of thorough reform in discipline, particularly directed to
                    abating the pomp and luxury of the prelacy. But he was in feeble health when
                    elected, and the fatigues of his new position brought on an attack of apoplexy
                    which carried him off three weeks after his accession. In his room was chosen,
                    on May 23, 1555, Cardinal Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, who took the title of Paul
                    IV. He was known to profess great austerity of life, to have actually founded
                    the Theatines, an ascetic community, and to be a stern and implacable advocate
                    for several measures of repression against innovators in matters of religion or
                    impugners of papal prerogative, as he quickly showed by setting up the
                    Inquisition in Rome, and taking care that it should not be idle. His election
                    consequently caused much alarm, and was especially displeasing to the emperor;
                    and the earlier acts of his pontificate seemed to justify the estimate formed of
                    his character and the fears of those who apprehended that he would proceed to
                    reform discipline in a swifter and more drastic fashion than had hitherto been
                    essayed. For in fact he pledged himself to this effect in the first bull
                    published after his accession, following it up with a show of activity by at
                    once setting some minor reforms on foot.</p>
                <p>During these three years important events had taken place in Germany. By the
                    peace of Passau in 1552, the Protestants of the Augsburg Confession were secured
                    from all molestation, and in the free exercise of their religion and of their
                    civil rights, and this was followed up by a decree of the diet of Augsburg, on
                    September 25, 1555, that, failing a national council to settle the religious
                    disputes, the emperor, the king of the Romans, and the other Catholic princes
                    should not interfere in any way with the religious liberties of the Lutherans
                    holding to the Confession of Augsburg, provided they in their turn would exhibit
                    equal tolerance towards Catholics; that no penalty, save the loss of benefices,
                    should be imposed on any Catholic ecclesiastics joining the Lutheran body; and
                    that such benefices as the Protestants had already annexed for the support of
                    their schools and ministers should remain in their possession. Paul IV. was much
                    incensed at these proceedings, and used all efforts to procure their repeal, on
                    the failure of which he openly broke with the emperor, formed an alliance with
                    the French king against him, and imprisoned the cardinals and other personages
                    of the imperial party on whom he could lay hands, confiscating the property of
                    such as saved themselves by flight. He continued for a time in the measures of
                    reform with which <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n567/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0567-0548"/> he began his reign, striking against jobbery,
                    pluralities, dispensations, and laxity of clerical manners; but all this
                    short-lived zeal was speedily neutralized by his nepotism, surpassing that of
                    any of his predecessors, and throwing the government of the States of the Church
                    into the hands of his dissolute nephews, upon whom he rained all the wealth,
                    honours, and authority in his power to bestow. And, as was to be expected, he
                    set himself steadily to oppose every one of the class of reforms which touched
                    doctrinal questions, just those for which the Protestants were urgent,
                    encouraging only such as promoted the unity and discipline of the Roman Church
                    itself, and made it more capable of effective resistance to the Reformation. He
                    was not favourable to the reassembling of the council, not merely because of his
                    experience of its languid action, nor even his dislike of the struggles of the
                    non-Italian minority to assert some measure of independence against the coercive
                    tutelage exerted by the several papal legates from the very first, but because
                    he regarded himself as the sole and proper person to consider such matters at
                    all, and a bull of his own promulgation a better mode of procedure, at once in
                    fulness of authority and swiftness of formulation, than any conciliar decree.
                    Consequently, no step for the resumption of the council was taken during his
                    reign, which ended on August 18, 1559. After a longer interregnum than usual,
                    Giovanni Angelo de’ Medici (not a member of the great Florentine house, but of
                    humble Milanese extraction) was elected on December 26, 1559, as Pius IV.
                    Markedly unlike his predecessor in almost every personal quality, he was much
                    his superior in practical shrewdness and tact, and had none of that dislike to a
                    council which Paul IV. had shown. So great, too, had been the strides made by
                    the Reformation during his predecessor’s reign that he might well think Paul
                    IV.’s policy undesirable, and he had this special motive for reversing it, that
                    a movement was going on in France for the convocation of a national council
                    there to consider the whole religious situation, which might very conceivably
                    result in a revolt like that of England from the Roman obedience. Accordingly,
                    Pius IV. determined on the resumption of the council of Trent, and issued a bull
                    on November 29, 1560, convoking it anew.</p>
                <p>But the whole face of Western Christendom, the whole religious situation, had
                    materially changed since the original assemblage of the synod in 1545. First,
                    the imposing personality of Charles V. was removed from the scene, and Ferdinand
                    I., his successor, enjoyed neither his personal ascendency nor his political
                    power, and could not be accounted as a possible competitor with the pope for the
                    first place in the Catholic world, nor even as an ally with means for crushing
                    the Reformation. Next, the Reformation itself was by this time an accomplished
                    fact, a consummated revolt from mediaeval Christianity. It had taken definite
                    shape in various countries; it had its own theological systems and traditions;
                    besides that a whole generation had now grown up under its influence, never
                    having had any personal associations with Latin Christianity. And, on the other
                    hand, the very lengths to which some of the Reformers had gone in their revolt
                    generated a corresponding reaction in the Roman Church, so that many influential
                    persons who had been in favour of moderate reforms and of explaining disputed
                    points of theology were convinced that no limits could be logically or
                    practically set to concessions in this direction, and therefore that it was
                    necessary to make a stand against any concessions at all. And, what is more, one
                    noticeable effect of the wave of controversy which had swept over western Europe
                    was to accentuate points of difference, to close questions previously open, to
                    make the current beliefs more incisive and, so to speak, legal in form, to
                    diminish seriously the neutral area between the competing religious systems, and
                    thus to bring them face to face as irreconcilable foes. One factor more, of
                    greater importance at the time than any other, contributed to the revolution
                    which is marked by the second council of Trent. As Spain took the political lead
                    in the earlier half of the 16th century, so it took also the lead in theology.
                    The Spanish divines were abler and more learned than all save the very foremost
                    in any other country, and their influence was throughout the greatest at the
                    council of Trent on purely theological issues. Now, the political and the
                    theological genius of Spain had both just found their highest exponent in one
                    person and the organization which he devised, Ignatius Loyola and the Company of
                    the Jesuits. Two of his immediate disciples and recruits, Salmeron and Laynez,
                    were chosen to be the pope’s theologians at the council of Trent, and exercised
                    a greater influence than any other divines there in the formulation of its
                    dogmatic decrees. But the Jesuits were to do more than this. The militant spirit
                    of their founder had nothing in common with the alarm and vacillation which had
                    for the most part marked the action of the Roman Church in dealing with the
                    Lutheran and Calvinist revolt; and, instead of being content with devising
                    schemes for standing on the defensive, and saving the remnant yet left to the
                    Roman obedience, he conceived the bolder and safer plan of vigorous aggression,
                    to reconquer all that had been lost, and to add fresh acquisitions thereto. The
                    Counter-Reformation which he initiated was in full operation when the second
                    council of Trent assembled, and it was by this spirit that it was guided in its
                    deliberations and decrees. The very thought of compromise was abandoned in fact,
                    if not in open expression, and the only reforms thenceforward taken into
                    consideration were such as would remove causes of weakness and scandal in the
                    Latin Church, enabling it, without sacrificing one of its claims, to overcome by
                    superior mass and discipline, by closer unity and more organized enthusiasm, the
                    heterogeneous, disordered, and already dissociated forces of Protestantism. The
                    most obvious effect of these principles upon the second council of Trent was
                    that the diminution, the all but disappearance, of variety of opinion amongst
                    its members, and the resolution to crush Protestantism rather than to parley
                    with it in any scheme of mutual concession or accommodation, tended to shorten
                    the preliminary discussions in a marked degree, so that little is to be noted of
                    the long and animated debates of the earlier period, and the last few sessions
                    exhibit even tokens of actual hurry to end the matter anyhow.</p>
                <p>There was no intention on the pope’s part to proclaim the Counter-Reformation as
                    the policy of the council, even if it may be safely assumed that he could
                    predict its action, and he sent nuncios to the Protestant sovereigns as well as
                    to the Catholics to signify the approaching resumption of its sittings. Francis
                    II. of France had died between the promulgation of the bull and its notification
                    in France, but the young king Charles IX., by the advice of the parlement of
                    Paris, directed all the bishops of the kingdom to be in readiness for journeying
                    to Trent. Three nuncios were despatched to Germany, but the princes assembled in
                    diet at Naumburg received them unfavourably, asserting anew their determination
                    to recognize no council which did not avow Scripture as its standard of appeal
                    and give right of free discussion to Protestants, denying the right of any one
                    save the emperor to convene a general council at all, and inveighing strongly
                    against the papacy. The king of Denmark declined to admit the nuncio on any
                    terms, declaring that neither he nor his father had ever had any dealings with
                    the pope; and Martinenghi, the nuncio commissioned to Elizabeth of England, was
                    stopped by a messenger while still on the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n568/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0568-0549"/> Continental side of the Channel, and informed
                    that he would not be permitted to land on the English coast. The free cities of
                    the empire also refused the summons, as did five of the Swiss cantons; and even
                    a large number of Roman Catholic prelates, while professing unqualified
                    obedience to the pope’s commands, showed much unwillingness to act upon them,
                    and pleaded age, illness, or diocesan business as excuses for absenting
                    themselves from the council. In this unpromising posture of affairs the
                    preparations for the council were pressed on, and Cardinals Ercole Gonzaga,
                    bishop of Mantua, Seripando, Hosius, Simoneta, and (later on) Altemps, the
                    pope’s nephew, were named as legates, being directed to open the session of the
                    council upon Easter Day, April 6, 1561. But they did not even arrive in Trent
                    until April 16, and found no more than nine bishops awaiting them. Several
                    causes conduced to this disappointment: the king of Spain had not yet accepted
                    the bull convoking the council; the French bishops were more than fully occupied
                    with the rapid advances of the Reformation in their midst; and the Germans had
                    no great inclination for the repetition of their experience ten years before. It
                    was thus necessary to postpone the assemblage till January 1 and then to January
                    18, 1562. That there might be a sufficient number of Italian bishops present to
                    outvote any possible combination of others, the pope collected a large number of
                    prelates, appointed them salaries for maintenance, and sent them off to Trent.
                    Two questions of the highest practical importance came up for discussion in the
                    preliminary congregation, wherein ninety-two bishops were present:—(1) Was the
                    council to be styled a “continuation” of the previous one, or to be reckoned as
                    a new synod? (2) Should the unprecedented clause in the papal decree for opening
                    the council (but not found in the bull of convocation), “proponentibus legatis
                    ac praesidentibus,” be accepted and acted on, or rescinded? To declare the
                    council a “continuation” of its precursor was to accept and ratify all which had
                    been done therein; to treat it as a new one was to make every decree of the
                    earlier sessions merely provisional and alterable. To adopt the novel clause
                    embodied in the papal decree was to gag the council from the outset and deprive
                    it of freedom by concentrating the initiative in the hands of the legates; and
                    Guerrero, archbishop of Granada, pressed this objection with much urgency. On
                    the other hand, this same prelate, acting on the orders of Philip II., demanded
                    that the council should be plainly declared a continuation of its precursor, for
                    Philip had already introduced some of the regulations of that synod into his
                    dominions, and would lose credit if they were rescinded, or even treated as
                    lacking full sanction. Contrariwise, the bishops of other nations present held
                    that there was no prospect of inducing the Germans, English, and other partly
                    alienated nationalities to send representatives, unless the proceedings so far
                    should be regarded as capable of reconsideration and alteration at the hands of
                    the actual assembly. The authorities at Rome were not unprepared for some
                    difficulty on this head, and had endeavoured to evade it by using the
                    indeterminate word “celebrated,” which might be taken either way, and the
                    Spanish remonstrants were privately told that it was understood that business
                    should be taken up just where it had left off under Julius III., thus making the
                    synod a continuation of the former one, but that any express statement to that
                    effect had been carefully avoided, lest the Protestants should take offence, and
                    thus one aim of the council might be defeated. The Spaniards were partly
                    contented with this reply, but urged that nothing which could be interpreted as
                    the convocation of a new council should be suffered to appear in the wording of
                    the decree about to be publicly read, which was conceded.</p>
                <p>The seventeenth session was held (January 18, 1562) in the presence of the
                    legates,—106 bishops, 4 abbots, 4 generals of orders, and the duke of Mantua,
                    nephew of the chief legate, being present. Four Spanish bishops lodged a protest
                    against the proposing clause —two of them unreservedly, two in a more qualified
                    manner—and they particularly objected to the novelty of the clause, and to the
                    manner in which it had been sprung upon the council, the archbishop of Granada
                    and the bishop of Orense pointing out that it was not in the original bull, with
                    which the subsequent decree ought to be in complete agreement, and the former
                    adding that it was not even in the copy of the decree shown to him. But the
                    Italian majority was too strong, and the protest was overruled,— the prorogation
                    of the council to February 26, 1562, being the only further business transacted.
                    But a very important question was laid before the congregations which followed
                    this session, that of providing some remedy for the injury done to the Roman
                    Catholic Church by the circulation of more or less hostile books, a difficulty
                    made incomparably greater from the middle of the 15th century onwards than at
                    any previous time in history, by reason of the invention of printing. The
                    council of Lateran in 1515 had made a licence from the ecclesiastical
                    authorities requisite before any book could be printed, under pain of
                    excommunication, but this penalty did not affect Protestant printers, and the
                    issue of a catalogue of books forbidden to Catholics became a necessary
                    addition. Such a catalogue was issued by Paul IV. in 1559, but some machinery
                    for supplementing it as fresh books poured from the press could alone meet the
                    permanent danger. Another matter debated in these congregations was the
                    invitation of Protestants to attend, and in what character. In the eighteenth
                    session (February 26, 1562) two decrees on these subjects were promulgated,—one
                    appointing a committee to report to the council on the whole question of
                    heretical books; the other publishing a safe-conduct to the German Protestants,
                    extended by a rider to those of other nations. The congregations held after this
                    session were busied chiefly with the questions of residence and the abuse of
                    indulgences, besides several less important details of reform. A warm debate
                    arose as to the nature of the obligation to reside,—the Spaniards holding it to
                    be of divine right, the Italians to be of no more than ecclesiastical precept.
                    So powerful a body in the council took the Spanish view that the legates were
                    alarmed, especially as ominous speeches were made to the effect that the Roman
                    curia must be reformed on the basis of the report of cardinals to Paul III.
                    before anything of moment could be done in the way of real improvement.
                    Accordingly, they sent a messenger to the pope, bringing with him a schedule of
                    the proposed reforms, and asking for advice in the crisis. The pope desired them
                    to counteract the opposition bishops, to postpone the question of residence, if
                    they could not suppress it altogether, and despatched Visconti, bishop of
                    Ventimiglia, as extra nuncio to the council, to report accurately to him
                    everything said or done there, and with him sent also all the bishops who could
                    be collected at Rome to swell the Italian vote, and thus defeat the opposition
                    indirectly. There was much debate also on the scope of the safe-conduct, as the
                    Spaniards were anxious that it should not protect those against whom the
                    Inquisition had taken action, while others desired to see its terms enlarged
                    sufficiently to meet the requirements of the Protestants, who objected to its
                    suspicious silence on several weighty particulars. As the French ambassadors
                    were expected, nothing was done in the nineteenth session (May 14, 1562) save to
                    prorogue the council. On May 26, 1652, De Lanssac (who had been lately French
                    envoy at Rome), Du Ferrier, and De Pibrac, envoys from Charles IX., were
                    admitted to audience, and demanded, amongst other matters, that the council
                    should be formally declared a new one, wherein the imperial ambassadors
                    supported them, while Philip II. of Spain, contrariwise, insisted that it should
                    be declared a continuation of the former synod. The legates strove to satisfy
                    both parties, and received contradictory directions from Rome, at first ordering
                    them to announce the continuation of the former council, and afterwards leaving
                    the matter to their discretion. So little agreement could be arrived at that the
                    twentieth session (June 4, 1562) was held merely to prorogue the council. The
                    question of communion in both kinds was the next to come up for consideration.
                    It was such a capital one, if any hope of winning back the Protestants was to be
                    entertained, that the imperial and French ambassadors had special injunctions to
                    forward by all means in their power an affirmative decision. The Frenchmen saw
                    little prospect of carrying this matter in the temper of the Italian majority,
                    and were for opposing the discussion which the legates had announced, but the
                    imperial ambassadors were more hopeful, and persuaded them to give way. While
                    the question was being debated in the congregations, the Venetian and Bavarian
                    ambassadors arrived, the latter armed with a formidable schedule of complaints
                    against prevalent abuses, and of demands for correspondingly drastic reforms,
                    beginning with the pope and the curia, and making havoc amongst cardinals,
                    dispensations, exemptions, pluralities, office-books, exclusively Latin
                    services, and other like matters, thus threatening all manner of vested
                    interests and long-rooted customs. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n569/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0569-0550"/> legates put them off, alleging the pressure of
                    other business, notably the question of communion in both kinds, which was, in
                    fact, being discussed and decided in accordance with the views of the Italians
                    and Spaniards, and against those of the French and Germans. In the twenty-first
                    session (July 16, 1562) a decree couched in four dogmatic, chapters and four
                    canons was promulgated upon it, to the following purport:—laymen, and priests
                    other than the actual celebrant, are not bound by divine right to communicate in
                    both kinds; the church has full power to make what changes it pleases in the
                    mode of administering sacraments; the whole sacrament of the Eucharist is
                    received entire under either kind singly; and little children are not bound to
                    communicate. The canons pronounce anathemas against maintainers of the contrary
                    propositions. At the same time a decree upon reformation was enacted, most of
                    the clauses dealing with the duties of bishops in the matters of ordination,
                    patronage, division, and union of benefices, discipline of ineffective parish
                    priests, and visitation of monasteries, but a more permanent interest attaches
                    to the ninth and concluding chapter of the decree, whereby the name and office
                    of the “questors of alms,” that is to say, the vendors of indulgences, are
                    abolished on the ground of the impossibility of otherwise putting a stop to the
                    abuses and depravity of their proceedings. All privileges and customs to the
                    contrary, even if of time immemorial, are rescinded; the publication of
                    indulgences is confined thenceforth to the ordinaries of each place, assisted by
                    two members of the chapter; and these same officers are directed to collect the
                    alms and charitable donations of the people, but forbidden to receive any
                    commission or payment for so doing. This decree is a virtual confession of the
                    justice of the agitation against Tetzel and his fellows which served as the
                    signal for beginning the great religious strife of the 16th century; and it is
                    noticeable that it was the pope’s own voice against the system which decided the
                    action of the council, wherein a powerful minority was found to defend it.
                    Several weighty matters then came before the congregations, that of residence
                    again being pressed by the Spaniards, while the imperial and Bavarian
                    ambassadors renewed their requisition for permissive communion in both kinds
                    (for the decree on that subject had gone no further than to declare it
                    unnecessary, and had not explicitly forbidden it), and the French ambassador not
                    only supported them in their demand, but added on his own part that in France
                    they desired vernacular services, the abolition of imageworship, and permission
                    for the clergy to marry. The nuncio Visconti wrote to the pope in great alarm,
                    expressing apprehensions at the very free language employed by the fathers of
                    the council on these matters, the probability of their conceding the emperor’s
                    demands, and of similar ones being advanced thereupon, all making in the same
                    direction. An intrigue to compel the resignation of Cardinal Gonzaga, who was
                    not thought sufficiently opposed to these measures, and who was far less
                    peremptory in his presidency of the council and use of the closure than
                    Crescenzio had been, was set on foot, and defeated only by the strong
                    representations made at Rome by the archbishop of Lanciano, who said that there
                    was already so much division in the council that it could but just hold
                    together, and would almost certainly be broken up by any step of the kind. The
                    next subject which was brought on for consideration was the sacrifice of the
                    Mass, and the debates thereon were very animated, disclosing considerable
                    variety of opinion amongst the theologians,—no fewer than five clearly distinct
                    views of the tenet, apart from mere verbal or minor differences, being adduced
                    and argued for. As sixty French bishops, to be accompanied by twelve
                    theologians, and headed by Charles de Guise, cardinal of Lorraine, were under
                    orders to repair to Trent, the French ambassador pressed the legates to postpone
                    the next session till their arrival, as De l’Isle, ambassador at Rome, did the
                    pope; but each replied evasively, referring the applicant to the other. The
                    question of communion in both kinds was also very warmly discussed, and the
                    council was warned that a negative decision would lead to the secession of
                    multitudes who had not yet broken with the Roman Church; but the Jesuit Laynez,
                    who was the chief advocate for refusal, replied that to diminish the church
                    would not destroy it, and that anything was better than concession in the
                    matter. The numbers in the division taken on the question were as follows :—29
                    were in favour of granting communion in both kinds; 31 agreed thereto, but
                    desired the execution of the decree to be left to the pope’s discretion; 38 were
                    for total refusal; 24 strove to evade responsibility by referring the matter to
                    the pope entirely; 19 were willing to make the concession to the Bohemians and
                    Hungarians, but would refuse it to all others; 14 asked for a postponement; and
                    11 remained neutral, declining to vote any way—being a total of 166 suffrages,
                    so split up as to make it impracticable to frame a decree. In this difficulty,
                    the legate seized the opportunity of persuading the council to refer the matter
                    to the pope’s decision, thereby at once checkmating the reforming section, and
                    indirectly ruling the vexed point of the relative superiority of pope and
                    council in favour of the former, and so virtually reversing those decrees of
                    Constance and Basel which had long been thorns in the side of the Roman curia.
                    In point of fact, the pope had written some time before to the legates,
                    recommending them to yield to the emperor’s demand of the chalice for the laity,
                    but they had replied that it would be impolitic to make it a conciliar act, and
                    that it would be more expedient to frame a mere general declaration that it
                    might be proper to make the concession in certain cases, but that the pope
                    should be the sole judge of them. In the twenty-second session (September 17,
                    1562) the decree on the sacrifice of the Mass was promulgated in nine chapters
                    and as many canons, directed for the most part against current Protestant
                    objections to the doctrine and ceremonial of the Missal. Rules to secure greater
                    order and reverence in the celebration of Mass, and for the suppression of
                    sundry superstitious observances connected therewith, were also enacted,—besides
                    some minor reforms of little note, and a decree referring to the pope the whole
                    question of the concession of the chalice. The meagreness and insignificance of
                    the reforms enacted thus far caused much displeasure in France, and the king
                    directed his ambassador to press once more for delay till the arrival of the
                    French, German, and Polish bishops who were expected at Trent, as the emperor
                    also instructed his envoy. But the pope was busy in recruiting the Italian
                    majority, and was unfavourable to this request, lest the Italians should be
                    outvoted by the new-comers; yet so contentious were the debates on the sacrament
                    of orders, and on the nature and extent of the rights of bishops—notably whether
                    they were inherently above priests, and whether they were necessarily subject to
                    the pope, deriving their jurisdiction and other powers solely through delegation
                    from him, or if they were not of Divine institution, and his colleagues rather
                    than his deputies (which latter thesis was steadily maintained by the
                    Spaniards)—that it proved impossible to frame the decrees and hold the session
                    before the arrival of the cardinal of Lorraine, who reached Trent on November
                    13, 1562, accompanied by fourteen bishops, three abbots, and eighteen
                    theologians. The discussions, further complicated with the question of
                    residence, were renewed hereupon, and long before any signs of agreement were
                    visible the French ambassadors laid before the legates a schedule of reform in
                    thirty-four articles, requiring, not only the removal of various abuses in
                    patronage, and the punishment of negligence on the part of the parochial and
                    monastic clergy, but also that vernacular services should be permitted, and
                    communion in both kinds enjoined, while all abuses and superstitions connected
                    with image-worship, indulgences, pilgrimages, and relics should be summarily
                    abolished. Lorraine, on being asked how far he agreed with these demands, said
                    that he disapproved of some of them, but that if he had not consented to take
                    charge of them in their actual form, they would have been made still more
                    drastic. No definite action was taken upon them either at Trent or at Rome, and
                    the proceedings dragged on ineffectively for some months longer. On March 2,
                    1563, Cardinal Gonzaga, first legate, died, and was speedily followed by
                    Cardinal Seripando. The imperial and French ambassadors endeavoured to get the
                    cardinal of Lorraine named as first legate and president, but he was not
                    acceptable at Rome, and the post was given to Cardinal Morone, with whom
                    Cardinal Navagero was associated, to fill the place of Seripando. All these
                    events delayed the twenty-third session until July 15, 1563, nearly ten months
                    later than the preceding one. A decree on the sacrament of orders, in four
                    chapters and eight canons, laid down that there is a sacrificial priesthood of
                    the New Testament, instituted by Christ; that there have been seven orders in
                    the Christian ministry from the earliest times; that holy order is a sacrament;
                    that orders are indelible; that bishops are superior to priests; that a call
                    from the laity, or from any secular authority, is unnecessary as a title to
                    ordination, and that a merely lay call is invalid, while bishops appointed
                    solely by the pope, without the intervention of any other persons, are validly
                    created. A decree of eighteen chapters on reformation, enacting, amongst much
                    else, penalties for non-residence on the part of beneficiaries, and providing
                    for the erection of those theological seminaries which have ever since been the
                    nurseries of the Latin clergy, was also promulgated in this session. The
                    congregations which followed it were occupied chiefly with the question of
                    matrimony, which had been mooted earlier, but with no definite result, and with
                    framing a scheme to repress the encroachments of the civil power upon the church
                    in most countries, one clause of which proposed to exempt all ecclesiastics from
                    civil jurisdiction in all cases whatever, and from the payment of taxes, with
                    penalty of excommunication upon such civil authorities as contravened this
                    ruling. This was never pushed to the stage of promulgation, but it was
                    successful as a manifestation against the reforming party in the council, and
                    actually drove the French ambassadors away, since they judged their further
                    presence useless in such a temper of the assembly. Yet it was itself by no means
                    agreed or harmonious. The old disputes about the claim of the council to
                    represent the church universal, about the proposing clause, limiting the
                    initiative to the legates, and about the need of reform in the Roman curia
                    itself were renewed, and that with much acrimony, but with no practical result.
                    In the twenty-fourth session (November 11, 1563) a decree on matrimony, couched
                    in ten chapters and eleven canons, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n570/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0570-0551"/> was promulgated, the most noticeable points of
                    which are the assertion that the church can constitute other impediments to
                    matrimony besides the forbidden degrees of the Levitical code, and can dispense
                    with such impediments; that clerks in holy orders and regulars vowed to celibacy
                    cannot contract valid marriage; and that celibacy is superior to matrimony. The
                    simultaneous decree on reformation lays down rules for the creation of bishops
                    and cardinals, so as to avoid unfit promotions; directs that diocesan synods
                    shall be held yearly, and provincial synods triennially; lays down rules for
                    episcopal visitations, and for the qualifications to be exacted of persons
                    promoted to cathedral dignities and canonries; appoints the provincial synod the
                    judge of minor causes against bishops, referring graver causes to the pope’s
                    decision; and enacts various other technical regulations. By this time all
                    concerned were thoroughly weary of the council, and the remaining matters for
                    discussion were hurriedly discussed, resulting, in the twenty-fifth and last
                    session (December 3 and 4, 1563), in a decree, very cautiously worded, upon
                    purgatory, the cultus of saints, and that of relics and images. In this same
                    session was also enacted a decree in twenty-two chapters, regulating several
                    matters affecting the discipline of convents of monks and nuns; and another
                    decree on reformation, in twenty-one chapters, the most important of which
                    enjoin all cardinals and bishops to keep modest households, and not to enrich
                    their kindred with church property; that all prelates shall receive and publish
                    the decrees of the council; that duelling shall be prohibited under severe
                    penalties; and that the authority of the Holy See both is, an is to be
                    understood to be, untouched by any decrees of the council touching the reform of
                    morals and discipline. On the last day of the session was passed a somewhat
                    indefinite decree upon indulgences, forbidding all evil gains connected
                    therewith, and directing that, wherever abuses or superstitions are prevalent
                    concerning them, the bishops shall collect the facts, lay them before the
                    provincial synod, and after discussion there refer them to the pope for ultimate
                    decision. The distinction of meats, and the due observance of festivals and
                    fasts, were also enjoined; and a formal statement was made that the committees
                    which had been engaged upon the index of prohibited books, on the draft of a
                    catechism, and on the revision of the Missal and Breviary, thinking that the
                    synod could not deal with them conveniently, had determined to lay their reports
                    before the pope to ratify and publish at his pleasure. Formal acclamations, and
                    an anathema against all heretics, closed the session; and the legates, after
                    forbidding any bishop, under pain of excommunication, to leave Trent till he had
                    either signed his assent to the decrees, or left documentary proof of such
                    assent, gave the blessing and dissolved the assembly.</p>
                <p>Two hundred and fifty-five signatures were attached to the decrees, and also
                    those of the ambassadors still remaining at Trent. The bull of confirmation was
                    issued at Rome on January 26, 1564, and followed by another fixing May 1, 1564,
                    as the date from which the decrees should be held binding. The bull of
                    confirmation forbade all persons whatsoever, whether ecclesiastics or laymen, to
                    gloss or interpret the decrees upon any pretext whatever, without papal
                    authority for the purpose. The republic of Venice was the first power to signify
                    its reception of the decrees, followed speedily by the other Italian states
                    (except Naples) and by Portugal; but the king of Spain, though receiving the
                    decrees, issued them at first in his own name, and not in that of the pope; the
                    emperor and the king of Bohemia demanded the lay use of the chalice and the
                    marriage of priests as the terms on which they would accept the council, and
                    obtained a partial concession of the former demand, but were refused the latter;
                    and in France, while the dogmatic decrees were accepted, the disciplinary ones
                    were not, and have never, in spite of efforts many times renewed, made part of
                    French ecclesiastical law. The provision referring the explanation of the
                    council to the pope was given shape by Sixtus V., who erected in 1588 a
                    Congregation of the Council of Trent to sit permanently at Rome, where it has
                    ever since continued to be included amongst those standing committees which
                    divide among them the administration of the pontifical government.</p>
                <p>Two questions remain to be considered in relation to this great synod :—how far
                    was it free, and representative of the mind of Latin Christianity at that time?
                    and what have been its effects upon dogma and discipline? Ample materials exist
                    for answering the first question, in the form of contemporary letters, either
                    separately published, as those of Vargas, or included in the great collection of
                    documents made by Le Plat, and in the official acts of the council itself, drawn
                    up by the secretaries Paleotto and Massarelli. From these it is perfectly clear
                    that the council was never free for a moment, but was hampered and fettered, not
                    merely by the permanent fact of a large Italian majority, subsidized by the
                    pope,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Italian
                    character of the council of Trent can best be exhibited by a classified table,
                    showing the nationality of the bishops present in the later sessions:—Italians,
                    189; Spaniards, 31; French, 26; Greeks (titulars), 6; Portuguese, 3; Illyrians,

                    English, 1.</p></note> but by the method of procedure in the congregations,
                    since by a skilful distribution of the members into groups or classes, so as to
                    prevent combined action, and by careful packing of the sub-committees to which
                    the preparation of business for debate was entrusted, little could be done save
                    when and how the majority pleased; and, above all, the vigilant supervision
                    exercised by the legates, their constant reference to Rome of every point of any
                    importance before they would permit it to come on for regular discussion (so
                    that Lanssac, one of the French envoys, somewhat profanely said that the Holy
                    Spirit was brought to the council in a carpet-bag from Rome), and their
                    uncompromising use of their presidential authority to interrupt or silence
                    unacceptable speakers (as frequently appears in the Acts) effectually bound the
                    council hand and foot; and thus its decisions, as a whole, represent little more
                    than the Italian and, to some extent, Spanish opinions of the time, and not
                    those of German, French, or Hungarian Catholics. The demeanour of the legates
                    differed much, and there is a wide interval between the open browbeating
                    employed by Crescenzio and the high-bred dignity of Gonzaga or the diplomatic
                    subtlety of Morone; but the policy was alike in all cases, and its results the
                    same. As to the dogmatic effect of the council, it went much further than merely
                    restating the current Catholic theology of the preReformation era; for it marks
                    a new departure, closing many questions previously left open (nothing is more
                    noteworthy in the debates than the manner in which several divines of
                    unquestioned ability and loyalty delivered themselves of opinions closely allied
                    to those advocated by leading Reformers, and then still tenable within the Roman
                    obedience), re-wording old propositions, or framing new ones, in an incisive
                    fashion. It recovered for papal authority all it had lost, or was likely to
                    lose, through the action of Basel and Constance; and, above all, it unified
                    Roman teaching for the first time, and crystallized it into rigid compactness.
                    Thus it made concessions and explanations for the reconciliation of the revolted
                    Protestants, although the primary cause of the council, practically impossible
                    thenceforward, since the Roman Catholic system, thus hastily consolidated out of
                    a former condition of partial flux, became like a “Prince Rupert’s drop,” from
                    which, if the smallest fragment be broken, the mass is at once resolved into
                    disintegrated powder. In the matter of disciplinary reform the council enacted
                    but little of an effective nature, except in the abolition of the traffic in
                    indulgences, and the establishment of theological seminaries, which has proved
                    the most effectual agency for creating that doctrinal uniformity which now
                    prevails throughout the Roman obedience; and the real honours of the
                    CounterReformation rest with the Jesuits, to whose unremitting diligence,
                    powerful organization, and ceaseless precept and example must be attributed by
                    far the larger part of the abatement of ecclesiastical abuses and scandals which
                    marks the succeeding era. Doubtless, the Tridentine decrees, in strong and
                    resolute hands, proved most useful subsidiary weapons to compel local reforms;
                    but decrees of little less stringency had been enacted by previous <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n571/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0571-0552"/> synods, and had rusted unused, because there was
                    no one able and willing to put them in operation against the passive resistance
                    of powerful vested interests.</p>
                <p>The bibliography of the council of Trent is very extensive, but a comparatively
                    small number of volumes really suffices the student. The first work of
                    importance is F. Paolo Sarpi’s <hi rend="italic">Istoria del Concilio
                    Tridentino,</hi> originally published in London (1619) by Antonio de Dominis,
                    archbishop of Spalato, under the pseudonym of Pietro Soave Polano (an imperfect
                    anagram of Paolo Sarpi Veneto), but better studied in the French version by Père
                    Le Courayer, with valuable notes (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Sarpi).</hi> The
                    rival work of Sforza Palavicino, <hi rend="italic">Istoria del Concilio di
                    Trento</hi> (1656-57), written to order as a refutation of Sarpi’s work, is also
                    indispensable. He had free access to many official documents which Sarpi could
                    not consult, and often corrects him upon points of detail, but a careful reader
                    will find that he confirms him far offener than he refutes him. It is not
                    enough, as Ranke points out, to compare those two, and take the mean statement
                    as a guide, for they are sometimes in blank contradiction, and other witnesses
                    must be called in to decide the matter. The Acts of the council, so far as they
                    were drafted by Paleotto, were first published by Mendham in 1842; the complete
                    Acts, by both Paleotto and Massarelli, were not accessible till published as <hi
                    rend="italic">Acta Genuina Oecumenici Concilii Tridentini</hi> by Theiner in
                    1874. The vast compilation of Jodocus Le Plat, <hi rend="italic">Monumentorum ad
                    Historiam Concilii Tridentini Amplissima Collectio</hi> (7 vols. 4to, 1781-87),
                    is full of valuable and interesting matter. The speeches of the Jesuit Laynez,
                    which had such a powerful effect upon the council, have been recently published
                    under the title of Lainez, <hi rend="italic">Disputationes Tridentinae,</hi> 2
                    vols., 1886. Vargas, <hi rend="italic">Lettres et Mémoires concernant le Concile
                    de Trent</hi> (1700, partly translated in Geddes, <hi rend="italic">The Council
                    of Trent no Free Assembly,</hi> 1714), is of much value. The canons and decrees
                    of the council have been many times published, and are readily accessible; the
                    best edition is that by Richter and Schulte (1853). There is a convenient
                    abridgment of Palavicino's history prefixed to the Rev. James Waterworth's
                    English version of the <hi rend="italic">Decrees and Canons of Trent</hi>
                    (1848), but it is not trustworthy, for the translator has suppressed many
                    statements of the original which tell in various ways against the freedom of the
                    action of the council. To these may be added Sickel, <hi rend="italic"
