                    commonly known as the Black Tern, thus confirming Turner, who, in 1544,
                    describes what seems to have been the same species as ‘ <hi rend="superscript">
                    ζ</hi> nostrati lingua sterna appellata.” In at least one instance the word has
                    been confounded with one of the old forms of the modern <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Starling</hi> (vol. xxii. p. 457). To Turner’s name, repeated by Gesner and
                    other authors, we owe the introduction by Linnaeus of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sterna</hi> into scientific nomenclature. ‘ ‘ Iksteιm ’ ’ is another Dutch form
                    of the word.</p></note><hi rend="italic superscript"> v</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Sterninae</hi> of modern ornithology, but, according to Selby,
                    properly belonging, at least in the Farne Islands, to the species known by the
                    book-name of Sandwich Tern, all the others being those called Sea-Swallows —a
                    name still most commonly given to the whole group throughout Britain from their
                    long wings, forked tail, and marine habit. In Willughby’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithologia</hi> (1676), however, the word Tern is used for more than one
                    species, and, though it does not appear in the older English dictionaries, it
                    may well have been from early times as general a name as it is now.</p>
                <p>Setting aside those which are but occasional visitors to the British Islands, six
                    species of Terns may be regarded as indigenous, though of them one has ceased
                    from ordinarily breeding in the United Kingdom, while a second has become so
                    rare and regularly appears in so few places that mention of them must for
                    prudence sake be avoided. This last is the beautiful Roseate Tern, <hi
                    rend="italic">Sterna dοugalli;</hi> the other is the Black Tern, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrochelidon nigra,</hi> belonging to a genus in which the toes
                    are only half-webbed, of small size and dark leaden grey plumage. It is without
                    doubt the <hi rend="italic">Sterna</hi> of Turner, and in former days was
                    abundant in many parts of the fen country,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It was known there as Carr-Swallow, Carr-Crow (corrupted
                    into “Scarecrow ”), and Blue Dar <hi rend="italic">(qu.</hi> = Daw

                    abodes have been drained, and for its purposes sterilized these many years past,
                    not a spring comes but it shows itself in small companies in the eastern
                    counties of England, evidently seeking a breedingplace. All around the coast the
                    diminution in the numbers of the remaining species of Terns within the last 50
                    years is no less deplorable than demonstrable.</p>
                <p>The Sandwich Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. sandvicensis</hi> or £ <hi rend="italic"
                    >cantiaca—</hi> named from the place of its discovery, though it has long since
                    ceased to inhabit that neighbourhood—is the largest of the British species,
                    equalling in size the smaller Gulls and having a dark-coloured bill tipped with
                    yellow, and dark legs. Through persecution it has been exterminated in all its
                    southern haunts, and is become much scarcer in those to which it still resorts.
                    It was, however, never so abundant as its smaller congeners, the so-called
                    Common and the Arctic Tern, —two species that are so nearly alike as to be
                    beyond discrimination on the wing by an ordinary observer, and even in the hand
                    require a somewhat close examination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Linnaeus’s diagnosis of his <hi rend="italic">Sterna
                    hirundο</hi> points to his having had an “Arctic” Tern before him; but it is
                    certain that he did not suspect that specific appellation (already used by other
                    writers for the ‘ ‘ Common” Tern) to cover a second species. Some modern
                    authorities disregard his name as being insufficiently definite, and much is to
                    be said for this view of the case. Undoubtedly ‘ <hi rend="italic">himndo”</hi>
                    has now been used so indiscriminately for one species or the other as to cause
                    confusion, which is perhaps best avoided by adopting the epithets of Nau mann
                    <hi rend="italic">(Isis,</hi> 1819, pp. 1847, 1848), who, acting on and
                    confirming the discovery of Nitzsch (who first detected the specific
                    difference), called the southern species »S', <hi rend="italic">fluviatilis</hi>
                    and the northern £ <hi rend="italic">rnacrura.</hi> Temminck’s name »8. <hi
                    rend="italic">arctica</hi> applied to the latter a year later has been· most
                    generally used for it, notwithstanding.</p></note> The former of these has the
                    more southern range, and often affects inland situations, while the latter,
                    though by no means limited to the Arctic circle, is widely distributed over the
                    north and mostly resorts to the seacoast. Yet there are localities where, as on
                    the Farne Islands, both meet and breed, without occupying stations apart. The
                    minute diagnosis of these two species cannot be briefly given. It must suffice
                    here to state that the most certain difference, as it is the most easily
                    recognizable, is to be found in the tarsus, which in the Arctic Tem is a quarter
                    of an inch shorter than in its kinsman. The remaining native species is the
                    Lesser Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. minuta,</hi> one of the smallest of the genus
                    and readily to be distinguished by its permanently white forehead. All the
                    species already mentioned, except the Black Tern, have much the same general
                    coloration— the adults in summer plumage wearing a black cap and having the
                    upper parts of the body and wings of a more or less pale grey, while they are
                    mostly lighter beneath. They generally breed in association, often in the
                    closest proximity—their nests, containing 3 eggs at most, being made on the
                    shingle or among herbage. The young are hatched clothed in variegated down, and
                    remain in the nest for some time. At this season the parents are almost
                    regardless of human presence and expose themselves freely.</p>
                <p>At least half-a-dozen other species have been recorded as occurring in British
                    waters, and among them the Caspian Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. caspia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> which is one of the largest of the genus and of
                    wide distribution, though not breeding nearer to the shores of England than on
                    Sylt and its neighbouring islands, which still afford lodging for a few pairs.
                    Another, the Gull-billed Tern, <hi rend="italic">S. anglica,</hi> has also been
                    not unfrequently shot in England. All these species are now recognized, though
                    the contrary was once maintained, as inhabitants of North America, and many go
                    much further.</p>
                <p>An excellent synopsis of the Sub-family <hi rend="italic">Sterninae</hi> has been
                    given by Mr Howard Saunders in the Zoological <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi>
                    (1876, pp. 638-672). He recognizes 5 genera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >—Hydrochelidon</hi> (with 3 species), <hi rend="italic">Sterna</hi> (with 38),
                    <hi rend="italic">Naenia,</hi> a very aberrant form consisting of but one
                    species, the Inca Tern, peculiar to the western coast of South America, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gygis,</hi> composed of 2 species of purely white birds and
                    restricted to the southern hemisphere; his fifth genus is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anous,</hi> to which belong the various species of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Noddy</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 531). Often confounded with these last are the two
                    species called in books Sooty Terns (N. <hi rend="italic">fuliginosa</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">S. anaestheta),</hi> but by sailors “Egg-birds” or
                    “Wideawakes” from their cry. These crowd at certain seasons in innumerable
                    multitude to certain islands within the tropics, where they breed, and the
                    wonderful assemblage at present known as “Wide-awake fair” on the island of
                    Ascension has been more or less fully described from very ancient times. Dampier
                    in his voyage to New Holland in 1699 particularly described and figured the
                    Sooty Tern <hi rend="italic">( Voyages,</hi> iii. p. 142), discriminating it
                    from the Noddy, from, which it had not before been distinguished. <hi
