                <p>SOMEWHERE about the second decade of the 13th century the little Turkish tribe
                    which in due course was to found the Ottoman empire fled before the Mongols from
                    its original home in Central Asia, and, passing through Persia, entered Armenia,
                    under the leadership of Suleymán Sháh, its hereditary chief. His son,
                    Er-Toghrul, who succeeded him as head of the tribe, when wandering about the
                    country with his warriors came one day upon two armies engaged in a furious
                    battle. Er-Toghrul at once rode to the assistance of the weaker party, who were
                    on the point of giving way, but who through the timely aid thus rendered not
                    only regained what they had lost but totally defeated their enemies. The army
                    thus saved from destruction proved to be that of 'Alá-ud-Dín, the Seljúk sultan
                    of Asia Minor, and their adversaries to be a horde of marauding Mongols. By way
                    of recompense for this service 'Alá-ud-Dín granted to Er-Toghrul a tract of land
                    on the Byzantine frontier, including the towns of Sugut and Eski Shehr. 'Osmán,
                    the son of Er-Toghrul and the prince from whom the race derives its name of
                    'Osmánli (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turks,</hi> p. 661 below), corrupted by
                    Europeans into Ottoman, was born in Sugut in 1258 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.h.</hi> 656). While still young 'Osmán won from the Greeks Karaja Hisár
                    (Karahissar) and some other towns, on which account he received from his
                    suzerain, the Seljúk sultan of Konya (Konieh), the title of beg or prince, along
                    with the drum and the horsetail standard, the symbols of princely rank.</p>
                <p>In 1300 (699) the Seljúk empire (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Seljuks)</hi> fell to
                    pieces under the onslaught of the Mongols, who were, however, powerless to
                    replace it by any government of their own. Thereupon ten separate Turkish
                    dynasties arose from its ruins: that of Karasi sprang up in ancient Mysia, the
                    houses of Saru Khan and Aydin in Lydia, of Mentesha in Caria, of Tekka in Lycia
                    and Pamphylia, of Hamid in Pisidia and Isauria, of Karaman in Lycaonia, of
                    Kermiyan in Phrygia, of Kizil Ahmedli in Paphlagonia, and of 'Osmán in Phrygia
                    Epictetus. These principalities were all eventually merged in that of the
                    'Osmánlis, once the least among them, and the inhabitants assumed the name of
                    Ottoman. Hence by far the greater portion of the people called Ottomans owe
                    their name to a series of political events. On the collapse of the Seljúk power
                    the Greeks retained hardly any possessions in Asia except Bithynia and
                    Trebizond. Armenia was abandoned for a time to roving Tatar or Turkman tribes,
                    till some sixty or seventy years later one or two petty local dynasties sprang
                    up and founded short-lived states.</p>
                <p>The year 1301 (700), in which 'Osmán, who shortly before had succeeded his
                    father, first coined money and caused the khutba, or public prayer for the
                    reigning monarch, to be read in his name—the two prerogatives of an independent
                    sovereign in the East—may be regarded as the birth-year of the Ottoman empire;
                    and it was about this time that his followers and subjects began to call
                    themselves 'Osmánlis, or, as we might render it, 'Osmanites. Having thoroughly
                    established his authority in his capital of Yeni Shehr, 'Osmán began to wrest
                    from the Greeks many of the neighbouring towns and strongholds, among others
                    Ayina Göl and Koyun Hisári, routing before the last named a large Byzantine
                    army. He then turned his attention to the administration of his state, and such
                    was the feeling of security he succeeded in establishing that large numbers of
                    people from the surrounding districts flocked into his dominions and became his
                    subjects. After six years of peace several of the Byzantine castellans of the
                    neighbourhood, instigated by the governor of Brusa (Broussa), made a
                    simultaneous attack upon the Ottomans, but 'Omán totally defeated them and sent
                    in pursuit Kara 'Alí Alp, who took possession of all their domains. Gházán, the
                    khan of the Mongols, who had entered into an alliance with the emperor of
                    Constantinople, sent to all the Turkish princes an arrogantly worded message
                    forbidding them to do any hurt to the Byzantine territories. To show how light
                    he held this menace, 'Osmán assembled an army forthwith, marched to Nicaea and
                    thence to the Bosphorus, laying waste the country as he went and taking
                    possession of a number of towns and villages. Michael, called by the Turkish
                    historians Kösa Míkhál or Michael Scant-beard, the governor of one of these,
                    embraced Islám and became one of the most trusted officers of 'Osmán and of his
                    son and successor Orkhan. The descendants of this Michael were the hereditary
                    commanders of the akinjis, a corps of light cavalry who played a great part in
                    the early Ottoman wars. The first service on which Michael was employed was to
                    destroy, along with Orkhan, a Mongol horde that had taken and pillaged the
                    Ottoman town of Karaja Hisár. Meanwhile ‘Abd-ur-Rahmán and Akcha Koja, two of
                    'Osmán’s generals, were adding to the Ottoman dominions in the north, capturing
                    several towns and laying siege to the city of Nicaea. The Ottoman chiefs next
                    resolved to acquire Brusa, the natural capital of these parts. So they built
                    round it a series of towers, in which they placed garrisons, with the view of
                    intercepting communications and eventually starving the city into submission. At
                    length, in 1326 (726), after a desultory siege of eight years, the keys were,
                    through the intervention of Míkhál, handed over to Orkhan, who was in command of
                    the Ottomans, and the townspeople were allowed to ransom <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0662-0641"/> themselves for 30,000 sequins. Very soon after
                    this 'Osmán died, aged seventy, at Sugut, whence his remains were carried for
                    burial to Brusa. 'Osmán was distinguished for piety and generosity as well as
                    for equity and courage. He cared nothing for amassing wealth, and on his death
                    his personal effects were found to consist of two or three suits of clothes, a
                    few weapons, some horses, and a flock of sheep. And so high was his reputation
                    for justice that, we are told, many of the Asiatic subjects of the Caesars fled
                    to him for that protection which their own rulers would not or could not give
                    them.</p>
                <p>Orkhan, who succeeded his father 'Osmán, continued the war against the Greeks,
                    taking from them Nicomedia, Nicaea, and many of the towns which they still
                    retained in Asia. Hitherto the Ottomans had not interfered with the other
                    Turkish states; but now Orkhan, granting a short respite to the Byzantines, took
                    advantage of a dispute regarding the succession to the throne of Karasi, entered
                    that principality, and annexed it to his own dominions. To his son Suleymán the
                    Ottomans owe their first establishment in Europe: one night that prince,
                    accompanied by a few companions, crossed the Hellespont on a raft and surprised
                    the town of Galipoli (Gallipoli). The next day he brought over a number of
                    Turkish troops, with whose assistance he possessed himself of many of the
                    neighbouring towns and villages; but his career was cut short by a fatal fall
                    from his horse when out hunting. Orkhan did not long survive his son, grief at
                    whose untimely end is said to have hastened his own death, in 1359 (761). This
                    monarch is celebrated for the number of mosques, colleges, and other public
                    institutions that he founded. During his reign the Ottoman army was thoroughly
                    organized, and a body of regular paid soldiers was raised, which formed the
                    nucleus of the military power of the state, though the old irregular militia was
                    still called out whenever a campaign was to be undertaken. The famous corps of
                    the janissaries (Turkish <hi rend="italic">yeni cheri, i.e.,</hi> “new troop ”)
                    was instituted at this time. It consisted of the children of Christian subjects,
                    who were educated as Mussulmans and brought up to a military life.</p>
                <p>Having taken the city of Angora from certain territorial lords who, incited by
                    the prince of Karaman, had attacked the Ottoman dominions, Murád I., the son and
                    successor of Orkhan, found himself free to extend his possessions across the
                    Hellespont. He forthwith passed over into Europe, where he and his generals soon
                    reduced almost all Roumelia, capturing Adrianople, Philippopolis, and many other
                    places of importance. These successes alarmed the Christian princes, who
                    determined to make a vigorous effort to drive the Turks back into Asia. The
                    kings of Bosnia, Hungary, and Servia accordingly marched with a large army upon
                    Adrianople, but were surprised during the night and completely defeated by an
                    inferior Turkish force. Some time after this victory Murád returned to Asia,
                    where he celebrated the wedding of his son Báyezíd with the daughter of the
                    prince of Kermiyán, a large portion of whose territory was made over to the
                    'Osmánli monarch as the dower of the bride. Next year, when Murád set out to
                    inspect his new possessions, he met the prince of Hamid, whom he constrained to
                    sell all his dominions. The Karaman prince, ever the jealous rival of the
                    Ottoman, now stirred up some of the Turkman tribes to ravage his enemy’s land;
                    but Murád was beforehand with him, and, entering his country, defeated him and
                    annexed the district of Ak-Shehr to his own kingdom. The Bosnian and Bulgarian
                    princes having allied themselves against the sultan, the Turkish commander in
                    Europe invaded Bulgaria, which was speedily subdued and added to the Ottoman
                    possessions. Murád next entered Servia and advanced to the plain of Kosovo,
                    where he found awaiting him the levies of Servia, Bosnia, Hungary, Albania, and
                    Walachia. The Turks, though far inferior in number to their adversaries, gained
                    a complete victory, 1389 (791), but it was purchased with their sovereign’s
                    life. After the battle Murád was riding over the field with some of his people,
                    when a wounded Servian, who was lying among the slain, sprang up and stabbed him
                    so that he died almost immediately afterwards. In consequence of this battle
                    Servia became subject to the Turk.</p>
                <p>Báyezíd I., surnamed Yildirim, “Thunderbolt,”on account of the fury of his attack
                    and the rapidity of his movements, received the oath of fealty on the
                    battlefield of Kosovo. He did much to secure the position of the Ottomans, in
                    Europe, taking many of the towns which still remained to the Christians in
                    Roumelia. In Asia he annexed the remaining Turkish principalities, and pushed
                    his conquests as far as Caesarea and Sívás. The Christians made another great
                    effort to free themselves from their Eastern foes: whilst Báyezíd was absent in
                    Asia, the king of Hungary led a powerful army, in the ranks of which were many
                    knights of France and Germany, into the Ottoman dominions and laid siege to
                    Nicopolis. Báyezíd sped to the rescue, and inflicted an overwhelming defeat on
                    the Christians. He next turned his attention to Constantinople, the reduction
                    and annexation of which he had long meditated, when he was summoned to meet
                    Tímúr, the Tatar conqueror, who had invaded his Asiatic dominions and taken
                    Sívás. The Ottoman and Tatar hosts encountered each other outside Angora, and
                    there the former sustained their first disastrous overthrow, Báyezíd being taken
                    prisoner and his army practically annihilated. Next year, 1403 (805), he died in
                    captivity; the story of his having been imprisoned in an iron cage is not
                    confirmed by the Turkish historians, and is most probably fictitious. After this
                    victory Tímúr overran the Ottoman territories in Asia, taking and sacking Brusa,
                    Nicaea, and many other cities. With a view to the complete annihilation of the
                    'Osmánli power, he restored the independence of the Turkish principalities which
                    Báyezíd had annexed, and placed them under the rule of their former emirs.</p>
                <p>On the withdrawal of Tímúr from Asia Minor the four surviving sons of Báyezíd
                    fought for what was left of their father’s kingdom; after ten years of civil war
                    success finally rested with Muhammed, who alone of the four is reckoned among
                    the Ottoman sovereigns. The attention of the new sultan, whom his people called
                    Chelebi Muhammed or Muhammed the Debonair, was turned rather to the restoration
                    of his father’s empire than to the conquest of neighbouring countries. In Europe
                    he lived on amicable terms with the Byzantine emperor, and the Christian kings
                    further north did not venture to make any serious attack upon him. But in Asia
                    he had to contend with many enemies, the most formidable of whom was the emir of
                    Karaman, who, having been defeated and made prisoner, was generously pardoned
                    and restored to liberty. Another difficulty with which Muhammed had to deal was
                    a strange religious outbreak: a vast number of fanatic dervishes, headed by an
                    apostate Jew and a Turkish adventurer of low birth, rose in revolt, and were
                    only dispersed after several bloody battles. This sultan, who was much beloved
                    by his subjects and is spoken of with praise by the Byzantine historians, was
                    stricken with apoplexy while riding in Adrianople, and died almost immediately
                    in the thirty-third year of his age, 1421 (824).</p>
                <p>The first care of his son and successor Murád II. was: to rid himself of a
                    pretender to the throne who, aided by the Greek emperor, had made a descent upon
                    the Asiatic shore of the Dardanelles. This adventurer was soon defeated and
                    pursued to Adrianople, where he was taken and hanged. In revenge for the
                    assistance rendered to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n663/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0663-0642"/> his enemy, the sultan invested Constantinople,
                    but he was compelled to relinquish the siege in order to subdue a revolt headed
                    by his brother, which had broken out in Asia. Murád again annexed all the
                    Turkish principalities which had been restored by Tímúr, except those of Kizil
                    Ahmedli and Karaman, which did not finally become incorporated with the empire
                    till the time of Muhammed II. The Turks were now called upon to face the most
                    formidable Christian enemy they had yet encountered, namely Hunyady, the
                    illegitimate son of Sigismund, king of Hungary. This famous general, after
                    having inflicted several severe though not very important defeats upon his
                    adversaries, invaded European Turkey with a large army of Hungarians, Poles,
                    Servians, Bosnians, Walachians, and Frankish crusaders, the last-named being
                    under the command of Cardinal Julian. The Ottoman army was utterly routed,
                    Sophia taken, and the chain of the Balkans forced; and Murád was compelled to
                    sign a treaty for ten years, by which he resigned all claims to Servia and gave
                    over Walachia to Hungary. Weary of the cares of state·, and thinking that peace
                    was, for a time at least, secured, Murád abdicated in favour of his young son
                    Muhammed and sought a quiet retreat in the town of Magnesia. But he was not
                    allowed to enjoy repose for long: the Christian princes, incited by Cardinal
                    Julian and in direct violation of the treaty, assembled their forces, and, under
                    Hunyady as commander-in-chief, without declaring war, entered the Turkish
                    dominions and took many of the Ottoman strongholds in Bulgaria. When the news
                    reached Murád he resumed the imperial power, put himself at the head of his
                    troops, and advanced to meet the invaders, who had just captured Varna. Outside
                    that town a great battle was fought, in which a copy of the violated treaty,
                    raised high upon a lance, formed one of the standards of the Ottomans. The
                    conflict, which was long and bloody, resulted in the total overthrow of the
                    Christians, the Polish king, Ladislaus, and Cardinal Julian being among the
                    slain, 1444 (848). Murád again abdicated and sought the retirement of Magnesia;
                    but once again he had to take up the reins of government. This time the
                    janissaries and sipáhís, accustomed to the firm rule of the victor of Varna, had
                    refused obedience to the young Muhammed. The sultan remained at the head of the
                    state until his death, which occurred in 1451 (855).</p>
                <p>Muhammed II., who now ascended the throne for the third time, determined to
                    accomplish the long-cherished design of his house, and make Constantinople the
                    capital of the 'Osmánli empire. He easily found a pretext for declaring war
                    against Constantine Palaeologus and in the spring of 1453 (857) led an immense
                    army to beleaguer the city. His troops covered the ground before the landward
                    walls between the Sea of Marmora and the Golden Horn; but he found that even his
                    monster cannon could do but little against the massive fortifications. At length
                    he resolved to assail the city from its weakest side, that facing the Golden
                    Horn. But the Greeks, having foreseen the likelihood of an attack from this
                    quarter, had thrown a great chain across the entrance to the harbour, thereby
                    blocking the passage against the hostile ships. The Ottomans, however,
                    constructed a road of planks, five miles long, across the piece of ground
                    between the Bosphorus, where their own fleet lay, and the upper part of the
                    Golden Horn. Along this road they hauled a number of their galleys, with sails
                    set to receive the aid of the favouring wind, and launched them safely in the
                    harbour, whence they cannonaded with more effect the weaker defences of the
                    city. This compelled the Greek emperor to withdraw a portion of his little
                    garrison from the point where the more serious attack was being made, to repair
                    the destruction wrought in this new quarter. At dawn on May 29 th the Ottomans
                    advanced to storm the city. The Christians offered a desperate resistance, but
                    in vain. The emperor died fighting in the forefront of the battle, and at noon
                    Muhammed rode in triumph into his new capital and went straight to the cathedral
                    of St Sophia; there, before the high altar, where the preceding night
                    Constantine had received the Holy Sacrament, he prostrated himself in the Moslem
                    act of worship. The capture of Constantinople is not the only exploit to which
                    Muhammed owes his surname of Fátih, or the Conqueror: he also reduced Servia and
                    Bosnia, overthrew and annexed the Greek empire of Trebizond and the Turkish
                    principality of Karaman, acquired the suzerainty of the Crimea, and won many of
                    the islands of the Greek Archipelago from the Venetians and Genoese. But before
                    Belgrade, which he had besieged as the first step to an attack upon the northern
                    kingdoms, he suffered a serious defeat, being driven wounded from the field by
                    Hunyady and John Capistran, with the loss of 300 cannon and 25,000 men. Rhodes,
                    whither an Ottoman force was despatched, was the scene of another failure: here
                    the Knights of St John gallantly and successfully withstood their Muhammedan
                    foes, and compelled them to retire from the island. In Albania a long and, for a
                    time, successful resistance was offered to the Turkish arms by the famous George
                    Castriot, the Iskender Beg of the Turks. This chieftain had been in his youth in
                    the service of Murád II., and was by him appointed governor of his native
                    Albania, whereupon he revolted and tried to restore the independence of his
                    country. Among the favourite designs of Muhammed were the subjugation of Italy
                    and the establishment of the Mussulman dominion in the capital of Western
                    Christendom. A Turkish army crossed the Adriatic and stormed the city of
                    Otranto; but its further progress was stopped, and for ever, by the death of the
                    Conqueror, which occurred a few months later, in 1481 (886). The Muhammedan
                    soldiers besieged in Otranto, being unsupported from Turkey, were, after a long
                    and brave defence, forced to surrender.</p>
                <p>Báyezíd II. was hardly seated on the throne before he was called upon to face a
                    formidable revolt raised by his younger brother Jem. This youthful pretender,
                    who was both talented and high-spirited, was, after a number of adventures,
                    finally compelled to fly the country. He sought the protection of the Knights of
                    St John at Rhodes, who, however, retained him a prisoner, and made an
                    arrangement with Báyezíd whereby they received from that monarch a yearly sum of
                    45,000 ducats as the price of the compulsory detention of his brother. After
                    thirteen years of captivity the unfortunate prince was murdered by Pope
                    Alexander VI. (Borgia), who, it is said, received 300,000 ducats from the sultan
                    as the reward of his crime. Though frequently compelled to engage in defensive
                    wars, Báyezíd was of a peace-loving and unambitious disposition, and a few towns
                    in the Morea were all the additions made to the empire while he was on the
                    throne. It was during his reign, however, that the Ottoman fleet began to be
                    formidable to Christendom, the desperate battle off Sapienza, won by Kemál Re’ís
                    against the Venetians, being the first of the Turkish naval victories over the
                    Mediterranean powers. Báyezíd, whose pacific habits had alienated the sympathies
                    of the janissaries, was in 1512 (918) forced by these dreaded guards to abdicate
                    in favour of Selim, the youngest of his three sons. This prince had already been
                    in open revolt against his father; but his determined and warlike character had
                    won for him the esteem of the Turkish praetorians. Báyezíd’s health, which had
                    long been failing, gave way under this blow; and the old sultan died three days
                    after his deposition, at a little village on the way to Demitoka, whither he was
                    going to end his life in retirement.</p>
                <p>Selim I. was personally the greatest of the Ottoman <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0664-0643"/> monarchs: his unflinching courage and tireless
                    vigour were not more remarkable than his political sagacity and his literary and
                    poetic talents; but so merciless was he that he has always been known in Turkish
                    history as Yawuz Selim or Selim the Grim. Happily for Europe he turned his
                    attention to the neighbouring Muhammedan states and left the Christian powers in
                    peace. Having caused both his brothers to be put to death, he marched against
                    Persia, the king of which country had given refuge to the family of one of the
                    hapless Turkish princes. The quarrel between them was further embittered by
                    religious hatred: the sháh of Persia was the pillar of the Shí'ites, as the
                    Ottoman sultan was of the Sunnites. Selim in his fanatical zeal had ordered a
                    massacre of his Shi'ite subjects, in which forty-five thousand persons suffered
                    death. The sháh was eager to avenge the slaughter of his co-religionists. The
                    janissaries showed signs of insubordination upon the march, but Selim resolutely
                    maintained order and reduced them to submission. At length they came upon the
                    Persian host drawn out on the plain of Chaldiran, where a great battle was
                    fought, which ended in the rout of the Persians and left the way to Tabriz, the
                    residence of the Persian king, open to the sultan. Thither Selim proceeded; but
                    eight days later he set out on his homeward march. The battle of Chaldiran
                    brought no addition of importance to the empire; but the districts of Diyár-Bekr
                    (Diarbekr) and Kurdistan, through which the army had passed on the way to
                    Persia, were completely subdued and annexed to the Ottoman dominions. Selim’s
                    next important campaign was against the Memlúks of Egypt. This body of Eastern
                    chivalry offered a most gallant resistance to the 'Osmánlis; but, possessing no
                    artillery, which they disdained as unbecoming men of valour, they were defeated
                    in a series of engagements, and Selim and his army entered Cairo as conquerors
                    in 1517 (923). The results of this war were momentous and far-reaching: the
                    Ottoman empire was greatly increased by the addition of Egypt, Syria, and the
                    Hejáz, of all of which the Memlúks had been lords; the caliphate of Islám was
                    won for the house of 'Osmán, Selim constraining the representative of the old
                    Abbásid family, who resided, a purely spiritual prince, at Cairo, to make over
                    to him and his heirs the rights and privileges of the successors of the Prophet.
                    The sultan at the same time acquired from him the sacred banner and other relics
                    of the founder of Islám, which had been handed down to the Arabian prince from
                    his fathers, and which are now preserved in the seraglio at Constantinople. On
                    his return Selim set himself to strengthen and improve his fleet, doubtless with
                    a view to the conquest of Rhodes. He died, however, in 1520 (926), before his
                    extensive preparations were completed. This sultan reigned only eight years, but
                    in that short time he almost doubled the extent of the Ottoman empire.</p>
                <p>Suleymán I., who succeeded his father Selim as sultan, had not been long on the
                    throne before he found himself involved in a war with the king of Hungary. He
                    marched northwards with a powerful army and wrested from the enemy several
                    places of importance, including the strongly fortified city of Belgrade. Having
                    left a large garrison in this city, which was regarded as the key to the
                    Christian lands north of the Danube, the sultan returned to Constantinople,
                    where he continued his father’s work of creating a strong and efficient Ottoman
                    fleet. When all was ready Suleymán set out for Rhodes, determined to wipe away
                    the disgrace of his ancestor’s second failure, as he had done that of his first.
                    The conquest of Egypt had, moreover, rendered the possession of Rhodes necessary
                    to the Turks, as the passage between Constantinople and their new acquisition
                    could never be safe so long as that island remained in hostile hands. The
                    Knights of St John met the attack in a manner worthy of their illustrious order;
                    but the overwhelming force of the Ottomans and the hopelessness of any relief
                    compelled them to accept the sultan’s terms. These were highly honourable to the
                    defenders, who were permitted to retire unmolested, while Suleymán pledged
                    himself to respect the Christian religion in the island, which now, 1522 (929),
                    became his. Four years after the conquest of Rhodes the sultan again invaded
                    Hungary, where in the renowned battle of Mohacz he annihilated the army of the
                    Magyars and slew their king. Thence he marched along the Danube to Buda-Pesth,
                    which opened its gates to him, and there he rested a little while before
                    starting on his homeward way. The disturbed state of Asia Minor hastened
                    Suleymán’s departure; but in three years (1529) he was back at Buda, ostensibly
                    as the ally of Zapolya, an Hungarian who claimed the throne left vacant by
                    Louis, who fell at Mohacz. Ferdinand of Austria had opposed the claim of
                    Zapolya, who thereon had applied to the sultan for aid, which that monarch was
                    most willing to accord. The troops of Ferdinand being driven from Buda,
                    Suleymán, accompanied by his protégé, advanced upon Vienna. On 27th September
                    1529 the vast Turkish host, under the personal command of one of the greatest of
                    the family of 'Osmán, laid siege to the capital of the German empire, and on the
                    14th of the following month, after a most desperate assault carried on for four
                    days, the invaders were compelled to retire, leaving the city in the possession
                    of its heroic defenders. The torrent of Turkish military might had now reached
                    its northern limit: once again it vainly swept round the walls of Vienna, but
                    further it never went. Suleymán next directed his arms against Persia, from
                    which country he won a large portion of Armenia and 'Irak as well as Baghdád,
                    the old capital of the 'Abbásid caliphs. In 1542 he was again in Hungary, having
                    been appealed to by the widow of Zapolya on behalf of her infant son against the
                    pretensions of Ferdinand. Suleymán promised to place the child upon the throne
                    when he should be of a proper age; in the meantime he treated Hungary as an
                    Ottoman province, dividing it into sanjaks or military districts, and
                    garrisoning Buda and other important cities with Turkish troops. Six years later
                    a truce for five years was concluded between the sultan and Ferdinand, whereby
                    almost all Hungary and Transylvania were made over to the former, who was also
                    to receive a yearly present, or more correctly tribute, of thirty thousand
                    ducats. The Turks, now at the zenith of their power, were the terror of all
                    around them. The achievements of the Ottoman navy during the reign of Suleymán
                    were hardly, if at all, less remarkable than those of the army. Khayr-ud-Dán,
                    the Barbarossa of the Europeans, won Algiers for Turkey, and held the
                    Mediterranean against the fleets of Spain and Italy; Torghud added Tripoli to
                    the empire; and Piyála routed the galleys of Genoa, Florence, Naples, and Malta
                    off the isle of Jerba. But fortune did not always smile upon the crescent. In
                    1565 (973) Suleymán sustained the second great check he was destined to
                    encounter. The Turks once more measured swords with the Knights of St John and
                    drove them from Malta, which had been given to the order by Charles V. on its
                    expulsion from Rhodes. A powerful Turkish army and fleet, commanded by officers
                    of renown, were accordingly despatched to win Malta for the Ottoman crown; but
                    so valiantly was it defended that the Turks were forced to withdraw with a loss
                    of twenty five thousand men. Suleymán died in harness. In 1566 (974), when
                    seventy-six years of age, he entered Hungary for the last time, summoned thither
                    to aid his vassal, young Sigismund Zapolya. Sziget, a place which had foiled the
                    Turks on previous occasions, was the first object of attack. Count Zrinyi, the
                    governor, determined to resist to the last, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0665-0644"/> so the Ottomans found themselves compelled to
                    undertake the siege of this comparatively unimportant town. There on the night
                    of 4th September the great sultan died, and a few hours later Count Zrinyi and
                    his brave companions perished amid the smoking ruins of the fortress they had
                    most nobly held. Under Suleymán I., whom European historians call the
                    Magnificent, but whom his own people style Kánúní or the Lawgiver, the Turkish
                    empire attained the summit of its power and glory. The two great disasters, at
                    Vienna and Malta, were eclipsed by the number and brilliancy of the sultan’s
                    victories, by which large and important additions were made to the empire in
                    Europe, Asia, and Africa.</p>
                <p>Selim II., the unworthy son and successor of the Magnificent Suleyman, was the
                    first Ottoman monarch who shrank from leading his army in person. He was a man
                    of mean and ignoble character, whose sole pleasure seems to have consisted in
                    the indulgence of his degraded tastes and vicious appetites. The first conflict
                    between the Turks and the Russians occurred in his reign. In view of a
                    threatened war with Persia, the grand vizier Sokolli conceived the idea of
                    uniting the rivers Don and Volga by a canal, by means of which an Ottoman fleet
                    could be sent into the Caspian. But in order to carry out this scheme it was
                    necessary that the town of Astrakhan should be in the hands of the Turks. A
                    considerable force was accordingly despatched from Constantinople to take
                    possession of that city; but the Russian army which Ivan the Terrible sent to
                    its relief drove back the Turks and their Tatar allies from before the walls,
                    1569 (977). Cyprus was the next object of attack. This island, which belonged to
                    Venice, was assailed and taken, though not without heavy loss, at a time of
                    peace between the republic and the Porte, 1570-71 (978). The Christian powers of
                    the Mediterranean were roused and alarmed by this act of treachery, and a
                    maritime league was formed through the efforts of Pope Pius V., with Spain,
                    Venice, and Malta for its most important members. On 7th October 1571 the
                    Christian fleet, under the command of Don John of Austria, encountered the
                    Ottoman ships, led by the galley of the kapudan pasha, Mu’ezzin-záda 'Alí, just
                    outside the Gulf of Lepanto. A furious conflict ensued, which resulted in the
                    utter defeat of the Turks, their admiral being killed and their fleet almost
                    annihilated. This famous fight, although it brought little immediate material
                    advantage to the victors, was of the highest moral value to them; for it broke
                    the spell of Barbarossa, and showed that the Ottoman was no longer invincible on
                    the seas. The only other event of importance during this reign was the final
                    conquest of Tunis for Turkey by Kilij 'Alí, who won it from the Spaniards in
                    1574 (982). Selim II. died miserably the same year.</p>
                <p>Murád III., who now succeeded to the Ottoman throne, was no improvement upon his
                    father; he ruled in name only, all real power being in the hands of worthless
                    favourites. As a natural consequence the empire began rapidly to decay;
                    corruption infected all ranks of official society, the sultan himself selling
                    his favours for bribes; while the other great curse of old Turkey, military
                    insubordination, showed itself in a more threatening aspect than ever. The
                    janissaries mutinied on several occasions, and each time compelled the weak
                    Murád to accede to their demand. Notwithstanding this wretched state of affairs,
                    some extensive and important, though not permanent, additions were made to the
                    empire. These, consisting of Azerbijan and Georgia—the latter had been in
                    alliance with Persia—were the result of a campaign against the last-named
                    country, the internal condition of which was then even worse than that of
                    Turkey. Transylvania, Moldavia, and Walachia rose in revolt, encouraged by the
                    war which broke out in 1593 between Turkey and Austria. In 1594 hostilities with
                    Persia were resumed; and early in the following year Murád died, leaving the
                    empire to his eldest son Muhammed III.</p>
                <p>Things had been going very badly in the war with Austria, when in June 1596 the
                    grand vizier and the mufti, joining their voices with that of Sa'd-ud-Dín the
                    historian, prevailed upon the new sultan, whose character resembled only too
                    closely that of his father, to place himself at the head of the Ottoman army
                    which was about to march into Hungary. Four months later Muhammed met the
                    imperialists under the archduke Maximilian, and the Transylvanians led by Prince
                    Sigismund, on the marshy plain of Keresztes, where a battle lasting three days
                    took place. Although at one time things looked so hopeless for the Turks that
                    the sultan would have fled but for the entreaties and remonstrances of
                    Sa'd-ud-Dín, the 'Osmánlis gained a complete and decisive victory. But nothing
                    came of it; for Muhammed, instead of following up his success, hastened back to
                    Constantinople to receive the congratulations of his courtiers and to resume his
                    indolent and voluptuous life. Nothing else worthy of note occurred during his
                    inglorious reign. He died in 1603 (1012).</p>
                <p>Muhammed III. was the last heir to the Ottoman throne who was entrusted with the
                    government of a province during his father’s lifetime; henceforth all the sons
                    of the sultan were kept secluded in a pavilion called the Kafes or cage in the
                    seraglio gardens. This new system, which was necessarily very prejudicial to the
                    character of the future rulers, had its origin in the same dread of rivals that
                    caused a sultan in those times to put all his brothers to death immediately on
                    his accession.</p>
                <p>The reign of Ahmed I. is not marked by any event of importance. The peace of
                    Sitavorok (Zsitvatorok) between Turkey and Austria, 1606 (1015), made no change
                    of any moment in the territorial possessions of either power, but is interesting
                    as being the first treaty in which an Ottoman sultan condescended to meet a
                    Christian prince on a footing of equality. Hitherto the Turkish monarchs had
                    affected to grant merely short truces to their European enemies. But this peace
                    was to be permanent; the annual payment or tribute of thirty thousand ducats by
                    Austria was to be discontinued; and the ambassadors sent from the Porte were now
                    to be officials of rank, and not, as formerly, menials of the palace or
                    camp.</p>
                <p>Ahmed died in 1617 (1026) and was succeeded by his brother Mustafa I. Up till
                    this time the succession had been regularly from father to son; but, as
                    Mustafa’s life had been spared by his brother on his accession, that prince now
                    ascended the throne in preference to 'Osmán, the eldest son of Ahmed I. This
                    arose from the peculiar nature of the Turkish law of succession, which gives the
                    throne to the eldest male relative of the deceased sovereign. Mustafa was,
                    however, imbecile; so after a reign of three months he was deposed, and his
                    nephew 'Osmán, though only fourteen years of age, seated on the throne in his
                    stead.</p>
                <p>An unsuccessful war with Persia, which had been going on for some time, was now
                    brought to an end by a treaty which restored to the sháh all the territories
                    conquered since the days of Selim II. In 1621 the sultan led his troops against
                    Poland, partially with the view of weakening the janissaries, whom he justly
                    regarded as the most deadly enemies of his empire. This expedition was not
                    attended by any important results, neither Turks nor Poles gaining a decisive
                    advantage. On his return 'Osmán formed another plan for freeing himself from his
                    tyrannical soldiery: he gave out that he was going to make the pilgrimage to
                    Mecca, but his real intention was to proceed only as far as Damascus, there
                    place himself at the head <pb break="no"

                    janissaries and sipáhís in Constantinople. But the janissaries heard of this
                    design and rose in revolt. Incited by a vizier whom 'Osmán had deposed, they
                    seized their sovereign and dragged him to the state prison of the Seven Towers,
                    where shortly afterwards he was foully murdered by the traitor minister, 1622
                    (1031).</p>
                <p>The wretched Mustafa was again raised to the throne, only to be deposed fifteen
                    months afterwards in favour of Murid, the eldest surviving brother of
                    'Osmán.</p>
                <p>In Murid IV., who succeeded to the supreme power in 1623 (1032), when a child of
                    eleven years, Turkey had once more a sultan of the old 'Osmánli type. Since the
                    death of Suleymán the empire had been cursed with a succession of <hi
                    rend="italic">rois faineants,</hi> under whom it had rapidly fallen to decay.
                    The vigour and courage of the new sultan stayed it for a while upon its downward
                    course, and restored to it something of its bygone glory. While still quite
                    young, Murid had been compelled by the mutinous janissaries to deliver into
                    their cruel hands his favourite vizier, Háfiz Pasha. This embittered him against
                    that corps, and, when soon afterwards the soldiers began openly to discuss his
                    deposition, Murid swiftly and suddenly cut off the ringleaders and all others
                    whom he suspected of disloyalty; this struck fear into the hearts of the
                    disaffected soldiers, who, finding themselves without any to organize or direct
                    them, returned to their allegiance. Murid next turned his attention to checking
                    the intolerable corruption and abuses which pervaded every department of the
                    state. He had but one simple though terribly drastic method of reform,—the
                    execution of every official whom he even suspected of any malpractice. Having
                    restored some sort of order in his capital, Murid marched against Persia and
                    recaptured the city and district of Erivan. In 1638 (1048) he undertook a second
                    and more important campaign against the same power. His object was the recovery
                    of Baghdád, which had been taken by the shih’s troops some sixteen years before.
                    The Persians resisted long and gallantly, but at length the Turks carried the
                    city by storm, when Murid disgraced himself by the slaughter of a vast number of
                    the inhabitants. By the peace which followed Turkey restored Erivan to Persia,
                    but retained Baghdád, which has been in its hands ever since. Murid on his
                    return entered Constantinople in triumph. This sultan died in 1640 (1049); his
                    death is said to have been hastened by habits of intemperance, which he had
                    contracted towards the close of his life.</p>
                <p>Ibráhím, the brother of the late sultan, now mounted the Ottoman throne. He was
                    another of those wretched princes who gave themselves up to the indulgence of
                    their own follies and vices without bestowing a thought upon the welfare of
                    their people or the prosperity of their country. All the evils that had been
                    curbed for a time by the stern hand of Murid broke out afresh and in worse form
                    than before. The sultan himself was the most venal of the venal. Shut up in the
                    seraglio, he thought of nothing but the gratification of his own and his
                    favourites’ caprices; gem-encrusted coaches and pleasure-boats, and carpets and
                    hangings of richest sable for his rooms, were among the objects for which he
                    plundered his people and sold every office to the highest bidder. This went on
                    for eight years, till at length his subjects, weary of his exactions and
                    tyranny, deposed him, and made his son Muhammed, then only seven years of age,
                    sultan in his room. The only events of note that occurred during Ibráhím’s
                    tenure of power are the capture of Azoff from the Cossacks and the occupation of
                    Crete. This island, which was then in the hands of Venice, was soon overrun, but
                    it was not till well on in the next reign, after a siege of twenty years, that
                    the Ottomans succeeded in taking Candia the capital.</p>
                <p>The minority of Muhammed IV., who became sultan in 1648 (1058), was marked by all
                    the troubles and evils that might have been anticipated, until the grand
                    vizierate was conferred on Köprili Muhammed in 1656 (1067). This statesman, who
                    was seventy years old when he entered upon the duties of prime minister of
                    Turkey, was the founder of an illustrious family of viziers, whose integrity and
                    strength of character did much to counteract the pernicious influence of
                    degenerate sultans and to prop up for a season the declining empire. Old Köprili
                    accepted the office of grand vizier only upon condition of receiving absolute
                    power; this he employed much in the same way as Murád IV. had done when he set
                    about the work of reform: he executed every one who fell under his suspicion. He
                    died in 1661 (1072), leaving the vizierate to his son Fázil Ahmed. Ahmed was,
                    like his father, a man of great ability, and happily for Turkey he enjoyed the
                    complete confidence of the young sultan, who cared for nothing but the chase,
                    whence he is called in the Ottoman histories Avji Muhammed or Muhammed the
                    Huntsman. Before long Ahmed was called on to lead the Turkish army against
                    Austria. He took Neuhäusel and several places of little importance; but near the
                    convent of St Gotthard (on the Raab) he was completely defeated in 1664 (1075)
                    by a smaller Christian force under Montecuculi. A truce for twenty years on the
                    basis of the treaty of Sitavorok was the result of this battle; the Ottomans,
                    however, retained Neuhäusel. Ahmed next appeared in arms in Crete, for the
                    purpose of bringing to a close the siege of Candia, which had been going on ever
                    since 1648; but it was not till other three years had passed that the brave
                    garrison opened the gates to the grand vizier, in 1669 (1079). The sultan
                    himself was induced to head the next campaign, which was undertaken on behalf of
                    the Cossacks of the Ukraine, who had craved the protection of the Porte against
                    Poland. The Turks took the cities of Kamenetz and Lemberg, whereupon King
                    Michael sued for peace, 1672 (1083), and promised to make over Podolia and the
                    Ukraine to Turkey and to pay an annual tribute of 220,000 ducats. The sultan
                    accepted these terms and returned home in triumph; but the Poles refused to be
                    bound by them, and under the command of Sobieski they attacked and defeated the
                    troops of Ahmed Pasha. The war lasted till 1676, when it was brought to an end
                    by the treaty of Zurawno, which left the sultan in possession of Podolia and
                    almost all the Ukraine. Three days after this peace was signed Ahmed Pasha died.
                    Few men have done more to ruin their country than Kara Mustafa, who succeeded
                    Ahmed in the grand vizierate. His pet scheme was the conquest of Germany and the
                    establishment of a great Turkish province between the Danube and the Rhine, with
                    himself as nominal viceroy but virtual sovereign. He accordingly marched with an
                    enormous army, probably not far off half a million strong, against Vienna. In
                    the summer of 1683 (1094) this mighty host appeared before the walls of the
                    Austrian capital. For an account of the siege, see vol. xix. p. 296. A few weeks
                    after his discomfiture Kara Mustafa was executed at Belgrade by the sultan’s
                    orders. Venice and Russia now declared war against Turkey; misfortune followed
                    misfortune; city after city was rent away from the empire; the Austrians were in
                    possession of almost the whole of Hungary, the Italians of almost all the Morea.
                    At length a severe defeat at Mohacz, where Suleymán had triumphed years before,
                    exhausted the patience of the soldiery, and Muhammed IV. was deposed in 1687
                    (1099).</p>
                <p>The first year of the reign of Suleymán II., who succeeded his brother, was
                    marked by a serious mutiny of the janissaries of the capital, who, aided by the
                    dregs of the population, created a reign of terror in Constantinople, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n667/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0667-0646"/> during which they pillaged the palaces of the
                    principal officers of the government and murdered the grand vizier, along with
                    many of the members of his household. The Austrians, under Charles of Lorraine,
                    Louis of Baden, and Prince Eugene, were carrying all before them in the north:
                    Erlau, Belgrade, and Stuhlweissenburg fell into their hands; and by the end of
                    1689 the Ottomans had lost almost all their former possessions beyond the
                    Danube. Meanwhile the Venetian leader, Morosini, was equally successful in the
                    Morea, completing the conquest of that province, which he added to the dominions
                    of St Mark. When matters had come to this pass, the sultan summoned an
                    extraordinary meeting of the divan to consult on the measures to be taken to
                    meet the danger threatening on every hand. By the unanimous advice of his
                    ministers, Suleymán appointed to the grand vizierate Köprili-záda Mustafa,
                    another son of old Köprili Muhammed. This statesman, who had been trained in the
                    duties of office under his father and brother, worthily upheld the high name of
                    his house. He gave up the whole of his gold and silver plate to be coined into
                    money wherewith to pay the troops; he sought out the best men to fill positions
                    of trust and responsibility in the army and navy; and he exercised and
                    encouraged a wise and just policy of toleration towards the Christian subjects
                    of the sultan. Such was the confidence which his high character and illustrious
                    connexion inspired that large numbers of volunteers hastened to join the Turkish
                    hosts; and in a very few weeks from the time when he took command of the army
                    Mustafa had driven the Austrians out of Servia, and Belgrade once more received
                    a garrison of Ottoman troops. Mustafa returned in triumph to Constantinople,
                    where, early in the summer of 1691 (1102), Suleymán II. died, and was succeeded
                    on the throne by his brother Ahmed II.</p>
                <p>The most important event which occurred during the brief and disastrous reign of
                    this monarch was the defeat and death at Slankamen (Szlankament) of Köprili-záda
                    Mustafa, who in August 1691 advanced from Belgrade to attack the Austrians under
                    Louis of Baden. The unfortunate result of the battle was in great measure owing
                    to the rashness of the vizier, who, in opposition to the advice of the oldest
                    and most experienced of his officers, refused to await behind the lines the
                    attack of the enemy. The Ottomans fought with desperate courage; but the day was
                    decided against them by the death of Mustafa, who was shot while cutting his way
                    through the Christian ranks. Ahmed II. reigned for four years, during which the
                    hapless empire, besides continuing to suffer defeat at the hands of foreign
                    foes, was visited with the curses of pestilence and domestic insurrection.</p>
                <p>On the death of Ahmed II. in the year 1695 (1106) Mustafa II., son of Muhammed
                    IV., was girt with the sword of 'Osmán. The new sultan, aware of the pitiful
                    condition to which the empire had sunk, in part, at least, through the
                    negligence and indifference of his predecessors, resolved to restore the old
                    Ottoman usages, and placed himself at the head of his armies. His first campaign
                    was altogether successful: he recaptured several important fortresses and
                    totally defeated a great Austrian army. During the following winter he worked
                    hard to repair the finances and bring the forces of the empire into a higher
                    state of efficiency; and, when he set out in the spring against the Austrians,
                    fortune continued to smile upon his banners. He defeated the duke of Saxe,
                    raised the siege of Temesvar, and strengthened the garrisons of those fortresses
                    which Turkey still held in Hungary. But in the next year, 1697, all was changed:
                    Prince Eugene was at the head of the Austrians, and on the banks of the Theiss,
                    near Zenta, the Turks sustained an overwhelming defeat, which compelled the
                    sultan to retreat to Temesvar. Thence he returned to Constantinople, and never
                    again led an army against the enemy. Recourse was once more had to the house of
                    Köprili, and Amuja-záda Huseyn, a nephew of old Köprili Muhammed, was promoted
                    to the grand vizierate. Huseyn raised fresh troops; but he saw that what was
                    really needful was peace, and this he succeeded in bringing about. At Carlowitz
                    on 26th January 1699 a peace was arranged, through the’ intervention of England
                    and Holland, between Turkey on the one hand and Austria, Venice, Russia, and
                    Poland on the other. The basis of the treaty, agreed to with certain
                    modifications, was that each power should retain the territories in its
                    possession at the time of opening negotiations. This arrangement left Austria in
                    possession of Transylvania and almost all Hungary and Slavonia; Venice remained
                    mistress of its conquests in Dalmatia and the Morea; Poland received Podolia;
                    and Russia, which under Peter the Great was only now becoming conscious of its
                    strength, retained Azoff, which it had wrested from Turkey three years before.
                    Huseyn Pasha took advantage of the restoration of peace to check the disorders
                    which had sprung up in various parts of the empire, and to endeavour to effect
                    much-needed reforms in many departments of the state. But unfortunately his
                    efforts were thwarted by others less disinterested than himself; and,
                    broken-hearted by the calamities of his country, he retired from office three
                    years after the peace of Carlowitz, and very shortly afterwards died. Mustafa
                    II. very soon followed the example of his minister, and abdicated in 1703 (1115)
                    in favour of his brother Ahmed III.</p>
                <p>Although the peace of the empire was often broken during his reign, Ahmed III.
                    was not of a warlike disposition, and all the representations and entreaties of
                    Charles XII. of Sweden, who after the disaster of Pultowa had taken refuge in
                    Turkey, failed to induce him to re-open hostilities with the czar. In 1710
                    Nu'mán Pasha, son of Amuja-záda Huseyn, and the last of the Köprili family, was
                    appointed grand vizier. Though able and tolerant, he was so much addicted to
                    interfering in the business of his subordinates that he became the object of
                    general dislike, and was dismissed from his office after holding it for fourteen
                    months. The menacing preparations of Russia in the south had more influence with
                    the Porte than the prayers of the Swedish king, and in 1711 the new grand
                    vizier, Baltaji Muhammed, marched into Moldavia to meet the forces of Peter the
                    Great, who had formed an entrenched camp near the village of Hush, on the right
                    bank of the Pruth. Here the vizier blockaded him, and after two days’ severe
                    fighting compelled him to surrender with all his army. By the treaty which
                    followed the czar pledged himself, among other things, to restore the fortress
                    of Azoff and all its dependencies to the sultan, and to grant the king of Sweden
                    a free and safe passage to his own country through the Muscovite dominions. The
                    lenity of Baltaji Muhammed in not destroying the czar and his army when they
                    were within his grasp caused such discontent at Constantinople that he was
                    dismissed from the vizierate, which was conferred on 'Alí Pasha, known as Dámád
                    'Alí or 'Alí the Son-in-Law, from the circumstance of his having married a
                    daughter of the sultan. This vizier distinguished himself by winning back from
                    Venice the whole of the Morea in a single campaign (1715). His next venture, a
                    war against Austria, undertaken in the following year, had a very different
                    issue, he himself being slain and his army routed in a great battle at
                    Peterwardein. Next year Prince Eugene, the conqueror of Dámád 'Alí, laid siege
                    to Belgrade, which he forced to capitulate after driving off a large army sent
                    by the Turks to its relief. These events led to the peace of Passarowitz in
                    1718, by which Austria , acquired that portion of Hungary which had remained in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"

                    territories in Servia and Walachia. The grand vizier Ibrâhîm, another son-in-law
                    of the sultan, who was at the head of affairs from 1718 to 1730, contrived to
                    secure for the empire an unusually long respite from internal disorders; but the
                    sultan’s love of costly pomp and splendour and the luxurious magnificence of his
                    court rendered him so unpopular that, in consequence of a riot in the autumn of
                    1730 (1143), he voluntarily abdicated the throne, and his nephew Mahmúd I.

                <p>With the treaty of Passarowitz the Venetian republic disappears from the scene of
                    Turkish warfare. Russia gradually becomes a more formidable enemy than Austria;
                    and the subject Christian races imperceptibly enter on the first stages of
                    national consolidation and revival. After the long and resultless war with
                    Persia hostilities again broke out with Russia in 1736. Marshal Münnich stormed
                    the lines of Perekop and devastated the Crimea; but he was unable to maintain
                    his army there and retreated with greatly diminished forces. Azoff was taken by
                    General Lascy; and in the following year Otchakoff fell into the hands of
                    Münnich, while the Crimea was again invaded and ravaged. Austria now joined
                    Russia, and the Porte had to sustain a war in Servia and Bosnia as well as on
                    the coasts of the Black Sea. The double combat was carried on with very
                    different results. While the Russians won victory after victory, and finally
                    penetrated into the heart of Moldavia, the Austrians were defeated and driven
                    across the Danube. On their advancing from Belgrade in the summer of 1739 they
                    were defeated with great loss at Krotzka, and compelled to sue for peace. The
                    treaty of Belgrade, which was signed on 1st September 1739, restored to the
                    Porte Belgrade and Orsova, with the portions of Servia, Bosnia, and Walachia
                    which it had ceded to Austria at the peace of Passarowitz. Russia, unable to
                    continue the war with a victorious Turkish army ready to fall upon its flank,
                    had to conclude peace on very moderate terms. It received Azoff, but under a
                    stipulation that the fortifications should be razed, and that no Russian vessels
                    of war should be kept either on the Black Sea or on the Sea of Azoff. The peace
                    was the last advantageous one made by the Porte without allies; and the
                    succeeding thirty years were on the whole a period of respite from
                    misfortune.</p>
                <p>After this followed the wars with the empress Catherine, before whose genius and
                    resources it seemed as if Turkey must inevitably sink into nothingness. The
                    first contest was provoked by the armed intervention of the empress in Polish
                    affairs and her well-known intrigues with rebellious subjects of the Porte. War
                    was rashly declared by Mustafa III. in October 1768. In 1769 the Russians
                    entered Moldavia and captured the fortress of Choczin (Chotim); in the following
                    year their armies made good the conquest of Moldavia and Walachia, while a fleet
                    from the Baltic entered the Greek Archipelago and landed troops in the Morea.
                    The Greeks of the Morea rose in insurrection; they were, however, overpowered,
                    and the small Russian force withdrew, leaving the Greeks to the vengeance of
                    their conquerors. At sea the Turks suffered a severe defeat near Chios, and
                    their fleet was subsequently blockaded and set on fire in the Bay of Tchesme,
                    the principal officers in the Russian navy being Englishmen. Assistance was,
                    moreover, given by the Russians to Ali Bey, a Mameluke chieftain who was in
                    rebellion against the Porte in Egypt, and to Tahir, a sheikh who had made
                    himself independent 'at Acre. In 1771 the Russians invaded and conquered the
                    Crimea. Austria now took alarm, and signed a convention with the Porte
                    preparatory to armed intervention. But the partition of Poland reunited the
                    three neighbouring Christian powers and prevented a general war. An armistice
                    was agreed upon between Russia and the Porte, and negotiations followed. These
                    were broken off in 1773. The Russians crossed the Danube, and, though
                    unsuccessful in their attempts upon Silistria and Varna, so completely defeated
                    the Turkish forces in the field that on 21st July 1774 the Porte concluded peace
                    at Kutchuk-Kainardji under conditions more unfavourable than those which it had
                    rejected in the previous year. The Tartar territory of the Crimea, with Kuban
                    and the adjoining districts, was made into an independent state, Russia
                    retaining Azoff, Kertch, and Kinburn. Moldavia and Walachia were restored, but
                    on the condition that, as occasion might require, the Russian minister at
                    Constantinople might remonstrate in their favour. Russia, in fact, was given a
                    species of protectorate over these provinces. Permission was given to Russia to
                    erect a church in Constantinople, and the following engagement was made: “The
                    Porte promises to protect the Christian religion and its churches; and it also
                    allows the court of Russia to make upon all occasions representations as well in
                    favour of the new church at Constantinople as on behalf of its ministers,
                    promising to take such representations into consideration.” Out of this clause
                    arose the claim of Russia to the right of protection over all the Christian
                    subjects of the Porte, though the specific right of intervention was clearly
                    attached only to a single church and its ministers. By other clauses in the
                    treaty the obligations restraining Russia from making fortifications and placing
                    ships of war on the Black Sea were annulled. It received the right of free
                    navigation for its merchant ships on all Turkish waters, and the right of
                    placing consuls at all Turkish ports. These last two conditions were of great
                    historical importance through their effect upon Greece. The consuls appointed
                    were usually Greek traders, and permission to carry the Russian flag was
                    indiscriminately given to Greek vessels. Hence there followed that great
                    development of Greek commerce, and of the Greek merchant navy, which in half a
                    century made the insurgent Greeks more than a match for the Turks at sea.</p>
                <p>The stipulation that the Crimea and adjoining districts should be made into an
                    independent state was of course not intended by Russia to be anything more than
                    a veil for annexation; and in 1783 Catherine united this territory to her
                    dominions. She had now definitely formed the plan of extinguishing Turkish
                    sovereignty in Europe and placing her younger grandson on the throne of a
                    restored Greek kingdom. The boy was named Constantine; his whole education was
                    Greek and such as to fit him for the throne of Constantinople. Joseph II. of
                    Austria threw himself eagerly into the plan for a partition of the Ottoman
                    empire, and in 1788 followed Russia into war. While the Russians besieged
                    Otchakoff, Joseph invaded Bosnia; but he was unsuccessful and retired
                    ingloriously into Hungary. Otchakoff was stormed by Suwaroff on 16th December
                    1788. In the following year the Turkish armies were overthrown by Suwaroff in
                    Moldavia and by the Austrian Laudon on the south of the Danube. The fate of the
                    Ottoman empire seemed to tremble in the balance; it was, however, saved by the
                    convulsions into which Joseph’s reckless autocracy had thrown his own dominions,
                    and by the triple alliance of England, Prussia, and Holland, now formed by Pitt
                    for the preservation of the balance of power in Europe. Joseph died in 1790; his
                    successor Leopold II. entered into negotiations, and concluded peace at Sistova
                    in August 1791, relinquishing all his conquests except a small district in
                    Croatia. Catherine continued the war alone. Ismail was captured by Suwaroff with
                    fearful slaughter, and the Russian armies pushed on south of the Danube. Pitt,
                    with <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n669/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0669-0648"/> the triple alliance, attempted to impose his
                    mediation on the empress Catherine, and to induce her to restore all her
                    conquests. She refused, and both Prussia and England armed for war; but public
                    opinion declared so strongly against the minister in England that it was
                    impossible for him to pursue his plan. Catherine nevertheless found it in her
                    interest to terminate the war with the Porte. Poland claimed her immediate
                    attention; and, adjourning to a more convenient season her designs upon
                    Constantinople, she concluded the treaty of Jassy in January 1792, by which she
                    added to her empire Otchakoff, with the seaboard as far as the Dniester. The
                    protectorate of Russia over Tiflis and Kartalinia was recognized.</p>
                <p>Catherine’s successor Paul (1796-1801) made it his business to reverse his
                    mother’s policy by abandoning the attack on Turkey. Bonaparte’s invasion of
                    Egypt and the destruction of the French fleet by Nelson at the battle of the
                    Nile led the Porte to join the second coalition against France. Bonaparte,
                    invading Syria, was checked and turned back at Acre, where Jezzar Pasha was
                    assisted in his strenuous defence by an English squadron under Sir Sidney Smith.
                    A Turkish army was meanwhile transported from Rhodes to the Egyptian coast. This
                    army was destroyed by Bonaparte on his return to Egypt at the battle of Aboukir
                    on 25th July 1799, after which Bonaparte set sail for France, leaving the
                    Egyptian command to Kléber. Kléber, cut off from all communication with France
                    and threatened by superior Turkish forces, entered into a convention at El Arish
                    for the evacuation of Egypt. This convention, however, was annulled by Lord
                    Keith, the English admiral, and Kléber replied by giving battle to the Turks and
                    defeating them at Heliopolis on 20th March 1800. Egypt was finally wrested from
                    the French by the English expedition under Abercromby, and restored to the
                    sultan. The Ionian Islands, which France had taken from Venice at the time of
                    the treaty of Campo Formio, were conquered by a combined Russian and Turkish
                    force, and were established as a republic, at first under the joint protectorate
                    of Russia and the Porte, afterwards under the sole protectorate of Russia. The
                    former Venetian ports on the mainland of Epirus and Albania were given up to
                    Turkey. Somewhat later, under pressure from St Petersburg, the sultan undertook
                    not to remove the hospodars, or governors, of Walachia and Moldavia without
                    consulting Russia, and to allow no Turks except merchants and traders to enter
                    those territories.</p>
                <p>On the restoration of peace France reassumed its ancient position as the friend
                    and ally of the Porte. The sultan now on the throne was Selim III. (1789-1807).
                    Though the results of the war of the second coalition had been favourable to
                    Turkey, the Ottoman empire was in a most perilous condition. Everywhere the
                    provincial governors were making themselves independent of the sultan’s
                    authority <hi rend="italic">; a</hi> new fanatical sect, the Wahhabees, had
                    arisen in Arabia and seized upon the holy places; the janissaries were
                    rebellious and more formidable to their sovereign than to a foreign enemy; and
                    the Christian races were beginning to aspire to independence. It had seemed for
                    a while as if the first to rise against the Porte would be the Greeks, among
                    whom the revolutionary influences of 1789 and the songs of the poet Rhegas, put
                    to death by the Turks in 1798, stirred deep feelings of hatred against their
                    oppressors. Circumstances, however, postponed the Greek revolt and accelerated
                    that of the Servians. In the country immediately south of the Danube the
                    sultan’s authority was defied by the janissaries settled about Belgrade and by
                    Passwan Oglu, ruler of Widdin in Bulgaria. The pasha of Servia, hard pressed by
                    these rebels, called upon the rayas to take up arms in defence of the sultan.
                    They did so, and in 1804 the janissaries answered by a series of massacres in
                    the Servian villages. The Servians now rose as a nation against the janissaries.
                    Kara George became their chief, and in combination with the pasha of Bosnia,
                    acting under the sultan’s orders, exterminated the janissaries or drove them out
                    of the country. Victorious over one oppressor, the Servians refused to submit to
                    another. They carried on the war against the sultan himself, and at the
                    suggestion of Russia sent envoys to Constantinople demanding that for the future
                    the fortresses of Servia should be garrisoned only by Servian troops.</p>
                <p>When the third European coalition against France was in course of formation
                    Russian and French influences were in rivalry at Constantinople. The victories
                    of Napoleon in 1805 gave him the ascendency, and his envoy prevailed upon the
                    sultan to dismiss, without consulting Russia, the hospodars of Walachia and
                    Moldavia, who were considered to be agents of the court of St Petersburg. This
                    was a breach of the engagement made by the sultan in 1802, and it was followed
                    by the entry of Russian troops into the principalities. England, as the ally of
                    Russia, sent a fleet under Admiral Duckworth through the Dardanelles to threaten
                    Constantinople. While the admiral wasted time in negotiations, the French
                    ambassador, General Sebastiani, taught the Turks how to fortify their capital.
                    The English admiral found that he could do nothing, and repassed the
                    Dardanelles, suffering some loss on the passage. The war on the Danube was not
                    carried on with much vigour on either side. Alexander was occupied with the
                    struggle against Napoleon on the Vistula; Selím III. was face to face with
                    mutiny in Constantinople, having brought upon himself the bitter hatred of the
                    janissaries by attempting to form them into a body of troops drilled and
                    disciplined after the methods of modern armies While the military art in Europe
                    had been progressing for centuries, Turkey had made no other changes in its
                    military system than those which belonged to general decay. Its troops were a
                    mere horde, capable indeed of a vigorous assault and of a stubborn defence, but
                    utterly untrained in exercises and manoeuvres, and almost ignorant of the
                    meaning of discipline. Selim was a reformer in government and administration as
                    well as in military affairs. He broke from the traditions of his palace, and
                    began a new epoch in Turkish history; but the influences opposed to him were too
                    strong, and a mutiny of the janissaries in Constantinople deprived him of his
                    crown. He was allowed to live, but as a prisoner, while the puppet of the
                    janissaries, Mustafa IV., was placed on the throne (May 1807).</p>
                <p>A few weeks after this event the treaty of Tilsit ended the war between France
                    and Russia, and provided for the nominal mediation of Napoleon between Russia
                    and the Porte. A truce followed between the armies on the Danube. Among the
                    Turkish generals who had understood the necessity of Selim’s reforms, and who
                    were prepared to support him against the janissaries, was Bairaktar, commander
                    at Rustchuk. As soon as the truce gave him freedom of action, Bairaktar marched
                    upon Constantinople. Leading his troops against the palace, he demanded the
                    restoration of Selim. As the palace gates were closed, Bairaktar ordered an
                    assault; but at the moment when his troops were entering Selim was put to death.
                    Besides Mustafa there was only one member of the house of Osman remaining, his
                    brother Mahmúd, who concealed himself in the furnace of a bath until the palace
                    was in the hands of Bairaktar’s soldiers. He was then placed on the throne (July
                    1808). For a while Bairaktar governed as grand vizier. He was rash enough,
                    however, to dismiss part of his own soldiers from Constantinople. The
                    janissaries attacked him in his palace. A tower in which he defended himself was
                    blown up, and after a battle in the streets of <pb break="no"

                    remainder of Bairaktar’s troops, during which the dethroned sultan Mustafa was
                    put to death, the janissaries remained conquerors, and Mahmúd was forced to
                    submit to their demands. The innovations of the late reign were abolished, and
                    for a while Mahmúd seemed content to reign as servant of the reaction.</p>
                <p>It is well known that plans for the partition of the Ottoman empire occupied
                    Napoleon and Alexander at Tilsit. Austria, though unwilling to see Russia
                    aggrandized, was prepared in the last resort to combine with the dismembering
                    powers, if all attempts to prevent the execution of the plan by diplomatic means
                    should fail. But after a few years the alliance declined and a war between
                    France and Russia was seen to be inevitable. Meanwhile the conflict on the
                    Danube had been resumed, and the Servians were still in arms. The Russians had
                    advanced into Bulgaria and captured Silistria. England, which had made peace
                    with Turkey in 1809, sought to reconcile the belligerents, in order that the
                    czar might be free to employ his whole force against Napoleon. In May 1812 a
                    treaty was signed at Bucharest, by which Bessarabia was ceded to Russia, the
                    river Pruth becoming the boundary of the two empires. The Porte in this treaty
                    promised to grant an amnesty to the Servians, to leave to them the management of
                    their internal affairs, and to impose upon them only moderate taxes. These
                    promises, however, were neither accepted by the Servians as a sufficient
                    concession, nor were they observed by the Porte. The Servians continued to
                    fight, and ultimately secured their autonomy about 1817 without help from
                    Russia.</p>
                <p>Mahmúd II. (1808-1839) was the only sultan of modern times who possessed the
                    qualities of a great ruler. Brought up in the seclusion of the seraglio till the
                    age of twenty-three, when he was suddenly placed on the throne, it is surprising
                    that he should have shown the power, the resolution, and the intelligence which
                    marked his government. The difficulties of his reign were enormous. He belonged
                    to an epoch when the Ottoman empire might fairly be considered as in actual
                    dissolution. This he to some extent arrested, and the reforms which he effected,
                    partial and imperfect as they were, have prolonged the existence of the Turkish
                    state to our own day. The first and most obvious internal danger to be met was
                    the insubordination of the provincial pashas. Against these rebellious servants
                    Mahmúd waged a persistent and unwearying war, now employing them against one
                    another, now crushing them by his own armed force. One of the most formidable
                    was Ali Pasha of Janina, who had made himself master of Albania and part of
                    Greece. When Mahmúd in 1820 threw his armies upon this chieftain, the outbreak
                    of hostilities in Epirus was the signal for the insurrection of Greece. While
                    Hypsilanti, grandson of a hospodar of Moldavia who had been put to death by the
                    Porte, raised the standard of revolt in Moldavia, asserting that Russia had
                    promised the Christians its support, the Greeks of the Morea rose and
                    exterminated the Turkish population among them. Hypsilanti was soon crushed; and
                    the rising in the Morea was answered by massacres of the Greeks in the principal
                    cities of the empire, and by the execution of Gregory, patriarch of
                    Constantinople, the head of the Greek Church. These deeds of violence excited
                    the utmost indignation in Russia. A despatch was sent to Constantinople, calling
                    upon the Porte to restore the churches which had been destroyed, to guarantee
                    the inviolability of Christian worship in the future, and to discriminate in its
                    punishments between the innocent and the guilty. These demands were presented as
                    an ultimatum by the Russian ambassador, who, not receiving an answer within the
                    time allowed, quitted Constantinople (27th July 1821). The influence of Austria
                    and England, however, restrained the emperor Alexander from declaring war, and
                    the Greeks were left to sustain their combat by themselves. As long as Ali Pasha
                    was unsubdued, the only forces which the sultan could employ against the Greeks
                    were irregular bands of volunteers. It was by one of these hordes that the
                    fearful massacres of Chios, in the spring of 1822, were perpetrated. In that
                    same spring, however, the overthrow and death of Ali set free the regular
                    troops. Two armies of considerable strength now moved southwards from Thessaly,
                    with the object of reducing the country north of the Gulf of Corinth and then
                    uniting to conquer the Morea. The western army, commanded by Omer Brionis, was
                    checked by the Suliotes, and subsequently beaten back by the defenders of
                    Missolonghi. The eastern army, after advancing under the command of Dramali into
                    the Morea, was compelled to retreat. But the passes in its rear had been seized
                    by the Greeks; on all sides the enemy closed in upon it; and it was only through
                    the disorders of the Greeks themselves that Dramali's force escaped
                    annihilation. Of those who survived the encounter most perished by sickness and
                    famine in the neighbourhood of Corinth. Nor was the fortune of the Ottomans
                    better at sea. The destruction of their admiral’s vessel with all its crew by
                    the fire-ship of the Greek captain, Kanaris, caused such terror that all further
                    attempts to reduce the islands were abandoned, and the fleet returned to the
                    Dardanelles.</p>
                <p>After an interval of ineffective land warfare, the sultan determined to call upon
                    Mehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt, for assistance. Mehemet had risen to power in the
                    disturbed period that followed the expulsion of the French from Egypt. He had a
                    more powerful fleet than that of his sovereign, and an army disciplined after
                    the European system. In calling upon his powerful vassal for help the sultan
                    must have been aware of the dangers which his aggrandizement would involve.
                    Mehemet eagerly responded to Mahmúd’s call; and his son Ibrâhîm, in command of a
                    powerful armament, set sail in the spring of 1824 from Alexandria against Crete.
                    This island was rapidly conquered, and Ibrâhîm, after failing in some combined
                    operations against Sanios, crossed over to the Morea. Here he marched across the
                    peninsula, carrying all before him. Nauplia alone maintained its defence, while
                    the Egyptian sent out his harrying columns, slaughtering and devastating in
                    every direction. From the Morea Ibrâhîm was summoned to assist the Turks, who
                    had been for nine months unsuccessfully engaged in a second siege of
                    Missolonghi. Ibrâhîm began his siege operations in the beginning of 1826; but it
                    was not for three months more that Missolonghi fell. The tide of Ottoman
                    conquest moved on eastwards, and the acropolis of Athens capitulated in the
                    following year. But the defence of Missolonghi had lasted long enough to bring
                    the powers of Europe into the field. On the death of the emperor Alexander at
                    the end of 1825, Canning sent the duke of Wellington to St Petersburg to
                    negotiate conditions of joint diplomatic action on the part of England and
                    Russia. A protocol signed at St Petersburg on 4th April 1826 fixed the
                    conditions on which the mediation of Great Britain was to be tendered to the
                    Porte. Greece was to remain tributary to the sultan, but to be governed by its
                    own elected authorities and to be independent in its commercial relations. The
                    surviving Turkish population was to be removed from Greece; all property
                    belonging to Turks, whether on the continent or the islands, was to be purchased
                    by the Greeks. This protocol was developed into the treaty of London between
                    England, Russia, and France, signed in July 1827, by which the three powers
                    bound themselves to put an end to the conflict in the East. In pursuance of this
                    treaty the mediation of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n671/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0671-0650"/> powers was offered to the Porte, and an armistice
                    demanded. It was contemptuously refused. The united fleets of the powers
                    consequently appeared before Navarino, where Ibráhím was assembling his forces
                    for an expedition against Hydra. After a vain attempt at negotiation, they
                    entered the harbour and fought the battle of Navarino, on 20th October 1827, in
                    which the Turco-Egyptian fleet was totally destroyed. Canning had just died; his
                    successors could only speak of Navarino as an “untoward event” and withdraw from
                    further interference, leaving Russia and the Porte face to face. After a
                    proclamation by the sultan calling the Mohammedans to arms, war was declared by
                    Russia in April 1828. The moment was singularly favourable for Russia, for
                    Mahmúd had, little more than a year before, exterminated the janissaries. After
                    bringing over soldiers from Asia to make him secure of victory in the event of a
                    conflict, he had called upon the janissaries to contribute a certain number of
                    men to the regiments about to be formed on the European pattern. The janissaries
                    refused and raised the standard of rebellion. Mahmúd opened fire on them with
                    cannon, and the slaughter did not cease until the last of them had perished. The
                    great difficulty in the way of a military reorganization was thus removed, and
                    the newly-modelled regiments were raised to about 40,000 men. Small as the army
                    was with which he had to meet the Russian invasion in 1828, the campaign of that
                    year was honourable to the Turkish arms. Though Varna fell into the hands of the
                    Russians, Silistria and Shumla were successfully defended, and the Russians,
                    after suffering great losses, were compelled to withdraw to winter quarters on
                    the Danube. In the following year they advanced through Bulgaria, defeated the
                    Turks at Kulevtcha, and, after the surrender of Silistria, crossed the Balkans
                    under the command of Diebitsch. They reached Adrianople, which immediately
                    capitulated. Diebitsch, concealing the real weakness of his force, sent out
                    detachments towards the Euxine and the Aegean, while the centre of his army
                    marched on Constantinople. Had the sultan known the insignificant number of his
                    enemy, he might safely have defied him. But the wildest exaggerations were
                    current in the capital; Kars and Erzeroum had fallen into the hands of
                    Paskiewitch, commander of the czar’s forces in Asia; and in Constantinople the
                    friends of the slaughtered janissaries threatened revolt. Mahmúd listened to the
                    advocates of peace, and on 14th September hostilities were brought to a close by
                    the treaty of Adrianople. This treaty gave Russia the ports of Anapa and Poti on
                    the eastern coast of the Black Sea; but its most important clauses were those
                    which confirmed and extended the protectorate of the czar over the Danubian
                    principalities. The office of hospodar, hitherto tenable for seven years, was
                    now made an appointment for life, and the sultan undertook to permit no
                    interference on the part of neighbouring pashas with these provinces. No
                    fortified point was to be retained by the Turks on the left bank of the Danube;
                    no Mussulman was to reside or hold property within the principalities. The
                    Bosphorus and the Dardanelles were declared free and open to the merchant ships
                    of all nations. The Porte further gave its adherence to the treaty of London
                    relating to Greece, and accepted the act entered into by the allied powers for
                    regulating the Greek frontier. An indemnity in money was declared to be owing to
                    Russia; and by leaving the amount to be fixed by subsequent agreement Russia
                    retained in its own hands the most powerful means of enforcing its influence at
                    Constantinople. The suzerainty over Greece, which the powers had at first agreed
                    to leave to the sultan, was by common consent abandoned, and Greece became an
                    independent kingdom.</p>
                <p>At the close of eight years of warfare Mahmúd’s southernmost provinces were even
                    more completely severed from the empire than Servia and the Danubian
                    principalities. It was in vain that he had borne the humiliation of calling upon
                    his vassal, Mehemet Ali, for help, and Mehemet’s reward had now to be paid.
                    Crete was offered to him; this, however, was far from satisfying his ambition,
                    and in November 1831 he threw an army under Ibrâhîm into Palestine and began the
                    conquest of Syria. The sultan now declared Mehemet and his son to be rebels, and
                    despatched an army against them. The first encounter took place in the valley of
                    the Orontes. The Turks were put to the rout, and retired into Cilicia. Ibrâhîm
                    following gained a second victory at the pass of Beylan, and, after crossing
                    Mount Taurus, destroyed the last army of the sultan at Konieh, on 21st December
                    1832. In this extremity Mahmúd looked for help to the European powers, and
                    Russia at once tendered its aid. At the request of the sultan a Russian fleet
                    appeared before Constantinople. The French ambassador thereupon threatened to
                    quit the capital; and finally, under French mediation, terms of peace were
                    signed with Ibráhím at Kutaya (April 1833), the sultan making over to his
                    vassal, not only the whole of Syria, but also the province of Adana between
                    Mount Taurus and the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>Scarcely had this treaty been concluded when Russian influence again won the
                    ascendency at Constantinople, and a treaty of alliance between Turkey and Russia
                    was signed at the palace of Unkiar Skelessi, which in fact reduced Turkey to the
                    condition of a vassal state. The form of the treaty was skilfully framed to
                    disguise the relation of dependence which it created and the right of
                    intervention in the internal affairs of the Ottoman empire which it gave to
                    Russia. Each power pledged itself to render assistance to the other not only
                    against the attack of an external enemy but wherever its peace and security
                    might be endangered. Another article declared that, in order to diminish the
                    burdens of the Porte, the czar would not demand the material help to which the
                    treaty entitled him, but that in lieu thereof the Porte undertook, whenever
                    Russia should be at war, to close the Dardanelles to the war-ships of all
                    nations. The control of the Dardanelles was thus transferred from Turkey to
                    Russia, and the entrance to the Black Sea converted into a Russian fortified
                    outpost. In this treaty, brilliant as it appeared, Russia had gone too far. The
                    Western powers declared that they would not recognize it, and the most strenuous
                    and systematic efforts were henceforth made both by France and England to
                    diminish Russian influence in the East. France, anxious to gain in Egypt a
                    counterpoise to England’s naval power in the Mediterranean, made itself the
                    patron and ally of Mehemet Ali. England adhered to the cause of the sultan, and
                    on many occasions showed its hostility to Mehemet. Thus the two Western powers,
                    though both in antagonism to Russia, were directly in conflict with one another
                    in their Eastern policy. Mahmúd in the meantime was steadily preparing to renew
                    the war with his rival. He obtained the services of Moltke and other Prussian
                    officers in organizing his army, and, after a successful campaign against the
                    rebellious tribes of Kurdistan, assembled his troops in the spring of 1839 on
                    the upper Euphrates; and marched against Ibrâhîm. In the operations which
                    followed the advice of the European officers was persistently disregarded by the
                    pasha in command; and on 24th June the Turkish army was annihilated by Ibráhím
                    at Nisib. To complete the ruin of the empire, the Turkish admiral, Achmet Fewzi,
                    sailed into the port of Alexandria and handed over his fleet to Mehemet Ali. The
                    sultan did not live to hear of the overthrow of his hopes. He died in the same
                    week in which the battle of Nisib was fought, leaving the throne to his son
                    'Abd-ul-Mejíd (1839-1861).</p>

                <p>The very suddenness of these disasters contributed ultimately to the preservation
                    of the Ottoman empire, inasmuch as it compelled the powers of Europe to take
                    action. The French and English fleets appeared in the Dardanelles. The czar saw
                    that it was impossible to maintain the treaty of Unkiar Skelessi, and this
                    treaty was tacitly abandoned. Russia now addressed itself to the task of
                    widening the existing differences between France and England. France insisted on
                    far more favourable conditions for Mehemet Ali than England would allow,
                    demanding that Egypt and all Syria should be given to him in hereditary
                    dominion, with no further obligation towards the sultan than the payment of an
                    annual tribute. Russia and the other powers took part with England, and
                    ultimately, without asking the sanction of France, the four powers signed a
                    treaty pledging themselves to enforce upon Mehemet the terms proposed by
                    England, which practically reduced him to the position of an ordinary pasha in
                    Palestine, while leaving him the hereditary government of Egypt. On the
                    publication of this treaty Thiers, the French minister, prepared for war. He
                    was, however, dismissed by Louis Philippe, and his successor, Guizot, accepted
                    the situation. As Mehemet Ali refused to give up his conquests, an
                    Anglo-Austrian naval squadron was sent to co-operate with a Turkish force in
                    attacking the coast-towns of Syria. Acre was captured, and Ibráhím, assailed by
                    the mountain tribes of the interior, was forced to retire to Egypt. A convention
                    made between Mehemet and Sir Charles Napier, who had appeared at Alexandria with
                    part of the fleet, formed the basis of the ultimate settlement, by which
                    Mehemet, after formal submission to the sultan, was recognized as hereditary
                    governor of Egypt. Russia now united with the other powers in a declaration that
                    the ancient rule of the Ottoman empire, forbidding the passage of the
                    Dardanelles to the war-ships of all nations, except when the Porte should itself
                    be at war, was accepted by Europe at large.</p>
                <p>The young sultan entered on his reign nominally as an independent sovereign, but
                    really under the protection of the European powers. His minister, Reshid Pasha,
                    who had gained in an unusual degree the confidence of Western statesmen,
                    understood the necessity of bringing the Turkish system of government more into
                    harmony with the ideas of the civilized world. An edict, known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hatti-sherif of Gulhane,</hi> announced the speedy establishment
                    of institutions “which should insure to all subjects of the sultan perfect
                    security for their lives, their honour, and their property, a regular method of
                    collecting the taxes, and an equally regular method of recruiting the army and
                    fixing duration of service.” Scarcely had this edict been published when Reshid
                    was driven from power by a palace intrigue. His reforming efforts, like those of
                    Mahmúd, were not wholly ineffective; yet little was realized in comparison with
                    what was promised and what was needed. The Turkish Government was soon
                    discredited, and the intervention of Europe required, by conflicts between the
                    Christian and Mohammedan tribes in the Lebanon, resulting in massacres of the
                    former. After the convulsions of 1848 the sultan incurred the enmity of the
                    autocratic courts by refusing to give up Kossuth and other exiles who had taken
                    refuge within his dominions. The suppression of the national Hungarian
                    Government by Russia in 1849 had heightened in the emperor Nicholas the sense of
                    his own power. He now looked forward to the speedy extinction of Turkey, and in
                    1853 proposed to the British ambassador, Sir H. Seymour, a plan for the division
                    of “the sick man’s” inheritance as soon as he should expire. Disputes between
                    France and Russia relating to the rights of the Latin and Greek Churches in
                    certain sacred places were made the occasion for the assertion of a formal claim
                    on the part of the czar to a protectorate over all Christians in Turkey
                    belonging to the Greek Church. This claim not being acknowledged by the Porte, a
                    Russian army entered the Danubian principalities. After ineffective negotiations
                    war was declared by the sultan on 4th October 1853. Hostilities commenced in
                    Walachia, and the Turkish fleet was attacked and destroyed at Sinope. England
                    and France allied themselves with the Porte, and landed an army at Varna in the
                    spring of the following year. Silistria was successfully defended by the Turks;
                    and, on the occupation of the Danubian principalities by Austria, the allies
                    took up the offensive and transferred their forces to the Crimea. The siege of
                    Sebastopol followed, ending in its capture in September 1855. Meanwhile Russian
                    and Turkish forces were opposed in Asia. Kars maintained a gallant defence, but
                    succumbed to famine two months after the fall of Sebastopol. The peace of Paris
                    followed, in which Russia ceded to Turkey the portion of Bessarabia adjacent to
                    the mouth of the Danube. The Black Sea was neutralized, Russia and the Porte
                    alike engaging to keep no war-ships and to maintain no arsenals there. The
                    exclusive protectorate of Russia over the Danubian principalities was abolished,
                    and the autonomy of these provinces, as well as of Servia, placed under the
                    guarantee of all the powers. The Porte published a firman, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hatti-Humaiun,</hi> professing to abolish “every distinction making any class
                    of the subjects of the empire inferior to any other class on account of their
                    religion, language, and race,” and establishing complete equality between
                    Christians and Mahommedans; the powers in return declared the Porte admitted to
                    the advantages of the public law and concert of Europe. The absurd stipulation
                    was added that no right should thereby accrue to the powers to interfere either
                    collectively or separately in the relations of the sultan with his subjects.</p>
                <p>The Crimean War gave to part of the Balkan population twenty years more of
                    national development under the slackened grasp of the Porte; and by
                    extinguishing the friendship of Austria and Russia it rendered the liberation of
                    Italy possible. But each direct proviso of the treaty of Paris seemed made only
                    to be mocked by events. Scarcely a year passed without some disturbance among
                    the Christian subjects of the sultan, in which the interference of the powers
                    invariably followed in one form or another. A new series of massacres in the
                    Lebanon in 1860 caused France to land a force in Syria. Walachia and Moldavia
                    formed themselves into a single state under the name of Roumania, to which the
                    house of Hohenzollern soon afterwards gave a sovereign. Bosnia and Montenegro
                    took up arms. Servia got rid of its Turkish garrisons. Crete fought long for its
                    independence, and seemed for a moment likely to be united to Greece under the
                    auspices of the powers; but it was ultimately abandoned to its Turkish masters.
                    The overthrow of France in the war of 1870 and the consequent isolation of
                    England led Russia to declare the provision of the treaty of Paris which
                    excluded its ships of war and its arsenals from the Black Sea to be no longer in
                    force. To save appearances, the British Government demanded that the matter
                    should be referred to a European conference, where Russia’s will was duly
                    ratified.</p>
                <p>A few <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> years later the horizon of eastern Europe
                    visibly darkened with the coming storm. Russian influences were no doubt at
                    work; but the development of national feeling which had so powerfully affected
                    every other part of Europe during the 19th century could not remain without
                    effect among the Christian races of the Balkan peninsula. In 1875 Bosnia and
                    Herzegovina revolted. In the meantime the government of ‘Abd-ul-'Azíz (1861-
                    1876) had become worse and worse. The state was bankrupt. Ignatieff, the Russian
                    ambassador, gained complete ascendency in the palace, and frustrated every
                    attempt on <pb break="no"

                    the torrent of misrule. His creature, Mahmúd Pasha, maintained his place in
                    spite of universal contempt, until a conspiracy was formed at Constantinople,
                    which cost the sultan his throne (30th May 1876) and a few days later his life.
                    His imbecile successor, Murád V., gave place after a reign of three months to
                    ‘Abd-ul-Hamíd II. The Bosnian insurrection had already extended to Bulgaria, and
                    the slaughter of the Turkish inhabitants in certain villages had been avenged by
                    massacres of the most fearful character. Servia and Montenegro took up arms. The
                    resources of European diplomacy were exhausted in fruitless attempts to gain
                    from the Porte some real securities for better government, and in April 1877
                    Russia declared war. The neutrality of Austria had been secured by a secret
                    agreement permitting that country to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina, if Russia
                    should extend its influence beyond the Balkans. The Bulgarian massacres had
                    excited such horror and indignation in England that Lord Beaconsfield was forced
                    to remain neutral. The ministry contented itself with stating that England would
                    not permit Egypt to be the scene of hostilities, nor acquiesce in any prolonged
                    occupation of Constantinople by Russian troops. Turkey was thus left without an
                    ally. The Russians entered Bulgaria in June; and, while Rustchuk was besieged,
                    their advanced guard under Gourko hurried across the Balkans. Meanwhile Osman
                    Pasha, coming from Widdin, occupied and fortified Plevna on the Russian line of
                    march. Against his redoubts the Russians, ill commanded, threw themselves in
                    vain, and Gourko was compelled to fall back on the Shipka Pass. But in December
                    the capture of Plevna, in which Roumanian troops cooperated, set free the
                    invading army, and the march on Constantinople was resumed. The Balkans were
                    passed in mid-winter; Adrianople was occupied; and the Turkish armies were
                    captured or annihilated. The Russians now pressed forward to the very suburbs of
                    Constantinople, and on 3d March 1878 peace was concluded at San Stefano. In Asia
                    the Russians had captured Kars and were besieging Erzeroum. The treaty of San
                    Stefano ceded to Russia the portion of Bessarabia taken from it in 1856,
                    together with the Dobrudja, and also Kars, Batoum, and the adjoining territory
                    in Asia. It recognized the independence of Servia, Montenegro, and Roumania, and
                    largely extended the territory of the first two. Bulgaria was constituted an
                    autonomous state, though tributary to the Porte, and was defined so as to extend
                    to the Aegean Sea and to include the greater part of the country between the
                    Balkans and the coast. Crete, Thessaly, and Epirus were to receive the necessary
                    reforms at the hands of a European commission. To this treaty Great Britain
                    refused to give its assent, and vigorous preparations were made for war. The
                    fleet was at the Dardanelles, and Indian troops were brought to Malta. Russia
                    could no longer count on the neutrality of Austria. Under these circumstances
                    the court of St Petersburg consented to submit the treaty to a European
                    congress, which, after a secret agreement had been made between Russia and
                    England on the principal points of difference, assembled at Berlin. The treaty
                    of San Stefano received various modifications, the principal being a reduction
                    of the territory included in Bulgaria and the division of that state into two
                    parts. Bulgaria north of the Balkans was constituted an autonomous principality;
                    Bulgaria south of the Balkans was made into a province, with the title of
                    Eastern Roumelia, subject to the authority of the sultan, but with a Christian
                    governor and an autonomous administration. Austria received Bosnia and
                    Herzegovina. The territory ceded to Servia and Montenegro by the treaty of San
                    Stefano, as well as that ceded to Russia in Asia, was somewhat diminished.</p>
                <p>The Porte was advised to make some cession of territory to Greece, and the line
                    of frontier subsequently recommended gave to Greece Janina as well as Thessaly.
                    The usual promises of organic reform were made by Turkey. By a separate
                    convention England undertook the defence of Asiatic Turkey and received Cyprus.
                    The organization of Eastern Roumelia was duly taken in hand by a European
                    commission and brought to a favourable conclusion; but it was not until a naval
                    demonstration had been made by England that the final cession of Dulcigno to the
                    Montenegrins was effected, and that Thessaly, without Epirus, was given up to
                    Greece. Alexander of Battenberg became prince of Bulgaria. By a popular movement
                    in 1885 Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia were united into a single state. This
                    revolution occasioned the utmost displeasure at St Petersburg; and under Russian
                    influence Prince Alexander was kidnapped and forced to abdicate. The Porte
                    offered no armed resistance to the union. (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.

                <p>Turkey, or the Ottoman empire (<hi rend="italic">Osmanli Vilaieti),</hi> embraces
                    extensive territories in south-eastern Europe, western Asia, and northern
                    Africa, grouped mainly round the eastern waters of the Mediterranean, and along
                    both sides of the Red Sea, the west coast of the Persian Gulf, and the southern
                    and western shores of the Black Sea. These territories form an aggregate of
                    provinces and states, some under the direct control of the sultan, some enjoying
                    a large share of political autonomy, some practically independent, either
                    administered by foreign powers or ruled by hereditary vassals or tributary
                    princes. The present (1887) extent of the Ottoman empire is about 1,692,150
                    square miles, and its population 42,346,000.</p>

                <p>Since the Russo-Turkish War of 1878 (see above), the extremely irregular
                    frontiers of European Turkey are conterminous with Greece in the south, and in
                    the north with Montenegro, Austria, Servia, and Roumania, being separated from
                    the last country partly by the Danube, partly by a conventional line drawn from
                    Silistria on that river to Mangalia on the Black Sea. By the Berlin congress
                    Roumania and Servia, hitherto vassal states, were made absolutely independent
                    kingdoms, Roumania at the same time receiving the district of Dobrudja between
                    the lower Danube and the Black Sea, and Servia those of Nish and Leskovatz about
                    the upper Morava river. Montenegro was also recognized as an independent
                    principality, with an increase of territory, which gave it a sea frontier
                    limited southwards by the river Boyana, and including the Albanian ports of
                    Dulcigno and Antivari on the Adriatic. The Greco-Turkish frontier was also
                    shifted north, Greece obtaining most of Thessaly and a strip of Epirus (south
                    Albania), so that since 1881 the border line runs from near Mount Olympus on the
                    Gulf of Saloniki (40° N. lat. ) west to the Pindus range, then southwest to the
                    Gulf of Arta on the Ionian Sea. A still more serious step was taken towards
                    disintegration by the withdrawal of Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia from the
                    immediate jurisdiction of the Sublime Porte. The former was constituted a
                    tributary principality, with representative institutions, and Eastern Roumelia
                    was erected into an autonomous province, both under the guarantee of the
                    European powers. But in 1885 the latter province declared for union with
                    Bulgaria, and since then these two territories have practically formed one state
                    administered from Sophia, Europe assenting and Turkey consenting (imperial
                    firman of 6th April 1886) on the retrocession to Turkey of the Moslem districts
                    of Kirjali and the Rhodope. In the year 1878 Austria occupied and assumed the
                    civil administration of the north-western provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina,
                    besides taking military possession of the contiguous strategical district of
                    Novi-Bazar. The direct possessions of the sultan have thus been reduced in
                    Europe to a strip of territory stretching continuously across the Balkan
                    Peninsula from the Bosphorus to the Adriatic (29° 10' to 19° 20' E. long.), and
                    lying in the east mainly between 40° and 42° and in the west between 39° and 43°
                    N. lat. It corresponds roughly to ancient Thrace, Macedonia with Chalcidice,
                    Epirus, and a large part of Illyria, constituting the present administrative
                    divisions of Stambul (Constantinople, including a small strip of the opposite
                    Asiatic coast), Edirneh (Adrianople), Saloniki with Kosovo (Macedonia), Janina
                    (parts of Epirus and Thessaly), Shkodra (Scutari or upper Albania). To these
                    must be added the Turkish islands in the Aegean usually reckoned to Europe, that
                    is, Thasos, Samothrace, Imbros, and, in the extreme south, Crete or Candia, with
                    estimated (1887) areas and populations as under :—</p>

                    these regions, the reader is referred to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Albania, Bosnia, Bulgaria, Constantinople, Epirus, Herzegovina, Macedonia,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thrace.</hi> Here it will suffice to remark in a
                    general way that the territory still directly administered from</p>
                <p>Stambul comprises one of the most favoured regions of the temperate zone. The
                    extensive igneous and metamorphic system of the Great Balkans and Rhodope
                    (Despoto-Dagh), culminating in the Rilo Dagh (9000 feet), interspersed in the
                    Pindus range farther west by Permian formations of unknown age, and succeeded in
                    the extreme east (both sides of the Bosphorus) by Lower Devonian sandstones and
                    some more recent volcanic rocks, is pierced by the four rich alluvial valleys of
                    the Maritza, Kara-su or “Blackwater,” Struma (Strymon), and Vardar. These
                    rivers, flowing in nearly parallel south-easterly courses to the Aegean, collect
                    most of the drainage of Roumelia, as Thrace and Macedonia are commonly called by
                    the Turks. The whole region thus enjoys a somewhat southerly aspect, sheltered
                    from the north by the lofty crests of the Rilo Dagh and northern Pindus, and in
                    every way admirably suited for the cultivation of most cereals, as well as of
                    cotton, tobacco, madder, the mulberry, the vine, and fruits. Here maize yields
                    such a bountiful harvest that, although originally introduced from America, it
                    has long been regarded as indigenous, and for the Italians is simply the Turkish
                    com (“gran turco”) in a pre-eminent sense. The inhabitants also, Greeks
                    intermingled with Turks in the east, with Bulgarians in the west, are
                    intelligent and industrious, noted for their skill in the manufacture of carpets
                    and other woven goods, of saddlery, arms, and jewellery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Asiatic Turkey.</hi></p>
                <p>The mainstay of the Ottoman dynasty is the Asiatic portion of the empire, where
                    the Mohammedan religion is absolutely predominant, and where the naturally
                    vigorous and robust Turki race forms in Asia Minor a compact mass of many
                    millions, far outnumbering any other single ethnical element and probably
                    equalling all taken collectively. Here also, with the unimportant exception of
                    the islands of Samos and Cyprus and the somewhat privileged district of Lebanon,
                    all the Turkish possessions constitute vilayets directly controlled by the
                    Porte. They comprise the geographically distinct regions of the Anatolian
                    plateau (Asia Minor), the Armenian and Kurdish highlands, the Mesopotamian
                    lowlands, the hilly and partly mountainous territory of Syria and Palestine, and
                    the coastlands of west and north-east Arabia. The changes caused by the
                    Russo-Turkish War of 1878 were the cession to Persia of the little district of
                    Kotur on the eastern frontier and to Russia of the districts of Kars and Batoum
                    on the north-east frontier, while to England were conceded the military
                    occupation and administration of Cyprus. Asiatic Turkey is conterminous on the
                    east with Russia and Persia; in the south-west it encloses on the west, north,
                    and north-east the independent part of Arabia. Towards Egypt the frontier is a
                    conventional line drawn from Akabah at the head of the Gulf of Akabah
                    north-westwards to the little port of El Arish on the Mediterranean. Elsewhere
                    Asiatic Turkey enjoys the advantage of a sea frontage, being washed in the
                    north-west and west by the Euxine, Aegean, and Mediterranean, in the south-west
                    by the Red Sea, and in the south-east by the Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>The above enumerated five natural divisions of Asiatic Turkey are divided for
                    administrative purposes into about twenty vilayets, which, however, have been
                    and still are subject to considerable fluctuations. The subjoined grouping, with
                    areas and populations, is based mainly on data lately communicated
                    confidentially to the British Government by Mr Redhouse. His estimates of
                    population have been strikingly confirmed by the official returns that have for
                    the first time just been made for certain provinces in Asia Minor and the
                    Armenian highlands. Thus the census of the Trebizond vilayet, completed in 1886,
                    gave a total of 1,010,000, which differs only by 7000 from Mr Redhouse’s
                    estimate for 1878 (1,017,000). So also the just completed (1887) census for the
                    Erzeroum vilayet gives 583,000, or 998,000 including the territory ceded to
                    Russia in 1878, which is 45,000 higher than Mr Redhouse’s estimate.</p>

                    Asia Minor or Anatolia is by far the most important for extent, population, and
                    natural resources. It constitutes an elevated and fertile plateau enclosed by
                    irregular mountain ranges, which in the Taurus and on the south and east rise to
                    from 7000 to 10,000 feet, culminating in the volcanic Erjish-Dagh, or Argaeus,
                    nearly 12,000 feet high. The plateau, which has a mean altitude of some 3000
                    feet, is depressed in the centre, where the Tuz-gol (Tatta Palus) and several
                    other lacustrine basins have at present no outflow, but which appear to have
                    formerly drained through the Sakaria (Sangarius) northwards to the Euxine. In
                    the same direction, and in curiously parallel curves, flow the more easterly
                    Kizil-Irmak (Halys) and Yeshil-Irmak (Iris), which carry off most of the surface
                    waters of the plateau. The western rivers—Granicus, Xanthus (Scamander), Hermus,
                    Simois, Meander—although renowned in song and history, are comparatively
                    insignificant coaststreams, rushing from the escarpment of the plateau down to
                    their fjord-like estuaries in the Aegean. None of the rivers are navigable to
                    any distance from their mouths, and in the absence of good means of
                    communication the very rich resources of the plateau in minerals and
                    agricultural produce have hitherto been little developed. Owing to the different
                    elevations and varied aspects of the land towards the Euxine, Aegean, and
                    Mediterranean, the climate is extremely diversified, presenting all the
                    transitions from intense summer heat along most of the seaboard to severe
                    winters on the lofty tablelands of the interior, which are exposed to biting
                    winds from the Russian steppes. Anatolia has an endless variety of natural
                    products, from the hardy boxwood of Lazistan (Trebizond vilayet) to the
                    sub-tropical figs and grapes of the western coastlands. On the plateau thrives
                    the famous breed of Angora goats, whose soft, silky fleece (mohair) forms a
                    staple export.</p>
                <p>Of far less economic importance are the Armenian uplands, forming a rugged
                    plateau of limited extent, above which rise many lofty peaks, culminating in the
                    tower-crested Ararat (16,916 feet), the converging point of three empires. The
                    long and terribly severe winters, intolerably hot short summers, and generally
                    poor soil of Armenia present a marked contrast to the far more temperate
                    climate, rich upland valleys, and densely wooded slopes of the more southern
                    Kurdistan highlands. But these advantages are counterbalanced by the generally
                    inaccessible nature of the country, the want of good highways, and especially
                    the lawless character of its inhabitants, who have undergone little social
                    change since the days of their wild Karduchi forefathers. In the heart of this
                    savage region lies the magnificent basin of Lake Van, which, like Tuz-gol and
                    the more easterly Urmiya, has no present outflow, but formerly, no doubt,
                    discharged to the Tigris valley.</p>
                <p>In the Van district lie the sources of most of the head streams of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tigris</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">),</hi> which have created the vast and fertile alluvial plains
                    of Mesopotamia. This latter region, the seat of the ancient Accadian and
                    Assyrian and the more recent Moslem cultures, forms a continuous plain from the
                    escarpments of the Kurdistan highlands to the Persian Gulf, broken only in the
                    north by the Sinjar Hills, and capable of yielding magnificent crops wherever
                    water is available. But under Osmanli rule the splendid system of irrigation
                    works, dating from the dawn of history, has fallen into decay: the lower
                    Euphrates now overflows its banks and converts much of the region above and
                    below Kurnah, at the confluence of the two great arteries, into malarious
                    marshlands. Hence the populous cities and innumerable villages formerly dotted
                    over the Babylonian plains have been succeeded by the scattered hamlets of the
                    Montefik and other amphibious Arab tribes.</p>
                <p>This lowland region is separated by the more elevated Syrian desert or steppe
                    from the much smaller and less productive provinces of Syria and Palestine. Here
                    the main physical features are at once simple and yet striking. The narrow,
                    hilly region disposed north and south between the Mediterranean and the desert,
                    and stretching for over 400 miles between Anatolia and the Sinai Peninsula,
                    culminates towards the centre in the parallel Libanus and Antilibanus (10,000 to
                    11,000 feet), enclosing between them the fertile depression of the Beká'
                    (Coele-Syria). The stupendous ruins of Baalbek, standing at the highest point of
                    this depression in 30° N. lat., mark the parting line between the northern and
                    southern watersheds of the region. Northwards flows the El-'Asi (Orontes),
                    southwards the Lítáni (Leontes), both through the Beká' in moderately sloping
                    beds to the Mediterranean. For further particulars, see the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine.</hi> In the Lebanon the Christian
                    Maronite communities enjoy a measure of self-government under the guarantee of
                    France, while their pagan neighbours and hereditary foes, the Druses, are
                    gradually withdrawing to the hilly Hauran district beyond Jordan.</p>
                <p>Turkey’s Arabian possessions comprise, besides El-Hasa on the Persian Gulf, the
                    low-lying, hot, and insalubrious Tehama and the south-western highlands
                    (vilayets of Hejaz and Yemen) stretching continuously along the east side of the
                    Red Sea, and including the two holy cities of Mecca and Medina. These are held
                    by military occupation, probably at a loss to the imperial exchequer, and
                    certainly against the wishes of the inhabitants. But these drawbacks are
                    supposed to be more than compensated by the political prestige derived from the
                    possession of the Holy Land of Islam.</p>

                <p>Since the abandonment of eastern or Egyptian Soudan in 1884, consequent on the
                    revolt of the Mahdi, and the occupation of Tunis by the French in 1881, Turkey
                    in Africa has been reduced to the two territories of Egypt and Tripolitana with
                    Barca and Fezzan, jointly occupying the north-east comer of the continent. Of
                    these Tripolitana alone is directly administered, constituting the pashalik or
                    vilayet of Tripoli. Egypt, whose southern frontier was temporarily fixed in
                    January 1887 at the station of Akashe above Wady Haifa, near the second cataract
                    in Lower Nubia (22° N. lat.), has formed a practically independent principality
                    under the dynasty of Mehemet Ali since 1841, subject only to an annual tribute
                    of £695,000 to the Porte. The areas and populations of Turkey in Africa were
                    estimated as follows in 1887:—</p>

                <p>Turkey is essentially a theocratic absolute monarchy, being subject in principle
                    to the direct personal control of the sultan, who is himself at once a temporal
                    autocrat and the recognized caliph, that is, “successor” of the Prophet, and
                    consequently the spiritual head of the. Moslem world (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mohammedanism).</hi> But, although the attempt made in 1876 to introduce
                    representative institutions proved abortive, this theoretical absolutism is
                    nevertheless tempered not only by traditional usage, local privilege, the
                    juridical and spiritual precepts of the Koran and its <hi rend="italic"
                    >'ulemá</hi> interpreters, and the privy council, but also by the growing force
                    of public opinion and the direct or indirect pressure of the European powers.
                    The 'ulemá<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sunnites,</hi> vol. xxii. p. 660.</p></note> form a powerful
                    corporation, whose head, the <hi rend="italic">sheikhu 'l∙ Islám,</hi> ranks as
                    a state functionary scarcely second to the grand vizier, or prime minister.
                    Owing to their intensely conservative and fanatical spirit, the 'ulemá have
                    always been determined opponents of progress, and are at present one of the
                    greatest obstacles to reform in a political system where the spiritual and
                    temporal functions are inextricably interwoven. Besides these expounders of
                    Koranic doctrine, the sovereign is to some extent bound also by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Multeka,</hi> a legal code based on the traditional sayings of
                    Mohammed and the recorded decisions of his successors, having the force of
                    precedents.</p>
                <p>The grand vizier (<hi rend="italic">sadr-azam</hi>), who is nominated by the
                    sultan, presides ex-officio over the privy council <hi rend="italic"
                    >(mejliss-i-khass),</hi> which, besides the sheikhu 'l-Islám, comprises the
                    ministers of home and foreign affairs, war, finance, marine, trade, public
                    works, justice, public instruction, and worship, with the president of the
                    council of state and the grand master of artillery. For administrative purposes
                    the immediate possessions of the sultan are divided into vilayets (provinces),
                    which are again subdivided into sanjaks or mutessariks (arrondissements), these
                    into kazas (cantons), and the kazas into nahiés (parishes or communes). A vali
                    or governorgeneral, nominated by the sultan, stands at the head of the vilayet,
                    and on him are directly dependent the pashas, effendis, beys, and other
                    administrators of the minor divisions. All these officials unite in their own
                    persons the judicial and executive functions, and all alike are as a rule
                    thoroughly corrupt, venal in the dispensation of justice, oppressors of the
                    subject, embezzlers of the public revenues, altogether absorbed in amassing
                    wealth during their mostly brief and precarious tenure of office.<note

                    travelled through the heart of Yemen in the winter of 1886-87, thus speaks of
                    the administration in that almost exclusively Moslem province: “The fiscal
                    system of the Turks, if it were really carried into effect, would be by no means
                    bad; but like every other department of the government it is ruined by the utter
                    corruption that prevails in every branch of the administration from top to
                    bottom. No more eloquent expounders of the evils and hopelessness of their whole
                    system are to be found than the Turks themselves, as I found from conversation
                    with two or three of their own officials” (<hi rend="italic">Proc. R. Geog.
                    Soc.,</hi> August 1887, p. 487). Mr G. P. Devey also, consul at Erzeroum,
                    reports that in a part of that province the sheep-tax for 1885 was collected
                    three times over: “On the first occasion the real number had been
                    underestimated, and the collector therefore came again, and, finding that such
                    was the case, made the villagers pay the whole sum of 14,000 piastres (9000 had
                    been levied on the previous occasion), instead of the difference, on the ground
                    that they had cheated the Government in not declaring their whole stock. A third
                    time a collector visited the caza, and, when the villagers could produce no
                    receipt that the tax had been paid (for none had been given), a third time the
                    full sum was taken” <hi rend="italic">(Cons. Rep.,</hi> July 1887, p.

                <p>Exclusive of coasting craft, the mercantile fleet of Turkey in 1885 consisted of
                    14 steamers of 11,000 tons and 400 sailing vessels of 65,000 tons.</p>
                <p>All branches of the foreign trade, together with most of the local traffic and
                    the banking business, are almost exclusively in the hands of Greeks, Armenians,
                    Jews, and foreigners. The Turks and other Mohammedans are engaged nearly
                    altogether in agricultural and pastoral pursuits. But the land, especially in
                    Anatolia, is gradually passing from its Moslem owners into the possession of
                    Christian mortgagees. Scarcely any accurate agricultural returns are available,
                    except for one or two districts. In the Erzeroum vilayet in 1886<note

                    42,000, mules 5000; beehives numbered 80,000. The chief agricultural produce for
                    the same year was—wheat 16,690,000 bushels, barley 13,297,000 bushels, beans

                <p>Previous to 1880 Turkey was commonly regarded as practically bankrupt. But since
                    then a considerable improvement has been effected. Trustworthy data are still
                    wanting; but a careful estimate gave the gross revenue and expenditure of 1884
                    at £T16,313,000 and £T16,223,000 respectively, the expenditure including over
                    £T4,000,000 available for state creditors. The public debt stood at £106,437,000
                    in 1882. The sultan is reported to draw a sum of from £1,000,000 to £2,000,000
                    annually from the public revenues for the support of the seraglio or imperial
                    household of over five thousand persons.</p>
                <p>Until 1886 the military service, compulsory on all Moslems over 18 years of age,
                    was kept up by 45,000 annual recruits drawn by ballot; but in November of that
                    year universal conscription of the whole able-bodied male population was
                    decreed. By this measure the army, hitherto reckoned at about 160,000 men, with
                    a warstrength of from 450,000 to 500,000, will be probably raised to a permanent
                    footing of 1,000,000 effectives under the flag and in the reserves. These will
                    continue to be grouped in the three categories of the nizam or regulars in
                    active service, the redif or first reserve, and the mustahfiz or second reserve.
                    There is to be a considerable increase of cavalry, all conscripts being allowed
                    to join that branch of the service who have the means of providing themselves
                    with mounts and equipment. For military purposes the empire is divided into
                    seven divisions, with headquarters at Constantinople, Adrianople, Monastir,
                    Erzingian, Baghdad, Damascus, and Sanaa, all except Sanaa (for Yemen) hitherto
                    furnishing an army corps for the nizam and two for the redif.</p>
                <p>The navy at the beginning of 1887 comprised 15 large and several smaller
                    ironclads (monitors, gunboats, &amp;c.), a number of mostly old-fashioned
                    steamers, and 14 torpedo boats, and was manned by 30,000 sailors and 10,000
                    marines (nominal strength), raised by conscription or voluntary enlistment and
                    serving for 12 years in the active and reserve classes.</p>
                <p>Public instruction is much more widely diffused throughout the empire than is
                    commonly supposed. This is due partly to the Christian communities, notably the
                    Maronites and others in Syria, the Anatolian and Roumelian Greeks, and the
                    Armenians of the eastern provinces and of Constantinople. Education is
                    practically limited amongst the Mohammedans to reading and writing and the study
                    of the Koran. But amongst the Christians, especially the Armenians, the Greeks
                    of Smyrna, and the Syrians of Beyrut, it embraces a considerable range of
                    subjects, such as classical Hellenic, Armenian, and Syriac, as well as modern
                    French, Italian, and English, modern history, geography, and medicine. Large
                    sums are freely contributed for the establishment and support of good schools,
                    and the cause of national education is seldom forgotten in the legacies of
                    patriotic Anatolian Greeks. Even the Turks are bestirring themselves in this
                    respect, and great progress has been made during the last twenty years in the
                    Erzeroum vilayet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Cons. Rep.,</hi> July 1887, p. 4.</p></note> In 1886 that province
                    contained 1216 schools and 163 madrasas (colleges), with a total attendance of
                    25,680, including 1504 girls. Elsewhere few official statistics are
                    available.</p>
                <p>Besides administrative and financial reforms, one of the most pressing needs is
                    improved means of communication. In Trebizond the route from the coast at Unieh
                    through Niksar to Sivas has recently been completed to the limits of the
                    vilayet. But the works on the more important road from Kirasun to Kara-hissar
                    for the silver and lead mines at Lijessy are still suspended, owing to disputes
                    between the contiguous provincial administrations. Many of the great historic
                    highways are also much out of repair. At the end of 1885 only 1250 miles of
                    railway were completed in the empire, of which 903 were in Europe and 347 in
                    Asia. The chief lines are those connecting the capital with Adrianople (210
                    miles), Adrianople with Saremby (152), Saloniki with Uskub (150), Zenica with
                    Brod (118), Uskub with Mitrovitza (75), and Kulleli with Dégéagatch (70) in
                    Europe, and, in Asia, Scutari with Ismid (40), Smyrna with Ala-Shehr (130), and
                    Smyrna with Denizli (170). By imperial decree (August 1887) a contract was
                    granted to an English syndicate for the extension of the Ismid line and the
                    construction of a system of Asiatic railways to extend to Baghdad within the
                    space of ten years.</p>
                <p>The telegraph system is much more developed, comprising (1885) 14,620 miles, with
                    26,100 miles of wire and 470 stations. The yearly average of letters and
                    packages of all sorts sent through the 710 post-offices scarcely exceeds
                    2,600,000. Most of the foreign postal service is conducted through the British,
                    Austrian, German, French, and Russian privileged post-offices.</p>

                <p>In all literary matters the Ottoman Turks have shown themselves a singularly
                    uninventive people, the two great schools, the old and the new, into which we
                    may divide their literature, being closely <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n681/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0681-0656"/> modelled, the one after the classics of Persia,
                    the other after those of modern Europe, and more especially of France. The old
                    or Persian school flourished from the foundation of the empire down to about
                    1830, and still continues to drag on a feeble existence, though it is now out of
                    fashion and cultivated by none of the leading men of letters. These belong to
                    the new or European school, which sprang up some fifty or sixty years ago, and
                    which, in spite of the bitter opposition of the partisans of the old Oriental
                    system, has succeeded, partly through its own inherent superiority and partly
                    through the talents and courage of its supporters, in expelling its rival from
                    the position of undisputed authority which it had occupied for upwards of five
                    hundred years. For the present purpose it will be convenient to divide the old
                    school into three periods, which may be termed respectively the pre-classical,
                    the classical, and the post-classical. Of these the first extends from the early
                    days of the empire to the accession of Suleymán I., 1301- 1520 (700-926); the
                    second from that event to the accession of Mahmúd I., 1520-1730 (926-1143); and
                    the third from that date to the accession of 'Abd-ul-'Azíz, 1730-1861
                    (1143-1277).</p>
                <p>The works of the old school in all its periods are entirely Persian in tone,
                    sentiment, and form. We find in them the same beauties and the same defects that
                    we observe in the productions of the Iranian authors. The formal elegance and
                    conventional grace, alike of thought and of expression, so characteristic of
                    Persian classical literature, pervade the works of the best Ottoman writers, and
                    they are likewise imbued, though in a less degree, with that spirit of mysticism
                    which runs through so much of the poetry of Iran. But the Ottomans did not stop
                    here: in their romantic poems they chose as subjects the favourite themes of
                    their Persian masters, such as Leyli and Mejnún, Khusrev and Shírín, Yúsuf and
                    Zuleykhá, and so on; they constantly allude to Persian heroes whose stories
                    occur in the <hi rend="italic">Sháh-Náma</hi> and other storehouses of Iranian
                    legendary lore; and they wrote their poems in Persian metres and in Persian
                    forms. The mesneví, the kasida, and the ghazel,—all of them, so far at least as
                    the Ottomans are concerned, Persian,—were the favourite verse-forms of the old
                    poets. A mesneví is a poem written in rhyming couplets, and is usually narrative
                    in subject. The kasída and the ghazel are both monorhythmic; the first as a rule
                    celebrates the praises of some great man, while the second discourses of the
                    joys and woes of love. Why Persian rather than Arabian or any other literature
                    became the model of Ottoman writers is explained by the early history of the
                    race (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turks).</hi> Some two centuries before the
                    arrival of the Turks in Asia Minor the Seljúks, then a mere horde of savages,
                    had overrun Persia, where they settled and adopted the civilization of the
                    people they had subdued. Thus Persian became the language of their court and
                    Government, and when by and by they pushed their conquests into Asia Minor, and
                    founded there the Seljúk empire of Rúm, they carried with them their Persian
                    culture, and diffused it among the peoples newly brought under their sway. It
                    was the descendants of those Persianized Seljuks whom the early Ottomans found
                    ruling in Asia Minor on their arrival there. What had happened to the Seljúks
                    two centuries before happened to the Ottomans now: the less civilized race
                    adopted the culture of the more civilized; and, as the Seljúk empire fell to
                    pieces and the Ottoman came gradually to occupy its place, the sons of men who
                    had called themselves Seljuks began thenceforth to look upon themselves as
                    Ottomans. Hence the vast majority of the people whom we are accustomed to think
                    of as Ottomans are so only by adoption, being really the descendants of Seljúks
                    or Seljúkian subjects, who had derived from Persia whatever they possessed of
                    civilization or of literary taste. An extraordinary love of precedent, the
                    result apparently of conscious want of original power, was sufficient to keep
                    their writers loyal to their early guide for centuries, till at length the
                    allegiance, though not the fashion of it, has been changed in our own days, and
                    Paris has replaced Shiraz as the shrine towards which the Ottoman scholar turns.
                    While conspicuously lacking in creative genius, the Ottomans have always shown
                    themselves possessed of receptive and assimilative powers to a remarkable
                    degree, the result being that the number of their writers both in prose and
                    verse is enormous. Of course only a few of the most prominent, either through
                    the intrinsic merit of their work or through the influence they have had in
                    guiding or shaping that of their contemporaries, can be mentioned in a brief
                    review like the present. It ought to be premised that the poetry of the old
                    school is greatly superior to the prose.</p>
                <p>Ottoman literature may be said to open with a few mystic lines, the work of
                    Sultan Veled, son of Mauláná Jelál-ud-Dín, the author of the great Persian poem
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mathnawí.</hi> Sultán Veled flourished during the reign of
                    'Osmán I., though he did not reside in the territory under the rule of that
                    prince. Another mystic poet of this early time was 'Áshik Pasha, who left a long
                    poem in rhyming couplets, which is called, inappropriately enough, his <hi

                    chieftain named Ghází Fázil. Sheykhí of Kermiyan, a contemporary of Muhammed I.
                    and Murad II., wrote a lengthy and still esteemed mesneví on the ancient Persian
                    romance of Khusrev and Shirin; and about the same time Yaziji-oghlu gave to the
                    world a long versified history of the Prophet, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Muhammedíya.</hi> The writers mentioned above are the most important previous
                    to the capture of Constantinople; but there is little literature of real merit
                    prior to that event. The most notable prose work of this period is an old
                    collection of stories, the <hi rend="italic">History of the Forty Vezirs,</hi>
                    said to have been compiled by a certain Sheykh-záda and dedicated to Murád II. A
                    few years after Constantinople passed into the hands of the Ottomans, some
                    ghazels, the work of the contemporary Tatar prince, Mír 'Alí Shír, who under the
                    <hi rend="italic">nom de plume</hi> of Neváyí wrote much that shows true talent
                    and poetic feeling, found their way to the Ottoman capital, where they were seen
                    and copied by Ahmed Pasha, one of the viziers of Muhammed II. The poems of this
                    statesman, though possessing little merit of their own, being for the most part
                    mere translations from Neváyí, form one of the landmarks in the history of
                    Ottoman literature. They set the fashion of ghazel-writing; and their appearance
                    was the signal for a more regular cultivation of poetry and a greater attention
                    to literary style and to refinement of language. In Sinán Pasha, another
                    minister of Muhammed the Conqueror, Ottoman prose found its first exponent of
                    ability; he left a religious treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Tazarru'át</hi>
                    (Supplications), which, notwithstanding a too lavish employment of the resources
                    of Persian rhetoric, is as remarkable for its clear and lucid style as for the
                    beauty of many of the thoughts it contains. The most noteworthy writers of the
                    Conqueror’s reign are, after Ahmed and Sinán, the two lyric poets Nejátí and
                    Zátí, whose verses show a considerable improvement upon those of Ahmed Pasha,
                    the romantic poets Jemálí and Hamdi, and the poetesses Zeyneb and Mihrí. Like
                    most of his house, Muhammed II. was fond of poetry and patronized men of
                    letters. He himself tried versification, and some of his lines which have come
                    down to us appear quite equal to the average work of his contemporaries.
                    Twenty-one out of the thirty-four sovereigns who have occupied the throne of
                    'Osmán have left verses, and among these Selim I. stands out, not merely as the
                    greatest ruler, warrior, and statesman, but also as the most gifted and most
                    original poet. His work is unhappily for the greater part in the Persian
                    language; the excellence of what he has done in Turkish makes us regret that he
                    did so little. The most prominent man of letters under Selím I. was the legist
                    Kemál Pasha-záda, frequently called Ibn-Kemál, who distinguished himself in both
                    prose and verse. He left a romantic poem on the loves of Yusuf and Zuleykhá, and
                    a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Nigáristán,</hi> which is modelled both in
                    style and matter on the <hi rend="italic">Gulistán</hi> of Sa'dí. His
                    contemporary, Mesíhí, whose beautiful verses on spring are perhaps better known
                    in Europe than any other Turkish poem, deserves a passing mention.</p>
                <p>With the accession of Selím’s son, Suleymán I., the classical period begins.
                    Hitherto all Ottoman writing, even the most highly finished, had been somewhat
                    rude and uncouth; but now a marked improvement becomes visible alike in the
                    manner and the matter, and authors of greater ability begin to make their
                    appearance. Fuzúlí, one of the four great poets of the old school, seems to have
                    been a native of Baghdad or its neighbourhood, and probably became an Ottoman
                    subject when Suleyman took possession of the old capital of the caliphs. His
                    language, which is very peculiar, seems to be a sort of mixture of the Ottoman
                    and Azerbijan dialects of Turkish, and was most probably that of the Persian
                    Turks of those days. Fuzúlí showed far more originality than any of his
                    predecessors; for, although his work is naturally Persian in form and in general
                    character, it is far from being a mere echo from Shiraz or Ispahan. He struck
                    out a new line for himself, and was indebted for his inspiration to no previous
                    writer, whether Turk or Persian. An intense and passionate ardour breathes in
                    his verses, and forms one of the most remarkable as well as one of the most
                    attractive characteristics of his style; for, while few even among Turkish poets
                    are more artificial than he, few seem to write with greater earnestness and
                    sincerity. His influence upon his successors has scarcely been as far-reaching
                    as might have been expected,—a circumstance which is perhaps in some measure
                    owing to the unfamiliar dialect in which he wrote. Besides his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Díván</hi>, he left a beautiful mesneví on the story of Leyli and Mejnún, as
                    well as some prose works little inferior to his poetry. Bákí of Constantinople,
                    though far from rivalling his contemporary Fuzúlí, wrote much good poetry,
                    including one piece of great excellence, an elegy on Suleyman I. The Ottomans
                    have as a rule been particularly successful with elegies; this one by Bákí has
                    never been surpassed. Ruhi, Lámi'í, Nev’í, the janissary Yahya Beg, the mufti
                    Ebú-Su'úd, and Selim II. all won deserved distinction as poets. During the reign
                    of Ahmed I. arose the second of the great poets of the old Ottoman school, Nef'í
                    of Erzerúm, who owes his preeminence to the brilliance of his kasídas. But Neff
                    could revile as well as praise, and such was the bitterness of some of his
                    satires that certain influential personages who came under his lash induced
                    Murád IV. to permit his execution. Nef'í, who, like Fuzúlí, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0682-0657"/> formed a style of his own, had many to imitate
                    him, of whom Sabrí Shakir, a contemporary, was the most successful. Ná’ilí,
                    Jevrí, and Fehím need not detain us; but Nábí, who flourished under Ibrahim and
                    Muhammed IV., calls for a little more attention. This prolific author copied,
                    and so imported into Ottoman literature, a didactic style of ghazel-writing
                    which was then being introduced in Persia by the poet Sá’ib; but so closely did
                    the pupil follow in the footsteps of his master that it is not always easy to
                    know that his lines are intended to be Turkish. A number of poets, of whom
                    Seyyid Vehbi, Rághib Pasha, Rahmí of the Crimea, Kelim, and Sami are the most
                    notable, took Nábí for their model. Of these, Sami is remarkable for the art
                    with which he constructed his ghazels. Among the writers of this time who did
                    not copy Nábí are Sábit, Rasikh, and Talib, each of whom endeavoured, with no
                    great success, to open up a new path for himself. We now reach the reign of
                    Ahmed III., during which flourished Nedím, the greatest of all the poets of the
                    old school. Little appears to be known about his life further than that he
                    resided at Constantinople and was alive in the year 1727 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(a.h.</hi> 1140). Nedim stands quite alone: he copied no one, and no one has
                    attempted to copy him. There is in his poetry a joyousness and sprightliness
                    which at once distinguish it from the work of any other Turkish author. His
                    ghazels, which are written with great elegance and finish, contain many graceful
                    and original ideas, and the words he makes use of are always chosen with a view
                    to harmony and cadence. His kasídas are almost equal to his ghazels; for, while
                    they rival those of Nef'í in brilliancy, they surpass them in beauty of diction,
                    and are not so artificial and dependent on fantastic and far-fetched conceits.
                    The classical period cames to an end with Nedim; its brightest time is that
                    which falls between the rise of Nef'í and the death of Nedim, or, more roughly,
                    that extending from the accession of Ahmed I., 1603 (1012), to the deposition of
                    Ahmed III., 1730 (1143).</p>
                <p>We will now glance at the prose writers of this period. Under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Humáyún Náma</hi> (Imperial Book) 'Alí Chelebi made a highly
                    esteemed translation of the well-known Persian classic <hi rend="italic">Anvár-i
                    Suheylí,</hi> dedicating it to Suleyman I. Sa'd-ud-Dín, the preceptor of Murad
                    III., wrote a valuable history of the empire from the earliest times to the
                    death of Selim I. This work, the <hi rend="italic">Táj-ut-Teváríkh</hi> (Crown
                    of Chronicles), is reckoned, on account of its ornate yet clear style, one of
                    the masterpieces of the old school, and forms the first of an unbroken series of
                    annals which are written, especially the later among them, with great minuteness
                    and detail. Of Sa'd-ud-Dín’s successors in the office of imperial
                    historiographer the most remarkable for literary power is Na'ímá. His work,
                    which extends from 1591 (1000) to 1659 (1070), contrasts strongly with that of
                    the earlier historian, being written with great directness and lucidity,
                    combined with much vigour and picturesqueness. Evliya, who died during the reign
                    of Muhammed IV., is noted for the record which he has left of his travels in
                    different countries. About this time Tash-köpri-záda began and 'Atá-ulláh
                    continued a celebrated biography of the legists and sheykhs who had flourished
                    under the Ottoman monarchs. Haji Khalifa (see vol. xi. p. 377), frequently
                    termed Kátib Chelebi, was one of the most famous men of letters whom Turkey has
                    produced. He died in 1658 (1068), having written a great number of learned works
                    on history, biography, chronology, geography, and other subjects. The
                    Persian-izing tendency of this school reached its highest point in the
                    productions of Veysí, who left a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of the Prophet, and
                    of Nergisí, a miscellaneous writer of prose and verse. Such is the intentional
                    obscurity in many of the compositions of these two authors that every sentence
                    becomes a puzzle, over which even a scholarly Ottoman must pause before he can
                    be sure he has found its true meaning. The first printing press in Turkey was
                    established by an Hungarian who had assumed the name of Ibrahim, and in 1728
                    (1141) appeared the first book printed in that country; it was Van-kuli’s
                    Turkish translation of Jevherí’s Arabic dictionary.</p>
                <p>Coming now to the post-classical period, we find among poets worthy of mention
                    Belígh, Nevres, Hishmet, and Sunbuli-záda Vehbi, each of whom wrote in a style
                    peculiar to himself. Three poets of note—Pertev, Neshet, and Sheykh
                    Ghálib—flourished under Selim III. The last-named is the fourth great poet of
                    the old school. <hi rend="italic">Husn u 'Ashk</hi> (Beauty and Love), as his
                    great poem is called, is an allegorical romance full of tenderness and
                    imaginative power. Ghalib’s style is as original as that of Fuzúlí, Nef'í, or
                    Nedim. The most distinguished of the prose writers of this period are perhaps
                    Rashid, the imperial historiographer, 'Ásim, who translated into Turkish two
                    great lexicons, the Arabic <hi rend="italic">Kámús</hi> and the Persian <hi
                    rend="italic">Burhàn-i Káti',</hi> and Kání, the only humorous writer of merit
                    belonging to the old school.</p>
                <p>When we reach the reign of Mahmúd II., the great transition period of Ottoman
                    history, during which the civilization of the West began to struggle in earnest
                    with that of the East, we find the change which was coming over all things
                    Turkish affecting literature along with the rest, and preparing the way for the
                    appearance of the new school. The chief poets of the transition are Fázil Bey,
                    Wasif, notable for his not altogether unhappy attempt to write verses in the
                    spoken language of the capital, 'Izzet Molla, Pertev Pasha, 'Ákif Pasha, and the
                    poetesses Fitnet and Leyla. In the works of all of these, although we
                    occasionally discern a hint of the new style, the old Persian manner is still
                    supreme.</p>
                <p>More intimate relations with western Europe and a pretty general study of the
                    French language and literature, together with the steady progress of the
                    reforming tendency fairly started under Mahmúd II., have resulted in the birth
                    of the new or modern school, whose objects are truth and simplicity. In the
                    political writings of Reshid and 'Ákif Pashas we have the first clear note of
                    change; but the man to whom more than to any other the new departure owes its
                    success is Shinásí Efendi, who employed it for poetry as well as for prose. The
                    European style, on its introduction, encountered the most violent opposition,
                    but now it alone is used by living authors of repute. If any of these does write
                    a pamphlet in the old manner, it is merely as a <hi rend="italic">tour de
                    force,</hi> or to prove to some faithful but clamorous partisan of the Persian
                    style that it is not, as he supposes, lack of ability which causes the modern
                    author to adopt the simpler and more natural fashion of the West. The whole
                    tone, sentiment, and form of Ottoman literature have been revolutionized by the
                    new school: varieties of poetry hitherto unknown have been adopted from Europe;
                    an altogether new branch of literature, the drama, has arisen; while the
                    sciences are now treated and seriously studied after the system of the West.
                    Among writers of this school who have won distinction are Ziya Pasha, Jevdet
                    Pasha, the statesman and historian, Ekrem Bey, the author of a beautiful series
                    of miscellaneous poems, <hi rend="italic">Zemzema,</hi> Hámid Bey, who holds the
                    first place among Ottoman dramatists, and Kemal Bey, the leader of the modern
                    school and one of the most illustrious men of letters whom his country has
                    produced. He has written with conspicuous success in almost every branch of
                    literature,—history, romance, ethics, poetry, and the drama.</p>
                <p>For the Turkish language, see p. 661 below.</p>
                <p>There is no work in existence which gives a satisfactory account of Ottoman
                    literature, Vom Hammer - Purgstall's <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der
                    Osmanischen Dichtkunst</hi> (Pesth, 1836) is not always trustworthy and leaves
                    much to be desired in many ways. Other works on the poetry are <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Muse Ottomane,</hi> by Servan de Sugny (Paris, 1853); <hi rend="italic">On

                    1878); <hi rend="italic">Ottoman Poems,</hi> by Gibb (London, 1882). Of
                    translations we have Bákí’s <hi rend="italic">Divan,</hi> by Hammer (Vienna,
                    1825); the <hi rend="italic">Travels of Evliyá,</hi> by Hammer (London, 1834);
                    <hi rend="italic">Rose und Nachtigall</hi> (a poem of Fazli, a mediocre writer
                    of the time of Suleymán I.), Turkish and German, by Hammer (Pesth); <hi
