                    German descent, were of the mercantile class, and he himself was intended for
                    commerce, but a strong instinct led him to seek the career of a military
                    engineer. He entered the school of engineers at St Petersburg in 1835, and
                    passed from that into the army in 1838. In 1847 and the two following years he
                    was employed, as captain of engineers, in the campaigns against Schamyl in the
                    Caucasus, where he directed the siege operations against the principal mountain
                    fortresses. On the outbreak of war between Russia and the Porte in 1853, he was
                    placed at the head of the staff of General Schilder-Schuldner, by whom Silistria
                    was besieged. This general being wounded, Todleben acted in his place until the
                    siege was raised. He was then transferred to the Crimea. Sebastopol, while
                    strongly fortified toward the sea, was almost unprotected on the land side.
                    Todleben, though still only of colonel’s rank, became the animating genius of
                    the defence. By his advice the fleet was sunk, in order to blockade the mouth of
                    the harbour, and the deficiency of fortifications on the land side was made good
                    before the allies could take advantage of it. The construction of earthworks and
                    redoubts was carried on with extreme rapidity, and to these was transferred, in
                    great part, the artillery that had belonged to the fleet. In whatever direction
                    the besiegers drew their lines, there Todleben met them with counterworks,
                    until, with the arrival of heavy Russian reinforcements, the besiegers almost
                    became the besieged. It was in these improvised operations by means of
                    earthworks that Todleben’s peculiar power and originality showed itself; he was
                    not a great military leader in the wider sense, nor was he the creator of a
                    great permanent system of defence like Vauban. But for the special problems of
                    Russian warfare, both in 1854 and at a later epoch, he was exactly the man
                    wanted. Until June 1855 he conducted the operations of defence at Sebastopol in
                    person; he was then wounded in the foot, and at the operations which immediately
                    preceded the fall of the fortress he was not present. When he recovered from his
                    wounds he was employed in strengthening the fortifications at the mouth of the
                    Dnieper, and also those of Cronstadt. In 1856 he visited England, where his
                    merits were well understood. In 1860 he was appointed assistant to the
                    grand-duke Nicholas, and he became subsequently chief of the department of
                    engineers. For reasons which are not known he was given no command when war with
                    Turkey began in 1877. It was not until the disasters before Plevna had heaped
                    discredit upon the incompetent leaders of the Russian army that the soldier of
                    Sebastopol was called to the front. Todleben saw that Plevna could not be taken
                    by assault, and that it would be necessary to reduce it by drawing works round
                    Osman Pasha, and cutting him off from communication with the other Turkish
                    commanders. In due time Plevna fell. Todleben then undertook the siege of the
                    Bulgarian fortresses. After the conclusion of preliminaries of peace, he was
                    placed in command of the whole Russian army, and became responsible for the
                    government and administration of the occupied districts. In the discharge of
                    these duties he is said to have distinguished himself by his combined firmness
                    and good temper in dealing both with Turkish authorities and with the native
                    population. He received the highest military honours and commands when the war
                    was over, and became governor of Odessa. But his health was broken; and after
                    much suffering he died at a German watering-place in June 1884. He was buried
                    with great solemnity at Sebastopol.</p>
