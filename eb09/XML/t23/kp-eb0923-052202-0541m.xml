                <p><label type="entry">TRAPPISTS</label>. The abbey of Notre Darne de la Maison-Dieu
                    de la Trappe was founded in 1140 by Rotrou, count of Perche, at
                    Soligny-la-Trappe, a village of Haut-Perche, now in the arrondissement of
                    Mortagne, department of the Orne, so named from the narrow gorge which forms its
                    entrance, comparable to a trap-door. It was at first attached to the
                    congregation of Savigny, a minor offshoot of the order of Fontevrault, but that
                    congregation was united in 1148 to the Cistercian order, and, by the special
                    intervention of St Bernard, was affiliated, with all its dependencies, to his
                    own abbey of Clairvaux. No mediaeval monastic order fell more rapidly and
                    signally from the spirit of its original institute than the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0542-0523"/> Cistercian, and La Trappe formed no exception to
                    the general decay. Indeed, its geographical position in a district fiercely
                    contested during the long war between France and England hastened its
                    declension, for it was several times taken and pillaged, while the members of
                    the community, at last compelled to break up and disperse, returned at the close
                    of the war with their traditions interrupted, their discipline relaxed, and
                    their moral tone deteriorated. Nor was this the worst. The introduction of the
                    “commendam” system into the French Church, whereby secular ecclesiastics were
                    empowered to hold monastic benefices without residence or conformity to the rule
                    of the society in which they ranked as heads, wrought yet further mischief; and,
                    though the Trappists at first endeavoured to resist Jean du Bellay, the
                    celebrated bishop of Paris (afterwards cardinal-bishop of Ostia), whom Francis
                    I. nominated in 1526 as abbot commendatory, and were upheld by the pope in
                    continuing to elect their own abbots, yet their efforts were fruitless, and Du
                    Bellay was succeeded by a series of titular abbots, under whose nominal rule the
                    estates of the abbey were impoverished, the buildings suffered to fall into
                    nearly total ruin, and the conduct of the monks became a public scandal. In
                    fact, the community was broken up, the dismantled monastic buildings were
                    abandoned to a few domestics and their families, and the scattered Trappists
                    seldom reassembled save for hunting parties and similar amusements. Such was the
                    condition of things when a reformer arose in the person of one of those very
                    abbots commendatory who had been the ruin of the institute.</p>
                <p>Armand Jean Bouthillier de Rancé, second son of Denis Bouthillier de Rancé and
                    Charlotte Joly his wife, was born in Paris on January 9, 1626. By his father’s
                    side he was sprung from a patrician family of Breton origin long settled in
                    Normandy; by his mother’s he was connected with powerful members of the official
                    hierarchy. His near kindred were wealthy, titled, and highly placed in the
                    magistracy, the army, and the dignities of the church; while the fact that
                    Cardinal Richelieu was one of his sponsors and gave him his own fore-names
                    sufficiently attests the political influence just then at their disposal. The
                    child showed early tokens of considerable abilities, and was intrusted by his
                    father to accomplished tutors, under whom he made rapid progress. He was
                    originally intended to enter the order of the Knights of Malta, but the death of
                    his elder brother in 1637, after a long illness, changed his father’s plans, and
                    the child (who had been tonsured in 1635 by way of precaution against such a
                    contingency) was at once put in possession of the various benefices which had
                    been secured for his elder <hi rend="italic">; so</hi> that, while still under
                    eleven years of age, he was canon of Notre Dame de Paris, abbot of La Trappe, of
                    Notre Dame du Val, and of St Symphorian of Beauvais, and prior of Boulogne, near
                    Chambord, and of St Clementin, in Poitou. In 1642 he was sent to the Collége
                    d’Harcourt, where he began the usual course of philosophy, but addicted himself
                    almost at once to the then popular study of judicial astrology, which he soon
                    forsook for the cognate delusion of alchemy. Nevertheless, he distinguished
                    himself in the more accredited studies of the college, and graduated as M.A. in
                    1644. It was then usual for Parisian students in theology to attend the course
                    of lectures delivered at the Sorbonne, but De Rancé preferred to return home and
                    pursue his theological studies under private instruction. He was ordained deacon
                    in 1648, and, being in the heyday of youth, with high spirits and popular
                    manners, fell readily into the dissipations of the time, leading a very
                    irregular life, yet not so as to forfeit the goodwill of even his stricter
                    acquaintance. He was ordained priest in 1651, but made no alteration in his
                    habits, and yet so far kept up his studies that, when examined in 1652 for his
                    licence as bachelor in theology, he came out at the head of the candidates,
                    while the famous Bossuet ranked only as third. In 1653 he lost his father, who
                    bequeathed property to him which doubled his already large income, and in 1654
                    he graduated as doctor of divinity, when his uncle, the archbishop of Tours,
                    made him one of his archdeacons, hinting that this preferment would be merely
                    the preliminary of a mitre. He never so much as pretended to discharge the
                    duties of his new office, but spent his time amusing himself at his chateau of
                    Véretz; in despite of which his uncle nominated him as deputy from the diocese
                    of Tours to the general assembly of the French clergy convoked by the king in
                    1655 to discuss the Jansenist controversy. The chief matter of interest in this
                    connexion is that he was one of the minority of 65 doctors of the Sorbonne who
                    refused to vote, with the majority of 127, a censure upon the Jansenist leader
                    Arnauld, though he took part later against that school. The sudden death of the
                    duchess of Rohan-Montbazon, with whom he was intimate, and whose relations with
                    him were the subject of much hostile comment, is said to have been the first
                    great shock which began the process of change in his views of life and duty. A
                    story, which was first given currency in an anonymous account of his conversion
                    published at Cologne in 1668, much heightens this by alleging that De Rancé
                    arrived at the duchess’s house unaware of her death, and went direct to her
                    apartment without being warned by the servants, only to find her head lying
                    apart from her decapitated body, having been cut off because the coffin was too
                    short and there was no time to procure another. The truth of this story (itself
                    containing several improbable incidents) was promptly denied by Maupeou, the
                    earliest of De Rancé’s biographers, and has been rejected by Bayle and St Simon,
                    though accepted by La Harpe and Voltaire. What is certain is that the alteration
                    in his habits nearly synchronizes with the death of Madame de Montbazon, and
                    that the years 1657, 1658, and 1659 were mainly spent in solitary studies or in
                    visits to the monasteries of which he was titular head, varied by conferences
                    with eminent ecclesiastics whose advice he sought, while in 1660 the death of
                    the duke of Orleans, whose chief almoner he was, appears to have given the final
                    direction to his thoughts, though it was not for some years that he carried out
                    his new plans to the full. His first resolution was to sell his patrimony and
                    resign his benefices, and in 1662 he actually sold his chateau of Véretz, made
                    over two mansions in Paris to the hôtel-dieu, and obtained permission to
                    transfer all his abbeys except Boulogne and La Trappe to resident heads chosen
                    by himself. His canonry of Notre Dame had been resigned so far back as 1653
                    because of some difficulty about residence. After making provision for family
                    claims, and retaining a comparatively small sum for the repair of Boulogne and
                    La Trappe, he distributed the remainder of his property to the poor. In 1662 he
                    visited La Trappe, which he found in a deplorable condition, and the few
                    resident monks so indisposed to listen to his projects of reform that they
                    threatened to murder him and throw his body into the abbey ponds. In his turn he
                    threatened them with the king’s direct interference, and such was the terror of
                    Louis XIV.’s name that they at once submitted, and consented to retire upon the
                    payment of a moderate pension; whereupon De Rancé filled their places in 1663
                    with monks of the strict Cistercian observance, and carefully repaired the
                    monastic buildings there and at Boulogne. In that same year he finally decided
                    to enter the monastic life, and began his noviciate at the Cistercian abbey of
                    Perseigne in Maine, assuming, on his profession in 1664, the actual headship <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0543-0524"/> of the abbey of La Trappe, whose nominal abbot he
                    had been for nearly thirty years. Associating himself with other personages who
                    desired to revive the Cistercian discipline, he made two journeys to Rome to
                    obtain papal sanction for their plans, and after considerable delay a brief was
                    procured from Alexander VII. authorizing the abbot of Citeaux, as general of the
                    Cistercians, to hold a grand chapter of the order to discuss the proposed
                    reforms, which actually did meet in 1667. But De Rancé’s ideas went much beyond
                    the mere re-establishment of the strict observance; and, though he judged some
                    details of the original rule unsuited to his own day, and blended with it some
                    particulars borrowed from the Benedictine rule, yet he was so far from
                    diminishing its general austerity that he added to the protracted fasts, the
                    total abstinence from flesh-meat, fish, eggs, and wine, the laborious manual
                    occupations, the hard beds, and the severe asceticism, even in the church
                    services, which made part of the original rule, also the obligation of perpetual
                    silence, save at prayers (to which eleven hours daily are devoted), and save
                    also the “Memento mori” with which the Trappists greet each other on first
                    meeting, which is the distinguishing feature of La Trappe, a rule from which
                    none are dispensed save the abbot and the guest-master, as obliged to hold some
                    degree of intercourse with outsiders; and he further ordained that each monk
                    should spend some time each evening digging his own grave, and should sleep on
                    straw in his coffin for a bed. These austerities, though cheerfully embraced by
                    the monks of La Trappe, and attracting enthusiasts from without, were far from
                    being approved generally, even in the Cistercian order itself, and, when a
                    decree was issued by the council of state in 1675 giving the abbot of Citeaux
                    absolute authority over all Cistercians of the strict observance, De Rancé took
                    alarm, and, thinking it possible that an attempt might be made to mitigate the
                    severities he had introduced (particularly as the mortality amongst the members
                    of his society had been very large, and was currently attributed to insufficient
                    nutriment), induced them to renew their vows and to pledge themselves against
                    the admission of any relaxations. Nor was he content with opposing this kind of
                    resistance to the bishops, abbots, and others who remonstrated with him upon the
                    subject, but he also took up his pen in defence of his views, and published in
                    1683 his treatise <hi rend="italic">De la Sainteté et des Devoirs de la Vie
                    Monastique,</hi> which involved him in much controversy, notably with the
                    learned Benedictine Mabillon, who replied to him in his well-known work <hi
                    rend="italic">Traite des Études Monastiques,</hi> published in 1691. Advancing
                    years and unremitting asceticism told even on the strong constitution of De
                    Rancé, and he found himself unable to take his share of the manual labours of
                    the house, or even to be present in chapter, so that in 1695 he felt obliged to
                    resign the abbacy, and procured the nomination of the prior Zosimus to succeed
                    him, but he died before the arrival of the bulls for his installation, and Dorn
                    Francis-Armand was substituted in his room, and inducted into office in 1696. He
                    proved a failure as a ruler, and La Trappe broke up into two factions during his
                    headship, some holding to him and others to De Rancé, till the new abbot
                    resigned in a fit of disgust of which he soon repented, but could not succeed in
                    recalling his abdication. Dorn Jacques de la Tour, a man in sympathy with De
                    Rancé, was then nominated by the crown, and while he was still abbot De Rancé
                    died, on October 20, 1700, in the seventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>De Rancé was a tolerably copious author, though most of his writings were little
                    more than occasional pamphlets suggested by the controversies in which he was
                    engaged, short devotional treatises, and notices of deceased members of his
                    community, but his reputation for ability and scholarship was never contested.
                    He was a successful administrator, and, though the extreme severity of his
                    institute resulted in the failure of fully six-sevenths of the postulants who
                    presented themselves, he gathered round him during his government of the abbey
                    no fewer than three hundred ascetics, French, Belgians, Germans, Italians, and
                    Irishmen, one-third of whom were drawn from less austere communities or from the
                    ranks of the parochial clergy and candidates for the priesthood. Of lay
                    outsiders who joined him, the largest proportion consisted of rural artisans and
                    labourers, and of soldiers, from officer to private (a class for which La Trappe
                    has always continued to have attractions), with a small sprinkling of the legal
                    profession; while two physicians and a single tradesman complete the tale of
                    those who persevered out of the two thousand or so who presented themselves. No
                    daughter houses were founded from La Trappe during De Rancé’s life, for, though
                    he was ready enough to send some of his monks for a time or even permanently to
                    revive the Cistercian discipline in other monasteries, he was opposed on
                    principle to every scheme which tended to drain the resources of La Trappe
                    itself, and it was not till 1705 that the first offshoot of the Trappists was
                    planted at Buon-Solazzo, near Florence, at the solicitation of Cosmo III.,
                    grand-duke of Tuscany.</p>
                <p>No remarkable events occurred in connexion with La Trappe till the French
                    Revolution, when the order was included in the general suppression of monastic
                    societies by the Constituent Assembly in 1790. Even then the high character
                    borne by La Trappe, and honourably distinguishing it from too many monasteries
                    at that time, seemed likely to exempt it from the common fate, and great efforts
                    were made to obtain its exclusion from the operation of the decree. A petition
                    addressed by the Trappists to the National Assembly was referred to the
                    council-general of the department of the Orne at Alençon, which reported against
                    it to the ecclesiastical committee of the assembly, though admitting that all
                    the local municipalities which they had consulted were in favour of sparing the
                    abbey. Dorn Augustin (Louis Henri L’Estrange), at that time master of the
                    novices, foreseeing the result of the inquiry, went to Switzerland to provide a
                    refuge for the brethren, and obtained permission from the authorities of canton
                    Freiburg to take possession of Val-Sainte, an unoccupied Cistercian monastery,
                    and to bring no more than twenty-five persons thither. This necessitated leaving
                    more than a hundred at La Trappe to await the coming storm, which burst upon
                    Trinity Sunday, June 3, 1792, when commissioners seized all the movable goods
                    scheduled in their inventory, and compelled the inmates to disperse. Some betook
                    themselves to Soleure; a few retired singly into private dwellings; but various
                    groups set out together to found colonies in Spain, Germany, England, and
                    Canada; while the earlier Swiss and Tyrolese houses were compelled to break up
                    and seek refuge elsewhere from the French invaders. But amidst all difficulties
                    and discouragements the order not merely maintained itself, but grew and
                    strengthened, and in 1808 ventured to plant anew two houses in France itself.
                    This same year, however, saw the division of the order into two congregations,
                    because the Trappists of Darfeld, under their prior Eugène de Prade, resisted
                    what they considered to be the excessive demands made upon them by the abbot of
                    the order, that very L’Estrange who had led out the colony of Val-Sainte (and
                    who had been constituted its head, and that of the whole society, by a brief of
                    Pius VI. in 1794), and the dispute was appealed to Rome, with the result that in
                    June 1808 judgment was given against L’Estrange, and Darfeld was erected into an
                    independent abbey under De Prade as abbot, and subjected to the jurisdiction of
                    the bishop of Münster. Nearly every Trappist house at this date was <pb

                    sided with the pope against the emperor, the latter expelled its monks from all
                    monasteries in the empire, and imprisoned not a few of them. With his fall they
                    revived again, and obtained permission to return to France, whither between 1814
                    and 1825 they drifted back from most of their places of exile, though 1450 were
                    expelled anew in 1880 under the operation of the Ferry laws. La Trappe itself
                    was repurchased by L’Estrange, and became once more the mother house, while
                    there are fifteen other French monasteries of the order, four Belgian, two
                    English (Mount St Bernard, Leicestershire, and Stape Hill, Dorset), two in
                    Ireland, one each in Germany, Savoy, and Algiers, two in Italy, two (Gethsemane
                    in Kentucky and New Melleray in Iowa) in the United States, and one originally
                    settled in Pennsylvania, but now at Tracadie in Nova Scotia. An order of
                    Trappistine nuns was founded by Dorn Augustin in 1827, and has nine French
                    houses and one English. The total numbers are computed at 3000 members of both
                    sexes.</p>
