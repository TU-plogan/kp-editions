                    (1815-1874), an eminent Biblical critic, the son of a physician, was born on
                    18th January 1815 at Lengenfeld, near Plauen, in the Saxon Voigtland. From the
                    gymnasium at Plauen he passed in 1834 to the university of Leipsic, where he was
                    mainly influenced by Winer, and began to take special interest in New Testament
                    criticism. In 1840 he qualified as university lecturer in theology with a
                    dissertation on the recensions of the New Testament text, the main part of which
                    reappeared in the following year in the prolegomena to his first edition of the
                    New Testament. The importance of these early textual studies was that they
                    convinced him of the absolute necessity of new and exacter collations of MSS.,
                    and to this work he now gave himself. Above all he desired to go to Rome; but
                    lack of help and money compelled him to turn first towards Paris, where he
                    remained from October 1840 till January 1843, busy with the treasures of the
                    great library, eking out his scanty means by making collations for other
                    scholars, and producing for Didot several editions of the Greek New Testament,
                    one of them exhibiting the form of the text corresponding most closely to the
                    Vulgate. The great triumph of these laborious months was the decipherment of the
                    palimpsest <hi rend="italic">Codex Ephraemi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rescriptus,</hi> of which the New Testament part was printed before he left
                    Paris and the Old Testament in 1845. His success in dealing with a MS. much of
                    which had been illegible to earlier collators brought him into note and gained
                    public and private support for more extended critical expeditions. From Paris he
                    had paid short visits to Holland (1841) and England (1842). In 1843 he visited
                    Italy, and after a stay of thirteen months went on to Egypt, Sinai, Palestine,
                    and the Levant, returning by Vienna and Munich.<note anchored="true"

                    brought a great treasure, forty-three leaves of what is now known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex Sinaiticus</hi> (χ). For the time he kept the place of
                    discovery a secret, hoping to return and procure the rest of the book, and the
                    fragments were published in 1846 as the <hi rend="italic">Codex

                    given in honour of the king of Saxony. He now became professor in Leipsic and
                    married (1845). His teaching was apparently not very remarkable; but his
                    vacations were often occupied by fruitful critical journeys, and in 1853 and
                    1859 he made a second and a third voyage to the East. In the last of these, in
                    which he had the active aid of the Russian Government, he at length got access
                    to the remainder of the precious Sinaitic codex, and persuaded the monks to
                    present it to the czar, at whose cost it was published in 1862. To gain for
                    critical study a manuscript in point of age second only to the famous Vatican
                    Bible was a splendid triumph, but Tischendorf’s Eastern journeys were rich
                    enough in other less sensational discoveries to deserve the highest praise.<note

                    but this number is raised to twenty or twenty-one if mere reprints from
                    stereotype plates and the minor editions of his great critical texts are
                    included; posthumous prints bring up the total to forty-one. Four main
                    recensions of Tischendorf s text may be distinguished, dating respectively from
                    his editions of 1841,1849,1859(erf. <hi rend="italic">υii.),</hi> 1869-72 (erf.
                    inn.). The edition of 1849 may be regarded as historically the most important
                    from the mass of new critical material it used; that of 1859 is distinguished
                    from Tischendorfs other editions by coming nearer to the received text; in the
                    eighth edition the testimony of the Sinaitic MS. received great (probably too
                    great) weight. The readings of the Vatican MS. were given with more exactness
                    and certainty than had been possible in the earlier editions, and the editor had
                    also the advantage of using the published labours of Tregelles. Whatever
                    judgment may be passed on Tischendorfs critical tact and power, the apparatus of
                    this final edition will not soon be superseded, and sums up a vast series of
                    most important services to Biblical study.</p>
                <p>Much less important was Tischendorfs work on the Greek Old Testament His edition
                    of the Roman text, with the variants of the Alexandrian MS., the Codex Ephraemi,
                    and the Friderico-Augustanus, was of service when it appeared in 1850, but being
                    stereotyped was not greatly improved in subsequent issues. Its imperfections,
                    even within the limited field it covers, may be judged of by the aid of Nestle’s
                    appendix to the sixth issue (1880). Besides this may be mentioned editions of
                    the New Testament Apocrypha <hi rend="italic">{Acts of Apostles,</hi> 1851; <hi
                    rend="italic">Gospels,</hi> 1853, 2d ed. 1876; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apocalypses,</hi> 1866), and various minor writings, in part of an apologetic
                    character, such as <hi rend="italic">Wann wurden unsere Evangelien
