                    as old as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Septuagint</hi> (&lt;7.v.), the public use of
                    Targums on Sabbaths, festivals, &lt;fcc., is very ancient, and indeed their
                    language was for several hundreds of years the sole one understood by the
                    majority of the Jews in Palestine and Babylonia. How the Hebrew people of Judaea
                    came so entirely to unlearn their own Hebrew tongue as to stand in need of an
                    Aramaic translation of their Scriptures need not be dwelt on here (see vol. xi.
                    p. 597 and vol. xxi. p. 648). But an important contrast between the Aramaic and
                    Greek versions deserves particular notice. The use of the Septuagint by the
                    Greek-speaking Jews of Alexandria, Asia Minor, and elsewhere caused those who
                    adopted it to forget entirely their own Hebrew tongue. The Aramaic version
                    (Targum), however, springing from a religious necessity, was the cause of
                    revival of the knowledge of Hebrew, which had been nigh forgotten. It is
                    therefore easy to understand why the Jews in general have shown comparatively
                    little attachment to the Septuagint, whilst they ever ardently revered the
                    Aramaic version, even after the institution of publicly reciting it had
                    ceased.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Let not the

                    the Lord had been a respecter of persons. In Talmudic times they had apparently,

                    granted both to reciters and translators, as very scanty mention of any
                    particular provision concerning it is to be found in the Talmuds. The Psalms and
                    the book of Esther are classed together in so far as they may be read and
                    paraphrased even by ten persons (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Meg.,</hi> 215). For
                    Job and Lamentations, see below.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Duration of this Practice.—</hi> The practice of publicly
                    reciting the Targum continued somewhat later than the last of the geonim. Within
                    the last 400 years of that period, however, the power of this ancient
                    institution began to fluctuate, gradually declined, and finally almost —but not
                    entirely<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Long after the
                    institution of publicly reciting the Targum on the Law had generally declined,
                    it was yet retained in Germany and Italy on certain days of the three high
                    festivals, viz., (a) the seventh day of Passover, (5) the first day of
                    Pentecost, and (c) the last day attached to the festival of Tabernacles (t.e.,
                    Γ∏l∏ ΠΠ0Ei'). The passages so recited were—(a) parts of the lesson for the
                    day—the song of Moses and the children of Israel, with the introduction; (5) the
                    Decalogue in Exodus; (c) the last portion of Deuteronomy. In the first case the
                    paraphrase was from the three Targums mixed, in the second from the Targum
                    Yonathan with deviations, in the last from the Targum Onkelos. (These pieces are
                    interspersed with sundry bits of poetry; see’Camb. MS. Add. 374, leaves
                    169α-1715, 199α-203α, 4235-4275.) Towards the end of the 14th century, as
                    regards Passover and Pentecost, the custom fell into desuetude, but down to our
                    own days some of the congregations of Italy continue the usage of reciting the
                    Targum Onkelos in connexion with the narration of the death of Moses. This
                    custom, however, is now rapidly dying out. As regards the recitation of the
                    Targum on the Prophets, a small remnant of the congregations following the rite
                    of Rome <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Italianι)</hi> continue it to this day on the festival of Passover. For the use
                    of the Targum on Pentecost, see <hi rend="italic">Responsa,</hi> by R. Meir of
                    Rothenburg <hi rend="smallcaps">(Rosh,</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi> footnote

                    after the Mohammedan conquests Arabic supplanted Aramaic as the vernacular, and
                    the Targums thus became unintelligible to the mass (see <hi rend="italic">Seder
                    Pαb</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi><hi rend="italic">Λmram,</hi> i.,
                    Warsaw, 1863, leaf 29α), even as was already the case in the Western world. A
                    second and more important cause, however, was the spread of Karaism, whose
                    criticism of the Rabbinic contents of the Targums provoked the Rabbanites to pay
                    more attention to the etymology and grammar of the Hebrew text of the <pb

                    vigour and decay, exercised, directly and indirectly, a salutary influence. In
                    each case the knowledge of Hebrew was promoted; and it advanced so much, that by
                    1000 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the Jews of Irak, like those of the rest of
                    the world then, and as in our own days, certainly knew the pure Hebrew better
                    than the Aramaic idiom. The same was the case in other Arabic-speaking parts, as
                    Spain, Africa, &lt;fcc.,—Yemen then and still forming a solitary exception.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Yemen the Targum is
                    publicly recited to this day, and, strange to say, by boys of nine years of age

                    untenable. It is incredible that Aquila or any other Greek could have had the
                    mastery of Aramaic and of traditional lore as well as of Hebrew which the Targum
                    displays; and the phrase of T. Y <hi rend="italic">.,'MegU.,</hi> i. 9, “an

                    inapplicable to Onkelos, and ought to be taken as referring to the Peshito
                    Syriac, which is admittedly dependent on the LXX. In a Jewish writing “for
                    them”—set absolutely—means “for the Christians.” The view now accepted by most
                    critics is that the word Onkelos is a Babylonian corruption of Akylas, but that
                    the name “Targum Onkelos” originally meant no more than “Targum in the style of
                    Aquila,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> bearing to the freer Palestinian Targums a

                    others, and these older than either <hi rend="italic">Gernara,</hi> which have

                    a targumist; and, indeed, the Targum being a representative piece of the oral
                    law was certainly not written down, private notes <hi rend="italic">(megil∙ loth

                    beginning of the 7th century. But in the opinion of the present writer this need
                    not prevent us from recognizing Onkelos as a corrector and compiler of oral
                    Targum in the 1st century. As regards the name, it may be suggested that Onkelos
                    is a deliberate perversion of Evangelus, a Greek proper name which exactly
                    translates the Jewish (and especially Babylonian-Jewish) name Mebasser. As the
                    Christian writings are called <hi rend="italic">Aven</hi> (iniquity, idolatry),
                    and as the pre-Mishnic teacher R. Meir calls the gospel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(evangelion) ongillayoιι</hi> (iniquity of the roll; T. B., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shab.,</hi> leaf 116, Amst. ed. of 1645), or, by inversion, <hi rend="italic"
                    >gilyon-aven</hi> (roll of iniquity), the name Evangelus, which suggested
                    associations with the gospel, might be perverted into Onkelos <hi rend="italic"
                    >quasi</hi> On-keles (iniquity of disgrace). And, while a Babylonian Jew coming
                    to Palestine might find it convenient to translate his Hebrew name into
                    Evangelus, this good Greek name was enough to suggest in after times that he was
                    of heathen origin and so to facilitate the con· fusion with Aquila. The idiom of
                    the Targum Onkelos, which is held to be Palestinian with some Babylonian
                    features, points to Babylonia as the country of its final redactor, if to
                    Palestine as its source. It must be remembered that Hillel and other great
                    fountains of Palestinian learning were of Babylonian origin.<note

                    >Kimhi</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>), that, in addition to the complete
                    extant Targum on the Prophets, there existed other Targums or fragments of them.
                    These are now known from the marginal additions to the Reuch-linian Codex of the
                    Targum on the Prophets published by Lagarde (Leipsic, 1872), and have been
                    discussed by Bacher <hi rend="italic">(pit sup.).</hi> As regards the complete
                    Targum on the Prophets, no mistake can be greater than to believe that Rab
                    Yoseph, a teacher of the 3d and 4th centuries, and head of the academy of
                    Pumbaditha (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rabbah),</hi> was the author of this Targum
                    in whole or in part. This mistake has its origin in the repeated phrase of the
                    Babylonian Talmud, P)D1* 21 DJ1Π012 (“as Rab Yoseph targumizes”); but then a
                    similar phrase exists with regard to Rab Shesheth, 21 DU1ΠD12 (“as Rab
                    Shesheth<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the editions

                    but in the edition before R. ’ Azaryah m. Haadummim the reading was absolutely
                    <hi rend="italic">Shesheth</hi>; see <hi rend="italic">Meor Εnayim,</hi> cap.

                    we targumize ”) is of frequent occurrence. In this last instance the words mean
                    “as we are in the habit of translating certain passages in Holy Writ according
                    to a Targum we have received.” As applied to Rab Yoseph and Rab Shesheth the
                    phrase may certainly mean more and yet not imply that these teachers were in any
                    way authors of the Targum on the Law, the Prophets, or Hagiographa. Rab Yoseph
                    and Rab Shesheth were both blind, and as such were not allowed to quote <hi
                    rend="italic">in extenso</hi> the written word of the Law, which it was
                    forbidden to recite orally. They therefore committed to memory the oral Targum,
                    and so were, of course, appealed to as Targumic authorities, &amp;c.<note

                    Prophets will be clearly seen from the following Talmudic passage (B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Megillah,</hi> 3oe; <hi rend="italic">Mo'ed Katan,</hi> 286)
                    :—“Were it not for the Targum of that verse [Zechar. xii. 11] I should not know
                    the meaning of the prophet.” This verse is from the last but one of all the
                    Prophets;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is by no

                    similar one occurs, referring to Isa. viii. 6.</p></note> and we see that Rab
                    Yoseph must have had the Targum on the Prophets before him. In the opinion of
                    the present writer this Targum was composed by Yonathan; and, not being on books
                    of the Law, there was no reason why it should not have been there and then
                    written down.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,
                    however, vol. xxi. p. 648.</p></note> ® Although the traditions it embodies came
                    originally from Babylonia and returned to Babylonia, its language has yet a more
                    marked colouring of the Palestinian idiom than that of Onkelos, because it was
                    not studied so much and therefore not so much modified and interpolated. Some of
                    the Agadoth occurring in this Targum are ascribed in the Talmud and Midrash to
                    later men, but this is no conclusive argument against an early date. It can be
                    shown that many laws and sayings supposed to be of the 2d, 3d, and 4th centuries
                    of the Christian era are actually of pre-Christian times, and, indeed, certain
                    explanations, figures of speech, &amp;c., had been, so to say, floating in the
                    air for centuries. Certain passages in the Septuagint contain Agadoth which
                    reappear, seemingly for the first time, in the Talmudic literature. The Prophets
                    themselves knew Agadoth which only reappear in what are believed to be late

                    a very corrupt state. The causes of this corruption are many, but chiefly the
                    following :—(1) mistakes ordinarily made by scribes through carelessness, or
                    ignorance, or both; (2) the Targums had passed from century to century and from
                    country to country without having been written down; (3) when written down they
                    were probably not provided with vowel-points at once; (4) when provided with
                    vowel-points most of them were first provided with Babylonian (or Assyrian),
                    which afterwards were changed into Palestiuian ones; this change was a fertile
                    source of fresh mistakes; (5) the loss of the general knowledge of the Targumic
                    idiom contingent on the decline and final fall of the institution of publicly
                    reciting the Targum was an additional source from which mistakes arose; (6)
                    conjectural emendations contributed their quota to the corruption of the text;
                    (7) Buxtorf s emendations founded on the diction of the Biblical Targum (as
                    suggested in the <hi rend="italic">Methurgeman)</hi> are a gross mistake,
                    inasmuch as they lack the criticism of history; (8) printers’ mistakes,
                    increasing in every new edition, have all but ruined the text. The remedies for
                    this corruption are :—(1) good Targum MSS. in private hands and public
                    libraries, notably in Italy, Germany, and England; (2) Targum MSS., according to
                    the Babylonico·Assyrian system of punctuation, chiefly preserved in South
                    Arabia, Russia, and England; (3) some early and comparatively good printed
                    editions; (4) the <hi rend="italic">Massoreth</hi> of the Targum.</p>

                    original readings of the sacred text must be given up. All of them contain more
                    or less, whether visible at first sight or not, certain paraphrastic elements,
                    which give no absolute security for the exact reading of thé pristine Hebrew
                    text But besides their importance as linguistic monuments they have the highest
                    value as historical records—(1) of the exegesis which obtained at the time of
                    their composition, and (2) of the then current manners, thoughts, and
