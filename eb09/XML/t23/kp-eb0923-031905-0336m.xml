                    class, and include some of the most serious and fatal of maladies (see <hi

                    present article will be devoted mainly to a general account of the more common
                    diseases affecting the upper part of the respiratory passages, but certain
                    morbid conditions of the back of the mouth and of the gullet will also be
                    referred to. The diagnosis of not a few of these diseases has been greatly aided
                    by the introduction into medical practice of the laryngoscope; but, while the
                    use of this instrument is a part of the education of every well-equipped medical
                    practitioner, the minute investigation and the treatment of the more occult and
                    serious maladies affecting the throat are by general consent, and with much
                    advantage, relegated to the specialist.</p>

                    mucous membrane into that of the larynx. It is an occasional accompaniment of
                    certain of the infectious diseases in which the throat is liable to suffer, such
                    as small-pox, measles, scarlet fever, and erysipelas. Excessive use of the
                    voice, as in loud speaking or singing, sometimes gives rise to laryngitis.
                    Further, the inhalation of irritating particles, vapours, &amp;c., and the local
                    effects of swallowing very hot fluids, are well-recognized causes. The chief
                    changes in the larynx are great redness, with swelling of the parts, which
                    affect the whole interior of the cavity, but are specially marked where the
                    tissues are lax, such as the neighbourhood of the epiglottis and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n337/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0337-0320"/> of the vocal cords. The effect is to produce
                    narrowing of the channel for the entrance of air, and to this the chief dangers
                    are due. The symptoms vary with the intensity of the attack, but, along with
                    more or less feverishness and constitutional disturbance, there is usually a
                    sense of heat, dryness, and pain in the throat, attended with some difficulty in
                    the act of swallowing. Cough is a constant symptom, and is either loud, barking,
                    or clanging, or else husky and toneless. It is at first dry, but afterwards is
                    accompanied with expectoration. The voice, like the cough, is rough or husky.
                    The breathing shows evidence of laryngeal obstruction, both inspiration and
                    expiration being prolonged and difficult, with a somewhat hissing sound, and
                    with almost no interval between the two acts. In severe cases the face and
                    surface generally become livid, and suffocation threatens, particularly during
                    the paroxysms of coughing. In favourable cases, which form the majority, the
                    attack tends to abate in a few days, but on the other hand death may occur
                    suddenly in a suffocative paroxysm, particularly in the case of children. Many
                    cases of acute laryngitis are so comparatively slight as to make themselves
                    known only by hoarseness and the character of the cough; nevertheless in every
                    instance the attack demands serious attention. The treatment consists in keeping
                    the patient in bed in an atmosphere of 60° to 70° F., made moist by steam. The
                    use of warm gargles, and the frequent inhalation of the vapour of hot water,
                    containing such soothing substances as benzoin, conium, hop, &amp;c., and the
                    application of hot fomentations to the throat, will be found of much value.
                    Internally diaphoretics, such as small doses of antimony or Dover’s powder, are
                    also to be recommended. Such remedies usually suffice to relieve the attack, but
                    in very severe cases more active interference may be necessary. When there is
                    much swelling of the mucous membrane in the upper portion of the larynx,
                    scarification of the parts with the aid of the laryngoscope may afford relief,
                    but tracheotomy should not be neglected where death appears to be imminent from
                    suffocation. Attacks of laryngitis may be largely prevented in those liable to
                    them by a regimen calculated to invigorate the system, such as the cold bath,
                    regular open-air exercise, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chronic laryngitis</hi> may occur as a result of repeated
                    attacks of the acute form, or may arise independently from such causes as
                    habitual exposure (especially where along with this there is overindulgence in
                    alcohol), the habitual overuse of the vocal organs, &amp;c. The changes taking
                    place in the parts are more permanent than in the acute form, consisting mainly
                    in thickening of the mucous membrane, vocal cords, &amp;c. With it may be
                    ulceration, and also sometimes destruction, of the cartilaginous parts of the
                    larynx. The symptoms vary according to the extent and amount, as well as the
                    duration, of the inflammation. Thus there may simply be a certain huskiness or
                    hoarseness on attempts at the use of the voice, this condition being well
                    exemplified in the so-called clergyman’s sore throat <hi rend="italic"
                    >{dysphonia clericorum)</hi>; while, on the other hand, there may be, not only
                    complete loss of voice, but severe pain in the act of swallowing and great
                    difficulty in breathing, accompanied sometimes with expectoration of large
                    quantities of matter in the cases where ulceration is present. Under this
                    variety of the disease may be included the ulceration due to syphilis and that
                    occurring in the course of phthisis, both of which are attended with the
                    symptoms now mentioned. The diagnosis and the treatment of all such cases is
                    greatly aided by the use of the laryngoscope, by which a view of the affected
                    parts can be obtained, and the proper remedies more readily applied. In the
                    treatment of the chronic forms of laryngitis rest to the parts is essential, any
                    attempts at continuing the use of the voice only aggravating the condition;
                    while tonic remedies and regimen should be diligently employed to strengthen the
                    system generally. Applications to the affected parts in the forms of solutions
                    of silver, alum, zinc, tannin, &amp;c., either by means of a sponge-probang
                    introduced into the cavity or by the simpler method of spraying, are often
                    beneficial. The insufflation of powders, such as iodoform, or starch mixed with
                    a minute quantity of morphia, is also of service, as are likewise inhalations of
                    vapours of iodine, carbolic acid, turpentine, eucalyptus, &amp;c. In aggravated
                    forms of this disease tracheotomy is occasionally necessary to relieve
                    threatened suffocation.</p>
                <p>Symptoms similar to those already described are produced by tumours and other
                    growths in the larynx. Such growths may be of simple character, in the form of
                    isolated fibrous formations attached by a peduncle to some portion of the
                    laryngeal mucous membrane, or as warty excrescences occurring upon or in the
                    neighbourhood of the vocal cords. They are detected by means of the
                    laryngoscope, and can often be dealt with effectually by the surgeon. In the
                    more serious malignant tumours (epitheliomatous or cancerous), which either take
                    origin in the larynx, or spread into it from adjacent parts, interference by
                    surgical measures can only afford temporary relief.</p>
                <p>Certain affections of the larynx are of purely nervous origin, and occur
                    independently of any local disease. One of the most important of these is <hi
                    rend="italic">laryngismus striduhιs,</hi> otherwise called <hi rend="italic"
                    >child-crowing</hi> or <hi rend="italic">spasmodic croup.</hi> This condition
                    occurs chiefly during the early years of childhood, often in infants during
                    dentition, and manifests itself after premonitory symptoms of a common catarrh,
                    lasting a day or two, by the occurrence of a violent suffocative attack due to
                    sudden spasmodic approximation of the vocal cords, and consequent interruption
                    to the breathing. The symptoms are not connected with any local inflammatory
                    condition, but are the result of reflex irritation affecting the nerves
                    supplying the laryngeal muscles. Such disturbance appears specially apt to occur
                    in rickety or otherwise unhealthy children, in connexion either with dentition
                    or with disorders of the alimentary canal. The onset is sudden, resembling a
                    convulsive seizure, and symptoms of suffocation are at once developed. The child
                    makes strong efforts to inspire, which are accompanied with stridulous or
                    crowing sounds, but, notwithstanding, very little air can enter the chest owing
                    to the spasm of the glottis, and unless relief speedily comes death may be very
                    rapid. In most cases, however, the attack quickly passes off, and the child
                    seems little the worse. A liability to this disorder is sometimes observed in
                    families, and in such instances the attacks are apt to occur in their more
                    serious and fatal forms. Treatment to be of any avail must be promptly applied.
                    It consists mainly in the employment of means to allay the spasm. The use of the
                    warm bath is very serviceable for this purpose, as is also chloroform
                    inhalation. But one of the simplest and most effectual measures is putting the
                    finger back into the child’s mouth, which is sufficient in many cases to relax
                    the spasm of the glottis, and permit the entrance of air. In impending asphyxia
                    the dashing of cold water over the face and chest, and the use of artificial
                    respiration, should be tried, and even tracheotomy or laryngotomy if
                    practicable. In all cases every effort should be made to discover any causes
                    likely to produce nervous irritation, such as teething, intestinal worms,
                    &amp;c., and to deal with these by appropriate remedies.</p>
                <p>Symptoms not unlike those now described sometimes occur in adults as the result
                    of irritation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve, by the pressure upon it of a
                    thoracic aneurism or other tumour. Such pressure, if long continued, results in
                    paralysis of the nerve, occasioning more or less constant trouble in
                    breathing.</p>
                <p>In the condition known as <hi rend="italic">nervous aphonia,</hi> which occurs
                    mostly in women of hysterical habit or in circumstances of enfeebled health, the
                    voice becomes reduced to a whisper, but there is seldom any affection of the
                    breathing, or cough, and the laryngoscope reveals a perfectly healthy state of
                    the parts. In such cases the remedies must be directed to the improvement of the
                    general health. The use of electricity (faradism) applied to the neck is often
                    attended ∙with marked benefit.</p>
                <p>Diseases affecting the <hi rend="italic">Trachea</hi> are usually associated with
                    laryngeal affections on the one hand or bronchial on the other, and their
                    separate consideration is unnecessary.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tonsils</hi> are frequently the seat of inflammation, and
                    <hi rend="italic">acute tonsillitis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">quinsy</hi> is one
                    of the most common forms of sore throat. This affection is usually induced by
                    cold, but it would appear to arise under other conditions also, such as
                    digestive disturbances, &amp;c. It is said to be more common in persons of
                    rheumatic constitution, and one attack predisposes to others. The symptoms come
                    on somewhat suddenly <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and sharply, with chill
                    followed by fever, the temperature frequently attaining a high point of
                    elevation. Pain is experienced in the act of swallowing from the outset. The
                    inflammation is usually at first confined to one tonsil, but on examining the
                    throat there is seen to be considerable redness and swelling of the whole
                    surrounding mucous membrane, the uvula, soft palate, &amp;c., while a copious
                    secretion accumulates at the parts, and causes much discomfort. The act of
                    swallowing becomes increasingly difficult, and fluids are apt to regurgitate
                    through the nose. Pain is felt along the Eustachian tube towards the ear, and
                    there are tenderness and swelling in the neck about the angle of the jaw on the
                    affected side. The voice acquires a peculiar and very characteristic snuffling
                    tone, and there may be some embarrassment to the breathing. In a few days the
                    inflamed tonsil shows signs of suppurating, and an abscess is seen to be bulging
                    forward into the mouth. When this bursts or is evacuated, speedy relief is
                    obtained, and the patient is soon restored to his usual health. Occasionally,
                    however, the inflammation passes from the one tonsil to the other, and a similar
                    experience has to be gone through again. An attack of quinsy rarely lasts beyond
                    a week or ten days, and is not as a rule attended with danger to life, although
                    it is said that suffocation has occasionally occurred owing to the bursting of a
                    large tonsillar abscess during sleep, and the passage of its contents into the
                    trachea. The treatment for a quinsy is much the same as that for an ordinary
                    catarrh or cold,—confinement to the house, the employment of diaphoretics or
                    mild laxatives, together with light diet, being all that is necessary as regards
                    general management. For the relief of the local inflammation the frequent
                    employment of warm gargles of milk and water or glycerin and water or the
                    inhalation of vapour afford much relief, as do also hot applications to the
                    neck. Some authorities recommend the sucking of ice and the external application
                    of cold compresses, but on the whole <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0338-0321"/> warmth appears to be the more soothing remedy.
                    When an abscess has formed it may be punctured, but care requires to be observed
                    in doing this that no injury be inflicted on any important blood-vessel.</p>
                <p>The tonsils are frequently the seat of permanent enlargement <hi rend="italic"
                    >(chronic tonsillitis),</hi> which may result from frequent attacks of quinsy or
                    may exist independently. They are often seen in delicate young people, and, in
                    the case of some at least, denote a strumous tendency. They give trouble from
                    the mechanical impediment they present to swallowing and clear articulation, and
                    when very large they cause the breathing to be more or less noisy at all times,
                    but especially during sleep, while again they may give rise to a measure of
                    deafness. They are treated by remedies which promote the general nutrition, such
                    as cod-liver oil, iron, &amp;c., by the use of astringent gargles, and when
                    necessary by excision.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pharynx</hi> or upper portion of the gullet (seen to a
                    large extent on looking at the back of the mouth) is frequently the seat of a
                    chronic inflammatory condition, usually associated with derangements of the
                    digestive organs, and sometimes the result of excessive tobacco smoking. On
                    inspection the mucous membrane is seen to be unduly red and glazed looking, with
                    the enlarged follicles standing out prominently. It produces considerable
                    irritation, cough, and discomfort, which may be of long continuance unless
                    subjected to appropriate treatment. This consists in removing any local source
                    of irritation, in rectifying by diet and other remedies (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Stomach Diseases)</hi> any gastric disturbance, and by the
                    application to the parts of silver or other mild caustic solution.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">(Esophagus</hi> or gullet may be the seat of catarrhal or
                    inflammatory conditions, but the more important ailments affecting this tract
                    are those which arise from local injuries, such as the swallowing of scalding or
                    corrosive substances. This may cause ulceration followed with cicatrization
                    which narrows the passage and produces the symptoms of stricture of the
                    oesophagus,—namely, pain and difficulty in swallowing, with regurgitation of the
                    food. The severity of the case will necessarily depend upon the amount of
                    narrowing and consequent mechanical obstruction, but in some instances this has
                    occurred to such an extent as practically to occlude the canal. Cases of
                    oesophageal stricture of the kind now referred to may sometimes be relieved by
                    the diligent use of the bougie, but not unfrequently, in order to prevent death
                    by starvation, surgical interference is requisite to form an opening into the
                    stomach by means of which food may be introduced.</p>
                <p>A still more serious and frequent cause of oesophageal stricture is that due to
                    cancerous growth in the canal, which may occur at any part, but is most common
                    at the lower end, in the vicinity of the entrance into the stomach. The symptoms
                    of this condition are increasing difficulty in the passage downwards of the
                    food, the steady decline in strength, and the development of the cancerous
                    cachexia, together with enlargements of the glands in the neck; while the
                    diagnosis is rendered the more certain by the absence of any cause, such as
                    local injury, for the formation of a stricture, and by the age (as a rule at or
                    beyond middle life). Treatment here can only be palliative while life continues,
                    which in general is not long. Feeding by the bowel (enemata) may be
                    advantageously resorted to as supplementary to efforts to administer liquid
                    nutriment in the usual way. It is to be observed in all cases of organic
                    stricture that the food does not necessarily return at once, but seems as if it
                    had passed into the stomach. In reality, however, it has passed into the dilated
                    or pouched portion of the canal, which is almost always present immediately
                    above the seat of stricture, where it remains until, from its amount, it
                    regurgitates back into the mouth, when it can be seen, by the absence of any
                    evidence of digestion, that it has never been within the cavity of the stomach.
                    While in this way a large quantity of the food returns, it often happens that a
                    small amount of the liquid portion does trickle through the narrowed canal into
                    the stomach, and thus life may be prolonged for a considerable time.</p>
                <p>Strictures of the oesophagus may also be produced by the pressure of tumours or
                    aneurisms within the cavity of the chest but external to the canal. Further, a
                    variety of oesophageal stricture is not unfrequently met with which is due
                    entirely to nervous causes, and is quite unconnected with organic
                    disease,—namely, that form occurring in hysterical females termed spasmodic
                    stricture. Here the attack of difficulty in swallowing comes on usually when the
                    patient is at meals, and the food cannot pass down. The absence, however, of all
                    history of any organic source of disease, and especially the perfect facility
                    with which the oesophageal tube or bougie is passed, together with other
                    manifestations of hysteria commonly present, serve readily to establish the
                    diagnosis. The remedies most suitable are tonics and the frequent passage of the
                    stomachtube, which as a rule soon entirely removes the tendency to spasm.</p>
                <p>Finally, difficulty in swallowing sometimes occurs in certain serious nervous
                    diseases from paralysis affecting the nerves supplying the muscular coats of the
                    oesophagus, which thus loses its propulsive power. When such complications occur
                    they usually denote an advanced stage of the central disease with which they are
                    connected, and a speedily fatal termination. (J. 0. A.)</p>
