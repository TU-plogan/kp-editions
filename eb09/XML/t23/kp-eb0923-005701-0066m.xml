                <p><label type="entry">TAR</label> is a product of the destructive distillation of
                    organic substances. It is a highly complex material, varying in its composition
                    according to the nature of the body from which it is distilled,—different
                    products, moreover, being obtained according to the temperature at which the
                    process of distillation is carried on. As commercial products there are two
                    principal classes of tar in use—(1) wood tar, the product of the special
                    distillation of several varieties of wood, and (2) coal tar, which is primarily
                    a bye-product of the distillation of coal for the manufacture of illuminating
                    gas. These tars are intimately related to the bitumen, asphalt, mineral pitch,
                    and petroleum obtained in very many localities throughout the world.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wood Tar.—</hi> Wood tar, known also as Stockholm and as
                    Archangel tar, is principally prepared in the great pine forests of central and
                    northern Russia, Finland, and Sweden. The material chiefly employed is the
                    resinous stools and roots of the Scotch fir <hi rend="italic">(Pinus
                    sylvestris)</hi> and the Siberian larch <hi rend="italic">(Larix sibiηca),</hi>
                    with other less common fir-tree roots. A large amount of tar is also prepared
                    from the roots of the swamp pine <hi rend="italic">(P. australis)</hi> in North
                    and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, in the United States. In the
                    distillation of wood a series of products, including gas, tar, pyroligneous acid
                    and wood spirit, and charcoal may be obtained, and any of these may be the
                    primary object of the operation. When tar is the substance sought, the ancient
                    and crude method of working is yet largely adopted in the north of Europe. The
                    wood to be treated is closely piled up into a huge conical stack or pile on an
                    elevated platform, the sole of which is covered with clay and tiles. The sole
                    slopes inwards from every side to the centre, where an opening communicates with
                    a vaulted cavity under the elevated platform. The pile of wood is closely
                    covered over with layers of turf and earth or sand to a depth of several inches,
                    but leaving at first near the bottom numerous apertures for the admission of air
                    to promote ignition. The pile is ignited from below, and as the fire spreads
                    through the heap the various apertures are closed up and a slow smouldering
                    combustion goes on for some days till, by the sinking of the pile, the top of
                    the stack falls in, and a bright flame springs up at that point. About ten days
                    after ignition tar first begins to flow, and it is at once collected into
                    barrels. According to the size of the pile, the distillation may continue
                    several weeks, the tar secured amounting to about 17 <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 5 per cent, of the w ood operated on. In this method several valuable
                    products—the gas, the crude pyroligneous acid, and much charcoal—are lost or
                    wasted; and a more economical process of treating the wood in closed stills or
                    retorts is now largely used in Russia, the gas evolved serving as fuel under the
                    retorts. The heavier tar products of the distillation collect at the bottom of
                    the retort, whence they are carried off by a pipe to a receiver; the volatile
                    portion passes off at the upper part of the retort, and is separately condensed,
                    the lightest portion passing through a worm condenser. From treatment in close
                    retorts resinous roots yield from 16 to 20 per cent, of tar, with some oil of
                    turpentine and pyroligneous acid.</p>
                <p>Wood tar is a semi-fluid substance, of a dark brown or black colour, with a
                    strong pungent odour and a sharp taste. Owing to the presence of acetic
                    (pyroligneous) acid, which is a collateral product, it has an acid reaction; it
                    is soluble in that acid, as well as in alcohol and the fixed and essential oils,
                    &lt;fcc. Tar consists essentially of a mixture of homologous hydrocarbons, and
                    by redistillation it can be fractionated into a series of bodies having fixed
                    boiling points. Some varieties of tar have a granular appearance, from the
                    presence of minute crystals of pyrocatechin, which dissolve and disappear on
                    heating the substance. Pyrocatechin dissolves freely in water, and to it the tar
                    water <hi rend="italic">(liquor picis)</hi> of pharmacy probably owes its
                    value.</p>
                <p>Crude tar from retorts, when submitted to redistillation, gives off w ood spirit
                    (methyl-alcohol), and then acetic (pyroligneous) acid, and finally, on forcing
                    the heat, pitch oil is driven off. The residuum left in the still hardens into a
                    solid vitreous mass, which forms the black pitch of commerce. Tar and pitch are
                    most largely used as protective coatings for woodwork and other materials much
                    exposed to water and the weather. Thus tar is of great value in connexion with
                    shipbuilding and shipping generally. A considerable quantity is used in
                    manufacturing tarred ropes, and in the “smearing” of highland sheep to afford a
                    protection against the weather. Pitch also is the basis of the Berlin black or
                    Brunswick black used for coating cast-iron goods and for “japanning”
                    preparations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coal Tar.—</hi> The art of distilling coal for the production
                    of tar was discovered and patented by the earl of Dundonald in 1787, and till
                    the general introduction of coal gas some amount of coal was yearly distilled in
                    Scotland for the production of coal tar. The demand for the substance was
                    limited, it being principally used for coating iron castings and smith work, for
                    making an inferior lamp black, and as a source of a solvent oil. With the
                    extensive use of coal gas the necessity for this separate distillation ceased,
                    and soon tar was produced in the manufacture of gas in quantities that could not
                    be disposed of. It was burned up for heating gas-retorts; it was mixed with coal
                    dust, sawdust, &lt;tc., for making patent fuel; and it was distilled for
                    producing a series of hydrocarbon oils, heavy tar, and pitch; but it was only
                    after the discovery and introduction of “tar-colours” that the substance came
                    for some time to be really valuable. Since that time its price has fluctuated
                    greatly; and in the United Kingdom alone there are now distilled annually about
                    10,000,000 tons of coal for gas-making, producing 120,000,000 gallons of crude
                    tar,—a quantity greatly in excess of the ordinary demand.</p>
                <p>If wood be distilled slowly at low temperatures, the gases consist chiefly of
                    carbonic oxide and carbonic acid, mixed with only very little of carburetted
                    hydrogens, and consequently little luminous on combustion; the watery part of
                    the tar includes relatively much of methyl-alcohol, acetone, and acetic acid;
                    the oily part of the tar (tar proper) has a certain proximate composition
                    characteristic of this mode of distillation. Our present knowledge in regard to
                    this last-named point is very incomplete; of definite species the following have

                    kept at such temperature, or if the vapours produced at a relatively low
                    temperature are passed through intensely heated pipes before reaching the
                    condenser (Pettenkofer’s method for producing illuminating gas from wood),—the
                    gas produced contains a considerable admixture of luminiferous hydrocarbons, the
                    proportions of methyl-alcohol, acetone, and acetic acid get less, and the tar
                    proper assumes more of the character of coal-gas tar (see below). Similar
                    observations we make in the case of coal. About 1862 Wigan cannel coal used to
                    be distilled industrially at low temperatures to produce “light oils.”
                    Schorlemmer examined these and found them to consist chiefly of “paraffins” (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Paraffin)</hi> from C <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi> upwards. A similar result is obtained with ordinary
                    coal, although in its case the “benzols” are more largely represented. If we
                    distil any kind of coal at high temperatures— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, in
                    the way customary for illuminating-gas making—the distillable part of the tar

                    thrown considerable light on the chemical mechanism of dry distillation. As
                    found by him, even the most complex of the substances named are producible by
                    the interaction upon one another of a few bodies of very simple constitution, or
                    even one or other of these by the mere action of a high temperature. To give a
                    few examples. Marshgas, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, when passed through

                <p>Hence no single pyrogenic reaction goes to the end; if it does not, so to say,
                    check its own progress, other secondary reactions set in and do so, the general
                    result being that ultimately, but in general slowly, a state of dynamic
                    equilibrium is attained in which a set of synthetic reactions on the one hand
                    and a set of analytic reactions on the other compensate one another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Industrial Working of Coal Tar.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Coal tar, as it comes from the
                    gas-works, is used for a variety of purposes, such as—(1) for fuel, the tar
                    being made into a spray by means of a steam-injector and the spray kindled; (2)
                    for the preservation of building materials, porous stones, and bricks, &amp;c.;
                    (3) for making roofingfelt (in 1868, five-sixths of the 9000 tons of tar
                    produced at the Berlin gas-works was thus utilized; the case, however, is
                    different now); (4) for making a low quality of lamp-black. At present, however,
                    most of the tar produced, in centres of industry at least, is worked up by
                    distillation. The tar as it comes from the gasworks is allowed to rest in a
                    “pond” until the tar-water (solution chiefly of ammonia and certain ammonia
                    salts) has gone to the top. The tar proper is then pumped into a large
                    wrought-iron still (of upright-cylinder form preferably) and therein subjected
                    to distillation over a naked fire. A necessary preliminary, however, is the
                    removal of the unavoidable remnant of water, which is best effected by
                    cautiously heating the tar in the still so as to render it more fluid and enable
                    the water to rise to the top and then letting the upper stratum run out by an
                    overflow tap at the side. The distillation is then started. It involves the
                    formation of two sets of volatile products, namely—(1) combustible gases
                    (including sulphuretted hydrogen and bisulphide of carbon vapour), which must be
                    led away to avoid nuisance and danger of fire, and (2) a very complex liquid or
                    semi-liquid distillate. This latter is collected in successive fractions,
                    generally in this manner:—(1) as “first runnings,” what comes over at
                    temperatures below 105° to 110° C.; (2) as “light oils,” at temperatures between
                    110° and 210° C.; (3) as “carbolic oil,” at temperatures between 210° to 240°
                    C.; (4) as</p>
                <p>“creosote oil,” at temperatures between 240° to 270° C.; (5) as anthracene oil,
                    at temperatures above 270°.</p>
                <p>In the earlier part of the “first runnings” and light-oil period the condenser
                    must be kept cold; towards the end it must be kept warm to prevent choking by
                    solidified naphthalene. In practice, the operator does not go entirely by the
                    boiling point, but to a great extent by the specific gravity of the distillate,
                    which, in general, increases as the boiling point rises. As soon as a drop of
                    the last runnings floats in water (exhibits the specific gravity 1), the “light
                    oil” is supposed to be over. That the fractionation is not always and everywhere
                    effected in the same way needs hardly be said. If the manufacture of carbolic
                    acid is aimed at, it is best (according to Lunge) to select the fraction 170° to
                    230° C. for this purpose. Naphthalene boils as high as 217°, yet a deal goes
                    into this carbolic-acid fraction. As soon as naphthalene begins to crystallize
                    out largely (on cooling down a sample of distillate), the carbolic acid may be
                    presumed to be over. What follows next is put aside as creosote oil, until,
                    after the disappearance of the naphthalene, a new solid product, namely,
                    anthracene, begins to show itself. With any tar that contains a remunerative
                    proportion of anthracene, the anthracene oil is the most valuable of the
                    products, as the raw material for the making of artificial alizarins.</p>
                <p>Supposing the anthracene to have been extracted as completely as practicable, the
                    residue in the still consists of “hard pitch,” a viscid black fluid which on
                    cooling freezes into a fragile solid. In former times more commonly than now
                    “soft pitch’’used to be produced by leaving more or less of the anthracene oil
                    and even creosote oil in the still. At the end of the anthracene stage of the
                    distillation it is as well, if not necessary, to help the very high boiling
                    vapour out of the still by means of superheated steam, and to keep the worm at
                    100° C. to prevent choking. At a German establishment a vacuum is used with
                    great advantage.</p>
                <p>We come now to explain briefly how the several fractions are worked up.</p>
                <p>The pitch (which we assume to be “hard pitch ”) must be run off hot through a tap
                    at the bottom of the still and led into a low-roofed and well closed-in “house,”
                    because it would take fire in the open air. After it has cooled down
                    sufficiently in the “house,” the pitch is run into pitch-holes in front of the
                    house and allowed to freeze there. The depth of pitch in a hole is about 12
                    inches. The solid pitch is hacked out with pickaxes and sent into commerce. A
                    superior apparatus for the recovery of the pitch, which precludes all danger of
                    conflagration and many inconveniences of the ordinary system, has been devised
                    for the Paris gas-works by Régnault. <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> Lunge found,
                    from many distillations, that tar from the midland counties yields about 55 per
                    cent, of hard pitch.</p>
                <p>Hard pitch is used chiefly for making the following. (1) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asphalt.—</hi> The pitch is fused up—perhaps in the still which produced
                    it—with the requisite proportion of creosote and anthracene oil, previously
                    freed from their valuable components. Such asphalt is used for street-paving,
                    t.e., filling up the spaces between the paving-s*tones, and, in admixture with
                    sand and generally more or less of natural asphalt, for the making of footpaths
                    and floorings generally. In Germany it serves for the making of pipes for
                    conveying acid liquids in works and chemical laboratories, &amp;c. Endless
                    hemp-paper is soaked in liquefied asphalt and wound spirally around an iron
                    core, previously smeared over with soft soap, in about 100 layers. The whole is
                    then exposed to strong pressure while still hot, and is separated from the core
                    after being allowed to cool. Such pipes stand almost any kind of acid, but they
                    must not be used for hot liquids. (2) <hi rend="italic">Varnishes.—</hi> The
                    pitch is dissolved in suitable tar oils,—creosote oil for a lower and light oil
                    for a higher quality. (3) <hi rend="italic">Coke.—</hi> In former times more
                    frequently than now pitch was made into coke by transferring it to a special
                    flat still and distilling as long as any volatile products came off. The coke
                    which remains is a very pure and consequently valuable fuel. (4) <hi
                    rend="italic">Lamp Black</hi> (as a last resource, if no other mode of
                    utilization is practicable).—The pitch is subjected to partial combustion on hot
                    iron plates and the smoke conveyed into chambers to deposit its carbon. The
                    yield is about 40 per cent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anthracene Oil.—</hi> The oil is allowed to stand cold for a
                    week or so until the anthracene has crystallized out as completely as possible.
                    The mother-liquor is then eliminated, the bulk by means of a filter-press, the
                    rest, at a higher than the ordinary temperature, by hydraulic pressure. The
                    crude product includes far more than half its weight of impurities—phenanthrene,
                    paraffin, naphthalene, &amp;c. To remove these as far as possible, the crude
                    anthracene is ground up and treated with petroleum spirit (boiling at 70° to
                    100° C. ) or coal tar naphtha (12(r to 190°), in which real anthracene is
                    relatively insoluble. The insoluble part is separated by filtering arrangements
                    and presses (so constructed as to avoid danger of fire), and at last sublimed,
                    more with the view of bringing it into a customary convenient form than with the
                    object of effecting further purification. Such final anthracene may contain 50
                    to 65 per cent, of pure substance. The only reliable method for <hi

                    respective principal quantities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Carbolic Oil.—</hi> Assuming this oil to have been collected

                    suitable proportion of caustic-soda ley (ascertained by an assay) in an iron
                    vessel at 40° to 50° C. Charles Lowe recom-' mends ley of l <hi

                    and the soda supersaturated by sulphuric acid. Crude carbolic acid rises to the
                    top as an oil, and is withdrawn to be sold as such or purified. See <hi

                    in the oil left after extraction of the carbolic acid by caustic soda and in the
                    more volatile fractions of the creosote oil. From these it separates out (not
                    completely), on standing, in crystals. These are collected, best in a
                    filter-press, and then subjected to hydraulic pressure to force out the rest of
                    the mother-liquor. The crude naphthalene thus obtained contains an impurity
                    which causes it to become red on standing in the air. To remove it, the crude
                    product is mixed with 5 to 10 per cent, of vitriol of at least 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7 sp. gr., at a moderate heat (addition of a little
                    binoxide of manganese is an improvement, Lunge); it is then washed, first with
                    water, then with dilute alkali, and lastly again with water, to be ultimately
                    distilled or sublimed. In the latter case it is obtained in the form of thin
                    colourless plates of great beauty. It fuses at 80° C. and boils at 217° C.
                    Naphthalene is used largely in the making of certain tar colours, such as

                    gas lamps.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">First Runnings and Light Oil.—</hi> These may be said to
                    include all the industrially valuable “benzols” (taking “benzol” as a generic
                    term for benzol or benzene itself and its higher homologues, C <hi

                    most cases does not aim at an actual separation of all the individual benzols
                    from one another, but at the production of certain benzol mixtures demanded by
                    the trade, the mode of working may assume a great variety of forms; yet the
                    first aim in all cases is the same, being the elimination of all the non-benzol
                    from the given oil or oils. For this purpose the light oil is, as a rule,
                    subjected to a preliminary fractionation over a naked fire to split it up into
                    fractions fit to be worked for (crude) benzol (C <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> H

                    respectively; the carbolic acid is extracted, and the creosote-oil part put
                    aside, and thus one or more mixtures of “benzols” are obtained.</p>
                <p>The first runnings contain the bulk of the benzene, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi>, and a little of its higher homologues,

                    acid, &amp;c. To remove these impurities as far as possible, the oil is
                    thoroughly agitated with concentrated oil of vitriol (which takes up the
                    impurities except the bisulphide of carbon), and the “dirty” acid allowed to
                    settle out. The acid is then withdrawn as neatly as possible, and the residual
                    oil washed, first with water, then with dilute caustic soda, and, lastly, again
                    with pure water. The washed oil then is subjected to a preliminary fractionation
                    by distillation over a naked flame in the “crude benzol still.”</p>
                <p>The’ several mixed benzols obtained are subjected finally to a further
                    fractionation in stills worked with steam, to be divided into mixed products
                    known by specific names in commerce. But these we cannot possibly consider here.
                    We will rather give an idea of the way in which the several chemical species
                    (benzene, toluene, &amp;c.) are being isolated in a state of approximate purity
                    to meet the demands of the tar-colour industry. To do so even for one named
                    component by means of ordinary stills would require an endless number of
                    fractional distillations. The work is very materially shortened if, as proposed
                    by Mansfield long ago, we combine the still with an inverted condenser
                    (still-head, dephlegmator), inserted between the still and the worm, and keep
                    that intermediate condenser at a suitable constant temperature, so that all the
                    less volatile part of the vapour is recondensed and sent back to the still. An
                    excellent apparatus of this kind was constructed and worked successfully by
                    Coupler. His apparatus consists of three parts, viz.:—(1) a still heated by
                    means of a coil of close steam pipes; (2) a columnar
                    rectifier—“colonnen-apparat” as the Germans call it,—which communicates with the
                    still, and which is divided into many compartments by horizontal septa so
                    contrived that the vapour in passing from a compartment to the next higher one
                    must bubble through the liquid condensed there from preceding vapour,—an
                    overflow pipe, trapped below by condensate, hindering accumulation of the liquid
                    in any compartment beyond a certain level; (3) a constant temperature
                    still-head, consisting of a succession of communicating ring-shaped tubes, which
                    are immersed in a bath of water or molten paraffin kept at a prescribed constant
                    temperature. Only the most volatile part of the vapour survives as such in the
                    columnar rectifier, the degree of its volatility depending, of course, other
                    things being equal, on the rate at which we distil. This most volatile part
                    suffers partial condensation at the prescribed temperature in the still-head;
                    the condensed parts are sent back to compartments of the “column” by pipes bent
                    into the shape of a U at the point where they join the “column,” so as to
                    prevent vapour from entering them. The uncondensed vapour goes to the worm, and
                    is condensed as usual.</p>
                <p>To prepare benzene, the still-head is kept at 60° to 70° C. At first a mixture of
                    low-boiling bodies and benzene goes over, which is rejected, but soon pure
                    benzol follows and continues until almost all this component has distilled over.
                    The benzol obtained boils between 80° and 82° C., and consequently is
                    practically pure. In order now to extract the toluene, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    7</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, we raise the temperature of the
                    still-head to 100° C. A small quantity of a mixture of benzene and toluene
                    follows, which is rejected. After it comes a continuous distillation of almost
                    pure toluene, boiling at 110° to 112° C. In a similar manner (relatively) pure
                    xylene, C <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi>, boiling
                    point 137° to 140°, and tri-methyl-benzene, C <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 12</hi>, boiling point 148° to 150°, can be extracted
                    successively; but the process becomes troublesome with anything above toluene on
                    account of the high temperatures involved for still and still-head. Coupler’s
                    apparatus is now superseded by other constructions, but they all work on the
                    same principle,—that of the Coffey still, as used for the rectifying of spirit
                    of wine.</p>
                <p>Pure benzene, toluene, and xylene are used largely for the manufacture of
