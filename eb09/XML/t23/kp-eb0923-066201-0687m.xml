                    order <hi rend="italic">Zingiberaceae.</hi> It is a native of southern Asia,
                    being cultivated on a large scale both on the mainland and in the islands of the
                    Indian Ocean. Turmeric has been used from a remote period both as a condiment
                    and as a dye stuff, and to a more limited extent as a medicine. In Europe it is
                    employed chiefly as a dye, also as an ingredient in curry powder and as a
                    chemical test for alkalies. The root is prepared by cleaning it and drying it in
                    an oven. There are several varieties (Madras, Bengal, Gopalpur, Java, China, and
                    Cochin turmeric), differing chiefly in size and colour and to a slight degree in
                    flavour. Some of these consist exclusively of the ovate central tubers,
                    technically known as “bulbs,” and others of the somewhat cylindrical lateral
                    tubers, which are distinguished in trade as “fingers.” Both are hard and tough,
                    but break with a short resinous or waxy fracture, which varies in tint from an
                    orange brown to a deep reddish brown.</p>
                <p>Turmeric has a characteristic odour and an aromatic taste. The aroma it owes to a
                    complex essential oil, which consists principally of an alcohol called <hi
                    rend="italic">turmerol</hi> (formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 19</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 28</hi> O), which differs from carvol in being unable to
                    combine with hydrogen sulphide; the other constituents of the oil have not been
                    determined. The colour is due to <hi rend="italic">curcumin</hi>, <hi

                    possesses the properties of an acid, forming red-brown salts with alkalies and
                    being precipitated from alkaline solutions by acids. When pure it forms yellow
                    crystals having a vanilla odour and exhibiting a fine blue colour in reflected
                    light. It is soluble in alcohol, in chloroform, and in alkaline solutions, but
                    only sparingly in water. Paper tinged with a tincture of turmeric exhibits on
                    the addition of an alkali a reddish brown tint, which becomes violet on drying.
                    This peculiarity was pointed out by Vogel in 1815, and since that date turmeric
                    has been utilized as a chemical test for detecting alkalinity. In India the drug
                    is considered to possess cordial and stomachic properties: a decoction made with
                    milk and sweetened is used as a remedy for colds. Externally it is employed in
                    skin diseases and in the form of a cooling lotion for relieving the pain of
                    conjunctivitis; the fumes of the burning tubers directed into the nostrils
                    relieve congestion in cases of coryza. The cultivation of turmeric is carried on
                    most successfully in light rich soil in well-watered districts. The plant is
                    easily propagated by offsets. An acre yields about 2000 lb. Turmeric is said to
                    grow in large quantities on the slopes of hills bordering the plains of the Beni
                    in Bolivia and also in Panama. Several species of <hi rend="italic">Curcuma</hi>
                    and of allied genera yield yellowish aromatic roots. In Sierra Leone a kind of
                    turmeric is obtained from a species of <hi rend="italic">Canna.</hi></p>
