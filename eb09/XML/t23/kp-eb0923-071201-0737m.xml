                    north to south is 46 miles and from east to west 60. The total area in 1881 was
                    806,658 acres or about 1260 square miles. The surface is for the most part
                    hilly, rising into mountains towards the north and south, but eastwards towards
                    Lough Neagh it declines into a level plain. Running along the north-eastern
                    boundary with Londonderry are the ridges of the Sperrin Mountains (Sawell 2236
                    feet and Meenard 2064 feet). Farther south there are a range of lower hills and
                    Mullaghearn, to the north of Omagh (1890 feet). South of Clogher a range of
                    hills (1265 feet) forms the boundary between Tyrone and Monaghan. On each side
                    of the Mourne river near Omagh rise the two picturesque hills Bessy Bell and
                    Mary Gray. The Foyle forms a small portion of the western boundary of the
                    county, and receives the Mourne, which flows northward by Omagh and Newtown
                    Stewart. The principal tributaries of the Mourne are the Derg, from Lough Derg,
                    and the Owen-killew, flowing westward from Fir Mountain. The Blackwater, which
                    is navigable by boats to Moy, rises near Five-Mile Town, and forms part of the
                    south-eastern boundary of the county with Monaghan and Armagh. With the
                    exception of Lough Neagh, bounding the county on the east, the lakes are small,
                    also few in number. Lough Fea is picturesquely situated in the north-west, and
                    there are several small lakes near Newtown Stewart. The Ulster Canal runs along
                    the southern boundary of the county from Lough Neagh to Caledon. The substratum
                    of the northern mountains is mica slate interspersed with primary limestone.
                    Yellow sandstone appears in the north-west, in the centre towards Omagh, and in
                    the south-west, where it plunges into Fermanagh. The greater portion of the
                    central area of the county is occupied by Old Red Sandstone. The Tyrone
                    coal-field (6 miles long by 1 to 2 broad) extends between Lough Neagh and
                    Dungannon, all the measures being represented. The coal-field is much broken by
                    faults and has been worked chiefly near the surface, and generally in an
                    unskilful manner; the principal pits are near Dungannon and at Coal Island. The
                    coal is bituminous. There are also indications of copper, iron, and lead.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The hilly portions of the county are
                    unsuitable for tillage; but in the lower districts the soil is remarkably
                    fertile, and agriculture is generally practised after improved methods, the
                    county in this respect being in advance of most parts of Ireland. The excellent
                    pasturage of the hilly districts affords sustenance to a large number of young
                    cattle. The total number of holdings in 1885 was 27,958, of which 16,469 or
                    nearly two-thirds were each between 5 and 30 acres in extent (8365 between 5 and
                    15 and 8104 between 15 and 30). Only 43 were above 500 acres; 642 were between
                    100 and 500 acres, 2373 between 50 and 100, 3937 between 30 and 50, 2573 between
                    1 and 5, and 1921 did not exceed 1 acre. There were 237,528 acres under crops,
                    including meadow and clover (255,281 acres in 1876), 318,550 acres under grass,
                    1765 fallow, 9378 woods, 72,071 bog and marsh, 109,539 barren mountain land, and
                    30,112 water, roads, fences, &amp;c. The area under com crops decreased between
                    1876 and 1885 from 115,738 acres to 105,343,— oats from 114,223 acres to
                    104,040, and wheat from 1166 to 1013. The areas under the other corn crops are
                    very small and fluctuate considerably. The area under green crops between 1876
                    and 1885 decreased from 64,971 to 59,387 acres,—potatoes from 44,001 to 40,649,
                    turnips from 17,157 to 15,581, mangel wurzel from 750 to 487, and other green
                    crops from 3063 to 2670. Flax (23,901 acres in 1876) covered 16,364 acres in
                    1885. The area under meadow and clover in 1876 was 50,671, and in 1885 56,434,
                    but there has been no increase since 1878. The number of horses decreased
                    between 1876 and 1885 from 25,038 to 23,185, of mules from 71 to 49, of asses
                    from 1124 to 921, of cattle from 176,841 to 168,072, of sheep from 45,274 to
                    44,434, and of pigs from 49,012 to 39,530. On the other hand, the number of
                    goats increased from 7950 to 8984, and of poultry from 674,826 to 737,859.</p>
                <p>According to the latest landowner’s <hi rend="italic">Return</hi> (1876), the
                    county was divided among 2787 proprietors owning 775,285 acres at a total annual
                    value of £426,224, the average value per acre being nearly <pb break="no"

                    acre each, the total distributed amongst them being 272 acres. The estimated
                    extent of waste land was 4000 acres. The following possessed over 10,000 acres
                    each—duke of Abercorn 47,615 acres, earl of Castlestuart 32,615, earl of Caledon
                    29,236, commissioners of church temporalities 28,002, Sir John Μ. Stewart
                    27,906, Arthur W. Cole Hamilton 16,683, representatives of Sir William M'Mahon
                    16,326, Sir William Verner 16,043, earl of Belmore 14,359, Thomas Arthur Hope
                    13,996, Lord Dorchester 12,608, Michael Smith 10,968, Louisa Elizabeth De Bille
                    10,455, and Thomas R. Browne 10,125.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Communication</hi>.—Besides Lough Neagh and the Ulster Canal,
                    Tyrone has the river Foyle, which is navigable for small craft to a point
                    opposite St Johnstone, and thence by artificial cutting to Strabane, and the
                    Blackwater, which is navigable for boats to Moy. The Great Northern Railway
                    intersects the county by Dungannon, Pomeroy, Omagh, Newtown Stewart, and
                    Strabane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The manufacture of linens and coarse
                    woollens (including blankets) is carried on. Brown earthenware, chemicals,
                    whisky, soap, and candles are also made. There are a few breweries and
                    distilleries, and several flour and meal mills. But for the lack of enterprise
                    the coal and iron might aid in the development of a considerable manufacturing
                    industry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county comprises 8
                    baronies, 46 parishes, and 2164 townlands. Formerly it returned two members to
                    parliament, the borough of Dungannon also returning one; but in 1885 Dungannon
                    was disfranchised and the county arranged in four divisions—east, mid, north,
                    and south—each returning one member. It is in the north-western circuit, and
                    assizes are held at Omagh and quarter-sessions at Clogher, Dungannon, Omagh, and
                    Strabane. There are fourteen petty sessions districts within the county and
                    portions of four others. The county is in the Belfast military district.</p>
                <p>From 312,956 in 1841 the population had decreased by 1861 to 238,500, by 1871 to
                    215,766, and by 1881 to 197,719 (96,466 males and 101,253 females). In 1881
                    there were 109,793 Roman Catholics (119,937 in 1871), 44,256 Protestant
                    Episcopalians (49,201 in 1871), 38,564 Presbyterians (42,156 in 1871), 3597
                    Methodists (3115 in 1871), and 1509 of other denominations (1357 in 1871). The
                    number of persons in the county who could read and write in 1881 was 98,764, who
                    could read only 38,783, the remainder (60,172) being wholly illiterate.
                    Twenty-two persons could speak Irish only and 9796 Irish and English. For the
                    seven years ending 1885 the average number of emigrants annually was 3085. The
                    population of the principal towns in 1881 was—Strabane 4196, Omagh (the county
                    town) 4138, Dungannon 4084, and Cookstown 3870.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Anciently Tyrone was included in
                    the portion of Ulster made “sword-land” by the Scots. It became a principality
                    of one of the sons of Niall of the Nine Hostages, and from his name—Eogain—was
                    called Tir Eogain, gradually altered to Tyrone. From Eogain were descended the
                    O’Neals or O’Neills and their numerous septs. The family had their chief seat at
                    Dungannon until the reign of Elizabeth, when it was burned by Hugh O’Neill to
                    prevent it falling into the hands of Lord Mountjoy. The earldom of Tyrone had
                    been conferred on Con Bacagh O’Neill by Henry VIII., but he was driven into the
                    Pale by one of his sons Shan, who with the general consent of the people was
                    then proclaimed chief. From this time he maintained a contest with English
                    authority, but his last remaining forces were completely defeated near the river
                    Foyle in May 1567. During the insurrection of 1641 Charlemont Fort and Dungannon
                    were captured by Sir Phelim O’Neill, and in 1645 the Parliamentary forces under
                    General Munro were signally defeated by Owen Roe O’Neill at Benburb. At the
                    Revolution the county was for a long time in the possession of the forces of
                    James II. Dungannon was the scene of the famous volunteer convention in 1782.
                    Raths are scattered over every district of the county. There is a large cromlech
                    near Newtown Stewart, another at Tarnlaght near Coagh, and another a mile above
                    Castlederg. At Kilmeillie near Dungannon are two circles of stones. The monastic
                    remains are of comparatively little interest. There are still some ruins of the
                    ancient castle of the O’Neills, near Benburb, and among other ruined old castles
                    mention may be made of those of Newtown Stewart, Dungannon, Strabane, and
                    Ballygawley.</p>
