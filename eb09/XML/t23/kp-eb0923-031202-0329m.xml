                    Scotland. The father determined that his son should follow the ancestral
                    profession, and, greatly against his natural bent,—for all his thoughts turned
                    instinctively towards art,—he acceded to the parental wish. He studied in the
                    university of Edinburgh; and, residing with his elder brother, Thomas Thomson,
                    afterwards celebrated as an antiquarian and feudal lawyer, he made the
                    acquaintance of Francis Jeffrey and other young members of the Scottish bar
                    afterwards notable. The pursuit of art, however, -was not abandoned; during the
                    recess he sketched in the country, and, while attending his final college
                    session, he studied for a month under Alexander Nasmyth. After his father’s
                    death he became, in 1800, his successor as minister of Dailly; and in 1805 he
                    was translated to the parish of Duddingston, close to Edinburgh. The practice of
                    art was now actively resumed, and it came to be continued throughout
                    life—apparently without any very great detriment to pastoral duties. Thomson’s
                    popularity as a painter increased with his increasing artistic skill; and,
                    having mastered his initial scruples against receiving artistic fees, on being
                    offered £15 for a landscape—reassured by “Grecian” Williams’s stout assertion
                    that the work was “worth thrice the amount ”—the minister of Duddingston began
                    to dispose of the productions of his brush in the usual manner. Tn 1830 he was
                    made an honorary member of the Royal Scottish Academy. Besides that of art,
                    Thomson had other singularly varied tastes and aptitudes. He was an accomplished
                    performer on violin and flute, an exact and well-read student of physical
                    science, and one of the writers on optics in the early numbers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review.</hi> His life passed peacefully away in the
                    kindly and charitable discharge of his clerical duties, varied by the
                    enthusiastic pursuit of his art, and the enjoyment of intercourse with a
                    singularly <pb break="no"

                    artists, included Turner and Wilkie, and among men of letters Wilson and
                    Scott,—the latter of whom desired that Thomson, instead of Turner, should have
                    illustrated the collected edition of his w orks. He died at Duddingston on the
                    27th of October 1840 (not the 20th, as stated by some authorities). Thomson was
                    twice married, and his second wife, the widow of Mr Dalrymple of Cleland, was
                    herself also a skilful amateur artist.</p>
                <p>Thomson holds an honourable position as the first powerful landscapist that
                    Scotland produced, and he is still among her greatest. His style was founded, in
                    the first instance, upon the practice of the Dutch masters; but ultimately he
                    submitted to the influence of the Poussins and the Italians, rightly believing
                    that their method—in the richer solemnity of its colour and the deeper gravity
                    of its chiaroscuro—was more truly fitted for the portrayal of the scenery of
                    Scotland, more in harmony with the gloom and the glory of its mountains and its
                    glens and the passion of its wave-vexed cliffs. But to the study of the art of
                    the past he joined a close and constant reference to nature which kept his own
                    work fresh and original, though, of course, he never even approached such
                    scientific accuracy in the rendering of natural form and effect as is expected
                    from even the tyro in our recent schools of landscape. His art is clearly
                    distinguished by “style”; at their best, his works show skilful selection in the
                    leading lines of their composition and admirable qualities of abstract colour
                    and tone. Tlîomson is fairly represented in the Scottish National Gallery; and
                    the Aberlady Bay of that collection, with the soft infinity of its clouded grey
                    sky, and its sea which leaps and falls again in waves of sparkling and of
                    shadowed silver, is fit to rank among the triumphs of Scottish art.</p>
