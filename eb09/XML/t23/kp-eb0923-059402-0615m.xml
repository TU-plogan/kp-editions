                    the literal rendering in 1747, by the anonymous English translator of De la
                    Condamine’s travels in South America (p. 87), of that writer’s “Oiseau
                    trompette” (<hi rend="italic">Mem. de l'Acad. des Sciences,</hi> 1745, p. 473),
                    which he says was called “Trompetero” by the Spaniards of Maynas on the upper
                    Amazons, from the peculiar sound it utters. He added that it was the “Agami” of
                    the inhabitants of Para and Cayenne,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Not to be confounded with the “Heron Agami” of Buffon <hi
                    rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> vii. p. 382), which is the <hi rend="italic">Ardea
                    agami</hi> of other writers.</p></note> wherein he was not wholly accurate,
                    since those birds are specifically distinct, though, as they are generically
                    united, the statement may pass. But he was also wrong, as had been Barrere (<hi
                    rend="italic">France Equinoxiale,</hi> p. 132) in 1741, in identifying the
                    “Agami” with the “Macucagua” of Marcgrave, for that is a <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tinamou (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi>; and both still more wrongly
                    accounted for the origin of the peculiar sound just mentioned, whereby Barrere
                    was soon after led (<hi rend="italic">Ornith. Spec. Novum,</hi> pp. 62, 63) to
                    apply to the bird the generic and vulgar names of <hi rend="italic">Psophia</hi>
                    and “Petteuse,” the former of which, being unfortunately adopted by Linnaeus,
                    has ever since been used, though in 1766 and 1767 Pallas (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Miscellanea,</hi> p. 67, and <hi rend="italic">Spicilegia,</hi> iv. p. 6), and
                    in 1768 Vosmaer <hi rend="italic">(Descr. du Trompette Américain,</hi> p. 5),

                    writers the name “Trumpeter” was carried on by Latham and others so as to be
                    generally accepted, though an author may occasionally be found willing to resort
                    to the native “Agami,” which is that almost always used by the French.</p>
                <p>Messrs Sclater and Salvin in their <hi rend="italic">Nomenclator</hi> (p. 141)
                    admit 6 species of Trumpet-Birds—(1) the original <hi rend="italic">Psophia
                    crepitans</hi> of Guiana; (2) <hi rend="italic">P. napensis</hi> of eastern
                    Ecuador (which is very likely the original “Oiseau trompette” of De la
                    Condamine); (3) <hi rend="italic">P. ochroptera</hi> from the right bank of the
                    Rio Negro; (4) <hi rend="italic">P. leucοptera</hi> from the right bank of the
                    upper Amazons; (5) <hi rend="italic">P. viridis</hi> from the right bank of the
                    Madeira; and (6) <hi rend="italic">P. obscura</hi> from the right bank of the
                    lower Amazons near Para. And they have remarked in the Zoological <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> (1867, p. 592) on the curious fact that the range
                    of the several species appears to be separated by rivers, a statement confirmed
                    by Mr Wallace (<hi rend="italic">Geogr. Distr. Animals,</hi> ii. p. 358); and in
                    connexion therewith it may be observed that these birds have short wings and
                    seldom fly, but run, though with a peculiar gait, very quickly. A seventh
                    species, <hi rend="italic">P. cantatrix,</hi> from Bolivia, has since been
                    indicated by Prof. W. Blasius (<hi rend="italic">Jοurn. f. Ornith.,</hi> 1884,
                    ρp. 203-210), who has given a monographic summary of the whole group very worthy
                    of attention. The chief distinctions between the species lie in colour and size,
                    and it will be here enough to describe briefly the best known of them, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. crepitans.</hi> This is about the size of a large barndoor
                    Fowl; but its neck and legs are longer, so that it is a taller bird. The head
                    and neck are clothed with short velvety feathers; the whole plumage is black,
                    except that on the lower front of the neck the feathers are tipped with golden
                    green, changing according to the light into violet, and that a patch of dull
                    rusty brown extends across the middle of the back and wing-coverts, passing into
                    ash-colour lower down, where they bang over and conceal the tail. The legs are
                    bright pea-green. The habits of this bird are very wonderful, and it is much to
                    be wished that fuller accounts of them had appeared. The curious sound it
                    utters, noticed by the earliest observers, has been already mentioned, and by
                    them also was its singularly social disposition towards man described; but the
                    information supplied to Buffon (<hi rend="italic">Oiseaux,</hi> iv. pp. 496-501)
                    by Manoncour and De la Borde, which has been repeated in many works, is still
                    the best we have of the curious way in which it becomes semi-domesticated by the
                    Indians and colonists and shows strong affection for its owners as well as for
                    their living property—poultry or sheep — though in this reclaimed condition it
                    seems never to breed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    connexion herewith may be mentioned the singular story told by Montagu (<hi

                    authority of the then Lord Stanley, afterwards president of the Zoological
                    Society, of one of these birds, which, having apparently escaped from
                    confinement, formed the habit of attending a poultryyard. On the occasion of a
                    pack of hounds running through the yard, the Trumpeter joined and kept up with
                    them for nearly three miles!</p></note> Indeed nothing can be positively
                    asserted as to its mode of nidification; but its eggs, according to Mr E.
                    Bartlett, are of a creamy white, rather round, and about the size of Bantams’.

                    speaks of falling in with flocks of 200 or 300 “Waracabas,” as he called them,
                    in Demerara, but added nothing to our knowledge of the species; while the
                    contributions of Trail (<hi rend="italic">Mem</hi>. <hi rend="italic">Wem.

                    would have hardly failed to notice the curious arrangement of the trachea in

                    immediately under the skin to within about an inch of the anus, whence it
                    returns in a similar way to the front of the sternum, and then enters the
                    thorax. Analogous instances of this formation occur in several other groups of
