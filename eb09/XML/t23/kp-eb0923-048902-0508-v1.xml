                <p><label type="entry">TOURNEBOUT</label>, a wind instrument of wood, in which a
                    cylindrical column of air is set in vibration by a reed. The lower extremity is
                    turned up in a half circle, and from this peculiarity it has gained the French
                    names <hi rend="italic">tournebout</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cromorne,-</hi>
                    —the latter a corruption of the German name <hi rend="italic">Krummhorn.</hi>
                    There appears to be no English equivalent. The reed of the tournebout, like that
                    of the bassoon, is formed by two tongues of cane, adapted to the small end of a
                    conical brass tube, the large end being inserted in the body of the instrument.
                    It presents, however, this difference, that it is not, like that of the bassoon,
                    in contact with the player’s mouth, but is covered again by a cap pierced with a
                    hole in the upper part, through which opening the air is introduced which sets
                    the reed in vibration, the reed being therefore subject to no pressure of the
                    lips. The compass of the instrument is naturally limited to the simple
                    fundamental sounds which the successive opening of the lateral holes gives rise
                    to. The tournebouts have not much length for the deep sounds they produce, which
                    arises from these instruments sounding, like all tubes of cylindrical bore
                    provided with reeds, the same as the stopped pipes of an organ. That is to say,
                    theoretically <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0509-0490"/> they require only half the lengths necessary
                    for the open pipes of an organ, or for conical tubes provided with reeds, to
                    produce notes of the same pitch. Moreover, when, to obtain a harmonic, the
                    column of air is divided, the tournebout will not give the octave like the oboe
                    and bassoon, but the twelfth, corresponding in this peculiarity with the
                    clarinet and all stopped pipes or bourdons. With the ordinary boring of eight
                    lateral holes, the tournebout possesses a limited scale embracing a ninth
                    Sometimes, however, the deeper sounds are completed by the addition of one or
                    more keys. By its structure the tournebout is one of the oldest wind
                    instruments; it is evidently derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">aulos</hi>
                    and the Roman <hi rend="italic">tibia,</hi> which consisted equally of a simple
                    cylindrical pipe of which the column of air was set in vibration by a double
                    reed.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the successive improvements that were introduced in the
                    manufacture of wind instruments, the tournebout scarcely ever varied in the
                    details of its construction. Such as we see it represented in the treatise by
                        Virdung<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Musica getutscht und auszgezogen,</hi> Basel,
                            1511.</p></note> we find it again about the epoch of its disappearance,
                    in <hi rend="italic">L’Art du Faiseur d’Instruments de l'Encyclopédie de Diderot

                <p>The tournebouts existed as a complete family from the 15th century. According to
                    Virdung, it was formed of four individual instruments; Praetorius<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"
                                >Organographia,</hi> Wolfenbüttel, 1618.</p></note> cites five,—the
                    deep bass, the bass, the tenor or alto, the cantus or soprano, and the high
                    soprano, with compass respectively of</p>
                <p>A band, or, to use the expression of Praetorius, an “accort,” of tournebouts
                    comprehended—1 deep bass, 2 bass, 3 alto-tenor, 2 cantus (soprano), 1 high
                    soprano = 9.</p>
                <p>The tournebouts were not always an orchestra by themselves; they allied
                    themselves also to other instruments, and notably to flutes and oboes. It was
                    thus that the little groups of musicians in the service of princes, or those
                    engaged by some large town on the occasion of a festival or public ceremony,
                    were composed of several tournebout players combined with some flautists and
                    oboe players. In 1685 the orchestra of the Neue Kirche at Strasburg comprised
                    two tournebouts, and until the middle of the last century these instruments
                    formed part of the music called “la grande ecurie” in the service of the French
                    kings. Tournebouts have in our days become of extreme rarity, and scarcely exist
                    in collections. The museum of the Conservatoire Royal de Musique at Brussels has
                    the good fortune to possess a complete family, which is regarded as having
                    belonged to the duke of Ferrara, Alphonso II. d’Este, a prince who reigned from
                    1559 to 1597. The soprano (cantus or discant) has the same compass as above,
                    while the alto, the tenor (furnished with a key), and bass have an extent
                    respectively of</p>
                <p>The bass (see accompanying figure), besides having two keys, is distinguished
                    from the others by a kind of small bolt, two of which slide in grooves and close
                    the two holes that form the lowest notes of the instrument. It is very curious
                    to observe that the employment of these bolts, placed at the extremity of the
                    tournebout and out of reach of the fingers of the instrumentalist, forces him to
                    require the assistance of a person whose sole mission is to attend to these
                    bolts during the performance.</p>
                <p>The “Platerspil” of which Virdung gives a drawing is only a kind of tournebout.
                    It presents especially the peculiarity that, instead of having a cap to cover
                    over the reed, there is a spherical receiver surrounding the reed, to which the
                    tube for insufflation is adapted. This receiver was of wood worked round, or
                    perhaps consisted of a simple gourd. (V. M.)</p>
