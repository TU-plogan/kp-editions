                    from the Chinese frontier to 60° N. lat., is bounded by Tobolsk on the N.W., by
                    Yeniseisk on the N.E., by the Chinese province of Khobdo on the S.E., and by
                    Semipalatinsk on the S.W. Its area, 329,040 square miles, is fully one and a
                    half times that of France. The surface is most varied, including in the
                    south-east the high alpine tracts of the Altai Mountains, with an elevated
                    steppe which skirts these, and in the north-west and west the lowlands of the
                    Irtish and the marshy tracts of the Ob.</p>
                <p>The Altai Mountains, which cover within the limits of the Russian empire an area

                    although visited by many geologists, still remain very imperfectly known, even
                    as regards their orography. The country has been mapped only along the rivers
                    and the course of a few footpaths, and great confusion still prevails with
                    reference to the directions of the different chains of the Altai and their

                    same leading orographical features that are seen in the Tian-Shan Mountains
                    farther south, and in the West Sayan range farther north. A plateau with an
                    average altitude of more than 4000 feet, watered by the tributaries of the upper
                    Yenisei, all flowing in open valleys 3000 to 4000 feet above the sea, is known
                    to rise in that part of north-western Mongolia which is drained by the upper
                    Yenisei and Selenga. The surface of this plateau is diversified by ridges, and
                    by depressions like that of the Ubsa-nor—a relic of what was formerly a much
                    larger lake. A lofty mountain chain, which has its south-east foot on the
                    plateau and its north-west foot in the valley of the Us, fringes the plateau,
                    and has all the characters of a border-ridge. The present writer has proposed to
                    call this Erghik-shan. It runs from north-east to south-west along the
                    Russo-Chinese frontier, and is pierced by a deep gorge through which flows the
                    Yenisei. A belt, some 200 miles in width, of alpine tracts, made up of three or
                    four chains parallel to the border ridge, fringes the outer border of the
                    plateau, and fills up the Minusinsk region. The structure of the hilly tracts
                    (watered by the Kemtchik) between the Yenisei and the Altai remains quite
                    unknown, no scientific man or topographer having ever visited it. But the very
                    same orographical features as those already described reappear in the Altai
                    region. There is now no doubt that the backbone of the Altai is a huge and lofty
                    border-ridge, the Sailughem, which includes the small alpine plateaus of Ukek,
                    the upper Tchuya, and Juvlu-kul, and runs from south-west to north-east, being a
                    continuation of the border-ridge of the West Sayan. Its flat dome-shaped summits
                    rise to about 10,000 feet, and the small alpine plateaus just named range from
                    7800 to 8200 feet in elevation. It has a very steep slope towards the northwest,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> towards the broad valleys of the upper Bukh-tarma
                    and Tchuya, and a very gentle slope towards the south-east, and its
                    south-eastern hillfoots are on the level of the plateau of Khobdo (from 4500 to
                    5000 feet). A broad alpine region spreads to the north-west of the borderridge,
                    but in the imperfect state of our knowledge it is <pb break="no"

                    its chains. Nevertheless, another lofty chain, containing the snow-clad Alps of
                    the Katuñ (Katunskiye Byetki) and those of the Tchuya, and running also from
                    south-west to north-east, parallel to the Sailughem border-ridge, can be
                    distinguished in the labyrinth of confusedly scattered mountains seen on our
                    present maps. It is one of the most picturesque chains of the region, and
                    contains the Byelukha peak, estimated at 11,000 feet, and the Alas-tu, of nearly
                    the same height. It is pierced, however, by so many rivers, which rise on the
                    north-west edge of the plateau, and find their way to the lowlands by a series
                    of gorges, that its continuity could be easily overlooked. Farther to the
                    north-east it joins, in the opinion of the present writer, the high chain on the
                    left bank of the Kemtchik, which is continued by the picturesque Alps on the
                    northern bank of the Us. A third system of mountain chains, also parallel to the
                    above, can be distinguished in the succession of the Terektinsk Mountains, those
                    which are pierced by the Tchulyshman and those which follow the right bank of
                    the Abakan; while traces of a fourth plication of the rocks may be discovered in
                    the Tigeritsk Mountains, those pierced by the Biya below Lake Teletskoye, and
                    the Kuznetskiy A1atau, on the left bank of the Abakan. A number of smaller, much
                    lower, and shorter chains faintly appear as outer walls of this extensive alpine
                    region. As for the Great Altai, or Altain-Nauru, our knowledge of which has been
                    greatly increased by the recent explorations of Μ. Potanin,<note anchored="true"

                    Khobdo plateau, with its steep slope facing towards the wide Dzungarian
                    depression, or rather to the broad trench of the Ulungur. Its direction is
                    nearly at right angles to the above, running from northwest to south-east, like
                    the Tarbagatai Mountains (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Turkestan),</hi> and it is
                    continued farther to the south-east by the Irdyn-ula and Artsa-bogdo Mountains,
                    which separate the eastern Gobi from the Tarim depression. It is most probable
                    that upheavals, having the same northwestern direction (which, according to Μ.
                    Mushketoff, are in Central Asia more recent than the north-eastern ones), have
                    to a certain extent modified the old north-eastern chains of the Altai, and
                    complicated the chains of its alpine region. If so, the structure of the Altai
                    would be very similar to that of the Turkestan mountains. A chain having a
                    north-western direction—the Salair Mountains— shoots off from the main ranges of
                    the Altai, between the Tom and the Tchumysh; it is about 170 miles in length,
                    with a width of nearly 60 miles, and contains the best silver-mines of the
                    region, as also several gold-washings. Its upheaval belongs to a more recent
                    epoch than that of the Sailughem ridge, and (like the mountains of Turkestan,
                    having a north-west direction) it is due to dioritic rocks. In the Kuznetsk
                    depression it is covered with deposits of the Lower and Upper Carboniferous,
                    containing beds of coal. The Kuznetskiy Aiatau, in which Humboldt saw one of his
                    meridional upheavals, consists of a series of ridges running south-west to
                    north-east, with further continuations within South Yeniseisk.<note

                <p>The alpine region of the Altai is most picturesque; most of its chains, rising
                    oveι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8000 and 9000 feet, are snowclad, and a
                    great glacier descends from the hollows under the Byelukha peak; several other
                    less known glaciers occur in the different “byeikis” (snowclad chains). A thick
                    forest vegetation clothes the mountain slopes, while beautiful valleys, often of
                    great length, such as that of the Bukhtarma (180 miles) or that of the Uimon and
                    Koksu, offer on their fertile and well-sheltered floors most favourable
                    conditions for agriculture. Several lakes are met with, some, like the Juvlu·kul
                    and Kendykty-kul on the small alpine plateaus, at heights where only the dwarf
                    birch grows and the polar marmot takes up its abode.</p>
                <p>while two others, Lakes Kotyvanskoye and Teletskoye, respectively 1170 and 1600
                    feet above the sea, from their position amidst steep and picturesque mountains,
                    recall those of Geneva and Lucerne.</p>
                <p>The Altai flora is very rich. Although the European flora (including the beech)
                    which clothed the Altai at a recent period has disappeared, and the Siberian
                    flora invades its hillfoots from the north-west, while the steppe flora is
                    advancing from the south, still in a zone ranging from 1000 to 6000 feet above
                    the sea the botanist has to admire a flora rich in bright flowers, tall grasses,
                    and shrubs, several of which are now common ornamental plants in European
                    gardens; and the zoologist discovers in the Altai the meeting-place of the
                    northern fauna (including the reindeer) with that of the high Central-Asian
                    plateau (including the tiger and the two-humped camel of Bactriana).</p>
                <p>A strip of elevated plains or grassy steppes, also about 200 miles in breadth,
                    girdles the ajpine region upon the north-west. Its outer border can be roughly
                    indicated by a line running north-east from Lake Gorkoye to Tomsk. They have an
                    average altitude of from 700 to 1000 feet above the sea, and are covered with a
                    luxuriant grass vegetation; the conditions for agriculture are excellent, and
                    Russian villages are rapidly springing up. The south-west portion is known as
                    the Kumandinsk steppe. An innumerable succession of small lakes—rivers in the
                    process of formation—cover this steppe, where we have a system of parallel
                    undulations, resulting in tributaries of the Ob, all flowing north-eastward with
                    remarkable regularity.</p>
                <p>Beyond the high plains, that is, all over north-western Tomsk, are the lowlands,
                    which may be subdivided into two portions,—the Baraba steppe in the south-west
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tobolsk),</hi> and the marshy region of the Ob (the
                    Vasyugan and Narym regions). The latter is one boundless marsh, a few
                    settlements of native hunters occurring only along the rivers. The interior is
                    for the most part inaccessible alike to boats and to human feet. Low hills, or
                    rather swellings, intersect it, but even the highest points, barely 200 or 300
                    feet above the sea, are covered with marshy forests. The forests themselves grow
                    on marshy ground; but where the trees disappear one sees for hundreds of miles
                    nothing but green flowery carpets, which, when trodden on, treacherously yield
                    under the unwary traveller. Similar in character must have been the marshes in
                    which the Siberian mammoths and rhinoceroses of the Quaternary epoch found their
                    graves. Only the light and broad-hoofed reindeer, but not the elk, can cross
                    them. This inhospitable region is inhabited only by Ostiaks, who have been
                    driven into it by stress of circumstances, and support themselves partly by
                    fishing and partly by hunting.</p>
                <p>The Sailughem ridge, and the high Khobdo plateau as well, consist of granites,
                    syenites, porphyries covered only with the oldest metamorphic slates belonging
                    to the Archaic formation (Huronian and Laurentian). The structure of the outer
                    chains of the Altai is more complicated. Their backbone is also composed of
                    granites, porphyries, and porphyrites covered with metamorphic slates which are
                    intersected by layers of crystalline limestones, breccias, and veins of
                    jade.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Prof. Mushketoff
                    in <hi rend="italic">Picturesque Russia,</hi> vol. xi.</p></note> Diorites,
                    diabases, augitic porphyries, and hyper-sthenites also appear, but they are of a
                    more recent origin. Silurian clay-slates are widely spread in the southern
                    Altai. Devonian slates and limestones are also developed in the southern Altai,
                    and the metalliferous deposits of Zmeinogorsk, Petrovsk, Riddersk, &amp;c.,
                    belong to that age. Carboniferous dolomitic limestones and slates are widely
                    spread both in the southern and northern Altai. After the Carboniferous epoch
                    the southern Altai was not again submerged, while the northern Altai was covered
                    by the Jurassic sea, and has thick Jurassic deposits containing a copious fossil
                    flora and rich beds of coal. Basaltic eruptions, dating from the Jurassic
                    period, have been found in the Salair Mountains. Thick diluvial deposits cover
                    the whole area, and in many valleys are traces of immense former glaciers; in
                    fact, the whole of the Sailughem ridge must at one time have been clothed with
                    an ice-cap.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Potanin,

                <p>The southern Altai is rich in silver, copper, lead, and zinc; while in the Atatau
                    are concealed its chief auriferous alluvial (or diluvial) deposits, iron-ores,
                    and coal-seams. The mineral wealth of the Altai is really immense, but only a

                    obtained. In the same year only 3000 cwts. of iron were manufactured, and that
                    metal is still imported from the Urals. The jade, beautiful porphyries, and the
                    like of the district, which are cut into works of art at the crown works of
                    Kotyvañ, are well known through the urns and vases shown at the St Petersburg
                    Hermitage. The mineral waters of the Altai are of high quality.</p>
                <p>Tomsk is watered mainly by the Ob and its tributaries, only its south-east corner
                    draining into the Abakan, a tributary of the Yenisei. The Ob, formed by the
                    union of the Biya and Katuñ, has λvithin the government a course of more than
                    800 miles, and is navigated as far as Barnaut and Biysk. Its tributaries, the
                    Tom (450 miles), the Vasyugan (530 miles), the Ket (230 miles), and the Tym (200
                    miles), are all navigable. The Tchutym and the Tchumysh are also great rivers.
                    Of tributaries of the Irtish, the Bukhtarma, the Om, the Uba, and the Tara are
                    worthy of notice. As many as 1500 lakes have been counted on the maps, but this
                    number is exceeded by the reality. Some of them are alpine; others dot the
                    steppes or the marshy tracts. Lake Tchany, notwithstanding its rapid
                    desiccation, still covers 1265 square miles. Many brackish lakes, Kutundinsk,
                    Kutchuk, &amp;c., attain a great size, and some small salt lakes yield about
                    100,000 cwts. of salt.</p>
                <p>The climate is very severe, and has, moreover, the disadvantage of being very wet
                    in the north-west. The average yearly temperatures at Tomsk, Kainsk, and Barnaut
                    are 30° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2, 31°, and 32°'7 (January, 4°, -6°'2,
                    and 3°'7; July, 65°'5, 68° ’ 5, and 62° ’ 2). The Altai steppes, enjoying a much
                    drier climate than the lowlands, are covered with a beautiful vegetation, and in
                    the sheltered valleys corn is grown to heights of 3400 and 4250 feet.</p>
                <p>The population, which is rapidly increasing, in 1882 reached 1,134,750. The
                    Russians are in a large majority, the indigenous inhabitants numbering in 1879
                    only 63,600, or 6'6 per cent, of the aggregate population. They include 23,600
                    Altaian Tartars, 5730 Teleutes, 17,020 Mountain Kalmucks (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tartars),</hi> 10,000 Tomsk Tartars, 2920 Samoyedes, and 4210
                    Ostiaks. The prevailing religion is Greek-Orthodox, but there are also some
                    50,000 Nonconformists, 7320 Catholics, 2600 Jews, 10,700 Mohammedans, and about
                    28,000 pagans.</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the prevailing occupation. It is most productive on the elevated
                    plains of Tomsk, Mariinsk, Barnaut, Kuznetsk, and Biysk. Cattle-breeding is much
                    developed, especially in the Kutundinsk steppe; and bee-keeping is an important
                    source of wealth. Fishing and hunting are extensively carried on in the forest
                    region. Mining occupies several thousands of men in the Altai. Manufactures are
                    insignificant, the aggregate production —chiefly from distilleries and
                    tanneries—hardly amounting to £250,000. Trade is actively carried on at Tomsk
                    and Barnaut, which are two great centres for the export and import trade of
                    Siberia with Russia. The Biysk merchants carry on exchange trade with Mongolia
                    and China. There are eight gymnasia (696 boys and 569 girls in 1883) and 225
                    primary schools (5680 boys, 1730 girls). The government is divided into six
                    districts, the chief towns of which (with populations in 1884) are Tomsk
                    (31,380), Barnaut (17,180), Biysk (18,960), Kainsk (4050), Kuznetsk (7310), and
                    Mariinsk (13,090). Narym (1600) also has municipal institutions; it is the
                    centre for the administration of the wide Narym region. Of the above towns only
                    Tomsk and Barnaut have the aspect of European towns. Barnaut, capital of the
                    mining district of the Altai, which belongs to the “Cabinet of the Emperor,” is
                    a wealthy city, with a mining school and laboratory, a botanic garden, a jpuseum
                    of mining and natural history, and a meteorological observatory. Kotyvañ, with a
                    stone-cutting manufactory, has 12,250 inhabitants. Several mining villages are
                    more important than the district towns Zyryanovsk (silver-mine; 4500
                    inhabitants), Riddersk, Zmeinogorsk (6160), Suzunsk (5400), and Salairsk (3500).
