                <p><label type="entry">TIVOLI</label> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">Tibur),</hi> a town of
                    Italy, situated 17 miles east-north-east of Rome on one of the spurs of Monte
                    Ripoli, 830 feet above the sea. Its position is very striking and beautiful; it
                    stands partly at the edge of the lofty cliff over which the river Anio falls in
                    a most imposing mass of water. The present aspect of the fall is very different
                    from what it was in ancient times, as the water has undermined and carried away
                    great masses of the rock. In 1881 the population of the town was 9730, and of
                    the commune 10,297.</p>
                <p>Ancient Tibur was founded, according to the legend adopted by the Roman poets,
                    many centuries before Rome, by the Siculi.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    named Tiburtus, the son of Catillus, who became the eponymous hero of
                    Tibur.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hor., <hi

                    Virg., <hi rend="italic">Aen.,</hi> vii. 670.</p></note> During the early
                    historic period Tibur, which stood on the borders of the Sabine territory, was
                    always a bitter enemy of Rome, and on many occasions allied itself to various
                    peoples, even the Gauls, in their attacks on the city. With the rest of Latium,
                    Tibur was finally conquered by Rome in 335 B.C., and on account of its constant
                    enmity was treated with much severity, not being admitted to the Roman franchise
                    till towards the close of the republican period. Almost no mention of Tibur
                    occurs during the time of the empire; but the town is recorded to have suffered
                    severely during the Gothic invasion in the 6th century.</p>
                <p>Remains of its city wall still exist, built of squared blocks of tufa; but the
                    whole circuit is not clearly determinable. Even the site of the large and
                    wealthy temple of Hercules is doubtful, which stood in an extensive temenos,
                    containing libraries and a porticus, λvhere Augustus sometimes administered
                    justice.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See App., <hi

                    72.</p></note> At the edge of the cliff still stands a small circular temple, of
                    doubtful dedication, which once had eighteen columns, and closely resembled that
                    in the Forum Boarium of Rome. Its cella walls are of concrete faced with opus
                    reticulatum, and its columns of travertine; it dates from about the time of
                    Christ. Its popular name is the “temple of the Sibyl.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It has also been called the temple of Vesta,
                    but the real site of this last was on the other side of the river.</p></note>
                    Close by is another small prostyle-tetrastyle temple resembling that (so called)
                    of Fortuna Virilis in Rome. Remains of the circuit wall of the forum also exist,
                    with a large apsidal projection, as well as an extensive crypto-porticus, faced
                    with blank arcading and divided internally by a row of twenty-eight columns.
                    Tibur was a favourite summer residence of many wealthy Romans under the empire,
                    and especially of Horace and Maecenas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Anio at Tibur. The ancient “lapis Tiburtinus” (modern travertine) was so called
                    from its chief quarries at Tibur, where it has been during long ages deposited
                    by the water of the river Anio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hadrian's villa,</hi> which stands at the foot of the Tibur
                    spur of hill about 2 miles distant, is one of the most important Roman remains
                    in the world. Between 1870 and 1882 the greater part of its immense area was
                    excavated; the whole circuit was once no less than 8 miles. The scheme of this
                    wonderful group of-buildings was the fancy of the rich and highly educated
                    emperor Hadrian, who desired to reproduce, within a short distance of Rome, a
                    number of the chief Greek sites and buildings which he had visited in different
                    parts of the world. Besides his own palace he built a large stoa paecile, copied
                    from that at Athens, an odeum, a lyceum, an academy (with its gardens, halls,
                    and porticus), libraries, Latin and Greek theatres, a stadium, palaestra,
                    hippodrome, baths, and many temples. Large gardens, divided into an artificial
                    “Vale of Tempe,” “Elysian Fields,” and “Tartarus,” were watered by a winding
                    stream named the “Euripus.” In another place stood a “serapeum,” copied from
                    that at Alexandria, and filled with pseudo-Egyptian statues and reliefs, many of
                    which have been recently unearthed. Barracks for the praetorian guard and rows
                    of dwellings for slaves completed this magnificent group of buildings. In many
                    parts the existing remains are well preserved and in some cases the uses of the
                    different buildings can be determined.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Many of the names given to different parts by the Roman
                    antiquaries are based on mere conjecture.</p></note> The main walls are of
                    concrete faced with mixed brick and opus reticulatum, once wholly covered with
                    magnificent Oriental marbles and crowded with fine Greek and Graeco-Roman
                    sculpture; mosaic of marble and glass was lavishly used for floors, walls, and
                    vaults, together with the most elaborate painted decorations. A large number of
                    fine works of art have been discovered here, such as the mosaic of “Pliny’s
                    doves” and the Faun in rosso antico now in the Capitol. It is probable that the
                    Venus de’ Medici came from this villa, together with many other statues found in
                    the 16th century whose <hi rend="italic">provenance</hi> is now forgotten.</p>
