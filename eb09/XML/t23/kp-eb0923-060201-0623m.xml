                    Dangerous Archipelago, Fleurieu’s Bad Sea, Krusenstern’s Low Islands, and the
                    Pearl Islands of traders.</p></note> a broad belt of seventy coral islands lying
                    between 14° 5' and 23° 22' S. lat. and 134° 25' and 148° 40' W. long., and now
                    under the protection of France. They trend in irregular lines in a northwest and
                    south-east direction, and cover 1500 miles of the Pacific, the easternmost
                    Tuamotus being 3600 miles from Peru.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Distinct names have been given to eight clusters of the
                    archipelago,— Disappointment Islands, King George’s Islands, Palliser Islands,
                    Raeffsky Islands, Two Groups, Duke of Gloucester Islands, Actaeon or Amphitrite
                    group, and Gambier Islands.</p></note> With the exception of a few insignificant
                    islands the archipelago consists of atolls (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Corals</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pacific Ocean),</hi> mostly chains of low islets that
                    crown the reefs and sometimes also obstruct the deep lagoons which they
                    encircle. The largest island, Nairsa (Dean’s Island), with a lagoon 45 miles
                    long by 15 wide, is made up of twenty islets. Fakarava, the next in size,
                    consists of fifteen islets, and its oblong lagoon affords the best anchorage in
                    the group. Hao has fifty islets, and its lagoon is dangerously studded with
                    coral. The symmetrically placed eleven islets of Anao suggested to Captain Cook
                    the name of Chain Island. Matahiva, Niau, and Mururoa are good specimens of the
                    horse-shoe-shaped atoll. Nengonengone, Fangataufa, and Marutea, true lagoon
                    islands, form unbroken rings round their lake-like lagoons. In a few of the
                    smaller atolls the lagoons have been completely silted up. To the south-east lie
                    the Gambier Islands, a cluster of four larger and many smaller volcanic islets,
                    enclosed in one wide reef. The wooded crags of Mangareva, the largest islet, 5
                    miles in length, rise to a height of 1300 feet and are covered with a rich
                    vegetation, quite Tahitian in character; but, as in the other Tuamotus, there is
                    a dearth of animal life. This group was discovered by Captain Wilson of the
                    London Missionary Society in 1797. Tahitian teachers were sent thither in 1834;
                    but Catholic missionaries followed in 1836, and converted the entire population.
                    The natives, once very numerous, now number less than a thousand, and are still
                    decreasing. Cannibalism was formerly prevalent. In physique, language, religion,
                    and custom the Gambier Islanders closely resemble the Rarotongans. Beechey
                    surveyed the group in 1826, and D’Urville in 1838. Pitcairn Island and a few
                    uninhabited rocks lie still farther to the south-east. The Tuamotus are healthy
                    and as a rule have a lower mean temperature than Tahiti. The easterly trade
                    winds prevail. Rain and fogs occur even during the dry season. The stormy season
                    lasts from November to March, when devastating hurricanes are not uncommon and a
                    southwesterly swell renders the western shores dangerous. Plants and animals are
                    very meagrely represented, even more so than in the atolls of Micronesia.
                    Cocoa-palms and the pandanus thrive on many of the islets, and the bread-fruit,
                    banana, pine-apple, and arum have been introduced from Tahiti into the western
                    islands. Mammals are represented by a rat; among land-birds a parakeet, a
                    thrush, and a dove are noticeable; and of reptiles there is only one lizard.
                    Insects are scarce. But the sea and lagoons teem with turtle, fish, mollusks,
                    crustaceans, and zoophytes. Coral grows luxuriantly everywhere. From the
                    abundance of pearl-oysters the archipelago gets its name of Pearl Islands;
                    pearl-fishing indeed is the only remunerative industry. Under French control the
                    newest appliances for obtaining shells have now mostly superseded the laborious
                    diving of the natives. The Tuamotus are very thinly inhabited by a fine strong
                    Polynesian race, more muscular and mostly darker-skinned than that inhabiting
                    Tahiti. In the west considerable intermixture with other races has taken place.
                    Of the habits of the people little is known, and many of the islands are still
                    marked “hostile inhabitants” on the English Admiralty charts. In the eastern
                    islands cannibalism existed. Tattooing is not universal. Clothing and ornaments
                    are very scanty. The huts are mean square buildings, often mere shelters of
                    leaves. Good outrigger and single and double canoes are built, the larger
                    ingeniously stitched together of small pieces of drift wood. Fishing with net
                    and hook is much practised. Food besides fish consists almost exclusively of
                    cocoa-nuts and pandanus fruit. Water is scarce.</p>
                <p>Magellan’s first discovery of land after reaching the Pacific in 1520 was one of
                    the Tuamotus. Various portions of the archipelago were in turn crossed by
                    Queiros (1605), Lemaire and Schonten (1616), Roggeween (1722), Byron (1765),
                    Wallis (1767), Bougainville (1768), Cook (1769), the “Duff” (1797), Krusenstern
                    (1803), Kotzebue (1816), Fitzroy (1835), D’Urville (1838), and Belcher (1840).
                    The first systematic survey was instituted in 1818 by Bellinghausen, and was
                    continued in 1823 by Duperry, in 1826 by Beechey, and in 1839 by Wilkes. Thanks
                    to these many explorers, the islands have been christened and rechristened with
                    a chaos of Spanish, Dutch, English, French, German, and Russian names.</p>
