                    Reggio, Calabria, where his father was lieutenantcolonel in the Austrian
                    service. After his rough early training in the camp, he made himself so
                    unendurable at the college of Vienna that he was speedily removed, and entered
                    in 1727 as ensign in the Palfy regiment, from which, however, after a brief but
                    riotous course of duelling, gambling, and love-making, he received a new
                    dismissal. He returned to his father, and, on the outbreak of war between the
                    Russians and Turks, raised a corps of 300 men at his own expense and joined the
                    Russian army on the Hungarian frontier. His brilliant exploits won him the
                    favour of his commander, but a breach of orders, followed by an assault on his
                    colonel, brought him under sentence of death, from which a daring feat of arms
                    alone saved him. A sentence of exile to Siberia, incurred soon after by a second
                    affray with a superior officer, was commuted to imprisonment at Kieff and
                    expulsion from the country. His term of imprisonment having expired, he retired
                    to his estate, where he armed and drilled his vassals, and in a series of
                    encounters compelled the Slavonian brigands to seek refuge in Turkish territory.
                    From these marauders he recruited in 1740 the formidable body of pandours with
                    which he joined the levies in aid of Maria Theresa. Repulsing the French near
                    Linz, he penetrated into Bavaria, took Deckendorf and Reichenhall, and destroyed
                    Cham,—the conduct of his troops being marked not less by atrocity than by
                    desperate courage. Recalled to Vienna to render account for the cruelties
                    practised, he refused to defend himself, and, being set at liberty, rejoined his
                    men, opened in 1743 a passage across the Rhine for the army, and became as much
                    the terror of Alsace as he had been of Bavaria. On the retreat of the army to
                    Bohemia he covered the rear and took several towns, but had his right <pb

                    him a surgeon, and, having made a species of triumphal entry into Vienna, he
                    resumed his command. But in September</p>
                <p>1745, after having boldly penetrated with his pandours to the tent of Frederick
                    II., he suffered the king to escape him while his followers were stopping to
                    plunder, and he was thereupon accused of having been bribed by that monarch to
                    release him. He was condemned on inquiry to pay an indemnity for peremptory
                    dismissal to the officers accusing him, but he refused to acknowledge the
                    sentence, and, raising new troops, added to the list of his exploits. His
                    conduct leading to a renewal of the inquiry, he laid hands on the president of
                    the court-martial and was thrown into prison, but was enabled to escape by the
                    baroness Lestock, with whom he fled to Holland. He was brought back to Vienna,
                    and condemned to perpetual imprisonment in the Spielberg, where, finding escape
                    impossible, he poisoned himself, October 1749, at the age of 38.</p>

                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Friedrich, Freiherr von der Trenck</hi> (1726-1794),
                    cousin of the preceding, born at Königsberg, 16th February 1726. His precocious
                    abilities won him the favour of Frederick the Great, in whose guards he was
                    enrolled at an early age as cadet, and by whom he was made cornet in 1743 and
                    aide-de-camp for his gallantry in 1744. An intrigue with the princess Amelia,
                    sister of the king, led to his temporary confinement until the campaign of 1745
                    recalled him to the army. He was again thrown into prison, however, on the
                    discovery of a correspondence between him and his cousin, then fighting with his
                    pandours in the service of Maria Theresa, but in December</p>
                <p>1746, after many failures, he succeeded in escaping from the fortress of Glatz.
                    He went to Vienna, was involved in several duels by his cousin, who was too
                    closely confined to give expression to his animosities except by proxy, and
                    finally accepted a company in the service of the czar. On the declaration of
                    peace the empress Elizabeth bestowed on him a diamond-hilted sword, and a
                    Russian princess left him a fortune, which was still further increased by the
                    death of his cousin, who, on condition of his entering none but the Austrian
                    service, made him his heir. The latter inheritance being heavily burdened, he
                    spent the next three years in a series of lawsuits, and then, after a journey to
                    Italy, became a captain in an Austrian regiment of cuirassiers. At the death of
                    his mother he revisited Germany, but was promptly seized by the unforgetful king
                    and closely imprisoned in the fortress of Magdeburg, his efforts to escape
                    securing him the honour of a specially constructed cell, a heavy burden of
                    chains, and the additional punishment of being roused every quarter of an hour
                    by the sentries. Still unsubdued, he found means to remove his chains in the
                    brief intervals afforded him, and occupied himself with French and German
                    composition. In the meantime the princess Amelia had not ceased to move in
                    favour of his release, and Trenck, having been set free in 1763, returned to
                    Vienna only to be reconfined there as a lunatic. He was speedily released by the
                    intervention of the king, and raised to the rank of major by way of
                    compensation; but, being by this time satiated with royal patronage and prisons,
                    he retired to Aix-la-Chapelle, commenced business as a wine merchant, and
                    devoted his leisure to literature and politics, publishing, among other works, a
                    gazette entitled the <hi rend="italic">Friend of Man</hi> and an attack on
                    Frederick II. as the “Macedonian hero.” His commercial experiences, however,
                    were not encouraging, and, after spending three years (1774-1777) in England, he
                    returned to Vienna, became the secret agent of Maria Theresa, and at her death
                    withdrew to his castle of Zwer-bach, where he gave himself to agriculture and
                    wrote his famous autobiography. Not until 1787 was he permitted to return to his
                    own country, where he is said to have had an affecting interview with the
                    princess Amelia a few days before her death. The publication of his memoirs <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lebensgeschichte)</hi> in 1786, translated into French by himself
                    in 1789, gave him immediate and wide notoriety, and wax effigies of the
                    illustrious prisoner in his chains were exhibited on the Parisian boulevards <hi
                    rend="italic">à deux sous en sortant.</hi> Despite the grounds which the memoirs
                    undoubtedly furnish for Carlyle’s terse characterization of him as an
                    “extensively fabulous blockhead,” they took a strong hold of the popular
                    imagination, and obliterated for a time the fame of his more darkly passionate
                    pandour cousin. The tragic elements in the story were, however, to be emphasized
                    by a still more tragic close. His ready advocacy of the French Revolution
                    involved him in disgrace with the Austrian authorities, and, after deprivation
                    of his pension and further imprisonment, he set out towards the close of 1791
                    for Paris. In place of an enthusiastic reception, he was arrested by order of
                    the Committee of Public Safety as a secret emissary of the king of Prussia, and,
                    after confinement in the St Lazarus prison, was literally dragged to the
                    guillotine on 25th July 1794. His <hi rend="italic">Sämmtliche Gedichte und
                    Schriften</hi> were published at Leipsic in 1786.</p>
