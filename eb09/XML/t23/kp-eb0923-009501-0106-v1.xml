                <p><label type="entry">TAYLOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1580-1654),
                    commonly called “The Water Poet,” was born at Gloucester in August 1580. Of his
                    parentage and early boyhood very little is known, and that little is mainly to
                    be gleaned from various scattered personal allusions in the numerous short
                    writings of this prolific wit and rhymster. After fulfilling his apprenticeship
                    to a waterman, he seems to have served (1596) in the fleet under the earl of
                    Essex, and to have been present at the naval attack upon Cadiz. On his return to
                    England he took up the trade of Thames waterman, and for a time at any rate was
                    a collector of the dues exacted by the lieutenant of the Tower on all wines
                    destined for London. The title of “Water Poet,” which he owes to his occupation
                    on the river, is a misnomer. Taylor was no poet, though he could string rhymes
                    together with facility; his wit, which was vigorous and vulgar, found best
                    expression in rollicking prose. He shows a broad sense of rough fun,
                    occasionally of humour; but for the most part his comicalities would now meet
                    with scanty appreciation. He had a very good opinion of himself, his writings,
                    and his importance; and it was he himself who set forth that he was the “king’s
                    water poet” and the “queen’s waterman.” His literary performances can most
                    easily and most satisfactorily be studied in the handsome quarto, containing all
                    his productions, edited by Mr C. Hindley, and published in 1872. His “works,”
                    sixty-three in number, first appeared in one large volume—now a rarity sought
                    after by collectors—in 1630. He delighted in eccentric freaks, calculated in
                    narration to astound both the sober countryfolk and the somewhat sceptical
                    Londoners. Thus, with a companion as feather-brained as himself, he once started
                    on a voyage from London to Queensborough in a paper boat, with two stockfish
                    tied to two canes for oars; before the journey’s end was reached the frail boat
                    collapsed, as might have been expected, though a qualified success finally met
                    Taylor’s efforts. The spirit of the bargee was in him, and he delighted in rough
                    give-and-take; a rude lampoon was one of his favourite verbal weapons. Thus
                    Thomas Coryat, the author of <hi rend="italic">Crudities,</hi> having excited
                    the literary waterman’s ridicule, was rewarded with a ludicrous dedication in
                    the production entitled <hi rend="italic">Taylods Travels in Germanie·,</hi>
                    again, the “water poet” indulged in abusive satire to his heart’s content in an
                    “effusion” which he called <hi rend="italic">A Kicksey-Winsey, or a Lerry
                        Come-Twang—</hi> a literary castigation which he inflicted upon those
                    subscribers to a certain “work” of his who omitted to substantiate their
                    promises. This production was entitled <hi rend="italic">The Penniless
                        Pilgrimage, or the Moneyless Perambulation of John Taylor,</hi> and
                    consisted of an account of its author’s pedestrian tour from London to
                    Edinburgh; and to this work some sixteen hundred persons are said to have
                    promised their support. Another wagering venture was a journey to Prague, where
                    he is said to have been received and entertained by the queen of Bohemia in
                    1620. Two years later Taylor made “a very merry, wherry ferry voyage, or Yorke
                    for my money,” and in the ensuing year another water-journey, which he
                    subsequently described in prose and verse as <hi rend="italic">A Hew Discovery
                        by Sea with a Wherry from London to Salisbury.</hi> At the outbreak of the
                    Civil War Taylor forsook the river and retired to Oxford, where he tempted
                    fortune by keeping a publichouse. His sympathies were wholly with the Royalists,
                    —the Roysterists, as he called them once; and, when the town surrendered, the
                    “water poet” returned to London and kept a public-house under the sign of The
                    Crown, in Phoenix Alley, Long Acre. He incurred some odium from his loyal
                    observance of the king’s death in the placement above his door of the sign of
                    The Mourning Crown, and he was forced to take the latter down. With
                    characteristic readiness he substituted for it his own portrait, with some
                    doggerel lines underneath. It was here that in December 1654 he died, and in the
                    neighbouring churchyard of St Martin’s-in-the-Fields his remains were laid.</p>
                <p>At the most, Taylor can only be called an amusing and vulgarly clever
                    pamphleteer; he wrote nothing worthy of remembrance save by the historian of the
                    period in which he lived, by the antiquary, and by the enthusiastic student of
                    the many straggling little byways of literature.</p>
