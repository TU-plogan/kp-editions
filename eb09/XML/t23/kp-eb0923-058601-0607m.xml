                    cupped mouthpiece, and is formed of two principal parts —the bell, the bore of
                    which gradually widens, and the slide, which is composed of two cylindrical

                    lower extremities by a pipe curved in a half-circle, glide without loss of air.
                    The mouthpiece is adapted to one of the upper ends of the slide and the bell to
                    the other end. When the slide, which is moved by the right hand, is closed, the
                    instrument is at its highest pitch; the note is lowered in proportion as the
                    column of air is lengthened by drawing out the slide.</p>
                <p>Formerly the trombone was known as the <hi rend="italic">sackbut</hi>; its modern

                    instrument was invented. In a manuscript of the 9th century, preserved at
                    Boulogne, there is a drawing of an instrument which bears a great resemblance to
                    a trombone deprived of its bell. Virdung<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    representation of it, under the name of <hi rend="italic">busaun,</hi> which
                    shows that early in the 16th century it was almost the same as that employed in
                    our day. By that time the trombone had come into vogue in England: the band of
                    musicians in the service of Henry VIII. included ten sackbut players, and under
                    Elizabeth, in 1587, there were six. English instrumentalists then enjoyed a
                    certain reputation and were sought for by foreign courts; thus in 1604 Charles
                    III. of Lorraine sought to recruit his sackbut players from English bands.
                    Praetorius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Organographia,</hi> Wolfenbüttel, 1619.</p></note> classes the
                    trombones in a complete family, the relative tonalities of which were thus
                    composed :—1 <hi rend="italic">alt-ρosaun,</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic">gemeine
                    rechte posaunen,</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">quart-posaunen,</hi> 1 <hi
                    rend="italic">octav-posaun,—</hi> 8 in all. The alt-posaun was in D. With the
                    slide closed it gave the first of the accompanying harmonics: The gemeine rechte
                    posaunen, or ordinary trombones, were in</p>
                <p>A. Without using the slide they gave the subjoined sounds: The quart-posaun was
                    made either in E, the fourth below the gemeine rechte posaun, or in D, the lower
                    fifth. In the latter case it was exactly an octave below the alt-posaun. The
                    octav-posaun was in A. It was constructed in two different fashions: either it
                    had a length double that of the ordinary trombone, or the slide was shortened,
                    the length of the column of air being still maintained by the adaptation of a
                    crook. The first system, which was invented by Hans Schreiber four years before
                    the work of Praetorius appeared, gave the instrumentalist a slide by which he
                    could procure in the lower octave all the sounds of the ordinary trombone. The
                    second system, which Praetorius had known for years, was distinguished from the
                    first, not only by modifications affecting the form, but also by a larger bore.

                    have made himself acquainted with its construction, for we can scarcely find an
                    allusion in the confused text of his work to the tonality of the trombone then
                    in vogue. He established this fact, however, that it was customary in France to
                    lower the instrument a fourth below the pitch of the ordinary trombone by means
                    of a <hi rend="italic">tortil,</hi> a kind of crook with a double turn that was
                    fitted between the bell and the slide, “in order,” he said, “to make the bass to

                    shortest length— that is, with the slide close up; it in fact comprises seven
                    positions, which are obtained by shifting the slide as many lengths and in such
                    a way that each of these produces a series of harmonics a semitone lower than
                    the length which has preceded. This system, so simple and rational, might have
                    been expected always to serve for the basis of the technique of the instrument;
                    but from the middle of the 18th century the art of playing the trombone became
                    the object of purely empiric teaching. Only four positions were made use
                    of.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    obtained from the ordinary trombone, then called the tenor trombone, the first
                    series of the subjoined harmonics (the numerals indicating the order): the
                    fundamental or first note being difficult to obtain; the second position
                    produced the third position produced</p>
                <p>In thus lowering by semitones, the and the fourth sounds furnished by the four
                    positions gave the tenor trombone a diatonic scale from This scale was formed
                    with notes that could be perfectly just, but the result would have been less
                    satisfactory to the ear if the player had strictly observed the rules laid down
                    by the teaching of that period for the production of the chromatic intervals.
                    Thus to pass from a note furnished by one of the four positions to another a
                    semitone lower it was necessary to lengthen the slide by two fingers; if the
                    semitone higher was required the slide had to be shortened to the same
                    extent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It need hardly
                    be remarked that the higher semitone cannot be produced in the first

                    show the viciousness of that rule.</p>
                <p>Of all wind instruments the trombone has perhaps been least modified in form;
                    changes have occasionally been attempted, but for the most part with only
                    trifling success. The innovation which has had the most vogue dates from the end
                    of the 18th century; it consisted in bending the tube of the bell in a half
                    circle above the head of the executant, which produced a very bizarre effect. It
                    also gave rise to very serious inconveniences: by destroying the regularity of
                    the proportions of the bell it prejudicially affected the quality of tone and
                    intonation of the instrument. For a long time the curved bell with its serpent’s
                    mask was maintained in military music, and it is only about twenty years ago
                    that it was completely given up. By giving a half turn more to the bell tube its
                    opening was directed to the back of the executant; but this form, in fashion for
                    a little while about 1830, was not long adhered to, and the trombone reassumed
                    its primitive form, which is still maintained. As appears from a patent
                    deposited by Stölzel and Blümel at Berlin on 12th April 1818, the application of
                    ventils or pistons was then made for the first time.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was mentioned in the Leipsic <hi
                    rend="italic">Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung</hi> in 1815, the merit of the
                    invention being assigned to Heinrich Stölzel of Pless in Silesia.</p></note> The
                    ventils, at first two in number, effected a decided lengthening of the
                    instrument. The first augmented the length of the tube by a tone, lowering by as
                    much the natural harmonics. The second produced a similar effect for a semitone,
                    and the simultaneous employment of the two pistons resulted in the depression of
                    a tone and a half. The principle, therefore, of the employment of ventils or
                    pistons is the same as that which governs the use of slides. For instance, a
                    trombone is provided with three pistons, and without their help it produces the
                    first of the following sets of harmonics (the numbers indicating the order).
                    Then by pressing down the second piston we obtain a lengthening of the column of
                    air that lowers the instrument by a semitone and makes it produce the second set
                    of harmonics here shown; with the aid of the first piston we relengthen the
                    column, so as to get a whole tone lower, producing the third set of sounds; the
                    third piston, in the same way, lowers the instrument a tone and a half, as
                    in</p>
                <p>(4); by the simultaneous employment of the second and third pistons we arrive at
                    two tones, as in (5); the combination of the first and third pistons lowers the
                    instrument two tones and a half, as shown in (6); finally, uniting the three
                    pistons lowers the trombone three tones and a half, as shown in (7).</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the increased facility obtained by the use of pistons, they are
                    very far from having gained the suffrages of all players: many prefer the slide,
                    believing that it gives a facility of emission that they cannot obtain with a
                    piston trombone. For this illustration of the use of pistons, we have taken a
                    tenor trombone in B♭; the flat tonalities having been preferred for military
                    music since the commencement of the 19th century, the pitch of each variety of
                    trombones has been raised a semitone. At present six trombones are more or less
                    in use, viz., the alto trombone in F, the alto in E♭ (formerly in D), the tenor
                    in B♭ (formerly in A), the bass in G, the bass in F (formerly in E), the bass in
                    E♭ (formerly in D). This transposition has no reference to the number of
                    vibrations that may be officially or tacitly adopted as the standard pitch of
                    any country or locality. A trombone an octave lower than the tenor has recently
                    been reintroduced into the orchestra, principally by Wagner. The different
                    varieties just cited are constructed with pistons or slides, as the case may be.
