                    warmer colouring and more pronounced ecclesiastical sympathies than the master,
                    and strong affinities to Tennyson, Keble, and Milnes. In 1841 he resigned his
                    living to become curate to Samuel Wilberforce, then rector of Alverstoke, and
                    upon Wilberforce’s promotion to the deanery of Westminster, in 1845, he was
                    presented to the rectory of Itchenstoke. In 1845 and 1846 he preached the
                    Hulsean lecture, and in the former year was made examining chaplain to
                    Wilberforce, now bishop of Oxford. He was shortly afterwards appointed
                    theological professor and examiner at King’s College, London. In 1851 he
                    established his fame as a philologist by his charming little work on <hi
                    rend="italic">The Study of Words,</hi> originally delivered as lectures to the
                    pupils of the Diocesan Training School, Winchester. His purpose, as stated by
                    himself, was to show that in words, even taken singly, “there are boundless
                    stores of moral and historic truth, and no less of passion and imagination laid
                    up ”—a truth enforced by a number of most apposite illustrations. The book may
                    be regarded as a comment on the saying that “language is fossil poetry.” It was
                    followed by two equally delightful little volumes of similar character— <hi
                    rend="italic">English Past and Present</hi> (1855), and <hi rend="italic">A
                    Select Glossary of English Words</hi> (1859). All have gone through numerous
                    editions, and they have probably contributed more than all the labours of
                    severer but less cultured and tasteful philologists to promote the historical
                    study of the English tongue. Yet Trench did little more than indicate the
                    existence of a vast region of research extending over all literary languages.
                    Another great service to English philology was rendered by his paper, read
                    before the Philological Society, “On some Deficiencies in our English
                    Dictionaries” (1857), which gave the first impulse to the great enterprise now
                    proceeding under the auspices of Dr Murray. His advocacy of a revised
                    translation of the New Testament (1858) powerfully aided to promote another
                    great national undertaking. In 1856 he published a valuable essay on Calderon,
                    with a translation of a portion of <hi rend="italic">Life is a Dream</hi> in the
                    original metre. He had not, meanwhile, been forgetful of professional claims
                    upon his pen. In 1841 he had published his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the
                    Parables,</hi> and in 1846 his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the Miracles,</hi>
                    works which, containing much to gratify every school of thought, and little to
                    offend any, obtained the most extensive popularity, and have been resorted to by
                    English theologians of all persuasions, who have turned the author to the same
                    account as he has turned his patristic, Romanist, and Lutheran predecessors.
                    There is, in fact, very little originality in these volumes, but they are
                    treasuries of erudite and acute illustration, selected from various quarters
                    with admirable judgment, and displayed with consummate taste.</p>
                <p>In 1856 Trench was raised to the deanery of Westminster, probably the position in
                    the whole church which suited him best. In January 1864 he was advanced to the
                    more dignified but less congenial post of archbishop of Dublin. Stanley had been
                    named, but rejected by the Irish Church, and, according to Bishop Wilberforce’s
                    correspondence, Trench’s appointment was favoured neither by the prime minister
                    nor the lord lieutenant. It was, moreover, unpopular in Ireland, and a blow to
                    English literature; yet the course of events soon proved it to have been most
                    fortunate. Trench, indeed, could do nothing to prevent the disestablishment of
                    the Irish Church, though he resisted with dignity, and repelled the insidious
                    proposal that she should do execution upon herself. But, when the disestablished
                    communion had to be reconstituted under the greatest difficulties, it was found
                    of the highest importance that the occupant of his position should be a man of a
                    liberal and genial spirit, able to ward off the narrowness which would have
                    alienated the sympathies of English churchmen, and sown the seeds of schism in a
                    body beyond all others in need of amity and unity. This was the work of the
                    remainder of Trench’s life; and, if less personally agreeable and of less
                    general utility than the literary performances which might have been expected
                    from him if he had remained at Westminster, it was much more weighty and
                    important. It exposed him at times to considerable misconstruction and obloquy,
                    but he came to be appreciated, and, when in November 1884 he resigned his
                    archbishopric from infirmity, clergy and laity unanimously recorded their sense
                    of his “wisdom, learning, diligence, and munificence.” He had found time for <hi
                    rend="italic">Lectures on Mediaeval Church History</hi> (1878); his poetical
                    works were rearranged and collected in two volumes (last edition 1885). He died
                    in London, after a lingering illness, on March 28, 1886.</p>
                <p>As a man Trench was universally beloved and esteemed. He was remarkable for a
                    high spirit, munificence, and general elevation of sentiment. As a prose author
                    he ranks among the most useful and agreeable of his generation, and may almost
                    be said to gain in both respects by his deficiency in originality. Both as
                    Biblical commentator and philologist, he has done far more by popularizing the
                    researches of more exact scholars and more profound thinkers than he could have
                    done by striving to make discoveries of his own. For durable fame as a poet
                    originality is indispensable, and here Trench fails. The style of his poems is
                    frequently admirable, but even when not obviously derived from some other writer
                    it wants the stamp of strong individuality. He has written little beyond the
                    reach of any man uniting exquisite culture to the accomplishment of verse: the
                    pieces where poetry seems a natural language with him are chiefly to be found
                    among his elegiac poems, which express real personal experience, and appeal
                    movingly to the heart. (R. G.)</p>
