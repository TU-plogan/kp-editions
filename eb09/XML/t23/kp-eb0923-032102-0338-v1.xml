                    presently.</p>
                <p>The former of these is one of the finest songsters in Europe, but it is almost
                    everywhere so common that its merits in this respect are often disregarded, and
                    not unfrequently its melody, when noticed, is ascribed to the prince of
                    feathered vocalists, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Nightingale</hi> (vol. xvii. p.
                    498). The Song-Thrush is too well known to need description, for in the spring
                    and summer there is hardly a field, a copse, or a garden that is not the resort
                    of a pair or more; and the brown-backed bird with its spotted breast, <pb

                    pausing to detect the movement of a worm, and vigorously seizing the same a
                    moment after, is one of the most familiar sights. Hardly less well known is the
                    singular nest built by this bird—a deep cup, lined with a thin but stiff coating
                    of fragments of rotten wood ingeniously spread, and plastered so as to present a
                    smooth interior—in which its sea-green eggs spotted with black are laid. An
                    early breeder, it builds nest after nest during the season, and there can be few
                    birds more prolific. Its ravages on ripening fruits, especially strawberries and
                    gooseberries, excite the enmity of the imprudent gardener who leaves his crops
                    unprotected by nets, but he would do well to stay the hand of revenge, for no
                    bird can or does destroy so many snails, as is testified to the curious observer
                    on inspection of the stones that it selects against which to dash its
                    captures,—stones that are besmeared with the slime of the victims and bestrewn
                    with the fragments of their shattered shells. Nearly all the young Thrushes
                    reared in the British Islands—and this expression includes the storm-swept isles
                    of the Outer Hebrides, though not those of Shetland—seem to emigrate as soon as
                    they are fit to journey, and at a later period they are followed by most of
                    their parents, so that many parts of the kingdom are absolutely bereft of this
                    species from October to the end of January. On the continent of Europe the
                    autumnal influx of the birds bred in the North is regarded with much interest,
                    as has been already stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 765),
                    for they are easily ensnared and justly esteemed for the table, while their
                    numbers make their appearance in certain districts a matter of great
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The second species to which the name applies is distinguished as the

                    while the harsh cries it utters when angry or alarmed have given it other local
                    names, as “Screech,” “Shrite,” and “Skrike,” all traceable to the Anglo-Saxon

                    patches on its outer tail-feathers. Of bold disposition, and fearless of the
                    sleety storms of spring, as of predatory birds, the cock will take his stand on
                    a tall tree, “like an enchanter calling up the gale” (as Knapp happily wrote),
                    and thence with loud voice proclaim in wild and discontinuous notes the fervour
                    of his love for his mate; nor does that love cease when the breeding-season is
                    past, since this species is one of those that appear to pair for life, and even
                    when, later in the year, it gathers in small flocks, husband and wife may be
                    seen in close company. In defence of nest and offspring, too, few birds are more
                    resolute, and the Daw, Pie, or Jay that approaches with an ill intent speedily
                    receives treatment that causes a rapid retreat, while even the marauding cat
                    finds the precincts of the “master of the coppice” <hi rend="italic"

                    Welsh name this Thrush, unsuitable for its stealthy operations. The connexion of
                    this bird with the mistletoe, which is as old as the days of Aristotle, is no
                    figment, as some have tried to maintain. Not only is it exceedingly fond of the
                    luscious viscid berries, but it seems to be almost the only bird that will touch
                    them. Of other British Thrushes, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fieldfare</hi> (vol.
                    ix. p. 142), <hi rend="smallcaps">Redwing</hi> (vol. XX. p. 318), and the
                    Blackbird and Ring-OüSEL (vol. xviii. p. 75) have been before noticed in these
                    pages, as has been (under the first of those headings) the so-called “Robin” of
                    North America.</p>
                <p>The Thrushes have been generally considered to form a distinct Family, <hi

                    in rank among birds. An attempt has already been made <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. pp. 30, 48) to point out the fallacy of this
                    view, and space is here wanting to dwell longer on the matter. This is the more
                    to be regretted, for, though many modern systematists will admit the close

                        >Catalogue of Birds</hi> (v. p. 1), being com pelled by the conditions

                    7) to unite them, protests against doing so. His own assignment of the Subfamily
                        <hi rend="italic">Turdinae</hi> is into 11 genera, of which, however, 6 only
                    would be commonly called Thrushes, and it must be borne in mind that in
