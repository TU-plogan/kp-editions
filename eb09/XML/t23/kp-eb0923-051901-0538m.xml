                    set in vibration by regular pulsations derived from a current of air directed by
                    the lips of the executant against the side of an orifice serving as an
                    embouchure, pierced laterally in the substance of the pipe and towards its upper
                    extremity. This mode of blowing appears to be of very ancient origin: the
                    Hindus, Chinese, and Japanese claim to have used it from time immemorial; in
                    Europe the high antiquity of a lateral embouchure is generally admitted,
                    although it does not really rest, so far as our present knowledge goes, on any
                    conclusive evidence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    Louvre has two ancient statues (from the Villa Borghese) representing satyrs
                    playing upon transverse flutes. Unfortunately these marbles have been restored,
                    especially in the details affecting our present subject, and are therefore
                    examples of no value to us. Another statue representing a flute-player occurs in
                    the British Museum. The instrument has been supposed to be a transverse flute,
                    but erroneously, for the insufflation of the lateral tube against which the
                    instrumentalist presses his lips, could not, without the intervention of a reed,
                    excite the vibratory movement of the column of air.</p></note></p>
                <p>The oblique flute of the Greeks was of Egyptian origin, and it is therefore
                    safest to suppose it to have been like the instrument frequently figured on the
                    monuments of ancient Egypt, which, held obliquely, was blown through the orifice
                    itself of the pipe at its upper extremity. The same instrument (called “nay ”)
                    is still used in Mohammedan countries. The flute is often mentioned in mediaeval
                    poetry, but no details of its construction are given. It was the custom,
                    moreover, to designate various instruments by this name. The oldest
                    representation we know of the transverse flute is found in the 11th-century
                    frescos of the cathedral of St Sophia at Kieff. Eustache Deschamps, a French
                    poet of the 14th century, in one of his ballads, makes mention of the “flute
                    traversaine,” and we are justified in supposing that he refers to the transverse
                    flute. It had certainly acquired some vogue in the 15th century, being figured
                    in an engraving in Sebastian Virdung’s celebrated work,<note anchored="true"

                    and, with the drums, it already constituted the principal element of the
                    military music. Agricola<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    alludes to it as the “Querchpfeiff” or “Schweizerpfeiff,” the latter designation
                    dating, it is said, from the battle of Marignan (1515), when the Swiss troops
                    used it for the first time in war.</p>
                <p>From Agricola onwards transverse flutes formed a complete family, said to
                    comprise the discant, the alto and tenor, and the bass,— respectively. There is
                    evidently an error in the indications of pitch here given, for the instruments
                    must in fact have produced sounds an octave higher than those noted.

                    varieties hitherto mentioned except the last. All of them are laterally pierced

                    The practice has for its result that the tonality is always a note lower than
                    the signature used. Thus the flute in D is really in C; that in F in E♭,

                    notes forming the first octave. By a stronger pressure of the breath these notes
                    are reproduced in the next octave higher, and the extent of compass of the
                    instrument is completed in the higher region by the production of other
                    harmonics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Victor

                <p>The largest bass flute in the Brussels museum is in at the French normal pitch A
                    435 double vibrations per second. It measures 0∙95 m. from the centre of the
                    blow orifice to the lower extremity of the tube. The disposition of the lateral
                    holes is such that it is impossible to cover them with the fingers if the flute
                    is held in the ordinary way. The instrument must be placed against the mouth in
                    an almost vertical direction, inclining the extremity of the tube either to the
                    right or the left. This inconvenient position makes it necessary that the
                    instrument should be divided into two parts, enabling the player to turn the
                    head joint that the embouchure may be most com-modiously approached by the lips,
                    which is not at all easy. The first and fourth of the six lateral holes are
                    double, but those holes are stopped up with wax which have become useless
                    through the player’s habit of using the fingers of the right or left hand to
                    cover the higher three holes. The bass flute shown in fig. 1 is the facsimile of
                    an instrument in the Museo Civico of Verona. The original, unfortunately no
                    longer fit for use, is nevertheless sufficiently well preserved to allow of all
                    its proportionate measurements being given. The lowest note, E♭, is obtained
                    with a remarkable amplitude of sound, thus upsetting a very prevalent opinion
                    that it is impossible to produce by lateral insufflation sounds which go a
                    little lower than the ordinary limit downwards of the modern orchestral
                    flute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Fétis, <hi

                <p>The bass flute cited by Mersenne should not differ much from that of the Museo
                    Civico at Verona. We suppose it to have been in and that it was furnished with
                    an open key like that which was applied to the recorders (<hi rend="italic"
                    >flûtes douces</hi>) of the same epoch, the function of the key being to augment
                    by another note the compass of the instrument in the lower part. Following
                    Quantz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Berlin, 1752.</p></note> it was in France and about the middle of the 17th
                    century that the first modifications were introduced in the manufacture of the
                    flute. The improvements at this period consisted of the abandonment of the
                    cylindrical bore in favour of a conical one, with the wide part in the head of
                    the instrument. At the same time the flute was made of three separate pieces
                    called head, body, and foot, which were ultimately further subdivided. The body
                    or middle joint was divided into two pieces, so that the instrument could be
                    tuned to the different pitches then in use by a replacement with longer or
                    shorter pieces. It was probably about 1677, when Lully introduced the German
                    flute into the opera, that recourse was bad for the first time to keys, and that
                    the key of D♯ was applied to the lower part of the instrument.<note

                    improvement of which we have just spoken, but the body was still formed of one
                    piece only. In 1726 Quantz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    differentiate the D♯ and the E♭. This innovation was generally well received in
                    Germany, but does not appear to have met with corresponding success in other
                    countries. In France and England manufacturers adopted it but rarely; in Italy
                    it was declared useless.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    constructed with the lower extremity lengthened and furnished with two
                    supplementary keys to produce the C♯ and C. This innovation, spoken of by
                    Quantz, did not meet with a very favourable reception, and was shortly
                    afterwards abandoned. Passing mention may be made of the drawing of a flute with
                    a C key in the <hi rend="italic">Music-Saal</hi> of J. F. B. Mayers, Nuremberg,
                    1741.</p>
                <p>The tuning of the instrument to different pitches was effected, as already
                    explained, by changes in the length, and notably by substituting a longer or
                    shorter upper piece in the middle joint. So wide were the differences in the
                    pitches then in use that seven such pieces for the upper portion of it were
                    deemed necessary. The relative proportions between the different parts of the
                    instrument being altered by these modifications in the length, it was conceived
                    that the just relation could be re-established by dividing the foot into two
                    pieces, below the key. These two pieces were adjusted by means of a tenon, and
                    it was asserted that, in this way, the foot could be lengthened proportionately
                    to the length of the middle joint. Flutes thus improved took the name of “flûtes
                    à registre.” The register system was, about 1752, applied by Quantz to the head
                    joint, and, the embouchure section being thus capable of elongation, it was
                    allowable to the performer, according to the opinion of this professor, to lower
                    the pitch of the flute a semitone, without having recourse to other lengthening
                    pieces, and without disturbing the accuracy of intonation.</p>
                <p>The upper extremity of the flute, beyond the embouchure orifice, is closed by
                    means of a cork stopper. On the position of this cork depends, in a great
                    measure, the accurate tuning of the flute. It is in its right place when the
                    accompanying octaves are true. Quantz, in speaking of this accessory, mentions
                    the use of a nut-screw to give the required position to the cork. He does not
                    name the inventor of this appliance, but, according to Tromlitz,<note

                    moreover, the little octave flute in D (octave). A bass flute in D had also been
                    attempted (see fig. 2). When Ribocq published his <hi rend="italic">Bemerkungen

                    This author does not cite the inventor of these new keys, but some claim them

                <p>George Tromlitz of Leipsic, and Ribocq declares he has seen no flutes so
                    constructed other than by these two makers. But Tromlitz lays no claim for
                    himself to the credit of this improvement. He only says that “he had occupied
                    himself for several years in applying these keys so as not to augment the
                    difficulty of playing, but, on the contrary, to render the handling of them as
                    easy as possible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    We may therefore regard the London maker as the author of the first flute with

                <p>In 1785 Richard Potter, of London, improved Quantz’s slide applied to the head
                    joint as well as to the register of the foot by a double system of tubes forming
                    double sliding air-tight joints. In the document<note anchored="true"

                    describing this improvement Potter patented the idea of clothing the holes which
                    were covered by keys formed by metal conical valves. The keys mentioned in the
                    patent were four,—D♯ F, G♯, A♯. The idea of extending the compass of the flute
                    downwards was "taken up again about the same time by two players of the flute in
                    London named Tacet and Florio. They devised a new disposition of the keys C and
                    C♯ and confided the execution of their invention to Potter. In Dr Arnold’s <hi

                    and Florio’s new invented German Flute, with all the additional keys explained.”
                    It explains the use of six keys,—C, C♯, D♯, F, G♯, A♯ —that are not always
                    figured, because the employment of so many keys was at once admitted. Tromlitz
                    himself, who, however, made flutes with nine keys,—adding E♭, another F, and C♮,
                    declared that he was not in favour of so great a complication, and that he
                    preferred the flute with only two keys, D♯ and E♭</p>

                <p>with a register foot joint and a cork nut-screw at the head joint. This
                    instrument met all requirements. He was even against the use of the keys for C♮
                    and C♯, because they altered the recognized quality of tone of the instrument.
                    When Tromlitz published his method, the family of flutes had become modified. It
                    comprehended only the typical flute in D, the flûte d’amour a minor third lower,
                    a “third” flute a minor third higher, and, finally, the little octave flute.</p>
                <p>While Tromlitz was struggling in Germany with the idea of augmenting the compass
                    of the flute downwards by employing open keys for C♮ and C♯, an Italian,

                    increased the scale of the instrument downwards by the application of five new
                    keys, viz., B, B♭, A, A♭, and G. At the same time that he produced this
                    invention<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The idea of
                    this large flute was taken up again in 1819 by Trexler of Vienna, who called it
                    the “panaulon.”</p></note> he conceived the plugging of the lateral holes by the
                    valve keys then recently invented by Potter. But it was hardly possible to
                    obtain a perfect plugging of seven lateral holes with the aid of as many keys,
                    for the control of which there were only the two little fingers, and therefore
                    this invention of Orazi proved a failure.</p>
                <p>In 1808 Frederick Nolan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Patent, No. 3183.</p></note> of Stratford, near London, conceived an open
                    key, the lever of which, terminating by a ring, permitted the closing of a
                    lateral hole at the same time the key was being acted upon. The combination in
                    this double action is the embryo of the mechanism that a little later was to
                    transform the system of the flute. Two years later Macgregor,<note

                    a musical-instrument maker in London, constructed a bass flute an octave lower
                    than the ordinary flute. The idea was not new, as is proved by the existence of
                    the bass flute mentioned above. The difference between the two instruments lies
                    in the mechanism of the keys. That employed by Macgregor consisted of a double
                    lever, a contrivance dating from before the middle of the 18th century, of which
                    the application is seen in an oboe of large dimensions preserved in the National
                    Museum at Munich.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>About 1830 the celebrated French flautist Tulou added two more keys, those of F♯
                    and C♯, and a key, called “de cadence,” to facilitate the accompanying
                    shakes.</p>
                <p>To increase the number of keys, to improve their system of plugging, and to
                    extend the scale of the instrument in the lower region, —these had hitherto been
                    the principal problems dealt with in the improvement of the flute. No maker, no
                    inventor whose labours we have called attention to, had as yet devoted his
                    attention to the rational division of the column of air by means of the lateral
                    holes. In 1831 Theobald Boehm, a Bavarian, happening to be in London, was struck
                    with the power of tone the celebrated English performer Charles Nicholson drew
                    from his instrument. Boehm learned, and not without astonishment, that his
                    English colleague obtained this result by giving the lateral holes a much
                    greater diameter than was then usually admitted. About the same time Boehm made
                    the acquaintance of an amateur player named Gordon, who had effected certain
                    improvements; he had bored the lateral hole for the lower E, and had covered it
                    with a key, while he had replaced the key for F with a ring. These innovations
                    set Boehm about attempting a complete reform of the instrument.<note

                    well as by larger holes disposed along the tube in geometrical progression.</p>

                    the Paris Conservatoire, assisted by Auguste Buffet the younger, a
                    musical-instrument maker in that city, modified Boehm’s flute by closing the G♯
                    with a key, wishing thus to render the new fingering more conformable to the
                    old. He thus added a key, facilitating the shake upon C♯ with D♯, and brought
                    about some other changes in the instrument of less importance.</p>
                <p>Boehm had not, however, altered the bore of the flute, which had been conical
                    from the end of the 17th century. In 1846, however, he made further experiments,
                    and the results obtained were put in practice by the construction of a new
                    instrument, of which the body was bored cylindrical, but the head was modified
                    at the embouchure. The inventor thus obtained a remarkable equality in the tones
                    of the lower octave, a greater sonorousness, and a perfect accuracy of
                    intonation, by establishing the more exact proportions which a column of air of
                    cylindrical form permitted.</p>
                <p>The priority of Boehm’s invention was long contested, his detractors maintaining
                    that the honour of having reconstructed the flute was due to Gordon. But an
                    impartial investigation vindicates the claim of the former to the invention of
                    the large lateral holes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    harmonic by means of eleven holes so disposed that in opening them successively
                    they shorten the column of air in exact proportional quantities.<note

                    note-holes of wind instruments for every given pitch. This diagram gives the
                    position of the intermediate holes which he had been enabled to establish by a
                    rule of proportion based on the law of the lengths of strings.</p>
                <p>The Boehm flute, notwithstanding the high degree of perfection it has reached,
                    has not secured unanimous favour; even now there are players who prefer the
                    ordinary flute. The change of fingering required for some notes, the great
                    delicacy and liability to derangement of the mechanism, have something to do
                    with this. In England especially, the ordinary flute retains many partisans,
                    thanks to the improvements introduced by a clever player, Abel Siccama, in
                    1845.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Patent, No.

                    with open keys. He added some keys, and made a better disposition of the other
                    lateral holes, of which he increased the diameter, producing thus a sonorousness
                    almost equal to that of the Boehm flute, while yet preserving the old fingering
                    for the notes of the first two octaves. But in spite of these improvements the
                    old flute will not bear an impartial comparison with that of Boehm. (V. Μ.)</p>
