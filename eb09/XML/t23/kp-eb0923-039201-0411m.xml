                <p><label type="entry">TIME, <hi rend="smallcaps">Measurement of</hi></label>. Time
                    is measured by successive phenomena recurring at regular intervals. The only
                    astronomical phenomenon which rigorously fulfils this condition, and the most
                    striking one,—the apparent daily revolution of the celestial sphere caused by
                    the rotation of the earth,—has from the remotest antiquity been employed as a
                    measure of time. The interval between two successive returns of a fixed point on
                    the sphere to the meridian is called the sidereal day; and sidereal time is
                    reckoned from the moment when the “first point of Aries” (the vernal equinox)
                    passes the meridian, the hours being counted from 0 to 24. Clocks and
                    chronometers regulated to sidereal time are only used by astronomers, to whom
                    they are indispensable, as the sidereal time at any moment is equal to the right
                    ascension of any star just then passing the meridian. For ordinary purposes
                    solar time is used. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi> (vol. ii.
                    p. 771) it is shown that the solar day, as defined by the successive returns of
                    the sun to the meridian, does not furnish a uniform measure of time, owing to
                    the slightly variable velocity of the sun’s motion and the inclination of its
                    orbit to the equator, so that it becomes necessary to introduce an imaginary
                    mean sun moving in the equator with uniform velocity. The equation of time <hi
                    rend="italic">floc. cit.,</hi> pp. 772-773) is the difference between apparent
                    (or true) solar time and mean solar time. The latter is that shown by clocks and
                    watches used for ordinary purposes. Mean time is converted into apparent time by
                    applying the equation of time with its proper sign, as given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nautical Almanac</hi> and other ephemerides for every day at noon.
                    As the equation varies from day to day, it is necessary to take this into
                    account, if the apparent time is required for any moment different from noon.
                    The ephemerides also give the sidereal time at mean noon, from which it is easy
                    to find the sidereal time at any moment, as 24 hours of mean solar time are
                    equal to 24 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 3 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> 56'
                    ’ 5554 of sidereal time. About 21st March of each year a sidereal clock agrees
                    with a mean-time clock, but it gains on the latter 3 <hi rend="superscript">
                    m</hi> 56 <hi rend="superscript"> ,,</hi> 5 every day, so that in the course of
                    a year it has gained a whole day. For a place not on the meridian of Greenwich
                    the sidereal time at noon must be corrected by the addition or subtraction of
                    9’·8565 for each hour of longitude, according as the place is west or east of
                    Greenwich.</p>
                <p>While it has for obvious reasons become customary in all civilized countries to
                    commence the ordinary or civil day at midnight, astronomers count the day from
                    noon, being the transit of the mean sun across the meridian, in strict
                    conformity with the rule as to the beginning of the sidereal day. The hours of
                    the astronomical day are also counted from 0 to 24. An international conference
                    which met in the autumn of 1884 at Washington, to consider the question of
                    introducing a universal day (see below), has recommended that the astronomical
                    day should commence at midnight, to make it coincide with the civil day. The
                    great majority of American and Continental astronomers have, however, expressed
                    themselves very strongly against this change; and, even if it should be made in
                    the <hi rend="italic">British Nautical Almanac,</hi> it appears very doubtful
                    whether the other great ephemerides will adopt it, the more so as astronomers
                    have hitherto felt no inconvenience from the difference between the astronomical
                    and the civil day.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Determination of Time.—</hi> The problem of determining the
                    exact time at any moment is practically identical with that of determining the
                    apparent position of any known point on the celestial sphere with regard to one
                    of the fixed (imaginary) great circles appertaining to the observer’s station,
                    the meridian or the horizon. The point selected is either the sun or one of the
                    standard stars, the places of which are accurately determined and given for
                    every tenth day in the modern ephemerides. The time thus determined furnishes
                    the <hi rend="italic">error</hi> of the clock, chronometer, or watch employed,
                    and a second determination of time after an interval gives a new value of the
                    error and thereby the <hi rend="italic">rate</hi> of the timekeeper.</p>
                <p>The ancient astronomers, although they have left us very ample information about
                    their dials, water or sand clocks <hi rend="italic">(clepsydrae),</hi> and
                    similar timekeepers, are very reticent as to how these were controlled. Ptolemy,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Almagest,</hi> states nothing whatever as to how the
                    time was found when the numerous astronomical phenomena which he records took
                    place; but Hipparchus in the only book we possess from his hand gives a list of
                    forty-four stars scattered over the sky at intervals of right ascension equal to
                    exactly one hour, so that one or more of them would be on the meridian at the
                    commencement of every sidereal hour. In a very valuable paper<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Recherches sur l’Astronomie
                    des Anciens: I. Sur le chronomètre celeste d’Hipparque,” in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Copernicus: An International Journal of As· tronomu,</hi> i. p. 25.</p></note>
                    Schjellerup has shown that the right ascensions assumed by Hipparchus agree
                    within about 15' or one minute of time with those calculated back to the year
                    140 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> from modern star-places and proper motions.
                    The accuracy which, it thus appears, could be attained by the ancients in their
                    determinations of time <pb break="no"

                    necessary, as they only record astronomical phenomena <hi rend="italic"

                    the third hour,” or “about 8⅜ hours of the night,” without ever giving
                    minutes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For

                    perception of the importance of knowing the accurate time of phenomena, and in
                    the year 829 we find it stated that at the commencement of the solar eclipse on
                    30th November the altitude of the sun was 7° and at the end 24°, as observed at
                    Baghdad by Ahmed ibn Abdallah, called Habash.<note anchored="true"

                    100.</p></note> This seems to be the earliest determination of time by an
                    altitude; and this method then came into general use among the Arabians, who on
                    observing lunar eclipses never failed to measure the altitude of some bright
                    star at the beginning and end of the eclipse. In Europe this method was adopted
                    by Purbach and Regiomontanus, apparently for the first time in 1457. Bernhard
                    Walther, a pupil of the latter, seems to have been the first to use for
                    scientific purposes clocks driven by weights: he states that on 16th January
                    1484 he observed the rising of the planet Mercury and immediately attached the
                    weight to a clock having an hour-wheel with fifty-six teeth; at sunrise one hour
                    and thirty-five teeth had passed, so that the interval was an hour and
                    thirty-seven minutes. For nearly two hundred years, until the application of the
                    pendulum to clocks became general, astronomers could place little or no reliance
                    on their clocks, and consequently it was always necessary to fix the moment of
                    an observation by a simultaneous time determination. For this purpose Tycho
                    Brahe employed altitudes observed with quadrants; but he remarks that they are
                    not always of value, for if the star is taken too near the meridian the altitude
                    varies too slowly, and if too near the horizon the refraction (which at that
                    time was very imperfectly known) introduces an element of uncertainty. He
                    therefore preferred azimuths, or with the large “armillary spheres” which played
                    so important a part among his instruments he measured hour-angles or distances
                    from the meridian along the equator.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See his <hi rend="italic">Epistolae astronomicae,</hi> p.
                    73.</p></note> Transits of stars across the meridian were also observed with the
                    meridian quadrant, an instrument which is alluded to by Ptolemy and was
                    certainly in use at the Marágha (Persia) observatory in the 13th century, but of
                    which Tycho was the first to make extensive use. It appears, however, that he
                    chiefly employed it for determining star-places, having obtained the clock error
                    by the methods already described.</p>
                <p>In addition to these methods, that of “equal altitudes” was much in use during
                    the 17 th century. That equal distances east and west of the meridian correspond
                    to equal altitudes had of course been known as long as sun-dials had been used;
                    but, now that quadrants, cross-staves, and parallactic rules<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Navigation,</hi> vol. xvii. pp. 251 and 253.</p></note> were commonly employed
                    for measuring altitudes more accurately, the idea naturally suggested itself to
                    determine the time of a star’s or the sun’s meridian passage by noting the
                    moments when it reached any particular altitude on both sides of the meridian.
                    But Tycho’s plan of an instrument fixed in the meridian was not forgotten, and
                    from the end of the 17th century, when Roemer invented the transit instrument,
                    the observation of transits across the meridian became the principal means of
                    determining time at fixed observatories, while the observation of altitudes,
                    first by portable quadrants, afterwards by reflecting sextants, and during the
                    19th century by portable alt-azimuths or theodolites, has been used on
                    journeys.</p>
                <p>During the last fifty years the small transit instrument, with what is known as a
                    “broken telescope,” has also been much employed on scientific expeditions; but
                    great caution is necessary in using it, as the difficulties of getting a
                    perfectly rigid mounting for the prism or mirror which reflects the rays from
                    the object-glass through the axis to the eyepiece appear to be very great, for
                    strange discrepancies in the results have often been noticed. The gradual
                    development of astronomical instruments has been accompanied by a corresponding
                    development in timekeepers. From being very untrustworthy, astronomical clocks
                    are now made to great perfection by the application of the pendulum and by its
                    compensation, while the invention of chronometers has placed a portable and
                    equally trustworthy timekeeper in the hands of travellers.</p>
                <p>We shall now give a sketch of the principal methods of determining time.</p>
                <p>In the spherical triangle <hi rend="italic">ZPS</hi> between the zenith, the
                    pole, and a star the side ZP=90°-≠ (≠ being the latitude), <hi rend="italic"
                    >PS=9Q</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> o</hi><hi rend="italic">-δ (δ</hi>
                    being the declination), and <hi rend="italic">ZS</hi> or Z=90° minus the
                    observed altitude. The angle <hi rend="italic">ZPS=t</hi> is the star’s
                    hour-angle or, in time, the interval between the moment of observation and the
                    meridian passage of the star. We have then <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>, cos <hi
                    rend="italic">Z-</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> sin δ cos <hi rend="italic"

                <p>which formula can be made more convenient for the use of logarithms by putting
                    <hi rend="italic">Z+ φ</hi> + δ= <hi rend="italic">2S,</hi> which gives <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> sin(S-≠)sin(N-δ) tan^ <hi rend="italic">κt —</hi><hi

                    λ</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">cos</hi> £ cos(0 - <hi rend="italic">Z)</hi></p>
                <p>According as the star was observed west or east of the meridian, <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> will be positive or negative. If α be the right ascension
                    of the star, the sidereal time =Z + α, a as well as δ being taken from an
                    ephemeris. If the sun had been observed, the hour-angle <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    would be the apparent solar time. The altitude observed must be corrected for
                    refraction, and in the case of the sun also for parallax, while the sun’s
                    semi-diameter must be added or subtracted, according as the lower or upper limb
                    was observed. The declination of the sun being variable, and being given in the
                    ephemerides for noon of each day, allowance must be made for this by
                    interpolating with an approximate value of the time. As the altitude changes
                    very slowly near the meridian, this method is most advantageous if the star be
                    taken near the prime vertical, while it is also easy to see that the greater the
                    latitude the more uncertain the result. If a number of altitudes of the same
                    object are observed, it is not necessary to deduce the clock error separately
                    from each observation, but a correction may be applied to the mean of the zenith
                    distances. Supposing <hi rend="italic">n</hi> observations to be taken at the

                    Similarly an afternoon observation may be combined with an observation made the
                    following morning to find the time of apparent midnight.</p>
                <p>The observation of the time when a star has a certain azimuth may also be used
                    for determining the clock error, as the hour-angle can be found from the
                    declination, the latitude, and the azimuth. As the azimuth changes most rapidly
                    at the meridian, the observation is most advantageous there, besides which it is
                    neither necessary to know the latitude nor the declination accurately. In the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Geodesy</hi> (vol. x. p. 166) it has been shown how
                    the observed time of transit over the meridian is corrected for the deviations
                    of the instrument in azimuth, level, and collimation. This corrected time of
                    transit, expressed in sidereal time, should then be equal to the right ascension
                    of the object observed, and the difference is the clock error. In observatories
                    the determination of a clock’s error (a necessary operation during a night’s
                    work with a transit circle) is generally founded on observations of four or five
                    ‘ ‘ clock stars,” these being standard stars not near the pole, of which the
                    absolute right ascensions have been determined with great care, besides
                    observation of a close circumpolar star for finding the error of azimuth and
                    determination of level and collimation error.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The probable error of a clock coιτection

                <p>Observers in the field with portable instruments often find it inconvenient to
                    wait for the meridian transits of one of the few close circumpolar stars given
                    in the ephemerides. In that case they have recourse to what is known as the
                    method of time determination in the vertical of a pole star. The alt-azimuth is
                    first directed to one of the standard stars near the pole, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> or δ Ursae Minoris, using whichever is nearest to the
                    meridian at the time. The instrument is set so that the star in a few minutes
                    will cross the middle vertical wire in the field. The spirit-level is in the
                    meantime put on the axis and the inclination of the latter measured. The time of
                    the transit of the star is then observed, after which the instrument, remaining
                    clamped in azimuth, is turned to a clock star and the transit of this over all
                    the wires is observed. The level is applied again, and the mean of the two
                    results is used in the reductions. In case the collimation error of the
                    instrument is not accurately known, the instrument should be reversed and
                    another observation of the same kind taken. The observations made in each
                    position of the instrument are separately reduced with an assumed approximate
                    value of the error of collimation, and two equations are thus derived from which
                    the clock error and correction to the assumed collimation error are found. This
                    use of the transit or alt-azimuth out of the meridian throws considerably more
                    work on the computer than the meridian observations do, and it is therefore
                    never resorted to except when an observer during field operations is pressed for
                    time. The formulae of reduction as developed by Hansen in the <hi rend="italic"

                    spoken of the determination of local time. But in order to compare observations
                    made at different places on the surface of the earth a knowledge of their
                    difference of longitude becomes necessary, as the local time varies
                    proportionally with the longitude, one hour corresponding to 15°. Longitude can
                    be determined either geodetically or astronomically. The first method supposes
                    the earth to be a spheroid of known dimensions. Starting from a point of
                    departure of which the latitude has been determined, the azimuth from the
                    meridian (as determined astronomically) and the distance of some other station
                    are measured. This second station then serves as a point of departure to a
                    third, and by repeating this process the longitude and latitude of places at a
                    considerable distance from the original starting-point may be found. Referring
                    for this method to the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Earth (Figure of the),
                    Geodesy,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Surveying,</hi> we shall here only deal
                    with astronomical methods of determining longitude.</p>
                <p>The earliest astronomer who determined longitude by astronomical observations
                    seems to have been Hipparchus, who chose for a first meridian that of Rhodes,
                    where he observed; but Ptolemy adopted a meridian laid through the “Insulae
                    Fortunatae” as being the farthest known place towards the west.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was probably first done
                    in the first century by Marinus of Tyre.</p></note> When the voyages of
                    discovery began the peak of Teneriffe was frequently used as a first meridian,
                    until a scientific congress, assembled by Richelieu at Paris in 1630, selected
                    the island of Ferro for this purpose. Although various other meridians <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> that of Uranienburg and that of San Miguel, one of the
                    Azores, 29° 25' west of Paris) continued to be used for a long time, that of
                    Ferro, which received the authorization of Louis XIII. on 25th April 1634,
                    gradually superseded the others. In 1724 the longitude of Paris from the west
                    coast of Ferro was found by Louis Feuillée, who had been sent there by the Paris
                    Academy, to be 20° Γ 45"; but on the proposal of Guillaume de Lisle (1675-1726)
                    the meridian of Ferro was assumed to be exactly 20° west of the Paris
                    observatory. Modern maps and charts generally give the longitude from the
                    observatory of either Paris or Greenwich according to the nationality of the
                    constructor; the Washington meridian conference of 1884 has recommended the
                    exclusive use of the meridian of Greenwich. On the same occasion it was also
                    recommended to introduce the use of a “universal day,” beginning for the whole
                    earth at Greenwich midnight, without, however, interfering-with the use of local
                    time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This proposal was
                    chiefly dictated by a wish to facilitate the international telegraph and railway
                    traffic. In the United States, where the large extent of the country in
                    longitude makes it impossible to use the time of one meridian, four standard
                    meridians were adopted in 1883, viz., 75°, 90°, 105°, 120° west of Greenwich, so
                    that clocks showing “Eastern, Central, Mountain, or Pacific time” are exactly
                    five, six, seven, or eight hours slower than a Greenwich mean-time
                    clock.</p></note></p>
                <p>The simplest method for determining difference of longitude consists in observing
                    at the two stations some celestial phenomenon which occurs at the same absolute
                    moment for the whole earth. Hipparchus pointed out how observations of lunar
                    eclipses could be used in this way, and for about fifteen hundred years this was
                    the only method available. When <hi rend="smallcaps">Regiomontanus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(g.ν.)</hi> began to publish his ephemerides towards the end of
                    the 15th century, they furnished other means of determining the longitude. Thus
                    Amerigo Vespucci observed on 23d August 1499, somewhere on the coast of
                    Venezuela, that the moon at 7 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 30 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> m</hi> p.M. was 1°, at midnight 5£° east of Mars; from this
                    he concluded that they must have been in conjunction at 6 <hi rend="superscript"
                    > h</hi> 30 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi>, whereas the Nuremberg ephemeris
                    announced this to take place at midnight. This gave the longitude of his station
                    as roughly equal to 5 J hours west of Nuremberg. The instruments and the lunar
                    tables at that time being very imperfect, the longitudes determined were very
                    erroneous; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation</hi> (vol. xvii. p. 251), to
                    which article we may also refer for a history of the long-discussed problem of
                    finding the longitude at sea. The invention of the telescope early in the 17th
                    century made it possible to observe eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites; but there
                    is to a great extent the same drawback attached to these as to lunar eclipses,
                    that it is impossible to observe with sufficient accuracy the moments at which
                    they occur.</p>
                <p>Eclipses of the sun and occultations of stars by the moon were also much used for
                    determining longitude before the invention of chronometers and the electric
                    tele, graph offered better means for fixing the longitude of observatories.
                    These methods are now hardly ever employed except by travellers, as they are
                    very inferior as regards accuracy. For the necessary formulae see Chauvenet<pb

                    of right ascension is known, it is easy from the observed time of culmination at
                    two stations to deduce their difference of longitude. Let the right ascension of

                <p>In order to be as much as possible independent of instrumental errors, some
                    standard stars nearly on the parallel of the moon are observed at the two
                    stations; these “moon-culminating stars” are given in the ephemerides in order
                    to secure that both observers take the same stars. Ás either the preceding or
                    the following limb, not the centre, of the moon is observed, allowance must be
                    made for the time the semi-diameter takes to pass the meridian and for the
                    change of right ascension during this time. This method was proposed by Pigott
                    towards the end of the 18th century, and has been much used; but, though it may
                    be very serviceable on journeys and expeditions to distant places where the
                    chronometric and telegraphic methods cannot be employed, it is not accurate
                    enough for fixed observatories. This is due, not only to the difficulties
                    attending the observation (the difference of personal error in observing the
                    moon and stars, the different apparent enlargement of the moon by irradiation in
                    different telescopes and under different atmospheric circumstances, &amp;c.),
                    but chiefly to the large coefficient with which <hi rend="italic">ϴ'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic">ϴ</hi> has to be multiplied in the final
                    equation for λ' - λ. Errors of four to six seconds of time have therefore
                    frequently been noticed in longitudes obtained by this method from a limited
                    number of observations: the longitude of the Madras observatory was for many
                    years assumed to be 5 <hi rend="superscript"> h</hi> 21 <hi rend="superscript">
                    m</hi> 3 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> 77, but subsequently by a telegraphic

                    great.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Signals.—</hi> In 1671 Picard determined the difference of
                    longitude between Copenhagen and the site of Tycho Brahe’s observatory by
                    watching from the latter the covering and uncovering of a fire lighted on the
                    top of the observatory tower at Copenhagen. Powder or rocket signals have been
                    in use since the middle of the 18th century; they are nowadays never used for
                    this purpose, although several of the principal observatories of Europe were
                    connected in this manner early in the 19th century.<note anchored="true"

                    longitude was first tried in cases where the chronometers could be brought the
                    whole way by sea, but the improved means of communication on land led to its
                    adoption in 1828 between the observatories at Greenwich and Cambridge, and in
                    the following years between many other observatories. A few of the more
                    extensive expeditions undertaken for this object deserve to be mentioned. In
                    1843 more than sixty chronometers were sent sixteen times backwards and forwards
                    between Altona and Pulkowa, and in 1844 forty chronometers were sent the same
                    number of times between Altona and Greenwich.<note anchored="true"

                    of course only natural that the uncertainty of the results for the
                    trans-Atlantic longitude should be much greater, considering the length of time
                    which elapsed between the rating of the chronometers at the observatories of
                    Boston (Cambridge, Massachusetts) and Liverpool. The difficulty of the method
                    consists in determining the “travelling rate.” Each time a chronometer leaves
                    the station <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and returns to it the error is determined,
                    and consequently the rate for the time occupied by the journeys from <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> to <hi rend="italic">B</hi> and from <hi rend="italic"
                    >B</hi> to <hi rend="italic">A</hi> and by the sojourn at <hi rend="italic"
                    >B.</hi> Similarly a rate is found by each departure from and return to <hi

                    rend="italic">B</hi> is also utilized for determining the stationary rate. In
                    this way a series of rates for overlapping intervals of time are found, from
                    which the travelling rates may be interpolated. It is owing to the uncertainty
                    which necessarily attaches to the rate of a chronometer during long journeys,
                    especially by land, where they are exposed to shaking and more or less violent
                    motion, that it is desirable to employ a great number. It is scarcely necessary
                    to mention that the temperature correction for each chronometer must be
                    carefully investigated, and the local time rigorously determined at each station
                    during the entire period of the operations.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Telegraphic Determination of Longitude.—</hi> This was first
                    suggested by the American astronomer S. C. Walker, and owed its development to
                    the United States Coast Survey, where it was employed from about 1849. Nearly
                    all the more important public observatories on the continent of Europe have now
                    been connected in this way, chiefly at the instigation of the “Europäische
                    Gradmessung,” while the determinations in connexion with the transits of Venus
                    and those carried out in recent years by the American and French Governments
                    have completed the circuit of the greater part of the globe. The telegraphic
                    method compares the local time at one station with that at the other by means of
                    electric signals. If a signal is sent from the eastern station <hi rend="italic"
                    >A</hi> at the local time <hi rend="italic">T,</hi> and received at the western
                    station <hi rend="italic">B</hi> at the local time <hi rend="italic">T</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> γ</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> then, if the time taken
                    by the current to pass through the wire is called <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the
                    difference of longitude is <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >=T-T</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">+x,</hi> and
                    similarly, if a signal is sent from <hi rend="italic">B</hi> at the time <hi
                    rend="italic">T</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi> and received at <hi

                    from which the unknown quantity <hi rend="italic">x</hi> can be eliminated.</p>
                <p>The operations of a telegraphic longitude determination can be arranged in two
                    ways. Either the local time is determined at both stations and the clocks are
                    compared by telegraph, or the time determinations are marked simultaneously on
                    the two chronographs at the two stations, so that further signals for clock
                    comparison are unnecessary. The first method has to be used when the telegraph
                    is only for a limited time each night at the disposal of the observers, or when
                    the climatic conditions at the two stations are so different that clear weather
                    cannot often be expected to occur at both simultaneously, also when the
                    difference of longitude is so considerable that too much time would be lost at
                    the eastern station waiting for the arrival of the transit record of one star
                    from the western station before observing another star. The independent time
                    determination also offers the advantage that the observations may be taken
                    either by eye and ear or by the chronograph, and that the signals may be either
                    audible beats of a relay or chronographic signals, the rule being to have
                    observations and signals made by similar operations. The best way of using
                    audible beats of a relay is to let the circuit pass through an auxiliary clock,
                    which from second to second alternately makes and breaks the current, the making
                    of the current being rendered audible by the tapping of the relays at both
                    stations. If, now, the auxiliary and the observing clocks are regulated to a
                    different rate, the coincidences of the beats of the relay with those of the
                    observing clock can be noted with great accuracy, from which the difference
                    between the two observing clocks is found. It has been proved by experience that
                    the degree of accuracy with which the clock comparison can be made by one
                    coincidence is exactly equal to that of one chronograph signal, the probable
                    error being in both cases about ±0 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> O15. It
                    should, however, be mentioned that the interval between two consecutive
                    coincidences cannot be made less than two minutes, whereas the chronograph
                    signals may be given every second, and, as the observations made with the
                    chronograph are also somewhat more accurate than those made by eye and ear, the
                    chronograph should be used wherever possible. The other method, that of
                    simultaneous registration at both stations of transits of the same stars, has
                    also its advantages. Each transit observed at both stations furnishes a value of
                    the difference of longitude, so that the final result is less dependent on the
                    clock rate than in the first method, which necessitates the combination of a
                    series of clock <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n415/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0415-0396"/> errors determined during the night to form a
                    value of the clock error for the time when the exchange of signals took place.
                    When using this method it is advisable to select the stars in such a manner·
                    that only one station at a time is at work, so that the intensity of the current
                    can be readjusted (by means of a rheostat) between every despatch and receipt of
                    signals. This attention to the intensity of the current is necessary whatever
                    method is employed, as the constancy of the transmission time (ae in the above
                    equations) chiefly depends on the constancy of the current. The probable error
                    of a difference of longitude deduced from one star appears to be<note

                    rend="superscript"> s,</hi> 025.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the success of a determination of longitude depends to a very
                    great extent on the accurate determination of time at the two stations, and
                    great care must therefore be taken to determine the instrumental errors
                    repeatedly during a night’s work. But, in addition to the uncertainty which
                    enters into the results from the ordinary errors of observation, there is
                    another source of error which becomes of special importance in longitude work,
                    viz., the so-called personal error. The discovery of the fact that all observers
                    differ more or less in their estimation of the time when a star crosses one of
                    the spider lines in the transit instrument was made by Bessel in 1820<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Maskelyne had in 1795 noticed
                    that one of his assistants observed transits more than half a second later than
                    himself, but this was supposed to arise from some wrong method of observing
                    adopted by the assistant, and the matter was not further looked into</p></note>;
                    and, as he happened to differ fully a second of time from several other
                    observers, this remarkably large error naturally caused the phenomenon to be
                    carefully examined. Bessel also suggested what appears to be the right
                    explanation, viz., the co-operation of two senses in observing transits by eye
                    and ear, the ear having to count the beats of the clock while the eye compares
                    the distance of the star from the spider 1ine at the last beat before the
                    transit with the distance at the first beat after it, thus estimating the
                    fraction of second at which the transit took place. It can easily be conceived
                    that one person may first hear and then see, while to another these sensations
                    take place in the reverse order; and to this possible source of error may ώ
                    added the sensible time required by the transmission of sensations through the
                    nerves to the brain and for the latter to act upon them. As the chronographic
                    method of observing dispenses with one sense (that of hearing) and merely
                    requires the watching of the star’s motion and the pressing of an electric key
                    at the moment when the star is bisected by the thread, the personal errors
                    should in this case be much smaller than when the eye and ear method is
                    employed. And it is a fact that in the former method there have never occurred
                    errors of between half and a whole second such as have not unfrequently appeared
                    in the latter method.</p>
                <p>In astronomical observations generally this personal error does not cause any
                    inconvenience, so long as only one observer is employed at a time, and unless
                    the amount of the error varies with the declination or the magnitude of the
                    star; but when absolute time has to be determined, as in longitude work, the
                    full amount of the personal equation between the two observers must be carefully
                    ascertained and taken into account And an observer’s error has often been found
                    to vary very considerably not only from year to year but even within much
                    shorter intervals; the use of a new instrument though perhaps not differing in
                    construction from the accustomed one, has also been known to affect the personal
                    error. For a number of years this latter circumstance was coupled with another
                    which seemed perfectly incomprehensible, the personal error appearing to vary
                    with the reversal of the instrument, that is, with the position of the
                    illuminating lamp east or west But in 1869-70 Hirsch noticed during the
                    longitude operations in Switzerland that this was caused by a shifting of the
                    reflector inside the telescope, by means of which the field is illuminated,
                    which produced an apparent shifting of the image of the spider lines, unless the
                    eye-piece was very accurately focused for the observer’s sight. The simplest and
                    best way to find the equation between two observers is to let one observe the
                    transits of stars over half the wires in the telescope, and the other observe
                    the transits over the remainder, each taking care to refocus the eye-piece for
                    himself in order to avoid the above-mentioned source of error. The single
                    transits reduced to the middle wire give immediately the equation; and, in order
                    to eliminate errors in the assumed wire-intervals, each observer uses
                    alternately the first and the second half of the wires. Another method is in
                    vogue at Greenwich, where each observer with the transit circle from a series of
                    stars determines the clock error and reduces this to a common epoch (0 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> h</hi> sid. time) by means of a clock rate found
                    independently of personal error. The differences between the clock errors thus
                    found are equal to the personal equations. This method cannot, however, be
                    recommended, as the systematic errors in the right ascensions of the stars and
                    any slight variation of the clock rate would affect the personal equation; the
                    first method is therefore generally used in longitude work. It is advisable to
                    let the observers compare themselves at the beginning, middle, and end of the
                    operations and, if possible, at both the instruments employed. A useful check on
                    the results is afforded by simultaneous experiments with one of the instruments
                    contrived by C. Wolf, Kaiser, and others (sometimes called “time collimators”),
                    by which the absolute personal error of an observer can be determined. Though
                    differing much in detail, these instruments are all constructed on the same
                    principle: an artificial star (a lamp shining through a minute hole in a screen
                    mounted on a small carriage moved by clockwork) passes in succession across a
                    number of lines drawn on oiled paper, while an electric contact is made at the
                    precise moment when the star is bisected on each line by the carriage passing a
                    number of adjustable contact makers. The currents thus made register the
                    transits automatically on a chronograph, while the observer, viewing the
                    apparatus through his telescope, can observe the transits in the usual manner
                    either by eye and ear or by chronograph, thus immediately finding his personal
                    error. On the Continent these contrivances have frequently been used to educate
                    pupils learning to observe, and experience has repeatedly shown that a
                    considerable personal error can be generally somewhat diminished through
                    practice.</p>
