                        >Dunciad</hi> when as a playwright, a littérateur, a translator, and even as
                    a Shakespearean commentator, he will be entirely forgotten. The son of an
                    attorney, Theobald was born at Sittingbourne, in Kent, in 1688, and, after a
                    moderate education at Isleworth, studied for the profession of law,—a
                    profession, however, which he never practised. He was a man with literary
                    impulses, but without genius, even of a superficial kind; as a student, as a
                    commentator, he might have led a happy and enviable life, had not the vanity of
                    the literary idea led him into a false position. His <hi rend="italic">Persian
                        Princess</hi> (1711) and his <hi rend="italic">Electra</hi> (1714) gained no
                    distinction. In 1726 <hi rend="italic">The Double Falsehood</hi> had a certain
                    vogue, partly from Theobald’s pretence that the greater part of the play was by
                    Shakespeare. In 1717 he commenced a series of papers (not to “The Censor,” as
                    has sometimes been stated, but under that title) which appeared in Mist’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Weekly Journal;</hi> these do not seem to have been highly
                    thought of by his contemporaries, but they were successful in gaining for
                    Theobald not a few enemies, among whom Dennis may be named. Seven or eight years
                    later Theoba1d’s censorious tendencies had intensified rather than moderated,
                    and in 1726 he ventured to attack the most eminent literary man of the day in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Shakespear Restored, or a Specimen of the many Errors as
                        well committed as unamended by Mr Pope in his edition of this Poet.</hi> Two
                    years later the censor was himself castigated severely, and, as the dedicatee of
                        <hi rend="italic">The Dunciad,</hi> he had long an unenviable notoriety; as
                    readers of the famous satire will remember, he occupied the place of chief
                    victim until replaced by Colley Cibber in 1743. In the matter of Shakespeare
                    editing, however, he had the advantage of his powerful rival. When in 1733
                    Theobald published his edition of Shakespeare in seven volumes, that of Pope had
                    to go to the wall. Lewis Theobald wrote other dramas besides those already
                    mentioned, and translated plays from Sophocles and Aristophanes, besides a
                    rendering of Plato’s <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> and a part translation of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi>; but for none of these things is he now
                    remembered. The student of English history might find it worth while to glance
                    through Theobald’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Raleigh</hi> (1719). He died in
                    1744.</p>
