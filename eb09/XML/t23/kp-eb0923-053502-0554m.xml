                <p>“Unisegmental <hi rend="italic">Vermes,</hi> with a flattish, leaf-like, more or
                    less cylindrical body provided with organs of adhesion in the shape of suckers
                    and sometimes of chitinoid hooks. The cuticle, so called, appears to be a
                    metamorphosed layer of cells. There is a well-developed nervous system, the
                    ganglia of which are entirely supra-pharyngeal, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    dorsal. There is a mouth, and an alimentary canal which is usually forked, but
                    no anus. The excretory system has the form of more or less branching tubes
                    commencing with flamecells, and either ending in a contractile vesicle or
                    opening by two independent orifices. Hermaphrodite self-impregnation occurs, as
                    well as reciprocal impregnation. The embryo either develops direct into the
                    sexual form (mono-genetic <hi rend="italic">Trematoda)</hi> or gives origin to a
                    series of inter mediate non-sexual dimorphic forms (digenetic <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Historical Sketch.—</hi> Some of the more salient points in the
                    history of our knowledge of these animals have already been alluded to in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Parasitism (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.);</hi> a
                    few additional facts must, however, be mentioned here. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trematoda</hi> were first formed into a group by Rudolphi (2), who included in
                    it the following genera :— <hi rend="italic">Monostoma, Amphistoma, Distoma,
                    Tristoma, Pentastoma,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Polystoma</hi>; the name had
                    reference to the suckers, which Rudolphi regarded as being for the most part
                    openings into the body (Gr. <hi rend="italic">τρῆμα,</hi> an aperture). Some of
                    these forms were soon perceived to have but small connexion with the others; and
                    Cuvier (3) reduced the whole to one genus, for which he adopted the name <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasciola,</hi> Linn. The Pentastomes have since been transferred
                    to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnida</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>)∙</p>
                <p>Our scientific acquaintance with the group may be said to date from 1831, when
                    Mehlis noticed that the eggs of certain Distomes hatched into a minute ciliated
                    body with an eye-speck resembling an Infusorian, an observation which gave the
                    key to the life-history of these forms. Von Siebold in 1835 (4) supplemented
                    this discovery by the observation that the ciliated embryo of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Monostomum mutabile</hi> contained, as a “necessary parasite,” as it was
                    termed, an organism identical with the “kingsyellow worm” (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Redia),</hi> found by Bojanus in pond-snails, and Von Baer had previously shown
                    (5) that these gave rise to free-swimming organisms not unlike tailed
                    Trematodes. The materials were thus ready to hand for a co-ordination of the
                    whole life-history, and Steenstrup recognized it as an instance of the so-called
                    “alternation of generations” (6). These researches received important additions
                    at the hands of Pagenstecher (7) and others, who showed experimentally that
                    encysted Distomes grow mature directly after their transference from one host to
                    another, and thus that a migration is necessary to the attainment of their
                    maturity, Diesing’s great work (8) appeared in 1850, and has formed the
                    groundwork of all subsequent treatises on the systematic arrangement of
                    parasitic worms, although it included forms which really belong to quite
                    different groups. In 1861 Van Beneden gained a prize offered by the French
                    Academy by his elaborate memoir on the intestinal worms (9), in which he not
                    only described many new and interesting forms, but gave anatomical details
                    regarding others previously known, and entered into detailed comparisons between
                    the Cestodes and Trematodes, both in their adult and immature states. Of recent
                    years the chief additions to our knowledge have been more in the direction of
                    further details regarding the structure and life-history of special forms than
                    the elaboration of new general principles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Anatomy.—</hi> In endeavouring to give a very brief account of
                    the more salient points in the anatomy of the <hi rend="italic">Trematoda</hi>
                    it has been thought expedient to select some well-known form as a type, and
                    afterwards to indicate the characters in which other species differ from it; for
                    this purpose the common liver-fluke, <hi rend="italic">Fasciola {Distomum)
                    hepatica</hi> has been chosen, as it is not unfrequently found in the bile-ducts
                    of sheep and other domestic animals, and constitutes a scourge much dreaded by
                    farmers. The account here given is in the main abstracted from Sommer (10).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">External Appearance. —</hi> The animal has a flattened oval
                    shape, with a sub-triangular process on the broader end, which represents the
                    head. The total length varies from 20 to 35 mm., the breadth from 6 to 12 mm. On
                    superficial examination two narrower lateral areas may generally be
                    distinguished from a broader median one; the former are occasionally of a
                    coarsely granular appearance and reddish-brown or orange in colour, and increase
                    in breadth towards the posterior end of the body, where they commonly unite. The
                    median area is commonly greyish-yellow in colour, sometimes spotted with black;
                    its anterior portion corresponds to the uterus, the posterior to the testes. Two
                    suckers (fig. 1, A, <hi rend="italic">o, s)</hi> are in the middle line of the
                    body; one is at the anterior extremity, and is directed forwards and somewhat
                    downwards; it is known as the <pb break="no"

                    oesophagus. The posterior or ventral sucker is situated, as its name implies, on
                    the inferior surface of the body, just behind the head-papilla. The suckers
                    measure on an average about 1 mm. in diameter, the ventral being slightly the
                    larger. The internal organs communicate with the outer world by four apertures
                    :—(1) the mouth (o), situated at the anterior pole of the body and perforating
                    the oral sucker; (2) the excretory pore (<hi rend="italic">x</hi>), placed at
                    the opposite extremity, and giving exit to the effete products; (3) the porus
                    genitalis (fig. 1, B, <hi rend="italic">p),</hi> leading into a sinus into which
                    the ducts of both sets of genital organs open,—it is to be found on the under
                    surface of the headpapilla at or near its centre; (4) the opening of the
                    Laurer-Stieda canal, situated on the dorsal surface of the animal, near the
                    junction of the two portions of the median area,—it is excessively minute and
                    difficult of detection, and leads by a narrow canal into the duct of the
                    yolk-gland.</p>
                <p>Internal Structure.—All Trematoda have been commonly regarded, like other
                    flat-worms, as devoid of a body-cavity (coelom), and as consisting of
                    parenchymatous tissue, in which the various organs were embedded. Recent
                    researches of Fraipont (15) appear to show, however, that the intercellular
                    spaces in this tissue are to be regarded as the homologue of a coelom. The body
                    is enclosed by a complex sheath (cortex), which may be resolved into several
                    layers, which will be discussed in order, proceeding from without inwards. (1)
                    The cuticle, which encloses the whole body, is a thin, pellucid, structureless
                    membrane; at the margin of the mouth it is reflected so as to form a lining for
                    the oesophagus, and similarly at the opening of the genital sinus it passes
                    inwards to form a lining to the vagina. The same phenomenon is observed at the
                    excretory aperture. By the application of ammonia the cuticle may be separated
                    from the subjacent tissues and its peculiarities demonstrated; although
                    apparently smooth to the naked eye, it presents under the microscope numerous
                    sharp backwardly directed processes, each of which encloses a hard stylet-shaped
                    body. These prominences are closely set over the whole body except immediately
                    around the suckers, extending even into the interior of the sinus genitalis. The
                    cuticle is furthermore perforated by innumerable fine pores, directed outwards
                    and somewhat backwards. With regard to the homology of the cuticle of Trematodes
                    the same uncertainty prevails as in the case of Cestodes (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Taγe-Worms);</hi> the general opinion is that it is not
                    comparable with the chitinous cuticle of <hi rend="italic">Arthropoda,</hi> but
                    is either a specially developed basement-membrane (Herbert, 11) or a layer of
                    modified cells (Ziegler, 12, and Schwarze, 13). (2) The outer cellular layer is
                    the matrix of the cuticle. (3) The muscular coat consists of three different
                    layers:—(i.) a thin layer of circular fibres; (ii.) the longitudinal muscles,
                    which form a series of separate bundles; (iii.) the oblique muscles, confined to
                    the anterior half or third of the body, and crossing so as to form a rhomboidal
                    lattice-work,—they are especially strong on the anterior ventral aspect of the
                    animal. (4) The inner cellular layer consists of elements which closely resemble
                    those of the outer, but are somewhat larger; they have been mistaken by various
                    observers for cuticular glands. The suckers may be considered as parts of the
                    cortical layer; speaking generally, each has the form of the segment of a
                    sphere, although the anterior one is shallower at the lower than at the upper
                    margin, and is penetrated by the oesophagus. Each consists of three sets of
                    muscles,—a thin outer equatorial layer, a second meridional, and a mass of
                    radially disposed fibres forming the greater part of the substance. It would
                    appear that the function of the first two of these groups is to flatten out the
                    sucker, whilst the radial ones restore its cavity and thus produce a suctorial
                    action. To the ventral sucker are attached a number of muscular fibres belonging
                    to the dorso-ventral system, and in particular a strong bundle, which passes
                    from behind downwards and forwards.</p>
                <p>The digestive system (fig. 1, A), the presence of which furnishes one of the most
                    characteristic differences between Trematodes and Cestodes, extends throughout
                    the body on a plane between the peripheral nervous and reproductive systems. It
                    has only one aperture, as above mentioned, in the centre of the anterior sucker.
                    The anterior portion or pharynx, although very short, measuring not much more
                    than 1 mm. in length, is again divisible into two sections. The hinder of these
                    is the larger, and is sometimes spheroidal but more commonly fusiform in shape;
                    it has strong muscular walls, which, in conjunction with protractor and
                    retractor muscles, bring about a kind of pumping action whereby nutritive fluids
                    are taken into the stomach, which name may be applied to the larger posterior
                    section of the alimentary tract, since in it the digestive processes are carried
                    on. The canal, which leads from the posterior end of the pharynx, divides almost
                    immediately into two branches, which diverge at first rapidly and then run
                    almost parallel, as far as the hinder end of the body. Each of these gives off
                    from its outer aspect some 16 or 17 lateral branches (c), which divide and
                    subdivide till their ramifications fill nearly the whole area of the body. The
                    digestive tract is lined by a layer of simple cells, resembling a cylinder
                    epithelium. These behave towards the blood corpuscles and other contents of the
                    intestine exactly as would a number of <hi rend="italic">Amoebae,</hi> putting
                    out processes or pseudopodia, which ingest them,— so that, in common with many
                    of the lower Invertebrates, the liver-fluke lives by “intracellular digestion”
                    (see Metschnikoff, 14).</p>
                <p>The canals of the excretory system (<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) may be divided into
                    three groups. (1) The collecting network consists of very fine tubules which
                    anastomose freely with each other: they are situated on the boundary between the
                    cortical and middle layers, and arc therefore visible from either side of the
                    body. (2) Conducting vessels (<hi rend="italic">v</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d)</hi> receive the contents of this network. Each of these is formed by the
                    union of a larger or smaller number of the delicate canals just described, and
                    after a longer or shorter course opens into the median excretory canal (<hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi>). On the way, however, it communicates with the
                    neighbouring vessels, so that a second network is formed, which is distinguished
                    from that of the collecting tubules by the greater size of its meshes and by the
                    fact that it is specially visible from the dorsal surface of the animal. In the
                    head four of these conducting vessels arise, which are disposed in two pairs,
                    one situated dorsally and one ventrally. As they pass backwards they receive
                    many branches, the dorsal unites with the ventral of its own side, and the two
                    tubes thus formed unite to constitute the last division of the excretory system.
                    (3) The median vessel (<hi rend="italic">m</hi>) passes along the body for the
                    posterior two-thirds of its length, immediately beneath the dorsal cortical
                    layer. It is widest near the commencement, where it measures about 0∙5 mm. in
                    diameter, and finally opens at the posterior extremity of the body. The wall of
                    the excretory apparatus is constituted everywhere by an exceedingly delicate
                    elastic membrane, which exhibits neither a cellular lining nor cilia;
                    furthermore, neither valves nor muscles have been demonstrated in connexion with
                    it. It contains a thin colourless fluid, in which very small highly refractive
                    drops are suspended.</p>
                <p>The details of the termination of the excretory system seem to have been first
                    clearly made out by Fraipont (15), who worked upon species in which they are
                    more distinct than in the form now under consideration. The spaces between the
                    round connectivetissue cells of the body are star-shaped in form, and into these
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n556/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0556-0537"/> finest excretory tubules, above mentioned, open
                    by funnels (fig. 1, D), into each of which projects a vibratile cilium, thus
                    constituting the so-called “flame-cells.” These researches have given rise to
                    numerous differences of opinion, as regards questions both of fact (16) and of
                    priority (17).</p>
                <p>The liver-fluke contains a complete set of male and female organs, which form the
                    most conspicuous part of its anatomy, and both of which open into the genital
                    sinus which has been described above. <hi rend="italic">A. The Male Organs.</hi>
                    (i.) The testes (fig. 1, B, <hi rend="italic">t</hi>) are two in number,
                    situated one behind the other in the hinder division of the median area. They
                    rest upon the ventral cortical layer in the parenchyma of the body, and
                    immediately above them are the ramifications of the digestive tract. Each
                    consists of a large number of ramifying tubes, often with slightly dilated
                    extremities. These unite into three or four, and eventually into two, main
                    excretory ducts <hi rend="italic">(va, vp),</hi> which terminate at the base of
                    the cirrus-pouch. Within the testicular tubules may be found spermatozoa in all
                    stages of development; the first stage appears to consist of small roundish
                    membraneless cells with a single nucleus; the nucleus then divides and the cells
                    become polygonal from mutual pressure. These large cells lie in the middle
                    rather than at the sides of the tube, and among them are a number which, while
                    they possess on one side a smooth evenly rounded contour, are on the other very
                    irregularly and deeply serrated. These serrations elongate until they become the
                    delicate filaments of spermatozoa, the small shining heads of which are still
                    embedded in the protoplasm of the cell. (ii.) The vasa deferentia <hi
                    rend="italic">(va, vp)</hi> are a pair of slender elongated canals, which lie on
                    the two sides of the middle line, and unite at the inner extremity of the
                    cirrus-pouch, which they penetrate in common. Their walls consist of a very
                    delicate homogeneous but resistant membrane, upon which contractile fibres are
                    disposed, close together and parallel to the axis. (iii.) The cirrus-pouch (cs)
                    is a muscular egg-shaped organ; the upper pole, which receives the united vasa
                    deferentia, is situated above the ventral sucker and separated by only a very
                    slight interval from the dorsal cortical layer, whilst the position of the lower
                    pole is indicated by the porus genitalis (<hi rend="italic">p</hi>). The muscles
                    are disposed in two layers, of which the inner is thin and composed of circular
                    fibres; the outer longitudinal layer is much thicker, and its fibres are
                    disposed in bundles; furthermore its apex receives a large number of
                    dorso-ventral fibres. Within the cirrus-pouch the two terminal sections of the
                    male conducting apparatus are situated. (iv. ) The first of these is the
                    vesicula seminalis (fig. 1, B, <hi rend="italic">vs</hi>; C, <hi rend="italic"
                    >g),</hi> a large, spindle-shaped dilatation of the canal usually more or less
                    curved upon itself. Its wall is somewhat more complex than that of the vasa
                    deferentia, consisting of a layer of tissue with many nuclei but no distinct
                    cell-boundaries, succeeded by a delicate layer of circular muscular fibres,
                    which is again followed by a layer of longitudinal ones. (v. ) The ductus
                    ejaculatorius (fig. 1, C, <hi rend="italic">h</hi>), which immediately succeeds
                    the vesicula seminalis, is a long slender tube, disposed in coils, and usually
                    projecting like a papilla into the base of the sinus genitalis. Its walls are
                    furnished with a number of unicellular glands. <hi rend="italic">B. The Female
                    Organs.</hi> The female reproductive apparatus may be roughly divided into two
                    portions, that which produces the eggs and that which conveys them to the
                    outside of the body; in the former of these processes three organs take part—one
                    producing the germ, another the secondary or food-yolk, and a third the
                    egg-shell. (i. ) The germarium or ovary (fig. 1, B, <hi rend="italic">o</hi>) is
                    situated between the anterior testis and the ventral sucker, in about three
                    cases out of four on the right hand side of the body. It has the form of a
                    branching tubular gland, the ramification being dichotomous throughout; in most
                    cases the branches are about as large as the stems which give rise to them. The
                    oviduct passes towards the shell-gland, narrowing as it approaches this, and
                    finally unites with the excretory duct of the yolk-glands. (ii.) The yolk-glands
                    <hi rend="italic">(y)</hi> of the liver-fluke are paired organs of considerable
                    size; they extend over both lateral areas, to which they impart the opaque
                    appearance and reddish colour above alluded to. They are composed of innumerable
                    small acini, spheroidal in shape and situated in groups on minute ductules,
                    which unite to form a longitudinal canal on either side of the body. These
                    canals are on the whole parallel to the margins of the animal and distant from
                    it about one-fifth of its greatest breadth. At the anterior margin of the
                    testicular area each longitudinal canal gives off a transverse branch, which
                    unites with its fellow of the opposite side in the middle line to form a
                    pear-shaped reservoir, situated just behind the posterior margin of the
                    shell-gland. From this reservoir the common yolk-duct passes forwards in the
                    substance of the shellgland and there unites with the oviduct. Previously to
                    this, however, it gives off a minute canal, which after an upward course opens
                    on the dorsal surface of the animal; it is known as the Laurer-Stieda canal, and
                    its function has been the subject of much discussion. It has been supposed (1)
                    “to serve for copulatory purposes,” as has been seen by Zeller (18) in <hi
                    rend="italic">Polystomum,</hi> and as is supported by its structure in <hi
                    rend="italic">Axine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Microcotyle,</hi> and (2) “to act
                    as a safety tube for the escape of over-abundant or altered vitelline products
                    and spermatozoa,” the main argument in support of which is that its calibre is
                    too narrow to admit of copulation taking place by its means; compare Sommer
                    (10), Kerbert (11), Poirier (19), Loose (20), and Lorenz (21). (iii.) The uterus
                    or female conducting apparatus (<hi rend="italic">u</hi>) originates at the
                    union of the ducts of the germarium and yolk-gland. Its first portion, which
                    lies within the shell-gland, is a delicate narrow canal, except when it is
                    distended either by eggs or by semen. The median section of the organ is by far
                    the largest both in length and breadth; it occupies almost the whole of the
                    anterior part of the median area of the animal, between the ventral sucker and
                    the shell-gland, and forms four or five large coils lying alternately right and
                    left, which as a rule are filled with completely formed eggs. The third section
                    of this organ includes the coils which lie above and anterior to the ventral
                    sucker; it is sometimes called the vagina. When it contains eggs these are
                    generally in a single file, and thus give it a moniliform appearance; it lies
                    entirely on the left side of the body, gradually approaching the middle line as
                    it passes forward, until it ends below the cirrus-pouch at the left and
                    posterior aspect of the genital pore (fig. 1, C, <hi rend="italic">e</hi>).
                    (iv.) The shell-gland (fig. 1, B, s), which (as its name implies) furnishes the
                    external coating of the eggs, has been already several times mentioned. In the
                    Trematodes, as in the tape-worms, it forms a kind of central point of the female
                    generative system; it is a spheroidal mass of unicellular glands, each of which
                    opens by its own special duct into the commencement of the uterus. The secretion
                    of the shell-gland is liberated in the form of small pellucid droplets, which
                    unite to form drops; afterwards it becomes thick and viscid and of a mahogany
                    brown colour. In this condition the drops are dispersed through the uterus mixed
                    with the secretions of the other genital glands, and they apply themselves to
                    the recently formed eggs, producing a delicate membrane around them. This
                    process is carried on in those coils of the uterus which lie immediately outside
                    the shell-gland, corresponding to the “ootype” described by Van Beneden in other
                    Trematodes.</p>
                <p>The eggs undergo a gradual development as they pass along the uterus. The ripe
                    primitive ovum, on entering the female conducting apparatus, becomes coated with
                    a larger or smaller number of spherules of secondary yolk, and then undergoes
                    the process of segmentation which leads to the formation of a morula. At this
                    point it receives the secretion of the shell-gland. The completely formed egg
                    (fig. 1, E) has a length of 0∙13 mm. and is ovoid in shape, with a small lid or
                    operculum at the broader end; its contents consist of a number of roundly
                    polygonal cells, with only a small quantity of secondary yolk remaining among
                    them. All of these but one have a thick granular protoplasm, the exceptional
                    cell having homogeneous and strongly refracting contents. It usually lies
                    immediately under the operculum, and is partly embedded in the other cells. They
                    are often present in the bile-ducts in such quantities as to form a stiff
                    brownish mass resembling wet sand, and the number produced by a single fluke has
                    been estimated at half a million.</p>
                <p>The mode of fertilization of the liver-fluke has given rise to much discussion.
                    According to Sommer, the organ which has usually been described as a cirrus or
                    penis is merely the genital sinus eva-ginated by abnormal pressure (fig. 1, C,
                    <hi rend="italic">d)</hi>; it is furthermore but ill-adapted to enter either of
                    the canals which could possibly serve as a vagina. He is therefore of opinion
                    that self-impregnation occurs, the external aperture being closed by the oblique
                    muscles, and the semen passing directly from the vas deferens through the
                    genital sinus into the uterus. The whole question of the fertilization of the
                    Trematodes is a matter on which very varied opinions have been expressed, even
                    by authors who have examined the same forms. The assertion of Von Siebold that a
                    direct internal communication exists between the male and female organs has been
                    denied by Stieda (22) and by many subsequent writers, but has been restated by
                    Lorenz (21) and by Zeller in the case of <hi rend="italic">Polystomum
                    integerrimum</hi> (18); however this may be, there can be no doubt that
                    self-impregnation does occur in certain cases. The structure of the organs
                    renders it more than probable in some species (see Poirier, 19, p. 582); Zaddach
                    has observed it actually taking place in <hi rend="italic">Distomum
                    cirrigerum</hi> encysted in <hi rend="italic">Astacus</hi> (23), and a single
                    <hi rend="italic">Polystomum integerrimum</hi> has been found in a frog’s
                    bladder with sperm in the female passages. Reciprocal fertilization, in which
                    two individuals act both as male and female simultaneously, has been recorded by
                    Zeller in <hi rend="italic">Polystomum integerrimum,</hi> by Looss (20) in <hi
                    rend="italic">Distomum clavigerum,</hi> and by Cobbold in <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The nervous system consists of a commissure passing round the oesophagus very

                    and Leuckart (26); regarding the question of priority see Jackson (27).</p>
                <p>The development of the embryo can only take place outside the body of the host
                    and at a lower temperature, the most favourable being from 23° to 26° C., at
                    which the process occupies two or three weeks. The free embryo (fig. 2, A) is
                    conical in shape, with a rounded apex, its average length being 0∙13 mm. At the
                    broader anterior end is a retractile head-papilla, with the exception of which
                    the body <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n557/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0557-0538"/> is ciliated all over. The interior of the body is
                    composed of granular nucleated cells, and it contains a double eye-spot,
                    composed of two crescentic masses of pigment. There are also two ciliated
                    funnels forming the rudiments of the excretory system and a granular mass behind
                    the head-papilla, probably representing the digestive tract. The embryo swims
                    actively about, but if it does not succeed in meeting the appropriate host for
                    its next stage of development (<hi rend="italic">Limnaeus truncatulus,</hi> a
                    small pond snail) its period of vitality seems to be limited to about eight
                    hours. If it should meet with one of these snails it applies the head-papilla to
                    some part of its surface and begins to bore, twisting round and round on its
                    axis by means of its cilia, the head-papilla becoming pointed and elongated to
                    four or five times its original length. Eventually the tissues of the snail are
                    separated as if by a wedge, and a gap is formed through which the embryo forces
                    an entrance into its body. Here it undergoes a metamorphosis, losing its organs
                    of locomotion and becoming what is termed a “sporocyst” (fig. 2, B). This is an
                    elliptical sac, which commonly attains a length of 07 mm. Its wall consists of a
                    structureless cuticle, beneath which are external, circular, and internal
                    longitudinal muscle-fibres. These are succeeded by an epithelium, the elements
                    of which vary greatly in size. These sporocysts may be produced by a process of
                    transverse fission. Within the sporocyst rounded masses of cells are formed
                    (morulae), which undergo a process of invagination, producing a gastrula, which
                    again develops by the formation of a digestive tract into what is known as a
                    “redia” (fig 2, C, D). This forces its way through the wall of the sporocyst,
                    which heals up immediately, and then wanders through the tissue of the snail,
                    most commonly finding its way to the liver. If many rediae are present the snail
                    usually perishes. The adult redia may attain a length of 1∙6 mm. It has an
                    elongated cylindrical form, and near its posterior extremity are two processes
                    directed backwards, which probably serve as aids to locomotion. At the anterior
                    extremity is the mouth, leading into a muscular pharynx, followed by a saccular
                    digestive tract. A ring-shaped thickening is seen a little way behind the mouth,
                    and immediately posterior to this a special aperture for the exit of the germs
                    formed within the redia. About a score of these are usually to be found in all
                    stages of development, the earliest being a rounded mass of cells (morula),
                    which elongates, one end at the same time becoming more attenuated than the
                    other, and gradually forming an elongated tail, while the body becomes oval and
                    depressed (fig. 2, E). Two suckers and the rudiment of the future digestive
                    tract make their appearance. As soon as the “cercaria,” this being the name
                    given to the present organism, has attained this stage of development it emerges
                    from the redia, and by the aid of its suckers and tail wriggles its way out of
                    the host, swimming freely about in the water. Like other cercariae developed in
                    rediae this one has no head-spine, but in mature examples the anterior of the
                    body often exhibits a number of very minute spines. An interesting feature in
                    the animal is the presence of the “cysto-genous cells,” two lobate masses
                    arranged one on each side of the body. These cells contain small rod-like
                    bodies, whence they have been termed “cellules à batonnets,” and similar bodies
                    have been found in the protective cyst which they excrete; Sonsino (28) has
                    suggested that they may assist in imparting stiffness to this structure, and has
                    noticed that they are more abundant in those forms which encyst in the open air.
                    When the cercaria has swum about for a short time it finds its way to the
                    water-plants, and encysts itself on their stems and leaves. During this process
                    the tail is swung vigorously about, until finally a more violent motion detaches
                    it; at the same time the cells just mentioned throw out a gummy secretion, which
                    rapidly hardens and encloses the cercaria in a kind of case. It is in this
                    condition that the larvae are swallowed by the grazing sheep to form sexually
                    mature flukes in their livers.</p>
                <p>The life-history of a typical digenetic Trematode may be summed up as
                    follows:—(1) the <hi rend="italic">egg,</hi> produced sexually; (2) the <hi
                    rend="italic">ciliated embryo·,</hi> (3) the <hi rend="italic">sporocyst·,</hi>
                    (4) the <hi rend="italic">redia,</hi> produced asexually; (5) the <hi
                    rend="italic">cercaria,</hi> produced asexually; (6) the <hi rend="italic">adult
                    Trematode.</hi> Hence it would appear that the digenetic forms have at least
                    one, usually many, asexual generations before the sexual one appears. The embryo
                    may form either a sporocyst or a redia, these two forms being distinguished by
                    the presence of a digestive tract and of a special birth-opening in the latter.
                    Within these parent forms the germs may arise from two sources,—the cells which
                    occupy the central region of the young sporocyst or redia, or the epithelium
                    lining the body-walls. “The germs to which a sporocyst gives origin may develop
                    in some instances into sporocysts, in others into rediae or into cercariae. And
                    it does not seem certain that there is any limit to the possible number of
                    successive generations of rediae. Both cercariae and rediae may occur side by
                    side in the same nurse. The last term in the series is, however, invariably a
                    cercaria.”</p>
                <p>Pagenstecher, Ercolani (29), and others have stated that the tail of a cercaria
                    may become a sporocyst and produce germs, but this has not met with general
                    acceptance, and the supposition is not supported by the structure of the tail,
                    which consists of a “contractile substance, occupying the axis and periphery,
                    with large vesicular cells between” (Schwarze, 13). Ercolani (29) has also
                    published striking statements to the effect that the structure of these entozoa
                    is so profoundly modified by their habitat that what have been hitherto
                    described as distinct species may be only “local varieties”; thus he finds that

                <p>For the general principles which govern the pathological effects of Trematodes in
                    common with other entozoa, reference may be made to the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Tape-Worms</hi>; only a few special cases need be alluded to
                    here. The occurrence of most of the forms in the above list has only been
                    recorded very few times, and in many cases the effects produced were very
                    inadequately studied, so that we can hardly be said to possess a knowledge of
                    their individual pathology. In a case of <hi rend="italic">Distomum
                    lanceolatum</hi> which occurred in Bohemia, the liver was enormously enlarged
                    and the contracted gall-bladder contained eight calculi and forty-seven flukes;
                    the symptoms during life were emaciation, pain over the liver, and distention of
                    the abdomen.</p>
                <p>The effects produced by <hi rend="italic">Bilharzia haematobia</hi> are very well
                    defined and exceedingly disastrous. The mature worms in couples <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n558/mode/1up"

                    urinary bladder and mesentery; extravasations of blood and villous growths or
                    ulcerations of the mucous membrane of the bladder present themselves, and thus
                    the eggs of the parasite find their way into the urine, in which they are
                    evacuated, and can be detected by microscopic examination. With the
                    characteristic presence of the eggs are associated colic, anaemia, and great
                    prostration of the vital powers, more particularly in the later stages; the
                    disease when once fairly established is almost always fatal; see Cobbold
                    (1).</p>
                <p>From a practical point of view by far the most important Trematode is <hi
                    rend="italic">Fasciola (Distomum) hepatica,</hi> which gives rise to the disease
                    known as “liver rot” in sheep. It is always more or less abundant in certain
                    districts, and it is estimated that in the United Kingdom the annual loss of
                    sheep due to it is not less than 1,000,000. The symptoms are said to be
                    emaciation, tenderness in the loins, harshness and dryness of the wool, and a
                    scaly condition of the skin. On post-mortem examination fluid is found in the
                    peritoneal cavity and the viscera have a blanched appearance; the liver is dark
                    chocolate or sometimes pale in colour, nodular, and uneven, the ducts are
                    thickened and Distomes are found within them. Dead flukes have been known to
                    furnish the nuclei of gall-stones in the gall-bladder. Briefly stated, the
                    principal preventive measures seem to be as follows :—(1) destruction of the
                    eggs, and especially abstention from putting manure of rotten sheep on damp
                    ground; (2) slaughter of sheep which are badly fluked; (3) adequate drainage of
                    pastures; (4) an allowance of salt and a little dry food to the sheep; and (5)
                    dressings of lime or salt on the ground to destroy the embryos (Thomas, 25). A
                    series of wet seasons increases the prevalence of the malady, and animals which
                    have been allowed to graze in low-lying ill-drained lands arc specially liable
                    to infection—facts which are readily explicable on a consideration of the
                    life-history given above.</p>

                    large numbers. The eggs hatch in the water, continuing to be attached to the
                    gill by a filament at one extremity. The embryo is elongated oval in shape, and
                    ciliated all over; on its back are two eyes, consisting of a cup-shaped mass of
                    pigment, with a spheroidal lenticular body. It presents also the mouth with two
                    peculiar suckers, the oesophagus and intestine, and the two claspers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diporpa.</hi> The embryo swims vigorously about until it finds its
                    way to the gill of a minnow, failing which it dies in about six hours. Attached
                    to its host it may live isolated for a considerable time, increasing in size;
                    usually, however, it unites with another individual in a kind of reciprocal
                    copulation (fig. 3, A). One individual by means of its ventral sucker seizes the
                    dorsal papilla of another, and then the two twist across each other so that the
                    sucker of the second seizes the papilla of the first. After this a complete
                    fusion of the individuals takes place, the papillae and suckers growing together
                    so firmly as to be anatomically’ inseparable. Both individuals continue to grow
                    and develop a second, third, and sometimes a fourth pair of claspers.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Polystomum integerrimum</hi> (18), which inhabits the
                    bladder of the frog, the eggs are developed during the winter and are laid in
                    the spring, when the frogs resort to the water. It appears probable that the
                    worm protrudes its body from the frog and thus deposits the egg directly in the
                    water. The young worm, as it escapes from the egg, which takes place after a
                    lapse of six or eight weeks, measures about 0∙3 mm. in length, and swims
                    vigorously about by the aid of a coating of cilia. At its posterior extremity is
                    a rounded disk (fig. 3, B, round the margin of which sixteen delicate hooks are
                    placed at equal intervals. Above the four hindmost of these are two others still
                    smaller and more delicate. Upon the back are situated four eyes disposed in
                    pairs. The mouth is wide and leads into a pharynx, and this into the intestine;
                    two excretory’ vessels are present, but there is no trace of generative organs.
                    The hindermost pair of suckers is the first to be developed, and they enclose
                    those two hooks which lie at the outer side of the very delicate ones mentioned
                    above, which eventually become the strong terminal hooks of the adult. The other
                    two pairs of suckers are formed in a similar manner, the development of all
                    three being usually completed during the month of July. The young <hi
                    rend="italic">Polystomum</hi> attacks not the full-grown frog but the tadpole,
                    entering the gill-cavity and subsequently proceeding to the bladder. Like the
                    frog it requires four or five years to attain sexual maturity. In certain cases
                    the <hi rend="italic">Polystomum</hi> does not migrate; it then becomes
                    prematurely sexual and dies when the tadpole undergoes metamorphosis; under
                    these circumstances the sexual organs are simpler than usual: the testis is
                    simple; the germarium is long and coiled; there is neither prostate nor
                    Laurer-Stieda canal; and the oviduct has no dilated anterior portion.</p>

                    (fig. 3, G). At the anterior extremity are two lappets, while the posterior is
                    furnished with a subtriangular plate, which bears the organs of attachment in
                    the shape of two large curved hooks in its centre and sixteen smaller ones on
                    its circumference. The most interesting peculiarity, however, of this form is to
                    be found in the fact that each embryo before it is extruded (the animal is
                    viviparous) contains another embryo, and this in its turn another, so that three
                    embryonic generations are present simultaneously.</p>

                    >Distomum (Distoma)</hi> of Retzius, which, however, has obtained extensive
                    currency. The name <hi rend="italic">Fasciola</hi> may appropriately be used in
                    a restricted sense for forms which have a branched digestive tract, <hi
                    rend="italic">F. hepatica</hi> above described being taken as the type. This
                    separation has not met with general recognition, although supported by Blanchard
                    and Cobbold (1). Weinland has proposed to substitute the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dicrocoelium,</hi> used by Dujardin, for <hi rend="italic">Distomum,</hi>
                    retaining <hi rend="italic">Fasciola</hi> for the type-species, but this
                    proposal has not met with acceptance. The Distomes vary in size from forms
                    almost microscopic to those which, like <hi rend="italic">D. ingens,</hi> Moniez
                    (35), measure 6 cm. long in alcohol, or even 12∙5 cm. in the fresh condition <hi

                    Bell (36), is parasitic upon a deep-sea fish taken in 1090 fathoms. <hi

                    Their growth distends the tentacle until it bursts and the sac hangs outwards.
                    The threads within the <hi rend="italic">Succinea</hi> contain only granular
                    cells, whilst the contractile sac is occupied by an organism ovoid in form, with

                <p><hi rend="italic">Bilharzia haematobia,</hi> Cobbold (1), is one of the most
                    dangerous human parasites, and occurs in the blood of the portal vein and in the
                    veins of the mesentery and bladder. The sexes are distinct, the female being
                    from 16 to 20 mm. in length, and somewhat resembling a Nematode on superficial
                    examination. The male is only from 10 to 14 mm. in length, but much thicker. The
                    surface of the female is covered with fine spines most distinct towards the
                    tail; at the anterior pointed extremity is the oral sucker, from which a narrow
                    opening leads into a wide pharynx, followed by the intestine, which at first
                    forms two branches, these again uniting posteriorly to the generative organs.
                    The ventral sucker is placed only 0 ’ 2 mm. behind the oral one, and it is
                    immediately succeeded by a long narrow groove, which extends down the ventral
                    surface and corresponds to the canalis gynaecophorus of the male (see fig. 4,
                    A).</p>
                <p>The stages in the life-history of <hi rend="italic">Gasterostomum</hi> are so
                    remarkable that a short account of them must be given. From the egg there
                    escapes (1) a club-shaped embryo, which in a manner hitherto unobserved enters
                    the freshwater mussel, <hi rend="italic">Anodonta</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unio</hi>, where it forms (2) the sporocyst (fig. 4, F); this is several
                    centimetres long and provided with lateral branches; it occurs chiefly in the
                    liver and ovary, and it is best developed near the skin. The wall of the
                    sporocyst consists of cells, muscles, and perhaps a cuticle; the extremities are
                    pointed and filled with cells, and it is here that growth takes place. Within
                    moniliform dilatations of these ramified tubes are formed balls of cells, each
                    of which develops into (3) a “bucephalus.’’ This organism (fig. 4, E) consists
                    of a small oval body about 0∙25 mm. in length with a double tail. At one
                    extremity is a mass of glands with an invagination of the integument, which has
                    been mistaken by many observers for the alimentary canal. This, however, opens
                    about the middle of the body, and consists of a muscular pharynx, a forwardly
                    directed oesophagus, and a simple saccular intestine. The excretory system
                    terminates in an S-shaped vesicle, which opens posteriorly in such a way that
                    its contraction drives the fluid into the tail, whence it probably finds its
                    exit by osmosis. Traces of genital organs are found in the form of an elongated
                    plug of cells in the hinder fourth of the body, and two rounded masses of
                    undifferentiated cells situated dorsally. The tail is double, and from about 0 ’
                    5 to 2∙5 mm. long according to its state of contraction. Each half consists of a
                    spheroidal basal portion, and an elongated tapering filament. These caudal
                    appendages contain many nucleated connectivetissue cells with fine protoplasmic
                    processes. The larvae swim freely in the water, but sink and perish after about
                    twelve hours, unless they enter the mouth of certain fishes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., Leuciscus erythrophthalmus),</hi> when (4) they lose their tails and
                    become encapsuled under the skin. The generative organs now become further
                    developed; cuticular spines and the anterior sucker are formed. If the fish thus
                    infected be swallowed by a pike or perch the cyst is dissolved, and the worms
                    (5) become adult, continue to live in the intestine, and produce eggs. For
                    further details, see Ziegler (12).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phylogenetic Relations.—</hi> The detailed comparisons of Van
                    Beneden (9) and the subsequent researches of others leave no doubt that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Trematoda</hi> are closely related to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cestoda.</hi> A consideration of their peculiarities leads moreover to the
                    opinion that the former are more primitive than the latter; that is to say, the
                    common ancestors of the two groups resembled Trematodes rather than Cestodes.
                    The ancestry of the <hi rend="italic">Trematoda</hi> is probably to be sought in
                    types such as the Planarians rather than the Leeches; characters uniting them
                    with the former are the possession of a commonly branched alimentary canal
                    without an anus, but with a powerful pharynx; the generative system is
                    hermaphrodite, and similar arrangements obtain in the excretory vessels, nerves,
                    and muscles, while histological agreements also are not wanting. Furthermore,
                    certain forms are known which help to fill up the gap between the two groups:
                    <hi rend="italic">Monocelis caudatus</hi> has a discoid posterior organ of
                    attachment, and <hi rend="italic">M</hi>. <hi rend="italic">protractilis</hi> a
                    true sucker. Such forms as these could scarcely be distinguished from
                    ectoparasitic Trematodes except for their ciliated epithelium (Leuckart, 1). In
                    this connexion, however, it is worth while to call attention to the researches
                    of Fewkes (40) on a marine cercaria, which had a tail distinctly annelid in
                    character, with bundles of bristles disposed at intervals along it. Compare also
