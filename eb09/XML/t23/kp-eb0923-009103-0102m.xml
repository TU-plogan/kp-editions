                <p><label type="entry">TAYLOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Bayard</hi></label> (1825-1878),
                    one of the most prolific among American authors, was born at Kennett Square in
                    Chester county, Pennsylvania, on January 25, 1825. The son of a well-to-do
                    farmer, he received his early instruction in an academy at West Chester, and,
                    later, at Unionville. At the age of seventeen he was apprenticed to a printer in
                    West Chester. A little volume, published in 1844 under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Ximena, or the Battle of the Sierra Morena, and other Poems,</hi>
                    brought its author a little cash; and indirectly it did him better service as
                    the means of his introduction to <hi rend="italic">The New York Tribune.</hi>
                    With the money thus obtained, and with an advance made to him on account of some
                    journalistic work to be done in Europe, “J. B. Taylor” (as he had up to this
                    time signed himself, though he bore no other Christian name than Bayard) set
                    sail for the East. The young poet spent a happy time in roaming through certain
                    districts of England, France, Germany, and Italy; that he was a born traveller
                    is evident from the fact that this pedestrian tour of almost two years cost him
                    only £100. The graphic accounts which he sent from Europe to <hi rend="italic"
                    >The New York Tribune, The Saturday Evening Post,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The
                    United States Gazette</hi> were so highly appreciated that on Taylor’s return to
                    America he was advised to throw his articles into book form. In 1846,
                    accordingly, appeared his <hi rend="italic">Views Afoot, or Europe seen with
                    Knapsack and Staff.</hi> This pleasant book had considerable popularity, and its
                    author now found himself a recognized man of letters; moreover, Horace Greeley,
                    then editor of the <hi rend="italic">Tribune,</hi> placed Taylor on the staff of
                    that journal, thus securing him a certain if a moderate income. His next
                    journey, made when the gold-fever was at its height, was to California, as
                    correspondent for the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi>; from this expedition he
                    returned by way of Mexico, and, seeing his opportunity, published (1850) a
                    highly successful book of travels, entitled <hi rend="italic">Eldorado, or
                    Adventures in the Path of Empire.</hi> Ten thousand copies were said to have
                    been sold in America, and thirty thousand in Great Britain, within a fortnight
                    from the date of issue. Bayard Taylor always considered himself native to the
                    East, and it was with great delight that in 1851 he found himself on the banks
                    of the Nile. He ascended as far as 12° 30' N. lat., and stored his memory with
                    countless sights and delights, to many of which he afterwards gave expression in
                    metrical form. From England, towards the end of 1852, he sailed for Calcutta,
                    proceeding thence to China, where he joined the expedition of Commodore Perry to
                    Japan. The results of these journeys (besides his poetical memorials, to which
                    reference will be afterwards made) were <hi rend="italic">A Journey to Central
                    Africa, or Life and Landscapes from Egypt to the Negro Kingdoms of the Nile</hi>
                    (1854); <hi rend="italic">The Land of the Saracens, or Pictures of Palestine,
                    Asia Minor, Sicily, and Spain</hi> (1854); and <hi rend="italic">A Visit to
                    India, China, and Japan in the Year 1853</hi> (1855). On his return (1854) from
                    these various journeyings he entered, with marked success, upon the career of a
                    public lecturer, delivering addresses in every town of importance from Maine to
                    Wisconsin. After two years’ experience of this lucrative profession, he again
                    started on his travels, on this occasion for northern Europe, his special object
                    being the study of Swedish life, language, and literature. The most noteworthy
                    result was the long narrative poem <hi rend="italic">Lars,</hi> but his “Swedish
                    Letters” to the <hi rend="italic">Tribune</hi> were also republished, under the
                    title <hi rend="italic">Northern Travel</hi> (1857). In October 1857 he married
                    Maria Hansen, the daughter of the well-known German astronomer. The ensuing
                    winter was spent in Greece. In 1859 Taylor once more traversed the whole extent
                    of the western American gold region, the primary cause of the journey lying in
                    an invitation to lecture at San Francisco. About three years later he entered
                    the diplomatic service as secretary of legation at St Petersburg, and the
                    following year (1863) became chargé d’affaires at the Russian capital. In 1864
                    he returned to the United States and resumed his active literary labours, and it
                    was at this period that <hi rend="italic">Hannah Thurston,</hi> the first of his
                    four novels, was published. This book had a moderate success, but neither in it
                    nor in its successors did Bayard Taylor betray any special talent as a novelist:
                    some of his characters are faithful studies from life, and he could describe
                    well the aspects of nature,—but a good deal more than this is necessary for the
                    creation of noteworthy romances. In 1874 he went to Iceland, to take part in the
                    centennial celebration which was held in that year. In J une 1878 he was
                    accredited United States minister at Berlin. Notwithstanding the resistless
                    passion for travel which had always possessed him, Bayard Taylor was (when not
                    actually <hi rend="italic">en route)</hi> sedentary in his habits, especially in
                    the later years of his life; and at Berlin he aggravated a constitutional liver
                    affection by too sedulous devotion to literary studies and pursuits, in the
                    intervals of leisure from his diplomatic duties. His death occurred on the 17 th
                    of December, only a few months after his arrival in Berlin.</p>
                <p>The main drawback to the widespread acceptance of Bayard Taylor’s poetry as a
                    whole is its perpetual diffuseness. His most ambitious productions—his <hi
                    rend="italic">Masque of the Gods</hi> (1872), <hi rend="italic">Prince
                    Deukalion</hi> (1877), <hi rend="italic">The Picture of St John (1865), Lars
                    (1818),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Prophet</hi> (1874)—are marred by a
                    ceaseless effort to overstrain his power. <hi rend="italic">Lars</hi> is the
                    least likely of his longer poems to survive any length of time: it lacks the
                    grandiose eloquence and impressive “adjuncts” of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Masque</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prince Deukalion,</hi> while in theme and
                    treatment it is, at most, only sedately agreeable. <hi rend="italic">The Poems
                    of the Orient</hi> contains his most genuinely satisfactory poetic writings. But
                    probably long after even the most familiar of the poems just mentioned have
                    ceased to be popular, when even the <hi rend="italic">Views Afoot</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Eldorado</hi> no longer hold the attention of the numerous public
                    interested in vividly narrated experiences of travel, Bayard Taylor will be
                    remembered by his poetic and excellent translation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Faust.</hi> Taylor felt, in all truth, “the torment and the ecstasy of verse”;
                    but, as a critical friend has written of him, “his nature was so ardent, so
                    full-blooded, that slight and common sensations intoxicated him, and he
                    estimated their effect, and his power to transmit it to others, beyond the true
                    value.” He felt life as perhaps only the poetic temperament can experience the
                    beauty of the world; single words thus became for him so charged with poetry
                    that he overlooked the fact that to most people these were, simply in
                    themselves, mere abstract terms—sunshine, sea, spring, morning, night, and so
                    forth. Thus a stanza having absolutely nothing original or striking or even
                    poetic in it would, because <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0103-0092"/> born of him, seem to be poetry unadulterate: to
                    <hi rend="italic">his</hi> mind, each line, each word, was charged with
                    delightful significance, therefore —so he felt—would be so also to the
                    sympathetic reader. He had, from the earliest period at which he began to
                    compose, a distinct lyrical faculty: so keen indeed was his ear that he became
                    too insistently haunted by the music of others, pre-eminently of Tennyson. But
                    he had often a true and fine note of his „own. His best short poems are “The
                    Metempsychosis of the Pine” and the well-known Bedouin love-song, the latter a
                    stirring lyric that ought assuredly to endure. In his critical essays Bayard
                    Taylor had himself in no inconsiderable degree what he wrote of as “that pure
                    poetic insight which is the vital spirit of criticism.” The most valuable of
                    these prose dissertations are the <hi rend="italic">Studies in German
                    Literature.</hi></p>
