                <p><label type="entry">TEMPLARS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Knights</hi></label>. Perhaps
                    the most renowned of the three great military orders founded in the 12th century
                    for the defence of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem is that of the Knights
                    Templars <hi rend="italic">{pauperes commilitones Christi templique
                    Salomonici∖</hi> though abolished long before its rivals. It differed from the
                    Hospitallers and the Teutonic Knights in having been a military order from its
                    very origin, inasmuch as its earliest members banded themselves together for the
                    express purpose of giving armed protection to the numerous pilgrims who, after
                    the first crusade, flocked to Jerusalem and the other sacred sites in the Holy
                    Land. Walter Map has preserved the legendary story of their first achievements,
                    from which it would appear that their earliest efforts were confined to the
                    immediate neighbourhood of Jerusalem; and the memory of their original aim may
                    perhaps be traced from fifty to seventy years later, when they conducted Henry
                    of Saxony from their own quarters on Mount Moriah to the banks of Jordan, or
                    when on the fall of the Holy City (1187) they protected the vanguard of the
                    Christians on its way from Jerusalem to Tripoli. The three orders were
                    distinguished from each other by their garb. The Hospitallers wore black mantles
                    with white crosses, the Templars white mantles with a red cross, the Teutonic
                    Knights white mantles with a black cross.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Templars almost from their foundation had their quarters in the palace of the
                    Latin kings, which had been the mosque of Mount Moriah. This palace was also
                    known as Solomon’s temple, and it was from this <hi rend="italic">templum
                    Salomonis</hi> that the Templars took their name.</p>
                <p>About the year 1118 a Burgundian knight, Hugh de</p>
                <p>Paganis, bound himself and eight comrades by a vow to the patriarch of Jerusalem
                    to guard the public roads, to live as regular canons, and to fight for the King
                    of Heaven in chastity, obedience, and self-denial. Baldwin II. granted them
                    quarters on Mount Moriah and recommended their cause to St Bernard. Under his
                    patronage the papal legate, Matthew, bishop of St Albano, presided at the
                    council of Troyes in January 1128 for the purpose of drawing up or confirming
                    the statutes of the new order. The seventy-two statutes then drawn up met with
                    the approval of Pope Honorius II. and the patriarch of Jerusalem, and became the
                    groundwork of the later and more elaborate “<hi rend="italic">Règle du
                    Temple.”</hi> Long before St Bernard’s death (1153) the new order was
                    established in almost every kingdom of Latin Christendom. Henry I. granted them
                    lands in Normandy. They seem to have been settled in Castile by 1129, in
                    Rochelle by 1131, in Languedoc by 1136, at Rome by 1138, in Brittany by 1141,
                    and in Germany at perhaps a still earlier date. Alphonso I. of Aragon and
                    Navarre, if we may trust the Spanish historians, bequeathed them the third of
                    his kingdom (Mariana, x. c. 9). Raymond Berengar, count of Barcelona, and
                    Alphonso’s successor in Aragon, whose father had been admitted to the order,
                    granted them the strong castle of Monçon (1143), and established a new chivalry
                    in imitation of theirs. Louis VII. in the latter years of his reign gave them a
                    piece of marsh land outside Paris, which in later times became known as the
                    Temple, and was the headquarters of the order in Europe. Stephen of England
                    granted them the manors of Cressing and Witham in Essex, and his wife Matilda
                    that of Cowley, near Oxford. Eugenius III., Louis VII., and 130 brethren were
                    present at the Paris chapter (1147) when Bernard de Balliol granted the order 15
                    librates of land near Hitchin; and the list of English benefactors under Stephen
                    and Henry II. includes the noble names of Ferrers, Harcourt, Hastings, Lacy,
                    Clare, Vere, and Mowbray.</p>
                <p>After the council of Troyes Hugh de Paganis came to England and induced a number
                    of English knights to follow him to the Holy Land. Amongst these was Fulk, count
                    of Anjou, who would thus seem to have been a Templar before assuming the crown
                    of Jerusalem in 1131. Hugh de Paganis died about the year 1136 and was succeeded
                    by Robert de Craon, who is said to have been Anselm’s nephew. Everard de Barris,
                    the third master, was conspicuous in the second crusade. In the disastrous march
                    from Laodicea to Attalia his troops alone kept up even the show of discipline;
                    and their success prompted Louis VII. to regulate his whole army after the model
                    of the Templar knights. In the French king’s distress for money the Templars
                    lent him large sums, ranging from 2000 silver marks to 30,000 solidi. When
                    Conrad III. of Germany reached Jerusalem he was entertained at their palace
                    (Easter 1148); and in the summer of the same year they took part in the
                    unsuccessful siege of Damascus. The failure of this expedition was ascribed by a
                    contemporary writer to their treachery,—a charge to which Conrad would not
                    assent. This is the first note of the accusations which from this time were of
                    constant recurrence.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Henceforward for 140 years the history of the Templars is the history of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Crusades</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.vf</hi> In 1149 the Templars
                    were appointed to guard the fortress of Gaza, the last Christian stronghold on
                    the way towards Egypt. Four years later the new master, Bernard de Tremelai, and
                    forty of his followers, bursting into Ascalon, were surrounded by the Saracens
                    and cut off to a single man. William of Tyre has preserved the scandal of the
                    day when he hints that they met a merited fate in their eagerness to possess
                    themselves of the city treasure. Next year <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0172-0161"/> the rumour went abroad that they had sold a noble
                    halfconverted Egyptian prince, who had fallen into their hands, to chains and
                    certain death for 60,000 aurei. In 1166 Amalric, the Latin king of Jerusalem,
                    hanged twelve Templars on a charge of betraying a fortress beyond the Jordan to
                    an emir of Nür al-Din of Damascus. The military power of Nür al-Din (1145-1173)
                    was a standing menace to the Christian settlements in the East. Edessa had
                    fallen to the prowess of his father (1144-45); Damascus was conquered by the son
                    (1153), who four years earlier had carried his depredations almost to the walls
                    of Antioch, and in 1157 laid siege to the Christian town of Paneas near the
                    sources of the Jordan. In the disastrous fight that followed for the safety of
                    the fortress of the Hospitallers, Bertrand de Blanquefort, the master of the
                    Templars, and Odo de St Amand, one of his successors, were taken prisoners.
                    Bertrand was released later when Manuel was preparing to march against Nιir
                    al-Din. The Templars do not seem to have opposed Amalric’s early expeditions
                    against Egypt. It was Geoffrey Fulcher, the Templar correspondent of Louis VII.,
                    who brought back (1167) to Jerusalem the glowing accounts of the splendour of
                    the caliph’s court at Cairo with which Gibbon has enlivened his great work. Nor
                    was the order less active at the northern limits of the Latin kingdom. Two
                    English Templars, Gilbert de Lacy and Robert Mansel, “qui Galen-sibus praeerat,”
                    starting from Antioch, surprised Nür al-Din in the neighbourhood of Tripoli and
                    put him barefooted to flight. But jealousy or honour led the Templars to oppose
                    Amalric’s Egyptian expedition of 1168; and the wisdom of their advice became
                    apparent when the renewed discord on the Nile led to the conquest of Egypt by
                    Asad al-Din Shirkùh, and thus indirectly to the accession of Saladin, in 1169.
                    In 1170 they beat Saladin back from their frontier fortress of Gaza; and seven
                    years later they shared in Baldwin IV.’s great victory at Ascalon.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Saladin had possessed himself of Emesa and Damascus (1174-75), and, as
                    he was already lord of Egypt, his power hemmed in the Latin kingdom on every
                    side. In July 1173 Amalric was succeeded by his son Baldwin IV., a boy of
                    twelve. Raymond III., count of Tripoli, a man suspected of being in league with
                    the Saracens, was appointed regent, although in 1176 the masters of the Templars
                    and the Hospitallers united in offering this office to the newly arrived Philip
                    of Flanders. The construction of the Templar fortress at Jacob’s ford on the
                    upper Jordan led to a fresh Saracen invasion and the disastrous battle of Paneas
                    (1179), from which the young king and the Holy Cross escaped with difficulty,
                    while Odo de St Amand, the grand-master, was carried away captive and never
                    returned.</p>
                <p>During Odo’s mastership the Old Man of the Mountains sent to Amalric offering to
                    accept the Christian faith if released from the tribute he had paid to the
                    Templars since (according to the reckoning of M. Defrémery) somewhere about
                    1149. The Templars murdered the envoys on their return (c. 1172). Amalric
                    demanded that the offenders should be given up for justice. Odo refused to yield
                    the chief culprit, though he was well known, and invoked the protection of the
                    pope. Amalric had to vindicate his right by force of arms at Sidon, and died
                    while preparing to take stronger measures. The connexion between the Templars
                    and the Old Man was still vital eighty years later when the two grand-masters
                    rebuked the insolence of the Assassin envoys in the presence of Louis IX. Odo de
                    St Amand was succeeded by Arnold de Torroge, who died at Verona on his way to
                    implore European succour for the Holy Land. The power of Saladin was now (1184)
                    increasing daily; Baldwin IV. was a leper, and his realm was a nrev to rival
                    factions. There were two claimants for the guardianship of the state,—Raymond
                    III. of Tripoli and Guy de Lusignan, who in 1180 had married Sibylla, sister of
                    the young king. Baldwin inclined to the former, against the patriarch and Arnold
                    de Torroge.</p>
                <p>There is something Homeric in the story of the fall of the Latin kingdom as
                    related by the historians of the next century. A French knight, Gerard de
                    Riderfort or Bideford, coming to the East in quest of fortune, attached himself
                    to the service of Raymond of Tripoli, looking for the hand of some wealthy widow
                    in reward. But on his claiming the hand of the lady of Botron he was met with a
                    refusal. Angered at this, Gerard enrolled himself among the Templars, biding his
                    time for revenge, and was elected grand-master on the death of Arnold. Baldwin
                    IV. died (1185), leaving the throne to his young nephew Baldwin V., the son of
                    Sibylla, under the guardianship of Raymond, whose office was not of long
                    duration, as the little king died in September 1186. This was Gerard’s
                    opportunity. The Templars carried the body of their dead sovereign to Jerusalem
                    for burial; and then, unknown to the barons of the realm, Gerard and the
                    patriarch crowned Sibylla and her husband Guy. The coronation of Guy was the
                    triumph of Reginald of Châtillon, once prince of Antioch, and Saladin’s
                    deadliest foe. It was at the same time the overthrow of Raymond’s ambition; and
                    both Latin and Arabic writers are agreed that the Christian count and the
                    Mohammedan sultan now entered into an alliance. To break this friendship and so
                    save the kingdom, the two grand-masters were sent north to make terms with
                    Raymond. But the rash valour of the Templars provoked a hopeless contest with
                    7000 Saracens. The grand-master of the Hospitallers was slain; but Gerard made
                    his escape with three knights to Nazareth (1st May 1187). In this emergency
                    Raymond became reconciled with Guy; and Gerard placed the temple treasures of
                    Henry II. at his king’s disposal. Once more it was the Templars’ rashness that
                    led to the disastrous battle of Hittin (4th July). Gerard and the king fell into
                    the hands of Saladin, but were released about a year later; Raymond of Tripoli
                    made his escape through treachery or fortune; and 230 Templars fell in or after
                    the battle, for the fight was scarcely over before Saladin ordered all the
                    Templars and Hospitallers to be murdered in cold blood. One after another the
                    Christian fortresses of Palestine fell into the hands of Saladin. Jerusalem
                    surrendered on 2d-3d October 1187, and the treasures of the temple coffers were
                    used to purchase the redemption of the poorer Christians, part of whom the
                    Templar warriors guarded on their sad march from the Holy City to Tripoli. Part
                    of their wealth was expended by Conrad of Montferrat in the defence of Tyre;
                    but, when this prince refused to admit Guy to his city, both the Templars and
                    the Hospitallers from the neighbouring parts flocked to the banner of their
                    released king and accompanied him to the siege of Acre (22d August 1189). In his
                    company they bore their part in the two years’ siege and the terrible famine of
                    1190-91; and their grand-master died in the great battle of 4th October 1189,
                    refusing to survive the slaughter of his brethren.</p>
                <p>On the fall of Acre Philip Augustus established himself in the palace of the
                    Templars, who are, however, stated to have sympathized with Richard. This king
                    sold them the island of Cyprus for 100,000 besants; but, unable to pay the
                    purchase money, they transferred the debt and the principality to Guy of
                    Lusignan. The English king consulted them before deciding on any great military
                    movement; and in June 1192 they advocated the bold plan of an advance on Egypt
                    rather than on Jerusalem. In the disputes for the Latin kingdom of the East the
                    Templars seem to have supported Guy, and, like Richard, were credited with
                    having had a hand in the murder of Conrad <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0173-0162"/> of Montferrat (April 1192). It was in the
                    disguise of a Templar and in a Templar galley that Richard left the Holy Land.
                    When Acre was recovered, the Templars, like the Hospitallers, received their own
                    quarters in the town, which from this time became the centre of the order. On
                    the death of Henry of Champagne (1197) they vetoed the election of Raoul de
                    Tabarie; after the death of his successor Amalric they refused to renew the
                    truce with Saladin’s brother, Saif al-Din, and led an expedition against the
                    Saracens before the arrival of the new king, John de Brienne, at whose
                    coronation in 1210 William de Chartres, the grand-master, was present. Seven
                    years later, with the aid of Walter de Avennis and of the Teutonic Knights, they
                    commenced the building of their fortress of Castle Pilgrim, near Acre, on a
                    rocky promontory washed by the Mediterranean on every side except the east. This
                    wonderful structure, whose ruins are still to be seen, was fortified with a
                    strong wall, founded on the substructure of a yet more extensive one running
                    from sea to sea, and was flanked by lofty towers of huge squared stones. Within
                    was a spring of pure water, besides fishponds, salt-mines, woods, pastures,
                    orchards, and all things fitted to furnish an abode in which the Templars might
                    await the day of their restoration to Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>It was from this castle that in May 1218 the fifth crusade started for the
                    expedition against Egypt. The Templars were the heroes of the siege of Damietta,
                    at which William de Chartres was slain. “First to attack and last to retreat,”
                    they saved the Christian army from annihilation on 29th August 1219; and when
                    the city surrendered (5th November) the only one of its twenty-eight towers that
                    had begun to give way had been shaken by their engines. On the other hand, it
                    was largely owing to their objections that John de Brienne refused the sultan’s
                    offer to restore Jerusalem and Palestine.</p>
                <p>From the very first the Templars seem to have been opposed to Frederick II., and
                    when he landed at Acre (7th September 1228) they refused to march under the
                    banners of an excommunicated man, and would only accompany his host from Acre to
                    Joppa in a separate body. They were accused of notifying Frederick’s intended
                    pilgrimage to the Jordan to the sultan, and they were certainly opposed to
                    Frederick’s ten years’ peace with Al-Kâmil, the sultan of Egypt, and refused to
                    be present at his coronation in Jerusalem. Frederick was not slow to avenge
                    himself: he left Jerusalem abruptly, publicly insulted the grand-master,
                    demanded the surrender of their fortresses, and even laid siege to Castle
                    Pilgrim. He left Acre on 3d May 1229, and on landing in Apulia gave orders to
                    seize the estates of the order and chase all its members from the land.</p>
                <p>Long before the expiration of Frederick’s peace Europe was preparing for a fresh
                    crusade against the now divided realm of the Ayyubids. Theobald of Navarre and
                    his crusaders reached Palestine about August 1239. The Templars shared in the
                    great defeat near Jaffa, an engagement which their temerity had done much to
                    provoke (13th November 1239). If the king ever accepted the overtures of Salih
                    of Damascus, he was supporting the policy of Hermann of Perigord, the
                    grand-master, who towards the summer of 1244 wrote a triumphant letter to
                    England, telling how he had engaged this sultan and Nâsir of Kerak to make an
                    alliance against the sultan of Egypt and restore the whole of Palestine from the
                    Jordan to the sea. Theobald, however, before leaving the Holy Land (27th
                    September 1240), signed a ten years’ truce with Sâlih of Egypt. The Hospitallers
                    seem to have been won over to his view, and when Richard of Cornwall arrived
                    (11th October) he had to decide between the two rival orders and their opposing
                    policies. After some hesitation he concluded a treaty with the sultan of Egypt,
                    much to the annoyance of the Templars, who openly mocked his efforts. On his
                    departure the three orders came to open discord: the Templars laid siege to the
                    Hospitallers in Acre and drove out the Teutonic Knights “in contumeliam
                    imperatoris.” They were successful on all sides. The negotiations with Damascus
                    and Kerak were reopened, and in 1244 Hermann of Perigord wrote to the princes of
                    Europe that after a “silence of fifty-six years the divine mysteries would once
                    more be celebrated in the Holy City.”</p>
                <p>It was in this moment of danger that the sultan of Babylon called in the
                    barbarous Khârizmians, whom the Mongol invasions had driven from their native
                    lands. These savages, entering from the north, flowed like a tide past the newly
                    built and impregnable Templar fortress of Safed, swept down on Jerusalem, and
                    annihilated the Christian army near Gaza on St Luke’s day (18th October) 1244.
                    From this blow the Latin kingdom of the East never recovered; 600 knights took
                    part in the battle; the whole army of the Templars, 300 in number, was present,
                    but only 18 survived, and of 200 Hospitallers only 16. The masters of both
                    orders were slain or taken prisoners. Despite the admirable valour of the
                    Templars, their policy had proved the ruin of the land. Jerusalem was lost to
                    Christendom for ever; and, though the Khârizmians melted away in the course of
                    the next three years, they left the country so weak that all the acquisitions of
                    Theobald and Richard fell an easy prey to the sultan of Babylon.</p>
                <p>Recognizing the fact that the true way to Jerusalem lay through Egypt, Louis IX.
                    led his host to the banks of the Nile, being accompanied by the Templars. Their
                    master, William de Sonnac, attempted in vain to restrain the rash advance of the
                    count of Artois at the battle of Mansιira (8th February 1250), which only three
                    Templars survived. St Louis, when captured a few weeks later, owed his speedy
                    release to the generosity with which the order advanced his ransom-money.
                    Shortly after his departure from Acre (April 1254) they consented to an eleven
                    years’ truce with the sultans of Egypt and Damascus.</p>
                <p>A new enemy was now threatening Mohammedan and Christian alike. For a time the
                    Mongol advance may have been welcomed by the Christian cities, as one after
                    another the Mohammedan principalities of the north fell before the new invaders.
                    But this new danger stimulated the energies of Egypt, which under the Mameluke
                    Beybars (see vol. vii. p. 755) encroached year after year on the scanty remains
                    of the Latin kingdom. The great Frankish lords, fearing that all was lost, made
                    haste to sell their lands to the Templars and Hospitallers before quitting
                    Palestine for ever. In 1260 the former purchased Sidon and Beaufort; next year
                    the Hospitallers purchased Arsuf. In 1267, by a skilful adaptation of the
                    banners of both orders, Beybars nearly surprised Antioch. The Templar fortress
                    of Safed surrendered with its garrison of 600 knights, all of whom preferred
                    death to apostasy (June 1266). Beaufort fell in April 1268, Antioch six weeks
                    later; and, though the two orders still made occasional brilliant dashes from
                    their Acre stronghold, such as that to Ascalon in 1264 and that with Prince
                    Edward of England to destroy Kâkùn in 1271, they became so enfeebled as to
                    welcome the treaty which secured them the plain of Acre and a free road to
                    Nazareth as the result of the English crusade of 1272.</p>
                <p>But, though weak against external foes, the Templars w ere strong enough for
                    internal warfare. In 1277 they espoused the quarrel of the bishop of Tripoli,
                    formerly a member of the order, against his nephew Bohemond, prince of Antioch
                    and Tripoli, and commenced a war which lasted three years. In 1276 their conduct
                    drove Hugh III., king <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n174/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0174-0163"/> of Cyprus and Jerusalem, from Acre to Tyre. In
                    the ensuing year, when Mary of Antioch had sold her claim to the crown to
                    Charles of Anjou, they welcomed this prince’s lieutenant to Acre and succeeded
                    for the moment in forcing the knights of that city to do homage to the new king.
                    Thirteen years later (26th April 1290) Tripoli fell, and next year Acre, after a
                    siege of six weeks, at the close of which (16th May) William de Beaujeu, the
                    grand-master, was slain. The few surviving Templars elected a new master, and,
                    forcing their way to the seashore, sailed for Cyprus, which now became the
                    headquarters of the order. A futile attempt against Alexandria in 1300 and an
                    unsuccessful effort to form a new settlement at Tortosa about the same time
                    (1300-2) are the closing acts of their long career in the western parts of
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>For more than a hundred years the Templars had been one of the wealthiest and
                    most influential factors in European politics. If we confine our attention to
                    the East, we realize but a small part of their enormous power. Two Templars were
                    appointed guardians of the disputed castles on the betrothal of Prince Henry of
                    England and the French princess in 1161. Other Templars were almoners of Henry
                    III. of England and of Philip IV. of France. One grand-master was godfather to a
                    daughter of Louis IX.; another, despite the prohibition of the order, is said to
                    have been godfather to a child of Philip IV. They are reported to have reckoned
                    a pope (Innocent III.) among their members and to have refused admission to a
                    king and his nephew (Philip IV. ). They were summoned to the great councils of
                    the church, such as the Lateran of 1215 and the Lyons council of 1274. Frederick
                    II.’s persecution of their order was one of the main causes of his
                    excommunication in 1239; and his last will enjoined the restoration of their
                    estates. Their property was scattered over every country of Christendom, from
                    Denmark to Spain, from Ireland to Cyprus. Before the middle of the 13th century
                    Matthew Paris reckons their manors at 9000, Alberic of Trois-Fontaines at 7050,
                    whereas the rival order of St John had barely half the latter number. Some fifty
                    years earlier their income from Armenia alone was 20,000 besants. Both in Paris
                    and in London their houses were used as strongholds for the royal treasure. In
                    the London temple Hubert de Burgh and the Poitevin favourites of Henry III.
                    stored their wealth; and the same building was used as a bank into which the
                    debtors of the foreign usurers paid their dues. From the English Templars Henry
                    III. borrowed the purchase money of Oléron in 1235; from the French Templars
                    Philip IV. exacted the dowry of his daughter Isabella on her marriage with
                    Edward II. To Louis IX. they lent a great part of his ransom, and to Edward I.
                    of England no less than 25,000 <hi rend="italic">livres Tournois,</hi> of which
                    they remitted four-fifths. James de Molai, the last grand-master, came to France
                    in 1306 with 150,000 gold florins and ten horse-loads of silver. In the Spanish
                    peninsula they occupied a peculiar position, and more than one king of Aragon is
                    said to have been brought up under their discipline.</p>
                <p>Such were the power and wealth of the Templars at the time when Philip IV. of
                    France accused them of heresy and worse offences, had them arrested (13th
                    October 1307), and forced them to confess by tortures of the most excruciating
                    kinds. Five years later (26th May 1312) the order was suppressed by decree of
                    the council of Vienne and its goods transferred to the hospital of St John.</p>
                <p>The order consisted of (1) knights, (2) chaplains, and (3) men-at-arms <hi
                    rend="italic">{armigeri, clientes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">servientes).</hi>
                    The knights were either bound for life or for a fixed period, and were the only
                    members entitled to wear the white mantle. Married brethren were admitted; but
                    no woman might enter the order. Each knight might keep three horses and one
                    man-at-arms, who, like his master, might be bound for life or only for a time.
                    Like Augustinian canons, they were to attend daily services; but the soldier
                    outwearied with his nightly duties might on certain conditions absent himself
                    from matins with the master’s consent. Two regular meals were allowed for each
                    day; but to these might be added, at the master’s discretion, a light collation
                    towards sunset. Meat might be eaten thrice a week; and on other days there was
                    to be a choice of vegetable fare so as to suit the tenderest stomach. Brethren
                    were to eat by couples, each keeping an eye on his fellow to see that he did not
                    practise an undue austerity. Wine was served at every meal, and at those times
                    silence was strictly enjoined that the words of Holy Writ might be heard with
                    the closest attention. Special care was to be taken of aged and ailing members.
                    Every brother owed the most absolute obedience to the master of the order, and
                    was to go wherever his superior bade him without delay, “as if commanded by
                    God.” All undue display in arms or harness was forbidden. Parti-coloured
                    garments were forbidden; black or dusky-brown <hi rend="italic">{burellus)</hi>
                    was to be worn by all except the knights. All garments were to be made of wool;
                    but from Easter to All Souls a linen shirt might be substituted for one of wool.
                    The hair was to be worn short, and a rough beard became one of the
                    distinguishing marks of the order. Hunting and hawking λvere unlawful; and the
                    very allusion to the follies or secular achievements of earlier life was
                    forbidden. A lion, however, being the type of the evil one, was legitimate prey.
                    Strict watch was kept on the incomings and outgoings of every brother, except
                    when he went out by night to visit the Sepulchre of our Lord. No letter, even
                    from the nearest relative, might be opened except in the master’s presence; nor
                    was any member to feel annoyance if he saw his relative’s gift transferred at
                    the master’s bidding to some other brother. The brethren were to sleep in
                    separate beds in shirts and breeches, with a light always burning in the
                    dormitory. Those who lacked a mattress might place a piece of carpet on the
                    floor; but all luxury was discouraged. The order recognized two governing
                    bodies,—the first, a meeting for ordinary business, to which only the wiser
                    members were summoned; the second, one for extraordinary affairs, such as the
                    granting of lands or the reception of new members, on which occasions the master
                    might summon the whole community. Even at these last assemblies the master seems
                    to have decided on the final action (c. 59). A term of probation was assigned to
                    each candidate before admission; and a special clause discouraged the reception
                    of boys before they were of an age to bear aims. Lastly, the brethren of the
                    Temple were exhorted to shun the kiss of every woman, whether maid or widow,
                    mother, aunt, or sister.</p>
                <p>The general spirit of the Templar statutes remained unaltered to the end, though
                    the increasing wealth of the order gave rise to a number of additional rules.
                    The grand-master was always head of the society; his instructions were binding
                    on every member, and the very laws were at his discretion. But he could not
                    declare war, alienate the society’s estates, or even admit a member without the
                    consent of his chapter. He was elected by thirteen brothers, chosen by a
                    peculiar method of co-optation, and all, if possible, belonging to different
                    nations. Next to him in dignity came the seneschal, on whom the duties of the
                    absent master devolved. The marshal had charge of the steeds and accoutrements;
                    he also commanded the knights and men-at-arms, the latter of whom seem in time
                    of war to have been at the disposal of the turcopolier. The commander of the
                    kingdom guarded the treasure-house, to which even the grand-master might not
                    have a key; the commander of the city of Jerusalem had charge of the True Cross
                    in time of war. There were twelve or perhaps more commanders or preceptors of
                    the different provinces and kingdoms of Europe and Asia,— Jerusalem (kingdom and
                    city), Acre, Tripoli, Antioch, France, England, Poitou, Aragon, Portugal,
                    Apulia, and Hungary. No European preceptor could cross the sea without the
                    grand-master’s leave; but all ought to be present at the election to this
                    office. The privileges and duties of every member were strictly prescribed, from
                    the number of horses he might ride and the amount of food he might eat to the
                    colour of his clothes. The order seems to have owned a fleet, part of which, if
                    not all, was under the authority of the commander of the kingdom. Besides the
                    knights and men-at-arms, the society reckoned chaplains in its ranks; and it was
                    the habit of confession to these priests that seems to have stirred the wrath of
                    the Dominicans and the Franciscans, who played a very conspicuous part in the
                    overthrow of the order, especially in England. For grievous offences, such as
                    desertion to the Saracens, heresy, or losing the gonfalon, a Templar might be
                    expelled <hi rend="italic">{perdre la maison); for</hi> minor offences, such as
                    disobedience or lowering the banner in battle, he suffered a temporary
                    degradation <hi rend="italic">{perdre son abit).</hi> By a mutual agreement the
                    Templars and Hospitallers, despite their long and deadly feud, were bound not to
                    receive ejected members of the rival order; and the Templar cut off in battle
                    and defeat from all hope of rejoining his own ranks might rally to the cross of
                    St John. As Acre was the headquarters of the order in Jthe East, so Paris was
                    its centre in the West (Matt. Paris, v. 478). Every member before admission must
                    declare himself free of debt, sound of body, and affiliated to no other

                    life to the Holy Land. The order prided itself specially on the splendour of its
                    religious services, the abundance of its alms, and its reckless valour for the
                    Christian faith. At the time of its suppression it was calculated to number
                    15,000 members. Three MSS. of its ancient statutes, written in Old French, are
                    still extant at Dijon, at Paris, and at Rome. Of these the first was transcribed
                    about 1200, the last two from 1250 to 1300. They have been published by Μ.

                <p>A scheme for the union of the three great military orders into one had received
                    the sanction of Gregory X. and Louis IX., of Nicholas IV. and Boniface VIII. The
                    recovery of the Holy Land was the dream of the last pope’s highest ambition; and
                    when he died a prisoner in the hands of Philip IV. of France this king continued
                    to advocate the plan for his own purposes. His gold or influence secured the
                    election of Clement V. as pope (5th June 1305). According to a slightly later
                    tradition, before consenting to the new pope’s appointment he exacted from him
                    an oath to assist in carrying out six propositions, one of which he would not
                    disclose as yet. This sixth condition, if it ever existed, must have been the
                    suppression of the Templars; and, whether false or true, Villani’s story
                    emphasizes a popular and almost contemporary opinion. It is known that Philip
                    was urging Clement in this direction before the latter’s coronation at Lyons on
                    14th November 1305, and all through the two succeeding years. On 6th June 1306
                    the pope summoned the grand-master from Cyprus to France. James de Molai obeyed
                    the call, and, hearing of the charges against his order, demanded a prompt
                    investigation. In this demand he was supported by the leading Templars of the
                    realm. Clement, who disbelieved the accusations, fenced with the question. But,
                    though only a very short time previously Philip had spoken of his special love
                    for the order, and though it had sheltered him from the fury of the Paris mob in
                    1306, he was now determined on its destruction. Its wealth would fill the royal
                    coffers, and the rumours of the day afforded a ready engine for its
                    overthrow.</p>
                <p>For perhaps half a century there had been strange stories circulating as to the
                    secret rites practised by the order at its midnight meetings. It was said that
                    on his initiation each member had to disavow his belief in God and Christ, to
                    spit upon the crucifix, to submit to indecent ceremonies, and to swear never to
                    reveal the secrets of the society or disobey the mandates of a grand-master, who
                    claimed full power of absolution. When the mass was celebrated the consecrating
                    words “Hoc est corpus” were omitted; on Good Friday the holy cross was trampled
                    under foot; and the Christian duty of almsgiving had ceased to be observed. Even
                    the vaunted chastity of the order towards women had, it was said, been turned
                    into a sanction for more horrible offences. These evil practices were part of
                    the secret statute law of an order which in its nightly assemblies worshipped
                    hideous four-footed figures,—a cat or a calf. In England the very children at
                    their play bade one another beware of a Templar’s kisses. Stranger stories yet
                    were rife in this country and gravely reported before bishops and priests,—of
                    children slain by their fathers because they chanced to witness the nightly
                    orgies of the society; of one prior’s being spirited away at every meeting of
                    the general chapter; of the great preceptor’s declaring that a single hair of a
                    Saracen’s beard was worth more than the whole body of a Christian man. In France
                    they were said to roast their illegitimate children and smear their idols with
                    the burning fat.</p>
                <p>For nearly two years Philip waited for Clement to fulfil his bargain. A certain
                    Templar from the prisons of Toulouse now offered to put the king in possession
                    of a secret that would be worth a realm. Acting on the evidence of this
                    informer, Philip issued orders (14th September 1307) for the arrest of all the
                    Templars in France on the night of Friday, 13th October. He seems to have
                    written to the neighbouring princes urging them to act in the same way. James de
                    Molai was seized with sixty of his brethren in Paris. On Saturday they were
                    brought before the university of Paris to hear the enumeration of their crimes;
                    and on Sunday the Paris mob was gathered in the royal gardens, where preachers
                    were inveighing against the iniquities of the order. The inquisitors began their
                    work at once; and inhuman tortures forced the most horrible avowals from the
                    lips of many. In Paris alone thirty-six Templars died under torture.<note

                    >Proces,</hi> i. 36; Gruelle, 35, &amp;c.</p></note> Of 140 Templars examined at
                    Paris between 19th October and 24th November 1307, the experience of some of
                    whom extended over nearly half a century, there is hardly one who did not admit
                    the dishonouring of the crucifix at his reception. Very many confessed to other
                    charges, even of the worst description. Clement V., although he suspended the
                    inquisitors’ powers on 27th October (Loiseleur, 159), before the end of the next
                    month wrote to Edward II. to arrest all the English Templars, who were
                    accordingly seized on 10th January 1308. About the same time they were arrested
                    in Sicily (24th January) and in Cyprus (27th May). As Clement did not move fast
                    enough, Philip went to Poitiers with 700 armed men, and the pope was at his
                    mercy. It was agreed that the prisoners, their lands, and their money should be
                    nominally placed in the hands of Clement’s commissioners. The power of the
                    inquisitors was restored (5th July); and the property forfeited was to be
                    devoted to the recovery of the Holy Land. Clement now gave orders for fresh
                    diocesan inquiries into the guilt of the Templars. He had already heard the
                    confessions of seventy-two at Poitiers (29th June to 1st July). The grand-master
                    and the three preceptors were re-examined at Chinon, and renewed their old
                    confessions (20th August). Lastly, the bull <hi rend="italic">Regnans in
                    Coelo</hi> summoned a great council at Vienne for 1st October 1310, when the
                    question of the guilt of the order might be considered. The diocesan councils
                    were only empowered to inquire into the conduct of individuals.</p>
                <p>The trial began on 11th April 1310. On 23d April Reginald de Praino protested
                    against the unfairness of the proceedings. On Tuesday, 12th May, fifty-four
                    Templars were burnt by order of the archbishop of Sens, and a few days later
                    four more. Next day the terror spread (19th May). Forty-six Templars withdrew
                    their defence and the commissioners decided (30th May) to adjourn till November.
                    The second examination lasted from 18th December 1310 to 5th June 1311.
                    Meanwhile (c. April 1311) Clement and Philip had come to terms. The pope
                    condemned the Templars. The council of Vienne met in October 1311. A discussion
                    arose as to whether the Templars should be heard in their own defence. Clement,
                    it is said, broke up the session to avoid compliance; and when seven Templars
                    offered themselves as deputies for the defence he had them cast into prison.
                    Towards the beginning of March Philip came to Vienne, and he was seated at the
                    pope’s right hand when that pontiff delivered his sermon against the Templars
                    (3d April 1312), whose order had just been abolished, not at the general
                    council, but in private consistory (22d March). On 2d May 1312 he published the
                    bull <hi rend="italic">Ad Providam,</hi> transferring the goods of the society,
                    except for the kingdoms of Castile, Aragon, Portugal, and Majorca, to the
                    Knights of St John. The order was never formally pronounced guilty of the crimes
                    laid to its charge; its abolition was distinctly, in the terms of Clement’s bull
                    <hi rend="italic">Considerantes. Dudum,</hi> “non per modum definitiv®
                    sententiae, cum eam super hoc secundum inquisitiones et processus super his
                    habftos non possemus ferre de jure sed per viam provisionis et ordinationis
                    apostolic®” (6th May 1312).</p>
                <p>The individual members of the order seem to have been left to the judgment of
                    provincial councils. They were divided into three classes,—(1) those who
                    confessed at once; (2) those who persisted in denial of the charges; (3) those
                    who, having confessed at first, withdrew their confessions later on the plea
                    that they had been extracted by torture. The penalties for the three classes
                    were respectively (1) penitence, (2) perpetual imprisonment, (3) death by fire.
                    The cases of the grand-master, the visitor of France, and the masters of
                    Aquitaine and Normandy were reserved for the pope’s decision. Early in 1314 they
                    were forced to make a public confession in Notre Dame, and had already been
                    condemned to perpetual imprisonment when the grand-master and the preceptor of
                    Normandy publicly proclaimed their entire innocence. The king, without
                    consulting the church, had them burnt “in the little island” of the Seine
                    “between the Augustinians and the royal garden.”</p>
                <p>The opinion that the monstrous charges brought against the Templars were false
                    and the confessions were only extracted by torture is supported by the general
                    results of the investigation (in almost every country outside France), as we
                    have them collected in Raynouard, Labbe, and Du Puy. In Castile, where the king
                    flung them into prison, they were acquitted at the council of Salamanca. In
                    Aragon, where they held out for a time in their fortresses against the royal
                    power, the council of Tarragona proclaimed in their favour (4th November 1312).
                    In Portugal the commissioners reported that there were no grounds for
                    accusation. At Mainz the council pronounced the order blameless. At Treves, at
                    Messina, and at Bologna, in Romagna and in Cyprus, they were either acquitted or
                    no evidence was forthcoming against them. At the council of Ravenna the question
                    as to whether torture should be used was answered in the negative except by two
                    Dominicans; all the Templars were absolved,—even those who had confessed through
                    fear of torture being pronounced innocent (18th June 1310). Six Templars were
                    examined at Florence, and their evidence is for its length the most remarkable
                    of all that is still extant. Roughly speaking, they confess with the most
                    elaborate detail to every charge, —even the most loathsome; and the perusal of
                    their evidence induces a constant suspicion that their answers were practically
                    dictated to them in the process of the examination or invented by the witnesses
                    themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    evidence in full ap. Loiseleur, pp. 172-212.</p></note> In England, where
                    perhaps torture was not used, out of eighty Templars examined only four
                    confessed to the charge of denying Christ, and of these four two were apostate
                    knights. But some English Templars would only guarantee the purity of their own
                    country. That in England as elsewhere the charges were held to be not absolutely
                    proved seems evident from the form of confession to be used before absolution,
                    in which the Templars acknowledge themselves to be defamed in the matter of
                    certain articles that they cannot purge themselves. In England nearly all the
                    worst evidence comes at second or third <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n176/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0176-0165"/> hand or through the depositions of Franciscans
                    and Dominicans. Yet it can hardly be doubted that the “spuitio super crucem” did
                    form a part of the initiation ceremony. Even the English Templars admitted that
                    the statutes of the order were one and the same all the world over; and there is
                    no setting aside the consistent evidence of almost every French Templar as to
                    his guilt in this matter. Of the other charges the most revolting may have
                    originated in the abuse and misinterpretation of a licence primarily intended
                    for military emergencies. Such at least is the form it seems to take in the
                    evidence of John Senand (ap. Mich., ii. p. 137). A debased mind might
                    misinterpret this concession and translate it into coarser words, till (this
                    part of the initiation ceremony being probably conducted in private, as, most
                    certainly, was the spitting on the cross) there might be two formularies current
                    in the order, of which the second was plainly immoral, whereas the first was
                    perfectly harmless unless coupled with a <hi rend="italic">sous-entendre.</hi>
                    So too with regard to the <hi rend="italic">spuitio.</hi> One Templar says
                    plainly that he took it for a joke,— <hi rend="italic">pro trufa</hi>; others
                    regarded it as an imitation of St Peter’s denial; a modern writer has suggested
                    that the custom was intended as a symbol of absolute obedience (ap. Mich., ii.
                    260). There is little doubt that most members looked upon the ceremony with
                    disgust. Some salved their consciences by the excuse that they were denying
                    Jesus and not Christ; another when shown the crucifix denied his belief in the
                    painted figure. Nearly all declared that they had spat near but not upon the
                    cross, and denied Christ “non corde sed ore.” Men who could thus play with their
                    own consciences at their initiation might well, when their lives were in peril,
                    clothe a falsehood in the garb of truth by denying “spuitio super crucem”
                    instead of confessing to “spuitio juxta crucem.”</p>
                <p>The other charges stand upon a somewhat similar footing. The power of lay
                    absolution might easily be developed out of the harmless words with which the
                    master or preceptor dismissed his chapter. The cordulae which Templars were
                    accused of wearing in honour of their idol take a very different appearance as
                    the “zones of chastity” or “belt of Nazareth” worn in accordance with St
                    Bernard’s precept. With regard to the charge of idolatry the evidence is very
                    conflicting. In France and at Florence a large proportion of the members
                    confessed to indecent kissing <hi rend="italic">(pscula inhonesta')</hi> at
                    their initiation; but hardly a single English Templar admitted the charge, and
                    one French witness suggested an almost ludicrous explanation of the rumour. Here
                    also a simple ceremony of respect or humiliation seems to have been expanded
                    into one of shamelessness; but the evidence is too strong to admit of its being
                    explained away, at least in France.</p>
                <p>Not a few witnesses confessed that they had been called upon to declare Christ a
                    false prophet, who suffered for His own sins and not for the race, and to
                    believe only in a superior God of the heavens <hi rend="italic">(Heu,m coeli
                    superiorem).</hi> One Florence witness admits that the idol was worshipped as
                    God and Saviour. It was this head, according to one of the witnesses, that could
                    make the order rich and cause the earth to bud and the trees to blossom. A
                    Carcassonne Templar spoke of the idol (Raynouard, 241) as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >friend of God,</hi> who converses with God when he wishes. On such evidence Μ.
                    Loiseleur holds that the Templars were members of a secret religion, which
                    combined the heretical teachings of the Bogomilians and the Luci-ferians. The
                    former, “the friends of God,” believed in a Supreme Deity, whose eldest son
                    Satanael was the creator of our world after his revolt against his father, and
                    whose younger son Jesus was made man to counteract the evil deeds of his
                    brother. They did not venerate the cross, regarding it as the instrument of
                    Christ’s passion. The Luciferians, on the other hand, worshipped the eldest son,
                    who had power over all the riches of this world. Μ. Loiseleur has shown some
                    remarkable coincidences, verbal and otherwise, between the creed of these two
                    sects and that of the Templars, who, according to him, borrowed from the former
                    their belief in the Supreme Deity and from the latter their devotion to the God
                    of this earth. It seems, however, doubtful whether he is justified in combining
                    the several items of such scattered evidence into a complete doctrinal system.
                    His argument might be turned against himself; for, if these heresies were so
                    widely spread in mediaeval Europe, are they not for that reason those most
                    likely to be ascribed to an unpopular order?</p>
                <p>On the whole it may perhaps be admitted that the charges of ‘ ‘ spuitio” and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> ‘ osculatio inhonesta” were current, at least
                    sporadically, for fifty years before the suppression of the order.<note

                    the grand-master (who died 1273), according to the evidence of the preceptor of
                    Aquitaine. On the death of William de Beaujeu (1291) there were two rivals for
                    the office of grand-master,—Hugh de Peraud, the visitor of France, and James de
                    Molai. The latter in 1291, at a general chapter, had declared his intention of
                    extirpating certain practices in the order of which he did not approve<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mich., ii. 139,
                    247.</p></note>; while, if we may trust the French witnesses, the most vigorous
                    initiator according to the new method was Hugh de Peraud. This exactly fits in
                    with the account<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mich.,
                    ii. 132.</p></note> that the errors were introduced after</p>
                <p>William de Beaujeu’s death. In other words, it is probable that the party of Hugh
                    de Peraud between 1290 and 1307 made a desperate effort to enforce the new
                    ceremonies and the new doctrines throughout France and England. The custom of
                    “spuitio,” at all events, was very ancient, and Hugh de Peraud devoted his
                    energies to the propagation of the “osculatio inhonesta.” This would explain the
                    omission of all allusion to the latter ceremony when the English Templars were
                    absolved; for they would not confess to a practice of which they were innocent.
                    This theory likewise goes a long way towards interpreting both the confession
                    and the denial of James de Molai and the general acquittal of the Templars in
                    nearly all the councils outside France. (T. A. A. )</p>
