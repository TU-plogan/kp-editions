                    the land, or the increase of flocks attributed to his blessing. At first this
                    tribute is not measured or enforced by law: the gift is a voluntary one, the
                    magnitude of which may be fixed by a vow, or influenced by public opinion as to
                    what is reasonable, but is not prescribed by any stated authority having power
                    to exact what is prescribed. In the oldest Hebrew legislation sacrificial gifts
                    to Jehovah (firstlings and first-fruits) are demanded; but apart from the
                    consecration of the firstlings, which is imperative (Exod. xxii. 29 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.,</hi> xxxiv. 19 <hi rend="italic">sqj),</hi> the amount is not
                    fixed. In Deuteronomy (xiv. 22 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∖</hi> on the other hand, the tithe or tenth of corn, wine, and oil is required
                    in addition to the firstlings of the flock and the herd. This precept, written
                    down in the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is plainly no
                    innovation, but rests on older usage (cp. Gen. xxviii. 22; Amos iv. 4); the new
                    point emphasized is not that tithes must be paid, but that they must be consumed
                    at the central, instead of a local, sanctuary (Deut. xii. 6, 11, xiv. 23 <hi

                    >(rëshïth)</hi> is a small gift to the priests, a mere basketful (xviii. 4,
                    xxvi. 2 <hi rend="italic">sq.').</hi></p></note> The establishment of such a
                    standard does not necessarily imply that full payment was exacted; in Gen.
                    xxviii. 22 Jacob vows of his own free will to pay tithes, just as the Arabs used
                    to vow the tithe of the increase of the flock (schol. on Hárith, <hi
                    rend="italic">Moall.,</hi> 1. 69, ed. Arnold). The Arab did not always fulfil
                    his vow, and there was no force to make him do so. But, however inexactly it may
                    often have been paid, the proportion of one part in ten seems to have been
                    accepted in many ancient nations as the normal measure of sacred tribute paid
                    from the gains of husbandry, trade, or even of war.<note anchored="true"

                    Lydia (Nie. Damasc., fr. 24).</p></note> The tithe, in fact, appears to have
                    been a common form of tax upon the produce of land or other revenues, for civil
                    as well as for sacred purposes. We find it in Greece (as at Athens), and in
                    Sicily and Asia, under the Roman empire; but its special home was in the East.
                    It was exacted on agricultural products and flocks by Hebrew kings (1 Sam. viii.
                    15,17), and on imports by the monarchs of Babylon (Aristotle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Econ.,</hi> ed. Berlin, p.1352b). Aristotle gives the tithe on fruits of the
                    soil the first place among the revenues of satraps <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Ibid.,</hi> p. 1345b), and it still forms an important element in the fiscal
                    system of Mohammedan states. It will be observed that the proportion of one in
                    ten has been applied in the East, and in antiquity generally, to imports of very
                    different kinds, and in Mohammedan taxation we find the name retained in cases
                    where much less than a tenth is actually taken. In like manner Aristotle <hi
                    rend="italic">{ut supra)</hi> makes <hi rend="italic">8eκατη</hi> a mere synonym
                    of <hi rend="italic">eκφοpιον,</hi> or tax on produce; the proportion of one to
                    ten, it would seem, was so commonly taken in antiquity as the basis of <hi
                    rend="italic">ad valorem</hi> taxes that any such tax or tribute might be called
                    a tithe. As regards the sacred tithe of the Hebrews, a distinction is drawn in
                    Deuteronomy between the ordinary annual tithe, which may not have been a full
                    tenth, and the “whole” or “full tithe,” paid once in three years</p>
                <p>(Deut. xiv. 28, xxvi. 12), which the legislator directs to be stored at home, and
                    spent in feeding the poor.</p>
                <p>From Amos iv. 4 it is sometimes inferred that in the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the sacrificial tithe, presented at a sanctuary, was
                    triennial. But when the prophet, mocking the false zeal of the people, says,
                    “Bring your sacrifices every morning and your tithes every three days” (not
                    “years,” as E.V.), he hardly implies more than that occasions of sacrifice were
                    three times as frequent as tithe-day, and so alludes to the fact that there were
                    by old usage three annual feasts and one annual tithe. A triennial sacrificial
                    tithe is inconceivable when it is remembered that the tithe is only an extension
                    of the first-fruits. The triennial tithe in Deuteronomy seems to be rather an
                    innovation necessary in the interests of the poor, when sacrificial feasts were
                    transferred to the central sanctuary, and ceased to benefit the neighbours of
                    the offerer, who had a prescriptive claim to be considered on such occasions
                    (comp. 1 Sam. xxv. 8 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi>; Neh. viii. 10; Luke xiv.
                    13).</p>
                <p>The priests of the sanctuaries had of old a share in the sacrificial feasts, and
                    among those who are to share in the triennial tithe Deuteronomy includes the
                    Levites, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the priests of the local sanctuaries who
                    had lost their old perquisites by the centralization of worship. After the
                    return, and before the work of Ezra, when Deuteronomy was still the law of the
                    new Israel, but the Levites had become subordinate ministers of the temple, and
                    required a more regular provision, the “whole tithe” was naturally fixed on for
                    this purpose; but, instead of remaining in the hands of the tithe-payers to be
                    doled out in charity, it was stored in the temple. Such, at least, was the plan
                    proposed, though from Mai. iii. 8 <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi> it appears that it
                    was very imperfectly carried out. As Malachi speaks in Deuteronomic phrase of
                    the “whole tithe,” the payment to the Levites was perhaps still only triennial;
                    and, if even this was difficult to collect, we may be sure that the minor
                    sacrificial tithe had very nearly disappeared. The indifference complained of in
                    Mai. i. was in great part due to the fundamental changes in the religion of
                    Israel, which made private altar gifts and feasts almost meaningless. On the
                    other hand, the provision of regular support for the priests and Levites, the
                    ministers of the public ritual, was now all important, and received special
                    attention from Ezra and Nehemiah (Neh. x. 37 <hi rend="italic">sqq.,</hi> xiii.
                    10 <hi rend="italic">sqq.).</hi> They effected it by enforcing the new law of
                    the priestly code (Num. xviii. 21 <hi rend="italic">sqq.),</hi> in which it is
                    formally laid down that the tithe is a tribute paid to the Levites, who in turn
                    pay a tithe of it to the priests. The plain intention of the priestly code is to
                    allow the old tithe of Deuteronomy to drop; but the harmonistic interpretation
                    of the later scribes was to the effect that two tithes were to be paid every
                    year, and a third tithe, for the poor, on every third year (Tob. i. 7 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.∙,</hi> Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> iv. 8, § 22). The
                    last change in the system was the appropriation of the Levitical tithe by the
                    priests, which apparently was effected by John Hyrcanus, though a tradition
                    glaringly inconsistent with Nehemiah ascribes it to Ezra <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Long before the 8th century payment of tithes was enjoined by ecclesiastical
                    writers and by councils of the church; but the earliest authentic example of
                    anything like a law of the state enforcing payment appears to occur in the
                    Capitularies of Charlemagne at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th
                    century. Tithes were by that enactment to be applied to the maintenance of the
                    bishop and clergy, the poor,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    church. In course of time the principle of payment of tithes was extended far
                    beyond its original intention. Thus they became transferable to laymen and
                    saleable like ordinary property, in spite of the injunctions of the third
                    Lateran council, and they became payable out of sources of income which were not
                    originally tithable. The canon law contains numerous and minute provisions on
                    the subject of tithes. The <hi rend="italic">Decrehιm</hi> forbade their
                    alienation to lay proprietors, denounced excommunication against those who

                    mention of tithes in statute law proper is in the Statute of Westminster the
                    Second in 1285, c. 5 of which deals with the patron’s writ <hi rend="italic"

                    present year (1887) there have been a large number of Acts dealing with
                    tithes,—the earliest which is still law being 2 Hen. IV. c. 4, making it an
                    offence to purchase a bull from the pope for the discharge of land from tithes.
                    The law has only attained its present condition by slow degrees, and by the
                    combined effect of statutes and judicial decisions. The effect of the Tithe
                    Commutation Act of 1836 has been to make most of the old law of merely
                    historical interest, as in the course of the commutation all the questions of
                    law as to prescription, exemptions, &amp;c., would have been duly considered by
                    the commissioners before the rentcharge was finally apportioned.</p>
                <p>Tithes in English law are of three kinds,—predial, arising immediately from the
                    soil, as of corn; mixed, arising from things nourished by the soil, as of milk
                    or wool; personal, as of the profits of manual occupations or trades. The right
                    to the last was considerably restricted by 2 and 3 Edw. VI. c. 13. They are also
                    divided from other points of view into ordinary and extraordinary,—the latter
                    being a tithe at a heavier rate charged on hop and market gardens,—and into
                    great and small, as a rule those which go to the rector and vicar respectively.
                    In general great tithes are predial, small are mixed and personal. It is not
                    everything that is tithable; exemptions are claimable either from the nature of
                    the property or the privilege of the owner. Stone, lime, and such other
                    substances as are not of annual increase are exempt. So are creatures <hi
                    rend="italic">ferae naturae.</hi> Exempt by privilege are the crown by its
                    prerogative, and spiritual corporations in accordance with the maxim recognized
                    equally by canon and common law, <hi rend="italic">ecclesia decimas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">non solvit ecclesiae.</hi> Thus a rector pays no tithes to his
                    vicar, or a vicar to his rector. On the same principle it is a ground of
                    exemption that lands were anciently the property of the privileged orders (at
                    the time of the dissolution of monasteries, the Cistercians and Hospitallers),
                    or were lands of the greater monasteries discharged from tithe by 31 Hen. VIII.
                    c. 13. Exemption may also be claimed by redemption, by substitution of a
                    rent-charge, by a real composition (that is, an agreement between the incumbent
                    and the landowner, with the consent of the ordinary and patron, for the
                    discharge from payment of tithe by means of satisfaction by giving of land or
                    some other real recompense), by a <hi rend="italic">modus</hi> (that is, a
                    partial discharge owing to some customary method of tithing or <hi rend="italic"
                    >modus</hi><hi rend="italic">decimandi),</hi> or by prescription under 2 and 3
                    Will. IV. fc. 100. Tithes in extra-parochial places belonged at common law to
                    the crown, except by custom. Tithes are incorporeal hereditaments (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Real Estate),</hi> and may be dealt with like any other real
                    estate of that nature. Thus they are, if in lay hands, tenements which may be
                    entailed or leased, are subject to dower and curtesy, are assets for the payment
                    of debts, and are (whether in lay hands or not) within the Statute of
                    Limitations. They do not, however, issue out of the land like rents, but are
                    collateral to it. Accordingly tithes are always freehold, even though they are
                    charged on copyhold lands. Tithes are presumed to go to the parson ot the
                    parish. This presumption may be rebutted by proof that some or all the tithes go
                    to the vicar, where the rector is in holy orders, or to a lay impropriator. It
                    is said that about a third part of the tithes in England is in the hands of
                    laymen. At one time arbitrary consecration of tithes was allowed,—that is,
                    payment to any priest at the will of the tithepayer. This was forbidden by a
                    decretal epistle of Innocent III., about 1200. “This epistle decretali,” says
                    Coke, “bound not the subjects of this realm, but the same being just and
                    reasonable they allowed the same, and so became <hi rend="italic">lex
                    terrae.’’</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Inst.,</hi> 641.</p></note> A vestige of the arbitrary
                    consecration perhaps exists in the rarely occurring right of the parson of one
                    parish to a portion of the tithes of another. Tithes are payable by all persons
                    alike, whether members of the Church of England or not. Special enactments deal
                    with their recovery from Roman Catholics and Quakers. Up to 1836 tithes were
                    paid in kind, unless where any other method of payment applied in a particular
                    case, such as a <hi rend="italic">modus</hi> in the nature of a pecuniary
                    compensation, or a pecuniary payment under the terms of a public or private Act,
                    as in the city of London by 37 Hen. VIII. c. 12, 22 and 23 Car. II. c. 15, and
                    other Acts. Even before 1836, however, the bulk of the tithes had been commuted,
                    but such commutation was in ordinary cases good only during the tenure of a
                    particular incumbency, and did not bind the incumbent’s successors. The Act of
                    1836 merely completed and gave legislative sanction to a tendency which had been
                    long on the increase.</p>
                <p>The effect of the Tithe Commutation Act, 1836 (6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 71,
                    frequently amended since), was to substitute for the tithe paid in kind or the
                    fluctuating commuted tithe a rentcharge—commonly called the tithe
                    rent-charge—equivalent to the market value from time to time on a septennial
                    average of the exact quantities of wheat, barley, and oats which made up the
                    legal tithes by the estimate in 1836. Excepted from the operation of the Act are
                    (unless where there is a special provision approved by the commissioners) tithes
                    of fish or of fishing, or any personal tithes other than those of mills, or any
                    mineral tithes, or payments or rent-charges in lieu of tithes in London and
                    other places, resting on the authority of local Acts. The Act has not been
                    wholly successful in its working. By the transfer of estates, and by changes in
                    local agriculture, the old estimates are no· longer fairly applicable in all
                    cases. The commutation has been, on the whole, to the advantage of the
                    landowners, for the tithe remains fixed while the rental of land since 1836 has
                    risen, according to Sir James Caird, from 33 millions to 52 millions per annum.
                    Commutation under the Act is either by a voluntary agreement, confirmed by the
                    tithe commissioners,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By
                    the Settled Land Act, 1882, the tithe commissioners have, with other bodies,
                    been merged in the land commissioners constituted by the Act.</p></note> or by
                    an award of the commissioners. The machinery for determining the tithe for any
                    given year is as follows :—the Board of Trade is to cause the average prices per
                    imperial bushel of each sort of British corn to be computed from the summaries
                    sent by the inspectors of corn returns, obtained from the averages stated by the
                    inspectors, and published in the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> weekly,
                    quarterly, and yearly, and a septennial average is to be obtained from the sum
                    of the annual averages divided by seven (45 and 46 Vict. c. 37, superseding
                    sect. 56 of the Act of 1836). The rent-charge is computed on the basis of
                    one-third for wheat, one-third for barley, and one-third for oats. The
                    respective prices were originally fixed by 7 Will. IV. and 1 Vict. c. 69, s. 7
                    (as altered by the <hi rend="italic">London Gazette</hi> of 9th December 1837),
                    at 7s. l∣d. for wheat, 3s. ll⅜d∙ for barley, and 2s. 9d. for oats per bushel.
                    The prices for 1887 were 4s. lid., 3s. 10d., and 2s. 7⅜d. respectively. Owing to
                    this fall in prices, tithe rent-charge which stood at £100 in 1836 was worth in
                    1887 only £87, 8s. 10d.</p>
                <p>After the coming into force of the Act of 1836 all lands were discharged from
                    tithe, and the tithe rent-charge was substituted, payable by equal half-yearly
                    payments, each 1st of July and 1st of January. A tenant paying the rent-charge
                    is to be allowed the same in account with his landlord. The charge thus
                    ultimately falls upon the landlord, whether or not he pays it in the first
                    instance to the tithe-owner. Land may be given instead of a rentcharge where the
                    tithe-owner is an ecclesiastical person. Gardens or small tenements may be
                    exempt from tithe by 3 and 4 Vict. c. 15. Later Acts give a power of redemption
                    of rent-charge in the case of land required for public purposes, settled land,
                    &amp;c. (9 and 10 Vict. c. 73; 23 and 24 Vict. c. 93; 41 and 42 Vict. c. 42; 45
                    and 46 Vict. c. 38). Merger of the rent-charge is allowed by tenants in fee or
                    in tail under the Act of 1836, and by persons having powers of appointment,
                    tenants for life, and owners of glebes under 1 and 2 Vict. c. 64 and 2 and 3
                    Vict. c. 62. The mode of recovery of arrears provided by the Act of 1836 was a
                    new one. Up to that time arrears could not be distrained for, unless in
                    exceptional cases. The remedy of the parson was a suit for subtraction of
                    tithes, which, by 2 and 3 Edw. VI. c. 13, could only be brought in a spiritual
                    court. The remedy of the lay holder was a suit or action in any temporal court
                    by 32 Hen. VIII.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n432/mode/1up"

                <p>c. 7. It is provided by the Act of 1836 that, if the rent-charge be in arrear for
                    twenty-one days, the person entitled to it may, after ten days’ notice in
                    writing, distrain upon the lands liable to the payment of it. If it be in arrear
                    for forty days, and there be no sufficient distress on the premises, a writ of
                    <hi rend="italic">habere facias possessionem</hi> may issue, directing the
                    sheriff to summon a jury to assess arrears. Not more than two years’ arrears can
                    be recovered by either means. It appears from these sections of the Act that the
                    charge binds the land alone, and that there is no personal liability of either
                    landlord or tenant. Though the charge is on the land, it is not on the
                    inheritance, and it has been recently decided that arrears are not recoverable
                    by sale of the lands out of which the rent-charge issues. The assessment of the
                    rent-charge on wastes, common or Lammas lands, coppice wood, turnips, cattle
                    agisted, &amp;c., and the commutation of corn rents created by local Acts, are
                    the subject of special provisions. The Act of 1836 and later Acts provided for
                    the division of the charge upon hop grounds, orchards, fruit plantations, and
                    market gardens into the ordinary and extraordinary charge, the latter to be a
                    rate per acre in addition to the ordinary charge. The extraordinary tithe
                    applies only while the land is cultivated as a hop ground, &amp;c., and in case
                    of new cultivation comes into operation gradually, the full rate not being
                    levied at once. The incidence of the extraordinary tithe having been found an
                    impediment to agriculture, especially in Kent, the Extraordinary Tithe
                    Commutation Act, 1886 (49 and 50 Vict c. 54), was passed as a remedy. It
                    provides that no extraordinary tithe is to be charged upon any land newly
                    cultivated after the passing of the Act. With regard to land subject at the
                    passing of the Act to extraordinary tithe, the Act enables the land
                    commissioners to certify the capital value of the extraordinary tithe on each
                    farm or parcel of land, the land to be charged in lieu of the tithe with the
                    payment of an annual rent-charge equal to 4 per cent, on the capital value. The
                    owner or any other person interested in the land may redeem the charge at its
                    capital value. Tithe rent-charge is subject by the Act of 1836 to all
                    parliamentary, parochial, and county rates, and is an hereditament within the
                    Poor Kate Act of the same year (6 and 7 Will. IV. c. 96). The latter Act further
                    enacts that in estimating the net annual value of rateable hereditaments, the
                    rent is to be estimated free, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> of tithe

                    but the latter is the more common. Teinds are either drawn in kind, valued, or
                    redeemed. Originally they were all drawn in kind, as in England, but their
                    commutation or redemption was the subject of many Acts of the Scottish
                    parliament, especially those passed in 1633, the practical effect of which has
                    been to make a fixed burden on the land take the place of a fluctuating payment,
                    and to substitute a payment of one-fifth of the rent for one-tenth of the
                    produce. In the first instance all teinds went to the church; but, when at the
                    Reformation the crown became proprietor of the church lands, grants were made by
                    it to the lords of erection or titulars of the tithes, laymen holding of the
                    crown. The Act 1587, c. 29, annexed the church lands to the crown, with certain
                    exceptions in favour of lay holders and others. All bishops’ teinds and those
                    formerly part of the revenue of the chapel royal are now crown property. The
                    Church Patronage Act of 1874 does not affect the right to teinds of a patron or
                    titular. Teinds in lay hands are subject to the burden of providing a suitable
                    provision for the minister, the stipend being fixed by the Court of Teinds. All
                    lands are subject to teinds except those which before the Reformation were feued
                    <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">decimis inclusis et nunquam antea
                    separatis,</hi> so that the grantee held lands and teinds together. In order to
                    prove such an exemption, the person claiming under a <hi rend="italic">decimae
                    inclusae</hi> title must show that the lands and teinds belonged to a monastery,
                    that the lands were never teindable, that they were <hi rend="italic"
                    >novalia,</hi> or reclaimed by the monks themselves, that the title bears that
                    the lands are held <hi rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">decimis
                    inclusis,</hi> &amp;c., and that it is previous to 1587. The judges of the Court
                    of Session sit as commissioners of teinds,—a jurisdiction specially preserved by
                    art xix. of the Act of Union,—and exercise wider powers than any existing body
                    in England, as they possess at once the jurisdiction of a court of justice and
                    of the English land commissioners. The constitution and procedure of the Court
                    of Teinds is regulated by 48 Geo. III. c. 138 and subsequent Acts.<note

                    being 33 Hen. VIII. c. 12, based upon the English Act, 28 Hen. VIII. c. 20.
                    After the “tithe war” at the beginning of the 19 th century, a tithe composition
                    payable by the occupier was fixed by 4 Geo. IV. c. 99. In 1838 an annual
                    rent-charge equal in amount to three-fourths of the tithe composition was
                    substituted for the latter by 1 and 2 Vict. c. 109. The rent-charge is
                    recoverable by distress where the person liable is the occupier, in other cases
                    by action in the High Court of Justice, or by civil bill in claims under £20.
                    The Irish Church Act, 1869 (32 and 33 Vict. c. 42), vests all tithe rent-charge
                    then belonging to clergy of the Irish Church in the commissioners of church
                    temporalities in Ireland. By that Act and the amending Act, 35 and 36 Vict. c.
                    90, the commissioners are enabled to purchase the surrender or assignment of any
                    subsisting lease of tithe rent-charge made by an ecclesiastical person or
                    corporation, and to sell any rent-charge vested in them to the owner of the land
                    charged therewith for a sum equal to twenty-two and a half years’ purchase. (J.
