                    from time to time to advise parliament in matters of trade, but it was not till
                    the middle of the 17th century, under the Commonwealth, that any department of a
                    permanent character was attempted. Cromwell’s policy in this respect was
                    continued under the Restoration, and in 1660 a committee of the privy council
                    was appointed for the purpose of obtaining information as to the imports and
                    exports of the country, and improving trade. A few years later another committee
                    of the council was appointed to act as intermediaries between the crown and the
                    colonies, or foreign plantations, as they were then called. This joint
                    commission of trade and plantations was abolished in 1675, and it was not until
                    twenty years later that the Board of Trade was revived under William III. Among
                    the chief objects set before this board were the inquiry into trade obstacles
                    and the employment of the poor; the state of the silver currency was also a
                    subject on which John Locke, its secretary, lost no time in making
                    representations to the Government. Locke’s retirement in 1700 removed any chance
                    of the Board of Trade advocating more enlightened opinions on commercial
                    subjects than those generally held at that time. It had only a small share in
                    making the constitutions of the colonies, as all the American ones except
                    Georgia and Nova Scotia were formed before the reign of Charles IL; and in 1760
                    a secretary of state for the colonies was appointed, to whom the control drifted
                    away. In 1780 Burke made his celebrated attack on the public offices, which
                    resulted in the abolition of the board. In 1786, however, another permanent
                    committee of the privy council was formed by order in council, and with one or
                    two small exceptions the legal constitution of the Board of Trade is still
                    regulated by that order. Under it all the principal officers of state, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n517/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0517-0498"/> including the first lords of the treasury and
                    admiralty, the secretaries of state, and certain members of the privy council,
                    among whom was the archbishop of Canterbury, obtained seats at the board <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi>; and ten unofficial members, including several
                    eminent statesmen, were also placed on the committee. The duties of the revived
                    board were made the same as they were in the beginning of the century, but, in
                    addition, the regulation of the food supply of the country, by restricting or
                    relaxing the export and import of corn, was brought into prominence owing to a
                    larger population requiring to be fed. New duties were thrown on the board by
                    the growth of joint-stock companies, the development of railways, and the
                    increase in shipping, and it was necessary to break it up into departments
                    charged with the administration of the various Acts of Parliament. The Board of
                    Trade thus became a mere name, the president being practically the secretary of
                    state for trade, and the vice-president became, in 1867, a parliamentary
                    secretary, with similar duties to those of a parliamentary under-secretary of
                    state. At present, besides the president, who has usually a seat in the cabinet,
                    the parliamentary secretary, and a permanent secretary, there are six assistant
                    secretaries, each in charge of a department.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Commercial Department</hi> is the real remains of the
                    original Board of Trade, as it combines the charge of the trade statistics with
                    the general consultative duties with which King Charles II.’s board was
                    originally entrusted. The statistical work includes compiling the abstracts
                    relating to the United Kingdom, the colonies, and foreign countries, the
                    supervision of the trade accounts, and the preparation of shipping, railway,
                    emigration, and fishery statistics. A record of the prices of corn has been
                    obtained from actual sales in the chief market towns for about a hundred years,
                    the original object being the sliding scale of corn duties, but these are now
                    continued to govern the tithe payments, and form an unbroken series of prices
                    based on actual transactions, and not mere market quotations. Foreign and
                    colonial customs tariffs and regulations are also matters on which information
                    is published, and labour statistics are for the future to have special
                    attention. In 1872 one of the most important functions of the commercial
                    department, viz., the negotiation of commercial treaties, was transferred to the
                    Foreign Office, but the Board of Trade is still consulted on these matters by
                    the Foreign Office, as well as by the Colonial Office on colonial commercial
                    matters, and by the other public departments. The Bankruptcy Act of 1883 added a
                    new branch of work, but for this there is now a separate establishment under an
                    inspector-general. The last new work undertaken by the department is the
                    publication (begun August 1886) of a <hi rend="italic">Monthly Journal</hi> of
                    commercial information, chiefly from official sources.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Railway Department</hi> was originally constituted in
                    1840, and performs multifarious duties under various Railway Acts, including the
                    inspection of railways before they are open, inquiries into accidents, reports
                    on proposed railways, approval of bye-laws, appointment of arbitrators in
                    disputes, as well as many duties under private Railway Acts. The inspection of
                    tramways, their bye-laws and “provisional orders,” are all dealt with here, as
                    are similar orders relating to gas and water schemes and to electric lighting.
                    Patents, designs, and trade marks are now dealt with by the Patent Office, which
                    is subordinate to the railway department, and copyright, art unions, and
                    industrial exhibitions are also among the matters dealt with by the
                    department.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Marine Department</hi> was created a separate branch of
                    the Board of Trade in 1850, about which time many new and important marine
                    questions came under the Board of Trade, such, for example, as the survey of
                    passenger steamers, the compulsory examination of masters and mates, the
                    establishment of snipping offices for the engagement and discharge of seamen.
                    Further work fell to the marine department by the Act of 1853, which gave it the
                    control of lighthouse funds, and to a certain extent of pilotage. The
                    consolidating Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and subsequent legislation so much
                    increased the department that in 1866 it was divided into three, viz., the
                    present marine department, which deals with ships and seamen, the harbour
                    department, and the finance department.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Harbour Department</hi> was, as stated above, a branch
                    of the marine department until 1866, so far as it is connected with the physical
                    adjuncts of navigation, but various other matters have since been added, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the charge of the foreshores belonging to the crown,
                    formerly managed by the commissioners of woods and forests, and the protection
                    of navigable harbours and channels, long under the control of the Admiralty.
                    Lighthouse funds, provisional orders for oyster and mussel fisheries, the
                    management of Holyhead and Ramsgate harbours and of Dover pier, wreck, and
                    quarantine are all among the matters dealt with by this department, which also
                    has charge of the standards department for weights and measures.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Finance Department</hi> was, like the harbour
                    department, separated in 1866 from the marine department. The accounts of all
                    the branches of the Board of Trade are in its charge, including the subordinate
                    offices. It also deals with the accounts of harbours, lighthouses, and
                    mercantile marine offices, and of the merchant seamen’s fund, and with the
                    consuls’ accounts for disabled seamen abroad. Savings banks and seamen’s money
                    orders are also among the accounts and payments with which it is charged, and
                    outside these marine matters it has to prepare for parliament the life insurance
                    companies’ accounts and to take charge of the bankruptcy estate accounts.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Fisheries Department.—</hi> By a recent Act the powers
                    of the Home Office over salmon and other fisheries have been transferred to the
                    Board of Trade, and a small department has consequently been created charged
                    with the care of those industries.</p>
