                    and the immediate predecessor of Propertius. The information which we possess
                    about him is extremely meagre. Besides the poems themselves—that is to say, the
                    first and second books—we have only a few references in later authors and a
                    short <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of probable but not undoubted genuineness. We
                    do not know his praenomen; and his birthplace is uncertain. It is, however, a
                    plausible conjecture that he came from Gabii. The year of his birth has been
                    variously assigned; but 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> may be taken as
                    approximately correct. This would make him about twenty-five when he accompanied
                    Messala on his Aquitanian campaign in 29, and thirty-five at his untimely death
                    in 19. His station was that of a Roman knight; and he had inherited a very
                    considerable estate. But, like Virgil, Horace, and Propertius, he seems to have
                    lost the greater part of it in 41 amongst the confiscations which Antony and
                    Octavian found expedient to satisfy the rapacity of their victorious soldiery.
                    Tibullus, like Propertius, seems to have lost his father early. He once mentions
                    his mother and sister; and, according to Ovid’s elegy upon him, they were alive
                    at his death.</p>
                <p>Tibullus’s chief friend and patron was M. Valerius Messala Corvinus, himself an
                    orator and poet as well as a statesman and commander. Messala, like Maecenas,
                    was the centre of a literary circle in Rome; but the bond between its members
                    was that of literature alone. They stood in no relations to the court; and the
                    name of Augustus is never once to be found in the writings of Tibullus. It was
                    doubtless this community of taste which gained the young poet the friendly
                    notice of Messala, who offered him an honourable position on his private staff
                    when he was despatched at the end of 30 by Augustus to quell the Aquitanian
                    revolt. Tibullus distinguished himself in the campaign and was decorated for his
                    services. But this did not rouse in him any military ardour. His tastes lay in
                    quite other directions; and he always speaks of war with horror and dislike. At
                    the end of the war in 29 Tibullus returned to Rome, and thenceforward his life
                    seems to have been divided between Rome and his country estate, though his own
                    preferences were altogether for the country life. Soon after his return he made
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n368/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0368-0349"/> acquaintance of his first love, Delia. This is
                    what he calls her in his poems; but we learn from Apuleius that her real name
                    was Plania. Delia seems to have been a woman of middle station. It is impossible
                    to give an exact account of the intimacy. The poems which refer to her are
                    arranged in no chronological order. She appears now as single, now as married;
                    but we do not hear anything either of her marriage or of her husband’s death. It
                    is clear, however, that it was the absence of her husband on military service in
                    Cilicia which gave Tibullus the opportunity of making or renewing the
                    acquaintance. It was not dropped when he returned, probably with Messala in 27.
                    It was not a difficult task to deceive the simple soldier; and Delia was an apt
                    pupil in the school of deception,—too apt, as Tibullus saw with dismay when he
                    found that he was not the only lover. His entreaties and appeals were of no
                    avail; and after the first book we hear no more of Delia. It was during the
                    earlier period of this attachment and probably in the spring of 28 that,
                    yielding to his friend’s earnest and repeated requests, Tibullus left Delia to
                    accompany Messala on a mission to Asia. He fell ill, however, and could not get
                    farther than Corcyra. In the second book the place of Delia is taken by Nemesis,
                    which is also a fictitious name. Nemesis (like the Cynthia of Propertius) was a
                    courtesan of the higher class; and she had other admirers besides Tibullus. He
                    complains bitterly of his bondage, and of her rapacity and hardheartedness. In
                    spite of all, however, she seems to have retained her hold on him until his
                    death. Tibullus died prematurely, probably in 19, and almost immediately after
                    Virgil, in order, as their contemporary Domitius Marsus pathetically puts
                    it,</p>

                <p>The character of Tibullus is reflected in his poems. Though not an admirable it
                    is certainly an amiable one. He was a man of generous impulses and a gentle
                    unselfish disposition. He was loyal to his friends to the verge of
                    self-sacrifice, as is shown by his leaving Delia to accompany Messala to Asia,
                    and constant to his mistresses with a constancy but ill deserved. His tenderness
                    towards them is enhanced by a refinement and delicacy of feeling which are very
                    rare amongst the ancients. Horace and the rest taunt the cruel fair with the
                    retribution that is coming with the years, when they will exult over the decay
                    of the once imperious beauty. If Tibullus refers to such a fate, he does it by
                    way of warning and not in any petty spirit of triumph or revenge. Cruelly though
                    he may have been treated by his love, he does not invoke curses upon her head.
                    He goes to her little sister’s grave, hung so often with his garlands and wet
                    with his tears, and bemoans his fate to the dumb ashes there. Tibullus has no
                    leanings to an active life: his ideal is a quiet retirement in the country with
                    the loved one at his side. He has no ambition and not even the poet’s yearning
                    for immortality. His muse may go packing if it cannot propitiate the fair. As
                    Tibullus loved the country life, its round of simple duties and innocent
                    recreations, so he clung to its faiths, and in an age of crude materialism and
                    the grossest superstition he was religious in the old Roman way. A simple,
                    gentle, affectionate nature such as his could not fail to win esteem; and his
                    early death caused deep regret in Rome. Tibullus was remarkable, his biographer
                    tells us, for his good looks and the care that he bestowed upon his person. As a
                    poet he reminds us in many respects of the English Collins. His clear, finished,
                    and yet unaffected style made him a great favourite with his countrymen and
                    placed him, in the judgment of Quintilian, at the head of their elegiac writers.
                    And certainly within his own range he has no Roman rival. For natural grace and
                    tenderness, for exquisiteness of feeling and expression, he stands alone. He has
                    far fewer faults than Propertius, and in particular he never overloads his lines
                    with Alexandrian learning. But, for all that, his range is limited; and in power
                    and compass of imagination, in vigour and originality of conception, in richness
                    and variety of poetical treatment, he is much his inferior. The same differences
                    are perceptible in the way the two poets handle their metre. Tibullus is
                    smoother and more musical but liable to become monotonous; Propertius, with
                    occasional harshnesses, is more vigorous and varied. It need only be added that
                    in many of Tibullus’s poems a symmetrical composition is obvious, although the
                    symmetry must never be reduced to a fixed and unelastic scheme.</p>
                <p>It is probable that we have lost some of the genuine poems of Tibullus. On the
                    other hand, much has come down to us under his name which must certainly be
                    assigned to others. Only the first and second books of the usual order, or about
                    1240 verses, can claim his authorship. The first book consists of poems written
                    at various times between 30 and 26. It was probably published about 25 or 24.
                    The second book seems to have been a posthumous publication. It is very short,
                    containing only 428 verses, and is evidently incomplete. In both books occur
                    poems which give evidence of internal disorder; but scholars cannot agree upon
                    the remedies to be applied.</p>
                <p>The third book, which contains 290 verses, is by a much inferior hand. The writer
                    calls himself Lygdamus and the fair that he sings of Neaera. He was born in the
                    same year as Ovid, in the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa; but there is nothing
                    Ovidian about his work. He has very little poetical power, and his style is
                    meagre and jejune. He has a good many reminiscences and imitations of Tibullus
                    and Propertius; and they are not always happy. The separation of the fourth book
                    from the third has no ancient authority. They form one in the best MSS., and are
                    quoted as one in the anthologies of the Middle Ages. The division dates from the
                    revival of letters, and is due to the Italian scholars of the 15th century. The
                    fourth book consists of poems of very different quality. The first is a
                    composition in 211 hexameters on the achievements of Messala; and very poor
                    stuff it is. The author is unknown; but he was certainly not Tibullus. The poem
                    itself was written in 31, the year of Messala’s consulship. The next eleven
                    poems relate to the loves of Sulpicia and Cerinthus. Sulpicia was a Roman lady
                    of high station and the daughter of Valeria, Messala’s sister. She had fallen
                    violently in love with Cerinthus, about whom we know nothing but what the poet
                    tells us; and he soon reciprocated her feelings. The Sulpicia elegies divide
                    into two groups. The first comprises iv. 2-6, containing ninety-four lines, in
                    which the theme of the attachment is worked up into four graceful poems composed
                    for Sulpicia and Cerinthus alternately. The second, iv. 8-12 (to which seven
                    should be added), consists of Sulpicia’s own letters. They are very short, only
                    forty lines in all; but they have a quite unique interest as being the only love
                    poems by a Roman woman that have escaped the ravages of time. Their frank and
                    passionate outpourings remind us of Catullus. The style and metrical handling
                    betray the novice in poetical writing; and the Latinity is “feminine.” The
                    thirteenth poem (twenty-four lines) claims to be by Tibullus; but it is a
                    miserable forgery. It is little more than a cento from Tibullus and Propertius.
                    The fourteenth is a little epigram of four lines. There is nothing to determine
                    its authorship. Last of all comes the epigram of Domitius Marsus already
                    referred to. To sum up: the third and fourth books appear in the oldest
                    tradition as a single book; if separated, they would contain only 290 and 373
                    lines respectively, as against 812 of the first book and 428 of the incomplete
                    second; and they comprise pieces by different authors and in very different
                    styles, none of which can be assigned to Tibullus with any certainty. The
                    natural conclusion of this is that we have here a collection of scattered
                    compositions relating to Messala and the members of his circle which has been
                    added as an appendix to the genuine relics of Tibullus. When this collection was
                    made cannot be exactly determined; but it was certainly not till after the death
                    of Tibullus, and probably not till after Messala’s. Besides the foregoing, two
                    pieces in the collection called <hi rend="italic">Priapea</hi> have been
                    attributed to Tibullus; but there is very little external and no internal
                    evidence of his authorship. The text of Tibullus is, on the whole,
                    better-preserved than that of Catullus, and still more so than that of
                    Propertius. But it still contains many corruptions and several lacunae, besides
                    the disarrangements already referred to.</p>

                    inferior, MSS., has been much discussed. E. Baehrens maintains that it is
                    genuine, and possibly an abstract from the book of Suetonius, <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a conjecture
                    supported by the fact that even in so short a piece of writing more than one
                    Suetonian phrase occurs (Baehr., <hi rend="italic">Tibullische Blatt.,</hi> p. 4
                    sg ’.),—while Schulze <hi rend="italic">(Ztschr. f.d.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Gymnasialwesen,</hi> Berlin, xxxii. 658) regards it as a mere <hi rend="italic"

                    passages in Tibullus. E. Hiller <hi rend="italic">(Rhein.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mus.</hi>, xviii. 350) thinks it genuine, but assigns it to the late classical
                    period,—a view quite consistent with an ultimate Suetonian origin. It is as
                    follows :—“Albius Tibullus, eques R. e Gabiis [Baehrens’s ingenious conjecture

                    commentator Porphyrio (200-250 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0369-0350"/> A.D.) in his <hi rend="italic">Scholia.</hi> In
                    the former passage Horace tells Albius to moderate his grief at the cruelty of
                    Glycera, nor to descant in piteous elegies on her broken faith and the victory
                    of a younger rival. It is clear that Glycera cannot be Nemesis; for it is a
                    pseudonym, as the context shows, and Horace would, of course, have used the same
                    pseudonym as Tibullus. If, on the other hand, Nemesis were a real name, Horace
                    had no occasion to use a pseudonym. It is possible that Tibullus had another
                    mistress, Glycera, of whom we know nothing further, and that the <hi
                    rend="italic">miserabiles elegi</hi> have perished; but this is a mere
                    supposition. The Albius of the epistle has an estate at Pedum, where Horace
                    conjectures he may be musing or writing. He is handsome, rich, and knows how to
                    enjoy life. He is wise and has the gift of speech, popularity, reputation, and
                    good health <hi rend="italic">abunde,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> an enviable
                    list of attributes, but certainly one which does not agree very well with what
                    we know from elsewhere of Tibullus. The theory, then, that these passages refer
                    to Albius Tibullus must be pronounced, with Baehrens, unproven; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">forma</hi> of Horace’s Albius must not be used, as Schulze uses
                    it, to subvert the credit of the <hi rend="italic">insignis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">forma</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Life.—</hi> Ovid, <hi
                    rend="italic">Trist.,</hi> iv. 10, 53 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> “successor

                    amara Tibullo tempus amicitiae fata dedere meae.” Ovid, who was born in 43,
                    would be only twenty-four at Tibullus’s death if it occurred in 19.—The loss of
                    Tibullus’s landed property is attested by himself (i. 1, 19 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.),</hi> “Vos quoque felicis quondam, nunc pauperis agri custodes, fertis
                    munera vestra, Lares. Tunc vitula innumeros lustrabat caesa iuvencos; nunc agna
                    exigui est hostia parva soli” (comp. 41, 42). Its cause is only an inference,
                    though a very probable one. That he was allowed to retain a portion of his
                    estate with the family mansion is clear from ii. 4, 53, “Quin etiam sedes iubeat
                    si vendere avitas, ite sub imperium sub titulum-que, Lares.” Compare the
                    passages quoted above and i. 1, 77, 78.— Messala composed epigrams (Plin., <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep.,</hi> v. 3) and bucolic poems (comp, the pseudo-virgilian <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalepton,</hi> ii.); but he was more conspicuous as a patron
                    than as a poet. On his circle and that of Maecenas, see Teuffel, <hi

                    ed., p. 431 (vol. i. p. 389 of the Eng. transl.). Other members of the circle
                    were Messala’s brother, Pedius Publicola, Aemilius Macer (probably the Macer
                    addressed in ii. 6), Valgius Rufus, Lygdamus, Sulpicia, and others, and even
                    Ovid to a certain extent (Ον., <hi rend="italic">Pont.</hi>, i. 7, 28 <hi

                    triumph). It should be stated that the date of the Aquitanian campaign is still
                    undetermined. It has been assigned to 30, 29, and 28. He received <hi

                    Bl.,</hi> p. 15). Tibullus’sdislike of war is always coming to the surface <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> i. 3; i. 10), and so also his love of quiet and
                    retirement (i. 1; ii. 1; 3, 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.).—</hi> Apuleius <hi
                    rend="italic">(Apoh,</hi> 10), “accusent Tibullum . . . quod ei sit Plania in
                    animo, Delia in versu”; this is the most probable form of the name, Delia
                    (δ⅞λos) being a translation of Plania. As regards her station, it should be
                    noticed that she was not entitled to wear the <hi rend="italic">stola,</hi> the
                    dress of Roman matrons (i. 6, 68). Her husband is mentioned as absent (L 2, 67
                    <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> She eludes the custodes placed over her (i. 2, 15,
                    and 6, 7). Tibullus’s suit was favoured by Delia’s mother, of whom he speaks in
                    very affectionate terms (i. 6, 57 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> For Tibullus’s
                    illness at Corcyra, see i. 3, 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 55 <hi rend="italic"

                    >(discidium)</hi> and the sixth after the return of the husband and during
                    Delia’s double infidelity. On the difficulty of “harmonizing” the Delia elegies,
                    see F. Leo (in Kiessling and Wilamowitz-Möllendorfs <hi rend="italic">Philol.
                    Unters.,</hi> ii. pp. 19-23), who is, however, too sceptical. Any other
                    attachments that Tibullus formed (such as the supposed one for Glycera) must
                    have fallen between the end of the Delia and the beginning of the Nemesis
                    connexion.—Ovid, writing at the time of Tibullus’s death <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Am.,</hi> iii. 9, 31), says—“Sic Nemesis longum, sic Delia, nomen habebunt,
                    altera cura recens, altera primus amor.” Nemesis is the subject of book ii. 3,
                    4, 6. The mention of a <hi rend="italic">lena</hi> (ii. 6) settles her position.
                    The connexion had lasted a year when ii. 5 was written (see ver. 109). It is
                    worth noticing that Martial selects Nemesis as the source of Tibullus’s
                    reputation, “fama est arguti Nemesis lasciva Tibulli” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Epigr.,</hi> viii. 73, 7); compare xiv. 193, “ussit amatorem Nemesis lasciva
                    Tibullum, in tota iuvit quem nihil esse domo,” where, however, the second line
                    is taken from one of the Delia elegies., Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Amores,</hi>
                    iii. 9, 58, “me tenuit moriens deficiente manu.” The point of this can only be
                    seen by reference to Tib., i. 1, 60, where. Delia is addressed, “te teneam
                    moriens deficiente manu.” —The epigram of Domitius Marsus on his death is as
                    follows: “Te quoque, Vergilio comitem, non aequa, Tibulle, Mors iuvenem campos
                    misit ad Elysios, ne foret aut elegis molles qui fleret amores aut caneret forti
                    regia bella pede.”—Tibullus condemns the rough handling which the inamorata
                    often suffered from her Roman lover, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> i. 10,
                    59-60—“A! lapis est ferrumque, suam quicumque puellam verberat; e caelo deripit
                    ille deos.” The tenderness of the passage paraphrased above (ii. 6,41) is
                    perhaps unmatched in ancient poetry: “desino, ne dominae luctus renoventur
                    acerbi. Non ego sum tanti ploret ut illa semel. ”—His love for a rustic life and
                    rustic worship appears throughout whole poems, as in i. 1 and ii. 1, 2. Of h s
                    poetry he says (ii. 4, 19), “Ad dominam faciles aditus per carmina quaero; ite
                    procul, Musae, si nihil ista valent.”—Specimens of Tibullus at his best may be
                    found in i. 1, 3, 89-94; 5, 19-36; 9, 45-68; ii. 6. Quintilian says <hi
                    rend="italic">(Inst.,</hi> x. 1, 93), “Elegia quoque Graecos provocamus, cuius
                    mihi tersus atque elegans maxime videtur auctor Tibullus; sunt qui Propertium
                    malint; Ovidius utroque lascivior sicut durior Gallus.”—Ovid <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Am.,</hi><hi rend="italic">l.c.)</hi> well calls him <hi rend="italic"

                    not inadequate account of Tibullus’s prosody is given by L. Mueller in his
                    introduction to Tibullus <hi rend="italic">(Catullus, Tibullus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Propertius,</hi> Leipsic, 1880).
                    Catullus and Tibullus lengthen a short vowel before <hi rend="italic">sp</hi>

                    conjunctions, even where <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is followed by two consonants,

                    allow a trisyllabic verb to close the pentameter. Propertius never permits
                    himself this liberty, although in his earlier poems he has as many trisyllabic
                    endings as Tibullus. —The chronology of the first book is discussed amongst
                    others by Baehrens <hi rend="italic">(Tib. Bl.,</hi> pp. 12-24). But the data do
                    not admit in all cases of his precise determinations. Baehrens and Hiller <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hermes,</hi> xviii. 353) agree that the second book was
                    posthumous. If it had been known to Ovid when he wrote his elegy on the poet’s
                    death, it seems certain that he would have quoted from it. Hiller assigns 2 B.c.
                    as an inferior limit, by which time Ov., <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Am.,</hi> iii. 3, 535 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> must have been
                    written. Amongst the “disarranged poems” are i. 1, 4, 6 and ii. 3, 5. Proposed
                    rearrangements of them may be found in Hiller’s <hi rend="italic">Tibullus</hi>
                    (1885). Charisius (pp. 66 and 105) quotes part of a hexameter which is not found
                    in the extant poems of Tibullus.</p>
                <p>The Tibullian authorship of book iii. has long ago been surrendered by scholars.

                    Cranstoun. It has been suggested that <hi rend="italic">Lygdamus (</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">bybos,</hi> white marble) is a Grecizing
                    of <hi rend="italic">Albius,</hi> some relation of Tibullus (compare Hiller, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hernies,</hi> xviii. 353, n. 2); and this is possible. Gruppe’s
                    long-exploded theory that Ovid was the author has been recently revived by J.
                    Kleeman <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    Considerable difficulty is caused by iii. 5, 15-20, which contains agreements
                    with three passages of Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Ars</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Am.,</hi> ii. 669 <hi rend="italic">sq.; Tr.,</hi> iv. 10, 6: “cum cecidit fato
                    consul uterque pari” (Lygdamus and Ovid using word for word the same expression
                    for the year of their birth, the consulship of Hirtius and Pansa); and <hi
                    rend="italic">Am.,</hi> xi. 14, 23 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> which are much
                    too close to be accidental, and in which the theory that Ovid was the imitator
                    is excluded by the fact that the lines are much more appropriate to their
                    surroundings in Ovid than in Lygdamus. In consequence Baehrens (<hi
                    rend="italic">Tib. Bl.,</hi> 40) regards the poem as written after 13 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the date of the <hi rend="italic">Τristia,</hi>
                    while Hiller <hi rend="italic">(l.c.,</hi> p. 359) regards the lines as a later
                    addition by Lygdamus himself. In either case it would be published after 13. The
                    line quoted above may have obtained proverbial currency before either of the
                    passages was written, as the death of both consuls in one year would have
                    impressed the Roman imagination as powerfully as the coincident deaths of Adams
                    and Jefferson did the American. In that case no part of book iii. need be later
                    than the Christian era. For Lygdamus’s imitations of Tibullus, see Gruppe, <hi

                    that iii. and iv. originally formed one book may now be considered established,

                    were published some time after book ii., probably after the death of Messala

                    ’). Further determination of the date is impossible. We do not know when they
                    were added to the genuine poems of Tibullus; but it was probably before the <hi

                    rend="italic">(Hl. Sehr.,</hi> ii. 149) have condemned the “Panegyric on
                    Messala.” It is an inflated and at the same time tasteless declamation, entirely
                    devoid of poetical merit. The language is often absurdly exaggerated, <hi

                    marriage (Haupt, <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> iv. 33 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> Cerinthus is a real name. He was probably a Greek (Baehr., p. 41 and
                    note). He is not to be identified with the Cornutus addressed in Tib., ii. 2, 3.
                    Gruppe <hi rend="italic">(op. cit.,</hi> 27) and Teuffel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Studien,</hi> 367) attribute iv. 2-6 to Tibullus himself; but the style is
                    different, and it is best to answer the question as Baehrens does (p. 46) with a
                    <hi rend="italic">non liquet.</hi> For Sulpicia’s style and its feminine

                    is unquestionably spurious; see the examination by Postgate (<hi rend="italic"

                    His conclusions are that, as regards the iambics, the theory that Tibullus was
                    its author, though from the nature of the case it does not admit of complete
                    disproof, rests upon the slightest of foundations, and, as regards the epigram,
                    that the hypothesis of a Tibullian authorship is quite inadmissible.</p>
                <p>The text of Tibullus is in a much better condition than it was in Lachmann’s
                    time, thanks to the recent discovery of new MSS. by E. Baehrens. Of these the
                    Ambrosianus (A), of date about 1374, and the Vaticanus (V), end of the 14th or
                    beginning of the 15th century, agree so closely that they can be referred to an
                    original extant in the early part of the 12th or 13th century but long since
                    lost. A third is the Guelferbytanus (G), written in Lombard characters, but on
                    parchment of the beginning of the 15th century. Baehrens, who attaches great
                    importance to the original readings of this codex, considers it a faithful copy
                    of a 10th or 11th century MS. Besides these we have a number of extracts from
                    Tibullus in the <hi rend="italic">Florilegiurn Ρarisiηurn,</hi> an anthology
                    from various Latin writers which probably dates back to the 11th century, and
                    which we have from two MSS. at Paris (7647 and 17903); see Meyncke, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rhein.</hi><hi rend="italic">Mus.,</hi> xxv. 369 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi> Baehrens considers that these excerpta Parisina and G are closely
                    connected, and that their original and that of A and V were both descended from
                    a more ancient MS., which he calls O, but which was still fnU of corruptions.
                    The so-called <hi rend="italic">Excerpta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Frisingensia,</hi> preserved in an 11th-century MS. (now at Munich), but
                    unfortunately very few in number, are extracted from a much better MS. than O.
                    Still better was the <hi rend="italic">Fragmentum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cuiacianum,</hi> which we know only from Scaliger’s collation (in the library
                    at Leyden), and which is to be carefully distinguished from the codex
                    Cuiacianus, a late MS. containing Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius, and still
                    extant. It only contained from iii. 4, 65 to the end. The codices which Lachmann
                    used are later than all the foregoing and full of interpolations. Baehrens’s
                    estimate of the MS. authorities for Tibullus has not been accepted in all its
                    details. In particular his high estimate of G has been disputed by Leo, <hi
                    rend="italic">op. cit., p. 3</hi>; Rothstein, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tibulli Codicibus,</hi> p. 67 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> (who also
                    endeavours to raise Lachmann’s MSS. to an independent position again); and
                    others. R. Leonhard, in a careful dissertation, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Codicibus</hi><hi rend="italic">TibuUianis Capita</hi> Tria
                    (Munich, 1882), agrees with Baehrens in the main, though his pedigree of the
                    MSS. (p. 53) is more elaborate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Editions.</hi> —The first two editions of Tibullus and the
                    pseudo-Tibulliana are that with Catullus, Propertius, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Süvae</hi> of Statius by Vindelin de Spira (Venice, 1472) and one of Tibullus
                    separately by Florentius de Argentina, probably printed in the same year.
                    Compare Huschke, <hi rend="italic">Tibullus,</hi> Praef., vi. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> xxiii. <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Amongst others we may mention those
                    by Scaliger (with Catullus and Propertius, Paris, 1577, 1582, &lt;fcc.),
                    Broukhuys (Amsterdam, 1708), Vulpius (Padua, 1749), Heyne (Leipsic, 1817, 4th
                    ed. by Wunderlich; with supplement by Dissen, 1819), Huschke (Leipsic, 1819, 2
                    vols.), Lachmann (Berlin, 1829, the first critical edition), Dissen (Göttingen,
                    1835). The most important edition with critical apparatus is that of E. Baehrens
                    (Leipsic, 1878). The most recent edition, with critical introduction and index,
                    is E. Hiller’s (Leipsic, 1885). Recent texts are those of L. Mueller (Leipsic,
                    1880; also with Catullus and Propertius) and Haupt-Vahlen (Leipsic, 1885). There
                    is no good recent commentary on Tibullus; we have to fall back on Heyne and
                    Dissen. That by B. Fabricius (Berlin, 1881) does not even comprise all the
                    poems. Some contributions are made to the subject in F. Leo’s paper in
                    Kiessling’s and Wilamowitz-MoellendorΓs <hi rend="italic">Phüol.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Unters.,</hi> ii. p. 3 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> and by J.
                    Vahlen in the <hi rend="italic">Monatsberichte</hi> of the Berlin Academy, 1878,
                    pp. 343-356. For fuller bibliographies, see Engelmann’s <hi rend="italic"

                    >Bibliographical Clue to Latin Literature</hi> (1875). For the older editions,
                    see the preface to Huschke’s. There is an excellent account of Tibullus in W. S.

                    The following translations into English verse are known,—by Dart (London, 1720),
                    Grainger (London, 1739, 2 vols., with Latin text and notes, subsequently
                    reprinted), Cranstoun (Edinburgh and London, 1872). <hi rend="italic">An Essay
                    towards a New Edition of the Elegies of Tibullus, with a Translation and
                    Notes</hi> (London, 1792), merely contains i. 1 and 7, 29-48. Sir C. A. Elton,
                    <hi rend="italic">Specimens of the Classic Poets</hi> (London, 1814, vol. xii.
                    141-171) contains i. 1; ii. 4; iii. 2-4; 6, 33 to end; iv. 2, 3. To these should
                    probably be added <hi rend="italic">Tibullus, with other Translations from Ovid,
                    Horace,</hi> &amp;c., by Richard Whiffin, London, 1829. Cranstoun’s is the only
                    complete version of merit; but it is far inferior to the translations by Elton,
                    from whom Cranstoun seems sometimes to have borrowed. (J. P. P.)</p>
