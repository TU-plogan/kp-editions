                    Crete. From the last-named island it is separated by a space of 60 miles of sea,
                    but the lofty Cretan ranges of Dicte and Ida are clearly visible from it in fine
                    weather.</p>
                <p>In shape Santorin forms a crescent, and encloses a bay on the north, east, and
                    south, while on the western side lies the smaller island of Therasia. The
                    encircling wall thus formed, which is elliptical in shape and 18 miles round in
                    its inner rim, is broken in two places,—towards the north-west by a strait a
                    mile in breadth, where the water is not less than 1100 feet deep, and towards
                    the south-west by an aperture about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n297/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0297-0280"/> 3 miles wide, where the water is shallow, and an
                    island called Aspronisi or White Island, lying in the middle, serves as a
                    stepping-stone between the two promontories. The cliffs rise perpendicularly
                    from the waters of the bay, in some places to the height of 1000 feet; but
                    towards the open sea, both in Santorin and Therasia, the ground slopes gradually
                    away, and has been converted into broad level terraces, everywhere covered with
                    tufaceous agglomerate, which, though extraordinarily bare and ashen to the eye,
                    is the soil which produces the famous Santorin wine. Towards the south-east
                    rises the limestone peak of Mount Elias, the highest point of the island (1887
                    feet), and the only part that existed before the volcano was formed. In the
                    middle of the basin lie three small islands, which are the centre of volcanic
                    activity, and are called Palaea, Mikra, and Nea Kaumene, or the Old, the Little,
                    and the New Burnt Island; the highest of these, Nea Kaumene, is 351 feet above
                    the sea-level. Owing to the depth of the water there is no anchorage, and
                    vessels have to be moored to the shore, except at one point in the neighbourhood
                    of the modern town, where there is a slight rim of shallow bottom. The cliffs
                    both of Santorin and Therasia present an extraordinary appearance, being marked
                    in horizontal bands by black lava, white porous tufa, and other volcanic strata,
                    some parts of which are coloured dark red. The modern town of Thera (or Phera,
                    as it is more commonly pronounced) is built at the edge of these, overlooking
                    the middle of the bay at a height of 900 feet above the water, and the houses of
                    which it is composed are themselves peculiar, for their foundations, and in some
                    cases their sides also, are excavated in the tufa, so that occasionally they are
                    hardly traceable except by their chimneys; and, owing to the absence of
                    timber,—for, with the exception of the fig, the cactus, and the palm, there are
                    hardly any trees in the island,—they are roofed with barrel vaults of stone and
                    cement. Both wood and water have occasionally to be imported from the
                    neighbouring islands, for there are no wells, and the rain water, which is
                    collected in numerous cisterns, does not always suffice. The largest of the
                    other towns or villages is that of Apanomeria, near the northern entrance, which
                    is crowded together in a white mass, while the rocks below it are the reddest
                    that are seen in the island.</p>
                <p>Santorin has from the earliest times been a centre of volcanic agency, and is
                    closely connected with the earthquake movements to which the countries in the
                    neighbourhood of the Aegean are subject, and which have been the chief cause of
                    the destruction of the public buildings of ancient Greece. It is hardly accurate
                    to speak of the basin which forms the harbour as a crater, for most geologists,
                    including Lyell, support the view that the whole of this space was once covered
                    by a single volcanic cone, the incline of which is represented by the outward
                    slope of Santorin and Therasia, while the position of the crater was that now
                    occupied by the Kaumene Islands; and that, at some remote period, owing to the
                    sinking of the strata beneath, the central portion of this, extending oyer an
                    area which a French writer compares with that included within the fortifications
                    of Paris at the time of the siege, fell in, by which convulsion the basin was
                    formed. The principal eruptions that have taken place within historic times are
                    that of 196 B.C., when, as we learn from Strabo (i. 3, § 16, p. 57), flames rose
                    from the water halfway between Thera and Therasia for four days, and the island
                    of Palaea Kaumene was ejected; that of 726 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi>
                    during the reign of the emperor Leo the Isaurian, when an addition was made to
                    that island, and the pumice-stone that was cast forth was carried by the waves
                    to the shores of Asia Minor and Macedonia; that of 1573, when Mikra Kaumene
                    appeared; that of 1650, a fearful eruption, which destroyed many lives by its
                    noxious exhalations, and ended in the upheaval of an island in the sea to the
                    north-east of Santorin, which afterwards subsided and became a permanent reef
                    below the sea-level; that of 1707, when Nea Kaumene arose; and, within the
                    recollection of the present generation, that of 1866.</p>
                <p>Santorin and Therasia have been recently the scene of a remarkable archaeological
                    discovery. In the southern parts of both those islands prehistoric dwellings
                    have been found at some height above the sea, and there is no reasonable cause
                    to doubt that these date from a period antecedent to the falling in of the
                    crater and the formation of the bay. This is proved by their position underneath
                    the layer of tufa which covers the islands, and, moreover, by these layers of
                    tufa being broken off precipitously, in the same way as the lava-rocks, a fact
                    which can only be explained by the supposition that they all fell in together.
                    The foundations of the dwellings rested, not on the tufa, but on the lava below
                    it; and here and there between the stones branches of wild olive were found,
                    according to a mode of building that still prevails in the island, in order to
                    resist the shocks of earthquakes. Part of the skeleton of a man was discovered,
                    and large vases, some containing grain, others stone instruments very carefully
                    worked. Some of these vases were of fine yellowish earth, ornamented with brown
                    bands; some, of smaller size, were more elaborately; decorated, sometimes with
                    lines representing foliage, and in a few instances with figures of animals; some
                    were of red earth, without ornament; while others, of pale red earth, were of
                    very large dimensions. No implements of metal were found. Naturally it has been
                    the subject of much discussion what was the origin of this very primitive art.
                    The late Μ. Dumont, who was the leading authority on the subject <hi
                    rend="italic">(Les</hi><hi rend="italic">Céramiques</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">Grèce</hi><hi rend="italic">Propre,</hi> pp. 74, 75,
                    209), though speaking with great caution on account of the insufficiency of the
                    evidence, inclined to the belief that it was partly derived from Phoenician
                    influence, but at the same time that there were evident traces of native
                    originality. Comparing it in respect of date with the other prehistoric
                    developments of art in the neighbourhood of the Aegean, he would place it later
                    than that of Hissarlik, but earlier than those of Ialysus in Rhodes, and of
                    Mycenae.</p>
                <p>In Greek legend the island of Thera was connected with the story of the
                    Argonauts, for it was represented as sprung from a clod of earth which was
                    presented to those heroes by Triton (Apollon., <hi rend="italic">Argonaut.,</hi>
                    iv. 1551 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> 1731 <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> According
                    to Herodotus (iv. 147), a Phoenician colony was established there by Cadmus—a
                    story which proves at least the belief that there was an early settlement of
                    that race in the island. It has even been conjectured (see vol. xviii. p. 806)
                    that the alphabet was introduced into Greece, not, as was commonly believed,
                    through Thebes, but by way of Thera. Subsequently, we are told, a colony from
                    Sparta, including some of the Minyae, was led thither by Theras, who gave the
                    island his own name, in place of that of Calliste which it had borne before. But
                    the one event which gave importance to Thera in ancient history was the planting
                    of its famous colony of Cyrene on the north coast of Africa by Battus in 631 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> in accordance with a command of the Delphic oracle.
                    The ancient capital, which bore the same name as the island, has been identified
                    by an inscription as occupying a site on the eastern coast called Mesa-Vouno,
                    between Mount Elias and the sea. The other remains of the classical period
                    consist of walls and tombs, together with several <hi rend="italic">heroa</hi>
                    or small shrines, one of which, now dedicated to St Nicholas Marmorites, who is
                    so called in honour of his marble structure, is an almost unique specimen of a
                    perfect Greek temple, for even the roof remains intact. After the fourth
                    crusade, when the Byzantine empire was partitioned among the Latins, this island
                    formed a portion of the duchy of the Archipelago; and it was at this period that
                    it received the name of Santorin, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> St Irene, after
                    the patron saint of the place, to whom Tournefort mentions that in his time nine
                    or ten chapels were dedicated. At the present day Santorin is in a prosperous
                    condition, for, in addition to the wine trade, which is highly remunerative,
                    there is a large export of <hi rend="italic">pozzolana,</hi> which has been much
                    used for the works at Port Said in connexion with the Suez Canal, since, when
                    mixed with lime, it forms a very hard cement which resists the action of the
                    sea.</p>
