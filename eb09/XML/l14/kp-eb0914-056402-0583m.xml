                    birth a German, by adoption a citizen of the United States. He was the son of
                    Frederick William Lieber, and was born at Berlin, March 18, 1800. Upon the
                    return of Napoleon Bonaparte from Elba, young Lieber, then only fifteen years of
                    age, volunteered as a soldier, and served with his two brothers under Marshal
                    Blücher in the campaign of 1815. He fought at Ligny, Waterloo, and Namur. In the
                    last-named battle he was twice severely and dangerously wounded. At the close of
                    the war he returned to his studies, and joined the Berlin gymnasium under Dr
                    Jahn. Shortly afterwards he was arrested and thrown into prison for his
                    political sentiments, the chief evidence against him being several songs of
                    liberty which he had written. After several months’ confinement he was
                    discharged without a trial, but informed that he would not be permitted to
                    pursue his studies at the Prussian universities. He accordingly went to Jena,
                    where he took his degrees in 1820, subsequently continuing his studies at Halle
                    and Dresden. When the Greek revolution broke out, young Lieber instantly
                    resolved to take part in the struggle for Grecian independence. He made his way
                    with great difficulty to Marseilles, travelling much of the way on foot, and
                    thence embarked for Greece. His experiences there are recorded in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal in Greece,</hi> published at Leipsic in 1823, and at
                    Amsterdam in the same year under the title of <hi rend="italic">The German
                    Anacharsis.</hi> Returning from Greece after the failure of the struggle, he
                    landed at Ancona, and proceeded to Rome. There he made the acquaintance of
                    Niebuhr, then Prussian ambassador to Rome, who took great interest in him and
                    employed him as tutor to his son. He lived a year in the family of the
                    historian, a period of his history which he afterwards embalmed in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Reminiscences of Niebuhr,</hi> first published in America, and
                    afterwards in England. Returning from Rome to Berlin in 1823, he was soon again
                    arrested by the Prussian authorities on the old charges of enmity to the
                    Government and advocating republican opinions, and was imprisoned in the bastile
                    of Koepnik, but was released after some months’ confinement through the
                    influence of Niebuhr. In 1825 he abandoned his country, and after spending a
                    year in London went to the United States (1827), and as soon as possible was
                    naturalized as a citizen of that country. Lieber took up his residence at
                    Boston, and was occupied for five years in his laborious work <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Encyclopaedia Americana (13</hi> vols.). In 1832 he removed to New York,
                    where he published a translation of De Beaumont and De Tocqueville’s work on the
                    penitentiary system, with many notes. In 1833 he went to Philadelphia to prepare
                    a plan of education for Girard College, then newly founded. While there he
                    published <hi rend="italic">Letters to a Gentleman in Germany</hi> and a
                    supplement to his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia.</hi> In 1835 he was appointed
                    professor of history and political economy in South Carolina College at
                    Columbia, S.C., where he remained more than twenty years, and during this period
                    wrote and published the three great works upon which his fame as a writer
                    chiefly rests—the <hi rend="italic">Manual of Political Ethics</hi> (1838), <hi
                    rend="italic">Legal and Political Hermeneutics</hi> (1839), and <hi
                    rend="italic">Civil Liberty and Self Government</hi> (1853).<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>New editions of these works
                    and of his miscellaneous writings have been published recently at
                    Philadelphia.</p></note></p>
                <p>In 1856 Lieber resigned the professorship in South Carolina College, and was
                    immediately elected to a similar professorship in Columbia College, New York,
                    and to the chair of political science in the law school of the same institution.
                    He continued in the discharge of the duties of these positions until his death,
                    which occurred October 2, 1872. During the great war for the preservation of the
                    Union from 1861 to 1865, Lieber rendered services of great value to the
                    Government of his adopted country, and was frequently consulted by the secretary
                    of war. He was one of the first to point out by his pen the madness of
                    secession, and was ever active in supporting the Government and upholding the
                    Union. He prepared, upon the requisition of the president, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Code of War for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the
                    Field,</hi> which was adopted and promulgated by the Government in General
                    Orders No. 100 of the war department. This code has been characterized by many
                    European publicists as a masterpiece, and it suggested to Bluntschli his
                    codification of the law of nations, as may be seen in the preface to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Droit International</hi><hi rend="italic">Codifié.</hi> During
                    this period also Lieber wrote his <hi rend="italic">Guerilla Parties with
                    Reference to the Laws and Usages of War,</hi> a valuable contribution to the law
                    of war. At the time of his death he was by appointment of the Government of the
                    United States the umpire of the commission for the adjudication of Mexican
                    claims. The political writings of Francis Lieber are held in great estimation by
                    all publicists. Sir Edward S.</p>

                    alluding to his death, has justly said of him, “America and the civilized world
                    in general have lately had to deplore in his death the loss of one whom the
                    French jurist M. Laboulayehas truly styled ‘une des figures les plus originales
                    parmi les jurisconsultes de notre temps.’”</p>
                <p>Besides the works already mentioned, Lieber published at various times many
                    smaller works and pamphlets on different subjects, all of which attracted public
                    attention, such as <hi rend="italic">The Origin and De-velopme '</hi><hi

                    Nationalism, Rise of the Constitution</hi> (an unfinished work), and many minor
                    tracts and publications. These works are all written with as much ease and
                    purity of idiom as if English had been his native tongue, a fact not more
                    remarkable than that he, a German, should have become the great American teacher
                    of the philosophy of Anglican political science. (Μ. R. T. )</p>
