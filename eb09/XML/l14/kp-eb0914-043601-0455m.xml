                    measured 112J Roman miles, and the area has been estimated at 150 square miles.
                    Great part of it is mountainous, but some very fertile valleys exist, to
                    cultivate which two thousand yoke of oxen are employed. The hill-sides afford
                    pasture for 20,000 sheep. No forests exist on the island; all the wood which is
                    used is brought from the coast of Roumelia or from Thasos. A few mulberry and
                    fruit trees grow, but no olives. The inhabitants number about 22,000, of whom
                    2000 are Turks and the rest Greeks. The chief towns are Kastro on the western
                    coast, with a population of 4000 Greeks and 800 Turks, and Mudros on the
                    southern coast. Kastro possesses an excellent harbour, and is the seat of all
                    the trade carried on with the island. Greek, English, and Dutch consuls or
                    consular agents were formerly stationed there; but the whole trade is now in
                    Greek hands. The archbishop of Lemnos and Ai Strati, a small neighbouring island
                    with 2000 inhabitants, resides in Kastro. In ancient times the island was sacred
                    to Hephaestus, who as the legend tells fell on Lemnos when his father Zeus
                    hurled him headlong out of Olympus. This tale, as well as the name Aethaleia,
                    sometimes applied to it, points to its volcanic character. It is said that fire
                    occasionally blazed forth from Mosychlos, one of its mountains; and Pausanias
                    (viii. 33) relates that a small island called Chryse off the Lemnian coast was
                    swallowed up by the sea. All volcanic action is now extinct,</p>
                <p>The most famous product of Lemnos is the medicinal earth, which is still used by
                    the natives. At one time it was popular over western Europe under the name <hi
                    rend="italic">terra</hi><hi rend="italic">sigillata.</hi> This name, like the
                    Greek <hi rend="italic">Λ,ημνία</hi><hi rend="italic">σφρaγls,</hi> is derived
                    from the stamp impressed on each piece of the earth; in ancient times the stamp
                    was the head of Artemis. The Turks now believe that a vase of this earth
                    destroys the effect of any poison drunk from it,—a belief which the ancients
                    attached rather to the earth from Cape Kolias in Attica. Galen went to see the
                    digging up of this earth (see Kuhn, <hi rend="italic">Medic. Gr. Opera,</hi>
                    xii. 172 <hi rend="italic">sq.);</hi> on one day in each year a priestess
                    performed the due ceremonies, and a waggon-load of earth was dug out. At the
                    present time the day selected is the 6th of August, the feast of Christ the
                    Saviour. Both the Turkish hodja and the Greek priest are present to perform the
                    necessary ceremonies; the whole process takes place before daybreak. The earth
                    is sold by apothecaries in stamped cubical blocks. The hill from which the earth
                    is dug is a dry mound, void of vegetation, beside the village of Kotschinos, and
                    about two hours from the site of Hephaestia. The earth was considered in ancient
                    times a cure for old festering wounds, and for the bite of poisonous snakes.</p>
                <p>The name Lemnos is said by Hecataeus <hi rend="italic">{ap.</hi> Steph. Byz.) to
                    have been a title of Cybele among the Thracians, and the earliest inhabitants
                    are said to have been a Thracian tribe, called by the Greeks Sinties, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, “the robbers.” According to a famous legend the women
                    were all deserted by their husbands, and in revenge murdered every man on the
                    island. From this barbarous act, the expression Lemnian deeds, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hhμvia</hi> ∈pγα, became proverbial. The Argonauts <pb break="no"

                    island, ruled over by Hypsipyle, daughter of the old king Thoas. From the
                    Argonauts and the Lemnian women were descended the race called Minyae, whose
                    king Euneus, son of Jason and Hypsipyle, sent wine and provisions to the Greeks
                    at Troy. The Minyae were expelled by a Pelasgian tribe who came from Attica. The
                    historical element underlying these traditions is probably that the original
                    Thracian people were gradually brought into communication with the Greeks as
                    navigation began to unite the scattered islands of the Aegean (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jason)</hi>; the Thracian inhabitants were barbarians in
                    comparison with the Greek mariners. The worship of Cybele was characteristic of
                    Thrace, whither it spread from Asia Minor at a very early period, and it
                    deserves notice that Hypsipyle and Myrina (the name of one of the chief towns)
                    are Amazon names, which are always connected with Asiatic Cybele-worship. Coming
                    down to a better authenticated period, we find that Lemnos was conquered by
                    Otanes, one of the generals of Darius Hystaspes; but was soon reconquered by
                    Miltiades, the tyrant of the Thracian Chersonese. Miltiades afterwards returned
                    to Athens, and Lemnos continued an Athenian possession till the Macedonian
                    empire absorbed it. On the vicissitudes of its history in the 3d century <hi

                    rend="italic">Inst.</hi><hi rend="italic">Athen.,</hi> i. p. 261. The Romans
                    declared it free in 197 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but gave it over in 166
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to Athens, which retained nominal possession of
                    it till the whole of Greece was made a Roman province. A colony of Attic
                    κληρούχο« was established by Pericles, and many inscriptions on the island
                    relate to Athenians. After the division of the empire, Lemnos of course passed
                    under the Byzantine emperors; it shared in the vicissitudes of the eastern
                    provinces, being alternately in the power of Greeks, Italians, and Turks, till
                    finally the Turkish sultans became supreme in the Aegean. In 1476 the Venetians
                    successfully defended Kokkinos or Kotchinos against a Turkish siege; but in 1657
                    Kastro was captured by the Turks from the Venetians after a siege of sixty-three
                    days. Kastro was again besieged by the Russians in 1770.</p>
                <p>Homer speaks as if there were one town in the island called Lemnos, but in
                    historical times there was no such place. There were two towns, Myrina, now
                    Kastro, and Hephaestia. The latter was the chief town; its coins are found in
                    considerable number, the types being sometimes the Athenian goddess and her owl,
                    sometimes native religious symbols, the caps of the Dioscuri, Apollo, &amp;c.
                    Few coins of Myrina are known. They belong to the period of Attic occupation,
                    and bear Athenian types. A few coins are also known which bear the name, not of
                    either city, but of the whole island. Conze was the first to discover the site
                    of Hephaestia, at a deserted place named Palaeokastro on the east coast. It had
                    once a splendid harbour, which is now filled up. Its situation on the east
                    explains why Miltiades attacked it first when he came from the Chersonese. It
                    surrendered at once, whereas Myrina, with its very strong citadel built on a
                    perpendicular rock, sustained a siege. It is said that the shadow of Mount Athos
                    fell at sunset on a bronze cow in the agora of Myrina. Pliny says that Athos was
                    87 miles to the north-west; but the real distance is about 40 English miles. One
                    legend localized in Lemnos still requires notice. Philoctetes was left there by
                    the Greeks on their way to Troy; and there he suffered ten years’ agony from his
                    wounded foot, until Ulysses and Neoptolemus induced him to accompany them to
                    Troy. He is said by Sophocles to have lived beside Mount Hermaeus, which
                    Aeschylus <hi rend="italic">(Agam.,</hi> 262) makes one of the beacon points to
                    flash the news of Troy’s downfall home to Argos.</p>
