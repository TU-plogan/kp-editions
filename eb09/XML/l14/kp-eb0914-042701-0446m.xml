                    (1611-1684), bishop of Duublane, and afterwards archbishop of Glasgow, was the
                    eldest son of Dr Alexander Leighton, the author of <hi rend="italic">Zion’s Plea
                    against the Prelacie,</hi> whose terrible sufferings for having dared to
                    question the divine right of Episcopacy, under the persecution of Laud, form one
                    of the most disgraceful incidents of the reign of Charles I. Dr Leighton is said
                    to have been of the old family of Ulishaven in Forfarshire, and his illustrious
                    son was born in the year 1611. From his earliest childhood, according to Burnet,
                    he was distinguished for his saintly temper and disposition, and in his
                    sixteenth year (1627) he was sent to complete his education at the university of
                    Edinburgh, where, after studying with distinguished success for four years, he
                    took his degree of M.A. in 1631.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>One has difficulty in thinking of even the youthful Leighton
                    as capable of humour or sarcasm. But it so happens that the only anecdote of his
                    college career which has been preserved to us indicates the presence of some
                    trace of these in his character. The provost of Edinburgh at the time was a
                    certain David Aikenhead, who had probably made himself offensive in some way to
                    the young collegians, and Leighton, it appears, was tempted to perpetrate the
                    following little epigram upon him: —</p><p>“That qnhilk his name pretends is
                    falsely said, To wit that of ane aike his head is made, For if that it had been
                    composed soe, His fyrie nose had flaimed it long agoe."</p><p>To “blaspheme the
                    bailies” (much more the provost) was at that time a somewhat serious offence,
                    and we are told that he was “extruded” from the college for his attack upon the
                    provost’s nose. It would seem, however, that the offence was speedily condoned,
                    as he is found soon afterwards to have been restored to his
                    position.</p></note></p>
                <p>After leaving college his father sent him to travel abroad, and he is understood
                    to have spent several years in France, where he acquired a complete mastery of
                    the French language. While there he passed a good deal of time with some
                    relations at Douay who had become Roman Catholics, and with whom he would seem
                    to have formed a strict friendship, as he kept up a correspondence with them for
                    many years afterwards. Either at this time or on some subsequent visit to the
                    Continent he had also a good deal of intercourse with some members of the
                    Jansenist party. And no doubt what he then saw among these excellent persons of
                    the piety which was possible even in a communion which he believed to be corrupt
                    contributed not a little to the charity towards those who differed from him in
                    religious opinions, which ever afterwards formed so remarkable a feature in his
                    character. The exact period of his return to Scotland has not been ascertained;
                    but in 1641 he was ordained Presbyterian minister of Newbattle in Midlothian,
                    where he continued for about ten years. At the end of that period he resigned
                    his charge, and went to reside in Edinburgh (1652). What the precise
                    circumstances were which led him to take this step does not distinctly appear.
                    But the account given is that the fiery zeal of his brother clergymen on certain
                    political questions found little sympathy with him, and that this led to severe
                    censures on their part, which were too much for his gentle nature to bear.</p>
                <p>Early in the following year (1653) he was appointed principal of the university
                    of Edinburgh, and primarius professor of divinity. In this post he continued for
                    seven or eight years, and, according to Burnet, “he was a great blessing in it;
                    for he talked so to all the youth of any capacity or distinction that it had a
                    great effect on many of them.” A considerable number of his Latin prelections
                    and other addresses to the students were published after his death, and are
                    singularly remarkable for the purity and elegance of their Latinity, and their
                    subdued and meditative eloquence. The reader will be disappointed if he expects
                    to find in them any subtle exposition of a metaphysical system of theology. In
                    this respect they present a curious contrast to any thing that is known of the
                    theology taught at that time in the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. They are
                    rather to be regarded as valuable instructions in the art of living a holy life
                    than as a body of scientific divinity. Throughout, however, they bear the marks
                    of a deeply learned and accomplished mind, fully saturated with both classical
                    and patristic reading, and like all his works they breathe the spirit of one who
                    lived very much above the world. It would be interesting to ascertain how far he
                    succeeded in instilling something of his own spirit into the minds of those who
                    listened to his teaching. We certainly meet with very little indication of its
                    having taken any deep root in the hearts of either the Presbyterian or the
                    Episcopalian clergy of the twenty or thirty years which succeeded the period of
                    his principalship. The only writer of the time who has spoken with true
                    appreciation of his character is Bishop Burnet; both in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of his 0ιvn Times</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Care</hi>
                    he has referred to Leighton in language of unbounded affection and admiration.
                    This, however, was founded upon knowledge of him obtained in the course of a
                    friendship formed after he had demitted his office of principal, and not upon
                    his university teaching.</p>
                <p>In 1661, when Charles II. had resolved to force Episcopacy once more upon
                    Scotland, he fixed upon Leighton for one of his bishops. Looking at the matter,
                    as we are apt to do, in the light of what followed in the history of Scotland
                    during the next twenty-seven years, it seems almost unaccountable how such a man
                    as Leighton could have submitted as he did to the degradation of being
                    associated with coadjutors like Sharp and some of his companion bishops. The
                    only explanations which can be given perhaps are that Leighton, living very much
                    out of the world, and being somewhat deficient in what may be called the
                    political sense, had no idea of the deadly hatred entertained toward Episcopacy
                    by the great mass of the religious people of Scotland, and so of its utter
                    unfitness to become the established church polity of the country, and that his
                    soft and gentle nature rendered him too open to the persuasions which were used
                    to induce him to enter a sphere for which he instinctively felt he was ill
                    qualified. Every one will give him credit too for having no conception that the
                    only object of the Government in establishing Episcopacy in Scotland was to make
                    it subservient to despotism and persecution. The Episcopacy which he
                    contemplated was that modified form which had been suggested by Archbishop
                    Ussher, and to which Baxter and many of the best of the English Nonconformists
                    would have readily given their adherence. It is significant on this head that he
                    always refused to be addressed as “my lord,” and it is stated that when dining
                    with his clergymen on one occasion he was so far from arrogating any right of
                    superiority or precedence that he wished to seat himself at the foot of the
                    table.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For an
                    interesting and characteristic indication of the purity of his motives in
                    accepting a bishopric, reference may be made to his letter to the earl of
                    Lothian, dated December 23, 1661, which is still preserved among the Lothian
                    papers.</p></note></p>
                <p>If Leighton did not know before, he soon began to discover the sort of men with
                    whom he was to be associated in the episcopate. He travelled with them in the
                    same coach from London towards Scotland, but having become, as he told Burnet,
                    very weary of their company (as he doubted not they were of his), and having
                    found that they intended to make a kind of triumphal entrance into Edinburgh, he
                    left them at Morpeth and retired to the earl of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0447-0428"/> Lothian’s at Newbattle. He very soon, we are
                    told, lost all hope of being able to build up the church by the means which the
                    Government had set on foot, and his work, as he confessed to Burnet, “seemed to
                    him a fighting against God.” He did, however, what he could, governing his
                    diocese (that of Dunblane) with the utmost mildness, as far ns he could
                    preventing the persecuting measures which were in active operation elsewhere,
                    and endeavouring to persuade the Presbyterian clergy to sink their differences
                    and come to an accommodation with their Episcopal brethren. In this last matter
                    he seems to have succeeded no better with the Presbyterians than Baxter in
                    England did in a similar attempt with the Episcopalian party; and, after a
                    hopeless struggle of three or four years to induce the Government to put a stop
                    to their fierce persecution of the Covenanters, he at length determined to
                    resign his bishopric, and went up to London in 1665 for this purpose. He told
                    the king that “he could not concur in the planting the Christian religion itself
                    in such a manner, much less a form of government,” and so far worked upon the
                    mind of Charles that he promised to enforce the adoption of milder measures. In
                    the hope that this would be carried into effect, he returned to his diocese, but
                    it does not appear that any material improvement took place. In 1669 Leighton
                    again went to London and made fresh representations on the subject, which were
                    so far attended to, but, partly perhaps from faults on the Presbyterian as well
                    as the Episcopalian side, little result followed. The slight disposition,
                    however, shown by the Government to accommodate matters appears to have inspired
                    so much hope into Leighton’s mind that in the following year he agreed, though
                    with a good deal of hesitation, to accept the archbishopric of Glasgow. In this
                    new and higher sphere he redoubled his efforts with the Presbyterians to bring
                    about some degree of conciliation with Episcopacy, but all was of no avail, and
                    the only result of his attempts was to embroil himself with the hot-headed
                    Episcopal party as well as with the Presbyterians. In utter despair, therefore,
                    of being able to be of any further service to the cause of religion, he at
                    length in 1674 threw up the archbishopric and retired, after a short stay,
                    probably with his successor in the divinity chair, William Colville, within the
                    precincts of Edinburgh university, to the house of his widowed sister, Mrs
                    Lightmaker, at Broadhurst in Sussex. Here he spent the remaining ten years, in
                    all likelihood the happiest, of his life, and died somewhat suddenly on a visit
                    to London in 1684, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to form a just or at least a full estimate of Leighton’s
                    character. He stands almost alone in his age. In some respects he was
                    immeasurably superior both in intellect and in piety to most of the Scottish
                    ecclesiastics of his time; and yet he seems to have had almost no influence in
                    moulding the characters or conduct of his contemporaries. One is half inclined
                    to think that he would have shown himself a greater or at least a more complete
                    man jf a few natural weaknesses and imperfections had intermingled with his
                    nobler qualities. So intense was his absorption in the love of God that little
                    room seems to have been left in his heart for human sympathy or affection. Can
                    it be that there was after all something to repel in his outward manner? Burnet
                    tells us that he had never seen him to laugh, and very seldom even to smile. One
                    can hardly forgive him for regarding Episcopacy so purely under the dry light of
                    human reason after the horrible treatment which his excellent father had
                    suffered from it. In other respects, too, he gives the impression of standing
                    aloof from human interests and ties. It may go for little that he never married,
                    but it was surely a curious idiosyncrasy in the man that he habitually cherished
                    the wish (which was granted him) that he might die in an inn, where there could
                    be no loving hand to support, no loving heart to cheer him. In fact, holy
                    meditation seems to have been the one absorbing interest of his life. At
                    Dunblane tradition still preserves the memory of “the good bishop,” silent and
                    companionless, pacing up and down the sloping walk by the river’s bank under the
                    beautiful west window of his cathedral. And from a letter of the earl of Lothian
                    to his countess it appears that, whatever other reasons Leighton might have had
                    for resigning his charge at Newbattle, the main object which he had in view was
                    to be left to his own thoughts. It is therefore on the whole not very wonderful
                    that he was completely misjudged and even disliked both by the Presbyterian and
                    the Episcopal party. Some of the bitter expressions of hatred towards him,
                    however, on the part of the former, sound very strange to us who now know how
                    holy, humble, and blameless the man really was. Thus in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Naphtali</hi> it is said, “Mr Leighton, prelate of Durnblain, under a
                    Jesuitical-like vizard of pretended holiness, humility, and crucifixion to the
                    world, hath studied to seem to creep upon the ground, but always up the hill,
                    toward promotion and places of more ease and honour, and as there is none of
                    them all hath with a kiss so betrayed the cause and smitten religion under the
                    fifth rib, and hath been such an offence to the godly, so there is none who by
                    his way, practice, and expressions giveth greater suspicion of a popish
                    affection, inclination, and design.” So also in the continuation of Robert
                    Blair’s life by his son-in-law, William Ross, the most innocent of Leighton’s
                    acts have a malicious interpretation put upon them. When he resigned Newbattle,
                    he “pretended insufficiency for the ministry”; when he returned to Edinburgh as
                    bishop and expressed an opinion in favour of the English liturgy and ceremonies,
                    “it was suspected that he was popish and Jesuited”; when he refused the title of
                    lord, and in other respects carried himself modestly and humbly, he was simply
                    “a pawky prelate.” When he spoke in parliament in favour of the outed ministers,
                    and thought that they ought to be “cherished and embraced” instead of
                    persecuted, offending all the other prelates by the course he took, “it was
                    difficult what to judge of his actings or sayings, he carried so smoothly among
                    the ministers of his diocese.” Some, indeed, we are told, thought well of him,
                    but others thought “that he spoke from a popish principle.” When he behaved
                    sweetly and gently to the clergy of his diocese, telling them to hold their
                    presbyteries and sessions as before, and suggesting without commanding any
                    thing, it was “thought that he was but stroking cream in their mouths at first.”
                    When disgusted with the proceedings of the other bishops in “outing so many
                    honest ministers and filling their places with insufficient and for the most
                    part scandalous men,” and intimating his wish to demit his office in
                    consequence, he was only <hi rend="italic">“pretending</hi> to be displeased.”
                    When the king wrote to the council that some of the most peaceable and moderate
                    outed ministers might have liberty to preach, and Leighton pleaded that <hi
                    rend="italic">all</hi> might have the like liberty, it was “thought that he did
                    this of purpose to oppose and crush it.” Nothing that the good man could say or
                    do brought upon him anything but suspicion and calumny. Even Wodrow, who
                    generally gets credit for fairness and candour, tells us that ‘ ‘ he was judged
                    void of any doctrinal principles,” and that he was regarded “as very much
                    indifferent to all professions which bore the name of Christian.”</p>
                <p>It is worth while to set over against these uncharitable and malignant
                    insinuations the estimate which his intimate friend Bishop Burnet formed of him.
                    At the conclusion of his <hi rend="italic">Pastoral Care,</hi> he says, “I have
                    now laid together· with great simplicity what has been the chief subject of my
                    thoughts for above thirty years. I was formed to them by a bishop that had the
                    greatest elevation of soul, the largest compass of knowledge, the most mortified
                    and heavenly disposition, that I ever yet saw in mortal; that had the greatest
                    parts as well as virtue, with the perfectest humility that I ever saw in man,
                    and had a sublime strain in preaching, with so grave a gesture, and such a
                    majesty of thought, of language, and of pronunciation, that I never once saw a
                    wandering eye where he preached, and have seen whole assemblies often melt in
                    tears before him; and of whom I can say with great truth that, in a free and
                    frequent conversation with him for above two and twenty years, I never knew him
                    say an idle word, or one that had not a direct tendency to edification; and I
                    never once saw him in any other temper but that which I wished to be in, in the
                    last minutes of my life.”</p>
                <p>No one can study Leighton’s works without feeling that Burnet’s judgment of the
                    man must have been the true one. We know not if anywhere, except in Holy
                    Scripture, there is to be found so much of what seems to breathe the very breath
                    of heaven, or to be the expression of a life quite apart from the life of this
                    world. It was characteristic of him that he could never be made to understand
                    that anything which he wrote possessed the smallest value. None of his works
                    were published by himself, and it is stated that he actually left orders that
                    all his MSS. should be destroyed after his death. But fortunately for the world
                    this charge was disregarded. Like all the best writing, it seems to flow from
                    his pen without effort. It is simply the easy unaffected outcome of his saintly
                    nature, and hence it always carries the reader along with it without arresting
                    the current of his thoughts or diverting his attention by brilliant flashes of
                    imagination or curious turns of expression like what we find in Jeremy Taylor,
                    Dr Donne, and others of that time. Throughout, however, it is the language of a
                    scholar and a man of perfect literary taste; and with all its spirituality of
                    thought there are no mystical raptures, and none of that luscious sensuousness
                    which sometimes intermingles itself in the Scottish practical theology of the
                    17th century. No writer conveys a clearer or more elevated idea both of what
                    Christian religion is and what <pb break="no"

                    common reproach against Leighton, as we have seen, that he had leanings towards
                    Roman Catholicism, and perhaps this is so far trne that he had formed himself in
                    some degree upon the model of some of those saintly persons of that faith, such
                    as Pascal and Thomas a Kempis, who had carried the spiritual life to more
                    ethereal heights than appear to be as yet attained within the lines of
                    Protestantism.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Editions.—</hi> It is matter of regret that no perfectly
                    satisfactory edition of Leighton’s works has as yet appeared. After his death
                    his <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Peter</hi> and several of his other works
                    were published under the editorship of his friend Dr Fall, and on the whole
                    those early editions may be said to be, with some drawbacks, by far the best.
                    All his later editors have unfortunately been possessed by the tasteless mania
                    of reducing his good archaic and nervous language to the bald feebleness of
                    modern phraseology, dealing with him like literary martinets correcting a
                    schoolboy’s themes. It is unfortunately impossible to exempt from this criticism
                    even the edition, in other respects very valuable and meritorious, lately
                    published under the superintendence of the Rev. W. West (London, 1875). (J. T.
