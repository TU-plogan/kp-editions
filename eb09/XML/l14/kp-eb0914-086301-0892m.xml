                <p><label type="entry">LONGFORD</label>, an inland county of Leinster, Ireland, is
                    bounded on the N.W. by Leitrim, N.E. by Cavan, E. by Westmeath, S. by Westmeath
                    and Meath, and W. by Lough Ree aud Roscommon. With the exception of Carlow,
                    Louth, and Dublin, it is the smallest county in Ireland, its greatest length
                    being about 28 miles, its greatest breadth about 20, and the total area
                    comprising 269,409 acres, or about 421 square miles.</p>
                <p>The general level surface of the country is broken occasionally by low hills,
                    which cover a considerable area at its northern angle. The principal rivers are
                    the Camlin, which rises near Granard, and flows past Longford to the Shannon,
                    and the Inny, which, entering the county from Westmeath, crosses its southern
                    corner, and falls into Lough Ree. Lough Ree is partly included in Longford, and
                    the other principal lakes are Lough Gownagh, Derry-lough, Lough Drum, and Lough
                    Bannow. The Royal canal intersects the county. The southern division of the
                    county, bounded partly by the Camlin, belongs to the great limestone plain of
                    Ireland, and the northern division is occupied chiefly by clay-slate and
                    greywacke. In the west of the county there is an interpolation, between the two
                    divisions, of yellow sandstone and conglomerate. Isolated hills of sandstone
                    occur at Slievegauldry and at Ballymahon, on both sides of the Inny. Marble of
                    fine quality has been raised near Ledwithstown. In the north indications of iron
                    are abundant, and there are also some traces of lead.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is somewhat moist and cold,
                    partly owing to the large extent of marsh and bog. The soil in the southern
                    districts resting on the limestone is a deep loam well adapted for pasture, but
                    in the north it is often so thin and poor as to be incapable of reclamation.</p>
                <p>In 1881 there were 74,876 acres under tillage, 125,838 pasture, 3697 plantation,
                    and 51,333 waste. The total number of holdings in 1880 was 8682, of which 685
                    were less than 1 acre. More than one-half of the total number were included in
                    those between 5 and 15, and 15 and 30 acres in extent, which numbered
                    respectively 2482 aud 2658. The following table shows the areas under the
                    principal crops in 1855 and in 1881 :—</p>

                    agricultural purposes; of cattle 51,547, of which 16,212 were milch cows; of
                    sheep, 24,140; of pigs, 17,900; and of poultry, 232,324. There were 3066 asses

                    was 588 acres, and 14 per cent, possessed less than 1 acre. The largest owners
                    were Colonel King Harman, 28,779 acres; earl of Granard, 14,978; LordAnnaly,
                    12,160; George Maconchy, 10,319.</p>

                    coarse woollen and linen cloth.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> One branch of the Midland Great Western Railway
                    skirts the eastern boundary of the county, and another passes through its centre
                    to Longford.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county includes 6
                    baronies, with 26 parishes and 891 townlands. It is in the northwest circuit.
                    Assizes are held at Longford, and quarter sessions at Ballymahon, Granard, and
                    Longford. There is one poor-law union wholly within the county, with portions of
                    other two. It is in the Dublin military district and Birr subdistrict. There are
                    barracks for infantry and cavalry at Longford. The county returns two members to
                    parliament.</p>
                <p>The only town of any importance is the county town, Longford. From 25,142 in 1760
                    the population of the county gradually increased till in 1841 it was 115,491,
                    but since then it has diminished to 82,348 in 1851, 64,501 in 1871, and 61,009
                    in 1881, of whom 30,770 were males and 30,239 females. From 1st May 1851 to 31st
                    December 1881 the number of emigrants was 40,726. For the ten years 1871-81 the
                    marriage-rate per 100 of the population was 4, the birth-rate 24 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3, and the death-rate 16. In 1881 23 <hi

                    were illiterate, the percentage in 1871 being 32. The Roman Catholics formed 91
                    per cent, of the population in 1881, and the Episcopalians 8.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> The early name of Longford was
                    Anale or Annaly, and it was a principality of the O’Farrels. Along with the
                    province of Meath, in which it was then included, it was granted by Henry II. to
                    Hugh de Lacy, who planted in it an English colony. On the division of Meath into
                    two counties in 1543, Annaly was included in West Meath, but in the 11th of
                    Elizabeth it tfas made shire ground under the name of Longford, and included in
                    the province of Connaught, from which it was transferred to Leinster in the 27th
                    of the same reign.</p>
                <p>The principal antiquarian rain is the Danish rath called the Moat of Granard, at
                    the end of the main street of the town, and occupying a position 593 feet above
                    sea-level. There are monastic remains atArdagh, Longford, Moydow, Clone, Derg,
                    Druimchei, and Killinmore, as well as on several of the islands of Lough Ree.
                    The principal old castles are those of Rathcline near Lanesborough, and
                    Ballymahon, Burnacor, and Castlecor on the Inny. The principal modern seats are
                    those of Carrickglass on the Camlin, and Castle Forbes, the seat of the earl of
                    Granard. Oliver Goldsmith was born at Pallas, à village near Ballymahon, in this
                    county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Longford,</hi> the chief town of the above county, is
                    situated on the river Carnlin, and on a branch of the Midland Great Western
                    Railway, 75 miles west-north-west of Dublin. The principal buildings are the
                    parish church in the Grecian style, St Mell’s Roman Catholic cathedral (one of
                    the finest Roman Catholic churches in Ireland), the courthouse, the
                    market-house, and the county jail. Of the old castle and of the Dominican abbey
                    there are slight remains. The town has a considerable trade in grain, butter,
                    and bacon. There are corn-mills, a spool factory, and tanneries. The population
                    in 1871 was 4375, and in 1881 it was 4380.</p>
                <p>The ancient name of the town was Athfada, and it is said to occupy the site of a
                    monastery founded by St Idus, a disciple of St Patrick. The town obtained a fair
                    and market from James I., and a charter of incorporation from Charles II., as
                    well as the right to return two members to parliament. It was disfranchised at
                    the Union.</p>
