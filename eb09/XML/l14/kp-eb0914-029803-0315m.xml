                    in cave deposits, peat-mosses, river-gravels, &lt;fcc., may be regarded as the
                    earliest examples of the chipping and grinding of stone. Small cylinders of
                    serpentine and other soft stones, on which figures and inscriptions were
                    engraved, were fabricated in very early times by the Assyrians. Similar
                    cylinders were afterwards made in rock-crystal, chalcedony, haematite, &amp;c.,
                    and these harder substances were engraved by means of drills charged with the
                    powder of still harder minerals. The use of such drills is said to date as far
                    back as the year 730 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> These cylinders were
                    perforated by round holes, and were strung as necklaces. The stone scarabei and
                    other amulets of the Egyptians were carved or chiselled, and, according to King
                    <hi rend="italic">{Handbook of Engraved Gems,</hi> 1866), these people do not
                    appear to have followed the Ninevites and Babylonians in the use of the drill.
                    This tool was, however, largely employed by the Etruscan lapidaries, who also
                    used a diamond point in finishing their work. Signets were used by the Greeks as
                    early as 600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and in the time of Alexander gems of
                    all kinds were cut and engraved, with the exception of the diamond. The art of
                    cutting diamonds was probably known to the Hindus and the Chinese in very early
                    times, but it was unknown in Europe until nearly the close of the 15th century,
                    the diamond cut and polished for Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, in 1475
                    being the first recorded example. The diamond point was extensively used in
                    engraving the gems of the 16th, 17th, and early part of the 18th centuries, when
                    skilful imitations of the antique gems were fabricated, and the employment of
                    this tool is already spoken of by Pliny <hi rend="italic">{H. N^.,</hi> xxxviii.
                    15) and Solinus, c. 52. The drills used by the ancients were worked either by
                    hand or with a bow. Holes are now drilled in stone by means of an iron or copper
                    tube, fed with diamond dust and oil (fig. 1).</p>
                <p>The small tools used for engraving stones are set in a horizontal position, and
                    are worked by vertical driving gear (fig. 2). They are of various forms, some of
                    which are shown in fig. 3, and are made of soft iron and charged with diamond
                    düst and oil. Any substance finely pulverized, and of greater hardness than the
                    material operated upon, may be used for cutting and grinding stone, but diamond
                    dust is preferred as it can be used sparingly by the employment of very thin
                    slitting disks, into the edges of which it is imbedded by the application of an
                    agate or glass roller, the dust being previously worked into a paste with oil.
                    Oil of brick or soft soap is used freely as a lubricant during the process of
                    cutting. The diamond powder is procured by finely pulverizing imperfect stones,
                    usually the coarse variety termed <hi rend="italic">bort</hi> or carbonado, in a
                    steel mortar; or it is ground between flat iron slabs with oil of brick.</p>

                    their driving gear are termed <hi rend="italic">slitting-mills.</hi> When leaden
                    laps charged with emery mud are substituted the arrangement is called a <hi
                    rend="italic">roughing-mill,</hi> and when leaden or pewter laps charged with
                    rotten-stone are used it is known as a <hi rend="italic">polishing-mill.</hi>
                    The mills are sometimes worked by steam power, sometimes by hand. In the
                    ordinary pattern of a lapidary’s bench the handle turns in a horizontal plane,
                    as shown in fig. 4, where W is the driving-wheel turned by the handle A, and
                    working the pulley P by means of a strap. The pulley is fixed on a vertical
                    spindle, which carries M the disk for slitting or the leaden lap for rough ing
                    or polishing. The upper end of this spindle is conical, and rotates in a socket
                    drilled in a horizontal arm of iron which projects from a vertical wooden rod D.
                    A block of wood C fits on to the end of an iron support termed the <hi
                    rend="italic">gim-peg</hi> or <hi rend="italic">germ-peg.</hi> This support is
                    used to steady the operator’s arm when grinding the edges of small stones, and
                    the wooden block, which is fixed by a wedge, is employed for cutting facets at
                    any desired angle, the stone being cemented to the end of a stick S, which is
                    fixed at the requisite angle in one of the holes or notches made in the sides of
                    the socket C. In slicing stones it is necessary not to bring any sharp edge of
                    the stone against the disk, but to commence upon a moderately flat or smooth
                    surface, otherwise the charge of diamond dust or <hi rend="italic"
                    >seasoning,</hi> which should last for several hours, will be stripped off
                    during the first revolution.</p>
                <p>Another form of lapidary’s mill consists of a strong framework of oak, 8 or 9
                    feet long by 6 or 7 feet in height, and with a breadth of about 2 feet. It is
                    formed of four square uprights, mortised into a couple of sole-baf·s, and braced
                    together by eight cross-bars at top and bottom, which, like all the other parts
                    of the frame, are mortised and strongly bolted together. Half way up the frame a
                    strong board or table is fixed, and above and below this table stout wooden bars
                    or <hi rend="italic">summers</hi> run the length of the frame. In each of these
                    summers are two square holes through which slide short oaken rods having square
                    sections and bored out conically at the ends to receive the upper and lower
                    extremities of the iron spindles which carry the laps or slicers (fig. 5). The
                    remainder of the working parts are very similar to those already described,
                    except that the driving-wheels are very large and the lower extremities of their
                    axletrees, which are conical, rest upon sockets fixed to the floor, while their
                    upper ends revolve in holes in a beam. The driving-wheels drop over pegs which
                    project from the upper sides of collets, immediately beneath which the axle has
                    a crank. The crank is connected with an arm composed of three flat iron bars,
                    which are fixed together at suitable lengths by square rings. The other end of
                    the crank bar is provided with a stud by which it is attached to a pivoted
                    wooden arm carrying two upright pegs, which serve as handles for the operator,
                    who imparts a backward and forward motion to the arm.</p>
                <p>A very important substitute for the gim-peg-socket, already described, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">dial,</hi> by means of which facets can be cut with great
                    precision. One of the improved forms of the lapidary’s dial consists of two jaws
                    <hi rend="italic">a, a</hi> (fig. 6), in each of which a hemispherical cavity is
                    ground, and within this cavity a brass ball δ is contained by the jaws when they
                    are clamped together. A brass tube is attached to this ball, and carries a
                    circular dial <hi rend="italic">d</hi> at its upper end. Into the lower end of
                    the tube is tightly inserted the cement-rod, which is fixed by a set-screw
                    carrying at its lower end <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the stone to be cut. At its
                    upper end, which is squared, and projects above the dial, a small index/is
                    fitted. Upon the side of one of the jaws is a divided quadrant <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> with the centre of which the centre of the brass ball coincides. The
                    tube bearing the dial can therefore be inclined at any angle corresponding with
                    the divisions on the exposed face of the quadrant, while, by turning the
                    cement-stick and its index, the stone can be easily set, so that a range of
                    facets may be cut with great accuracy.</p>
                <p>Where practicable, the lapidary avails himself of the natural cleavages in the
                    mineral upon which he is going to operate, and these are constant in direction
                    in any one species, but are more easily available in certain minerals than they
                    are in others. When no satisfactory cleavage planes exist, the mineral may be
                    sawn into slices by a thin wire charged with diamond dust. The diamond is cut
                    and polished upon a lap of cast-iron fed with diamond dust and olive oil. Gems
                    having a hardness of 8 and 9 (Mohs’s scale) are cut on copper disks, similarly
                    primed, and are afterwards polished with tripoli and water. Stones of inferior
                    hardness are ground upon a leaden lap with emery and water, and are polished on
                    tin disks with tripoli, or on zinc disks with putty-powder and water. In

                    employed. Precious stones are cut in forms known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >brilliants</hi> and <hi rend="italic">roses,</hi> and the several parts are
                    designated as shown in fig. 7 (side-elevations). Turquoise, opal, cats-eye,
                    carbuncle, asteria, and a few other stones are cut en cabochon.</p>
                <p>Prior to engraving on a stone, the polish is removed with emery from the surface
                    to be engraved, and the device marked on it with a brass point; the outline is
                    then sharply incised, and the work continued by means of small drills, the
                    diamond point, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Within the last few years a great advance has been made in our knowledge of the
                    minute structure and mineral constitution of rocks by cutting and grinding small
                    slices of them so thin that they readily transmit light, and can then be
                    examined under the microscope, and the optical properties of their constituent
                    minerals conveniently studied. Sections suitable for this purpose may be
                    prepared by grinding thin flakes or splinters of a rock or mineral upon a
                    cast-iron plate smeared with emery powder and water. The emery employed for the
                    first grinding should not be very fine, that of medium grain being best suited
                    for the purpose. The fragment is pressed by the fingers against the slab, and
                    ground uniformly over all parts of the plate with a circular motion. When a flat
                    surface is obtained, the fragment should be carefully washed from all traces of
                    the emery mud, and a finer face should be imparted to it by a second grinding
                    with the finest flour-emery and water, smeared upon a slab of plate-glass or a
                    smoothly-planed brass slab. When thoroughly cleaned, the smooth face of the chip
                    is warmed and cemented to a small piece of plateglass with Canada balsam (fig
                    8). The older and drier the balsam the better it answers this purpose. A little
                    should be placed on the piece of glass and warmed until it liquefies (it must
                    not boil). The smooth surface of the stone is then laid upon the balsam and
                    pressed tightly against the glass; when the balsam has hardened, the grinding
                    process is renewed, the piece of glass serving as a handle, and the flour-emery
                    should generally be employed as soon as the fragment is thin enough to transmit
                    light. When finished, the glass and section are cleaned, the glass is warmed,
                    and the section is pushed off with a blunt needle or wire into a saucer of
                    turpentine, which should be gently warmed, and all traces of dirt should be
                    removed with a camel’s hair brush. The section is then lifted from its bath by
                    means of a needle and allowed to subside gently upon a drop of fluid Canada
                    balsam placed on a clean glass slip which has been previously warmed. A thin
                    covering-glass is then slightly warmed and placed over the preparation, care
                    being taken not to include any air-bubbles. The process of grinding sections by
                    hand is necessarily a rather slow one, and, although in the finishing it cannot
                    well be superseded by other methods, still the rough grinding may be much more
                    expeditiously done by means of various machines which have been devised for this
                    purpose. Some of these are worked by hand, others by a treadle. Among the
                    latter, the apparatus devised by Mr J. B. Jordan, and manufactured by Messrs
                    Cotton &amp; Johnstone of Grafton Street, Soho,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Described and figured in The Study of Rocks
                    (Longman’s TextBooks of Science).</p></note> and that made by Fuess of Berlin
                    are those in most general use. These machines are provided with slitting disks
                    for cutting thin slices with diamond dust. This saves much grinding, but
                    presents some difficulties to the novice. The grinding laps with which the
                    machines are supplied are generally cast in lead or pewter, while occasionally
                    prepared corundum disks are employed, and disks of hard wood are now and then
                    used for imparting a final polish. <hi rend="italic">(v.</hi><hi
