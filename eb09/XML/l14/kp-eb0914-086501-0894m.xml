                    west is about 120 miles, the width nowhere exceeds 24 miles, and in some places
                    falls to 12 or 15. The western end is separated from the city and State of New
                    York by the East River, which is nowhere more than three quarters of a mile in
                    breadth, and has been spanned by a great suspension bridge; but between the main
                    body of the island and the mainland (Connecticut, Rhode Island) lies Long Island
                    Sound, widening out to a breadth of 20 miles. The sound, however, is
                    comparatively shallow, the depth in the eastern and seaward portion being
                    usually under 200 feet, while in the portion west of Connecticut river it is
                    nowhere more than 170 feet, and in general only 75-100 feet. Geologically the
                    island is very interesting, consisting, as it does for the most part, of an
                    immense morainal deposit of glacial drift. A range of hills extends with some
                    interruptions for about 60 miles in the line of its longer axis, varying in
                    height from 150 to 384 feet above sea-level. Fort Pond Hill for instance is 194
                    feet; Neaρeague, 135; Amagansett, 161; Shinecock, 140; Osborn’s Hill, near
                    Riverhead, 293; Ruland’s, south of Coram, 340; West Hills (Jane’s Hill), 354;
                    Layton’s Hill, 380; Westbury, 260; Hempstead</p>
                <p>Harbour Hill, 384; John M. Clarke’s Hill, 326. From the foot of the hills
                    southward stretches a vast nearly level plain, with an average height of 70
                    feet, and consisting of post-glacial stratified sand and gravel; and across this
                    run a large number of shallow parallel watercourses, remarkable mainly for the
                    regularity with which they present an elevated bank on the western side and a
                    long declivity on the eastern. On the northern side of the range the surface is
                    very uneven, some of the elevations exceeding 200 feet, and deep fiord valleys
                    stretching down to the sound, and forming a series of excellent harbours. The
                    glacial drift of Long Island is of immense depth, and contains a wonderful
                    number of boulders. “At the eastern extremity,” says Lyell on the authority of
                    Mather, “they are of such kinds of granite, gneiss, mica, slate, greenstone, and
                    syenite as may have come across the sound from parts of Rhode Island. Opposite
                    the mouth of the Connecticut river they are of such varieties of gneiss and
                    hornblende slate as correspond with the rocks of the region through which that
                    river passes. Still further west they consist of red sandstone and conglomerate
                    and the trap of that country, and lastly, adjoining the city of New York, we
                    find serpentine, red sandstone, and various granitic and crystalline rocks which
                    have come from the district immediately to the north.” One of the boulders near
                    Manhasset measures 54 feet long and 40 feet wide, and rises 16 feet above the
                    level of the soil. Of the numerous lakelets scattered throughout Long Island it
                    is enough to mention Ronkonkoma, near Lakeland, the waters of which are said to
                    decrease and increase in regular periods of four years. Much of the surface of
                    the country is still covered with wood—oak, hickory, and chestnut growing freely
                    on the unmodified drift, and pine forests extending for about fifty miles
                    through the sandy plains. A good rich loam abounds in the northern districts,
                    and the lighter soils of the south are easily rendered productive.
                    Marketgardening especially is carried on with success. The climate is
                    comparatively mild, the mean annual temperature being 49° to 51°, the maximum
                    for the year between 95° and 100°, and the minimum 4° to 8°. The average
                    rainfall is about 421 inches. Towards its western end more especially, the
                    northern coast of Long Island presents a number of important bays—Glen Cove,
                    Oyster Bay, Huntington Bay, Smithtown Bay, &lt;fcc.; the western extremity is
                    deeply bifurcated by a very irregular inlet, broken up by various islands into
                    Gardiner’s Bay, Little Peconic, and Great <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n895/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0895-0866"/> Peconic; and along a large part of the southern
                    coast stretches a remarkable series of lagoons, formed by a line of dunes
                    varying in breadth from ∣ to 1 mile, and connected at various points with the
                    ocean. These last—of which the most important is Great South Bay, 40 miles long
                    by about 5 or 6 miles wide—are of great service to the island, and an Act has
                    been passed to increase their utility by connecting them by canals. Coney Island
                    and Rockaway Beach, the most frequented of the many seaside resorts in the
                    Island, lie near the south-western extremity. As regards both birds and fishes,
                    Long Island seems a kind of meeting place between the arctic and the equatorial
                    species. In winter, for instance, it is visited by the eider-duck, the little
                    white goose, the great cormorant, and the auk, in summer by the turkey buzzard,
                    the swallow-tailed kite, and the fork-tailed flycatcher. A few deer are still to
                    be found; and various tracts of country and islands in the great bays are
                    stocked with game and fish by sportsmen’s clubs. The east portion of the island
                    is one of the chief seats of the menhaden fisheries, and the oyster beds of both
                    the north and the south coast are of great value. Those of the Great South Bay
                    (furnishing, amongst others, the famous “blue points”) alone give employment in
                    the season to 1500 fishermen. (See E. Ingersoll, “The Oyster Industry,” in the

                <p>Of the thirteen or fourteen Indian tribes living in the island at the time of its
                    discovery, the only remnants are about fifty Shinecocks and Montauks.</p>
                <p>Besides Brooklyn, which had 566,689 inhabitants, King’s County contained Flatbush
                    town, 7634; Flatlands town, 3127; Gravesend town (including Coney Island
                    village), 3676; New Lots town, 13,681; and New Utrecht town, 4742. In Queen’s
                    county are Flushing town, 15,919; Hempstead town (including East Rockaway,
                    Garden City, and sixteen other villages), 18,160; Jamaica town, 10,089; Long

                    Bay town, 11,923. In Suffolk there are no cities, and none of the villages have
                    500 inhabitants. The “towns” are Babylon, Brookhaven, East Hampton, Huntington,
                    Islip, Riverhead, Shelter Island, Smithtown, Southampton, and Southhold. Garden
                    City was built by A. T. Stewart as a model suburban settlement, and contains a
                    fine cathedral. Hicksville is associated with the memory of Elias Hicks the
                    Quaker missionary. Sag Harbour was formerly a great whaling station, and still
                    maintains a good coasting trade. Five miles from Flushing is Creedmore rifle
                    range, the finest in the United States. On Gardiner’s Island the pirate Kidd
                    concealed the treasures partly recovered by the governor of Massachusetts in
                    1699.</p>
                <p>Long Island was so called by its Dutch discoverers in 1609, and the name Nassau,
                    bestowed in 1693 by the colonial legislature, never found popular acceptance.
                    Breucklen (Brooklyn), Amersfoort (Flatlands), Vlissingen (Flushing), Busdorf
                    (Jamaica), and New Utrecht were founded by the Dutch between 1630 and 1654; and
                    between 1640 and 1665 the English from the New England colonies established
                    Southold, Southampton, Easthampton, Hempstead, Huntington, Oyster Bay,
                    Smithtown, Islip, &amp;c. Though the charter granted by James I. in 1620
                    expressly excluded territory actually possessed or inhabited by any other
                    Christian prince or state, the grantees in 1635 conveyed to the earl of Stirling
                    among other lands the island of Matowacks or Long Island. A treaty concluded
                    between Dutch and English at Hartford (Connecticut) in 1650 suιτendered to
                    England all the land south of Oyster Bay; but, though it was ratified by the
                    states-general of Holland in 1656, no action was taken by the English
                    Government. Long Island was included in the territory assigned to the duke of
                    York in 1663-64, and in 1654 an English squadron conquered the Dutch in time of
                    peace, and set up a government in the duke’s name. When the Dutch governor, who
                    had recovered New York in 1673, issued a proclamation requiring the submission
                    of the Long Island towns, they all obeyed except the three most eastern; but the
                    treaty of Westminster in 1674 left Long Island to the English, and it became a
                    regular colony of the crown. In the beginning of the war of American
                    independence, Long Island naturally played a prominent part. The efforts made by
                    Washington to defend it were frustrated by the British under Cornwallis in 1776,
                    and it remained in their hands till the close of the contest.</p>
