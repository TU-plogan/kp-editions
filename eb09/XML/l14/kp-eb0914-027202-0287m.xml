                <p><label type="entry">LANDLORD AND TENANT</label>. It has been explained in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Land</hi> that in the United Kingdom no such thing
                    as the absolute private ownership of land is recognized. The absolute and
                    ultimate owner of all lands is the crown, and the highest interest that a
                    subject can hold therein is a tenancy. The largest estate known to the law, that
                    in fee simple, is after all only a holding in which the owner of the fee stands
                    to the lord in the relation of a tenant. All estates in land would therefore
                    fall under this heading, but on the present occasion, as in common parlance, it
                    is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0288-0273"/> restricted to those holdings which amount to the
                    hiring of land. That tenure has nowhere the same importance as in the British
                    Isles,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the United
                    States the law is substantially the same as in England. The remedy by distress
                    is said to be “becoming unpopular in the United States, as giving an undue
                    advantage to landlords over otlιer creditors. In New England the law of
                    attachment on mesne process has superseded the law of distress. In New York,
                    North Carolina, Georgia, Ohio, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi, and Louisiana,
                    it is modified or abolished (see Bouvier’s Lαιo Dictionary, art. “Distress”). On
                    the other hand, a speedier remedy than ejectment has been provided for
                    landlords, by which they may be ‘ ‘ reinstated, upon notice of a day or two, in
                    cases where a tenant abandons the premises before the end of the term without
                    surrendering the lease, leaving rent in arrear, continues to hold over after the
                    expiration of his term, or has become unable or unwilling to pay for the use of
                    the premises” (Bouvier, art. “Landlord and Tenant ”).</p></note> where
                    practically the whole agricultural land of the community is cultivated by
                    persons who merely hire it for a limited time from the owners. The social and
                    political bearing of this fact does not fall within the scope of the present
                    article, but it shows the important application of the rules of law which we
                    proceed to state.</p>
                <p>Dismissing the tenant character of the landlord, and regarding him as owner pure
                    and simple, we have to deal with him as contracting to give up the occupation of
                    his land to another person, the tenant, for a consideration. In Roman law, the
                    tenure of <hi rend="italic">emphyteusis</hi> (a kind of perpetual lease
                    originally used by corporations but afterwards by private owners), and <hi
                    rend="italic">precarium</hi> (or tenancy-at-will) occupied to some extent the
                    place of the law of landlord and tenant in our system. The proper contract of
                    letting and hiring <hi rend="italic">(locatio-conductid)</hi> as applied to land
                    had the following incidents. The <hi rend="italic">conductor</hi> (tenant) was
                    not technically regarded as possessor; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he had not
                    the aid of the interdicts in case of eviction either by the landlord or by
                    strangers. The <hi rend="italic">locator</hi> alone could sue in respect of the
                    land, but the conductor had a personal action against the locator on the
                    contract. The landlord was bound to make delivery to the tenant and permit him
                    to occupy for the term agreed upon, and to keep the premises in proper repair.
                    The landlord was answerable for any injury arising to the tenant from the
                    defective condition of the premises. Finally, “the lιndlord must permit the
                    tenant to carry away not only movables but even fixtures placed by the tenant,
                    provided the tenant did not injure the house. Λ tenant of land was entitled to
                    compensation for unexhausted improvements except such as he had specially agreed
                    to execute in consideration of a lower rent” (see Hunter’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introduction to Roman Law,</hi> p. 121). On the other hand, the <hi
                    rend="italic">conductor</hi> had to pay the rent subject to deductions for the
                    total or partial loss of the crops, to exercise due care during his term, and
                    give up possession at its expiration.</p>
                <p>In English law the following terms are of fundamental importance. The landlord so
                    contracting is said to <hi rend="italic">demise</hi> his lands, and the
                    instrument by which the contract is expressed would be a <hi rend="italic"
                    >demise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lease.</hi> The word lease is very generally
                    limited to the writing in which the agreement to let is expressed, but any
                    contract of letting is as on the side of the landlord a <hi rend="italic"
                    >demise,</hi> and as between the parties a <hi rend="italic">lease.</hi> A lease
                    or demise means a grant of the exclusive possession of the thing in question for
                    a definite time; permission merely to use the thing for a particular purpose or
                    on a particular occasion is a licence and not a lease. A lease further implies
                    that the lessor intends to give up possession to the defendant for a determinate
                    time, no matter how it may be expressed, and is so distinguishable from a mere
                    agreement contemplating that the parties shall on some future occasion enter
                    into the relations which a lease creates. The consideration promised by the
                    tenant or lessee is termed the <hi rend="italic">rent.</hi> The period of
                    occupation prescribed is the <hi rend="italic">term.</hi></p>
                <p>The Statute of Frauds (29 Car. II. c. 3) enacts that “all leases, estates,
                    interests of freehold, or terms of years, not put in writing by the parties so
                    making or creating the same or their agents thereunto lawfully authorized by
                    writing, shall have the effect of leases or estates at will,”— except leases for
                    a term not exceeding three years, whereon the reserved rent amounts to
                    two-thirds of the improved value. When rent is accepted by the landlord, the
                    tenancy-at-will is enlarged into a tenancy from year to year. By a later Act, 8
                    &lt;fc 9 Vict. c. 106, a lease required by law to be in writing must now be made
                    by deed.</p>
                <p>A lease, like other written contracts, should clearly indicate the parties to and
                    the effect of the contract. A date is not necessary, and, in the absence of a
                    date, it will take effect from the day of delivery. But it must contain the
                    names or other sufficient description of the parlies, a description of the
                    premises to be demised, words appropriately expressing the fact of a present
                    demise <hi rend="italic">(demise</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lease</hi> being the
                    usual words), the date at which the term is to begin and end, and the rent. The
                    rent or other services created in favour of the landlord by the lease are said
                    to be <hi rend="italic">reserved.</hi> And when things that would otherwise
                    belong to the tenant under the lease, as woods, timber, trees, minerals,
                    &lt;fcc., are expressly withheld, they are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >exceptecl.</hi> But these expressions do not apply to conditions giving to the
                    landlord the right of shooting, fishing, and so on over the land, or any right
                    of way or other easement thereon. That can be vested in the landlord only by a
                    re-grant from the tenant, no matter by what expression the right is created.
                    Such grant must be by deed; and, where a lease of the land would be effectual
                    without a deed, a reservation of such rights as we have mentioned would not.
                    There is a good deal of misconception on this point, for landlords are not
                    generally understoed to hold their right to game on grant from their
                    tenants.</p>
                <p>In point of length of term tenancies are distinguishable as being either at
                    sufferance, or at will, or from year to year, or for a term of years. A tenancy
                    by sufferance exists where a person having obtained possession on a lawful title
                    holds over after the title has determined, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a tenant
                    on lease for a term of years after the expiration of the lease. It has been said
                    that this is not an estate at all but a fiction to prevent the continued
                    possession being regarded as a trespass. It is not created by contract, but
                    arises by implication of law; it is not assignable; and possession of the land
                    can be resumed without previous demand to the so-called tenant. A
                    tenancy-at-will exists when the tenant holds by agreement with the landlord,
                    determinable at the will of either. Any signification of a desire to terminate,
                    the tenancy, whether expressed as “notice” or not, will bring it to an end. A
                    tenancy from year to year is a tenancy for one year certain, and is determinable
                    only by a six months’ notice to quit, such notice terminating on an anniversary
                    of the date of the beginning of the tenancy. A tenancy from year to year must
                    last at least one year, but may be determined then, if a six months’ notice have
                    been given; if not so determined it must endure for another year, again
                    determinable in like manner, and it will so endure until terminated by such a
                    notice. Apart from express agreement, it will be implied in law when, for
                    example, the landlord accepts rent yearly or by parts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi> quarters) of a year. Similarly monthly tenancies, chiefly of
                    furnished houses or lodgings, would be implied from the fact of rent being paid
                    once a month. But that is a matter of presumption only. If it were proved that
                    the parties agreed to a tenancy-at-will only, payment of rent by the quarter or
                    any other period would not enlarge the nature of the tenancy. Lastly, a lease
                    may be for a specified term, and the tenancy in that case comes to an end by the
                    lapse of time, without notice to quit or any other formality.</p>
                <p>These are the agreements by which the relations of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n289/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0289-0274"/> landlord and tenant, as the phrase is generally
                    understood, are created, and they are the agreements under which most of the
                    buildings and nearly the whole of the agricultural land are held by their
                    occupiers. There are tenancies, however, in which the granter would not be
                    spoken of as the landlord. Such is the position of the person to whom land is
                    granted for his own life, or, it may be, for the life of another, called in
                    technical language tenant for life and tenant <hi rend="italic">pur autre
                    vie.</hi> These are not cases of letting and hiring—to which the relation of
                    landlord and tenant is confined—but are modes of holding property. The same may
                    be said of the terms for long periods of years created for carrying out trusts
                    in the settlement of estates. The tenant in such cases is the person who, when
                    we come to the agreement of letting and hiring, stands in the place of the
                    landlord. It may be observed that the law-books distinguish in point of dignity
                    between estates for life, the lowest kind of freehold estates, and estates for
                    any term of years however long, which are only leasehold estates.</p>
                <p>Reverting to the agreement of letting and hiring, it may be laid down that any
                    person having an interest in land may, to the extent of that interest, create a
                    valid tenancy. A tenant for years or even from year to year only may stand in
                    his turn as landlord to another tenant. If he profess to create a tenancy for a
                    period longer than that to which his own interest extends, he does not thereby
                    give to his tenant an interest available against the reversioner or remainder
                    man. The subtenant’s interest will expire with the interest of the person who
                    created it. But as between the subtenant and his immediate lessor the tenancy
                    will be good; and, should the interest of that lessor become greater than it was
                    when the subtenancy was created, the subtenant will have the benefit of it. In
                    the same way, as between lessor and lessee—landlord and tenant—the latter has no
                    right to look beyond the grant of the former so as to call in question his
                    title. Be that title what it may, the tenant, by accepting that position, is <hi
                    rend="italic">estopped</hi> from denying that it is good. It may be notoriously
                    bad, but that is nothing to him. The landlord is not obliged to prove his title
                    as against the tenant or any person claiming through his tenant. In an action of
                    ejectment (for the recovery of land) the person claiming possession must in
                    general -prove his own title—mere possession being a <hi rend="italic"
                    >prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> sufficient defence, until a better title
                    be shown. But a landlord seeking to secure possession of land from his tenant is
                    not obliged to prove anything, except his right to resume possession under the
                    agreement. The tenant, however, may, without disputing the validity of the title
                    under which he entered, show that it has since been determined by lapse of time
                    or by operation of law.</p>
                <p>A large portion of the land of the country being held under settlements whereby
                    the person in possession for the time being had only the legal interest of a
                    tenant for life, there were until recently great difficulties in the way of
                    letting such land advantageously. The Leases and Sales of Settled Estates Act,
                    1856, now empowers any person entitled to the rents and profits of a settled
                    estate to demise the same by deed for any term not exceeding twenty-one years to
                    take effect in possession and at the best rent obtainable. Settlements
                    containing express directions to the contrary will, however, avoid the statute;
                    and on the other hand a settlement may contain powers to the tenant for life to
                    grant leases for even longer terms.</p>
                <p>The legal rights and duties of landlord and tenant respectively are in most cases
                    defined by the contract of tenancy. The policy of the law has hitherto been to
                    allow the landlord, who is virtually if not technically absolute owner of the
                    land, to do as he pleases with it. The contract of tenancy has hitherto been a
                    free contract, and, although in the absence of contract the law itself defines
                    the rights of the parties, there is hardly one of these which may not be
                    displaced or modified by the agreement. This, it may be said in passing, is the
                    seat of the very widespread dissatisfaction that exists in all the three
                    kingdoms with what are vaguely termed the land laws. A small class has been
                    allowed to acquire absolute dominion over the land of the country, and may
                    impose what terms it pleases on the rest of the community for the right to use
                    the land. The law governing the devolution of land is intricate and perplexing
                    no doubt, and by making conveyances expensive hinders the free distribution of
                    the land among a larger class of owners. But that is not the real root of the
                    present discontent. Its real root is the absolute dominion of the class of
                    owners who are not cultivators, but who, having the monopoly of the land, may
                    load the cultivators with what burdens they please. As for the law of landlord
                    and tenant, it is still greater misconception to suppose that to be in fault. It
                    is what the landlord or tenant choose to make it. There is very little of it,
                    independently of contract, and what little there is may be altered as the
                    parties please. No law can be better than one which allows men to make their own
                    contracts and limits itself to enforcing them. That is what the law of landlord
                    and tenant does. If its effects are bad, it must be because the original
                    conditions of the contracting parties are other than they ought to be. We shall
                    have to show that practical evils have led to a demand for an alteration on the
                    law of landlord and tenant in the direction of limiting the power of the
                    landlord to impose terms on the tenant.</p>
                <p>One privilege imposed by the law on the landlord must be excepted from what has
                    just been said. The right to distrain for rent is a special interference of the
                    law for the protection of the landlord. Besides suing for his rent as a man may
                    for any other right, besides taking advantage of whatever covenants he may have
                    made for entry on default of payment, a landlord may enter upon the demise
                    premises and help himself to whatever articles of personal property he may find
                    there, to an amount sufficient to satisfy his claim. Distress as a general rule
                    extends to all movable property found on the premises, whether belonging to the
                    tenant or not; but there are certain well-defined exemptions, as, for example,
                    goods sent to a man publicly carrying on a trade to be worked at or dealt with
                    in the way of his trade. And some things have the benefit of a conditional
                    exemption, as horses employed to work the ground, which should not be taken so
                    long as there is any other property to satisfy the distress. This privilege is
                    an injurious interference with the property and rights of third persons. It
                    exposes persons dealing with the tenant to the danger of losing whatever
                    property of their own they may permit to be on his premises, and of having their
                    claims against him postponed to those of the landlord. This is a wide departure
                    from the general principle of the law, which is to leave the parties alone; but
                    even here the right to distress may be expressly abolished in the contract of
                    tenancy if the parties please.</p>
                <p>Again, the land, on the expiration of the tenancy, becomes the absolute property
                    of the landlord, no matter how it may have been altered or improved during the
                    occupation. In certain cases the law has discriminated between the contending
                    claims of landlord and tenant. (1) In respect of <hi rend="italic">fixtures</hi>
                    (which may be shortly defined as movables so affixed to the soil as to become
                    part thereof), the tenant may sometimes remove them, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> when they have been brought on the premises for the purpose of being
                    used in business. This, it is said, is done by way of encouraging trade, but it
                    is curious that no similar principle has been admitted for the encouragement of
                    agriculture. (2) In respect of <hi rend="italic">emblements^ i.e.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> the profits of sown land, a tenant may be
                    entitled to these whose term <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n290/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0290-0275"/> comes to an end by the happening of an uncertain
                    contingency. (3) A similar right is very generally recognized by custom in
                    tenants whose term expires in the ordinary way. The custom of the district, in
                    the absence of stipulations between the parties, would be imported into their
                    contract —the tenant going out on the same conditions as he came in. But with
                    these exceptions the land in its improved condition passes over to the landlord.
                    The tenant may have added to its value by buildings, by labour applied to the
                    land, or by the use of fertilizing manures, but, whatever be the amount of the
                    additional value, he is not entitled to any compensation whatever. This again is
                    a matter which the parties may, if they please, regulate for themselves. As a
                    matter of fact, landlords never allow a compensation clause to be inserted in
                    their leases.</p>
                <p>The Agricultural Holdings Act, 1875, attempts to remedy this injustice by
                    enacting that compensation shall be paid to tenants for improvements the benefit
                    of which has not been exhausted at the end of the lease. These are of three
                    classes :—(1) Drainage of land, erection or enlargement of buildings, laying
                    down permanent pasture, making and planting osier beds, making water meadows or
                    works of irrigation, making gardens, roads, or bridges, water-courses, ponds,
                    wells, or reservoirs, making fences, planting hops, planting orchards,
                    reclaiming waste lands, and warping land. The tenant to establish a claim for
                    compensation must have the landlord’s consent in writing to the improvements.
                    The compensation is a sum equal to the amount originally expended, less
                    one-twentieth for every year that has elapsed since, and the whole benefit of
                    the improvement is taken to be exhausted in twenty years. (2) Boning lands with
                    undissolved bones, chalking land, clay burning, claying, liming, and marling
                    land, after notice in writing given to the landlord. They are deemed to be
                    exhausted at the end of seven years, and the compensation is the sum expended,
                    less one-seventh for every year. (3) Artificial or other purchased manure
                    applied to the land, and cake or other feeding stuff consumed thereon by cattle,
                    dec. Exhausted in two years, compensation to be a sum representing its fair
                    value to an incoming tenant. The Act, however, has no application if the parties
                    agree in writing, either on the contract of tenancy or otherwise, that it shall
                    not apply. In point of fact, landlords insist upon the renunciation of the Act
                    as a condition of granting a lease. The Act has accordingly been a dead
                    letter.</p>
                <p>The mutual rights of the parties are, as we have already said, regulated to a
                    large extent by special provisions or covenants in the lease. The most usual of
                    these are the following :—(1) The landlord covenants that the tenant shall have
                    quiet enjoyment of the premises for the time agreed upon, and in the absence of
                    such a proviso a covenant to this effect will be implied from the fact of
                    letting. The obligation makes the landlord responsible for any lawful eviction
                    of the tenant during the term, but not for wrongful eviction unless he is
                    himself the wrongdoer, or has expressly made himself responsible for evictions
                    of all kinds. (2) The tenant is presumed to undertake to use the property in a
                    reasonable manner according to the purposes for which it was let, and to do
                    reasonable repairs. The landlord is not presumed to have undertaken to put the
                    premises in repair, nor to execute repairs. But the respective obligations of
                    parties where repairs are, as they always are in leases for years, the subject
                    of express covenant may vary indefinitely. The obligation is generally imposed
                    on the tenant to keep the premises in “good condition” or “tenant-like repair,”
                    and it will be construed with reference to the character of the premises
                    demised, their age, and their condition. A covenant to repair, unless limited
                    specially, makes the tenant liable to rebuild houses destroyed by accident. A
                    covenant to keep in repair requires the tenant to put the premises in repair if
                    they are out of repair, and to maintain them in that condition up to and at the
                    end of the tenancy. A breach of the covenant gives the landlord an action for
                    damages, which will be measured by estimated injury to the reversion if the
                    action be brought during the tenancy, and by the sum necessary to execute the
                    repairs if the action be brought later. (3) The improper user of the premises to
                    the injury of the reversioner is <hi rend="italic">ιvaste. Voluntary</hi> waste
                    is when the tenant by some positive act of his own has injured the premises <hi
                    rend="italic">; permissive</hi> waste is when the injury is caused by some
                    omission. Tenants-at-will or from year to year are not liable for the latter.
                    What is or is not waste is in some instances dependent on the custom of the
                    country, but in general anything which damages the freehold or alters its nature
                    is waste. Even the erection of new buildings would, strictly speaking, be waste
                    unless the lease could be construed as authorizing them. Besides these general
                    conditions implied in law, the use of the premises may be restricted
                    indefinitely by special provisos. Covenants against using the premises for the
                    carrying on of particular trades or businesses are the most usual. In this
                    category may be placed the rules as to cultivation to be found in agricultural
                    leases, in which also an obligation to cultivate in conformity with the custom
                    of the district would be implied. (4) Covenants by the tenant to insure and keep
                    insured the premises are also common, and if the premises are left uninsured for
                    the smallest portion of the term, although there may be no damage by fire, the
                    covenant is broken. (5) The rates and taxes are generally the subject of special
                    covenants. One tax, the property tax, is specially excepted. It must be paid by
                    the landlord, and if the tenant should pay it the landlord must deduct it from
                    the rent. The parties cannot by contract make any different arrangement. Another
                    charge on lands—the rent-charge fixed under the Tithe Commutation Acts in lieu
                    of tithes —is not a personal charge against either landlord or tenant, but is
                    leviable by distress. Apart from agreement, the charge, if paid by the tenant,
                    may be deducted from the rent. Other rates and charges, whether primarily
                    imposed on landlord or tenant, may be imposed by the contract upon one or other
                    as the parties may agree. (6) The incidents of rent—its amount, whether fixed or
                    fluctuating, its nature, whether in money or otherwise, time and mode of
                    payment, &lt;fcc.∙—are fixed by the agreement of the parties. When the land has
                    been occupied without a letting, the owner has an action against the occupier
                    for compensation for use and occupation, an undertaking to pay being implied
                    from the fact of occupation. But in other cases the rent due is a matter of
                    agreement between the parties, the law interpreting the terms when necessary.
                    Thus an agreement to pay a rent of £100, no times of payment being mentioned,
                    would be construed as an agreement to pay that rent annually. Rent is said to be
                    <hi rend="italic">due</hi> at the first moment of the day appointed for payment,
                    and in arrear at the first moment of the day following. It has already been said
                    that, in addition to the right of action as for an ordinary debt, the landlord
                    has a special right of distress. The covenant may also give him the right to
                    enter and eject the tenant on non-payment.</p>
                <p>Covenants are said to “run with the land” when the liabilities and rights created
                    by them pass to the assignees of the original parties. At common law it was said
                    that covenants “ran with the land” but not with the reversion, the assignee of
                    the reversioner not having the rights of the original lessor. But the assignees
                    of both parties have been on the same.footing since the statute 32 Henry VIII.
                    c. 34. The following covenants “run with the land”:— (1) all implied covenants;
                    (2) all express covenants concerning something in being at the time of the
                    covenant <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n291/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0291-0276"/> and “parcel of the demise”; (3) covenants
                    relating to things not in being but to be built or done on the premises, if the
                    covenant be for the covenantor himself and “his assigns.” But things merely
                    collateral do not bind the assigns even if they be named.</p>
                <p>The right of the tenant to assign his lease—as well as his right to make an
                    underlease—may itself be restricted by agreement, and covenants to that effect
                    are not uncommon. Sometimes the tenant covenants not to assign or underlet
                    without consent, and it may be provided that such consent will not be refused
                    except on reasonable groun Is. The lessee is not discharged from liability by
                    the assignment unless the landlord accepts the assignee as his tenant, and even
                    then the original lessor will remain liable on his own express covenants.</p>
                <p>The term may be forfeited either for breach of some condition on which the lease
                    was granted, or in virtue of a specific provision for re-entry on breach of any
                    covenant. Such a proviso is generally attached to the covenants, and the effect
                    of a breach of a covenant so protected is to make the lease voidable at the
                    option of the landlord. The tenant cannot take advantage of his own default to
                    terminate the tenancy. The landlord must signify his intention to avoid the
                    lease by some specific act. If he accepts rent, or, it seems, if he even asks
                    for it after notice of an act of forfeiture, he waives any breach of covenant up
                    to that time, but not forfeiture for future or continuing bre ιches. The
                    condition of forfeiture on breach may be attached to any covenants the parties
                    choose to make, and may therefore iu many cases press hardly on the tenant, who
                    for a tri Hing default may lose the whole value of his term. The courts in some
                    few instances will relieve a tenant from forfeiture. Thus they may relieve once
                    against a forfeiture for breach of covenant to insure, when no damage has
                    occurred and an insurance is in effect at the time of application. Relief will
                    also be given for forfeiture by non-paymeut of rent, if the arrears be paid up.
                    Λnd on the ground of fraud, accident, or mistake forfeitures may be relieved
                    against in other cases. The determination of a lease by forfeiture has the same
                    effect as its determination in any other way, in destroying subtenancies or
                    other rights created under it.</p>
                <p>It will be seen that with a few insignificant exceptions the contract is left by
                    law to be regulated by the parties. In one particular an important change has
                    been made by a recent Act. The right to the game, as we have already pointed
                    out, can only be taken out of the tenant by an express grant made by him. The
                    Ground Game Act, 1880, enacts that “any occupier of land shall have as incident
                    to and inseparable from his occupation of the land the right to kill and take
                    ground game thereon, concurrently with any other person who may be entitled to
                    kill and take ground game on the same land,”—subject to certain conditions which
                    need not be recounted here. And “every agreement, condition, or arrangement
                    which purports to divest or alienate the right of the occupier, so declared,
                    given, and reserved to him by this Act, or which gives to such occupier any
                    advantage in consideration of his forbearing to exercise such right, or imposes
                    upon him any disadvantage in consequence of his exercising such right, shall be
                    void.” Another clause provides that, when the right to kill and take ground game
                    is at the passing of the Act vested in any person other than the occupier, under
                    a <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> contract, the occupier’s rights under the Act
                    shall not come into existence until the determination of that contract.
                    “Groundgame” means “hares and rabbits.”</p>
                <p>Scotland—In Scotch law, “the contract of location is consensual and in its own
                    nature merely personal; but by statute it is made real against singular
                    successors” {j.e., purchasers). A lease for any greater term than one year must
                    be in writing. The lessor and his representatives are bound by a written lease
                    which is “authenticated in terms of the statutes and delivered, or fortified by
                    rei interventus, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> or sanctioned by homologation,”
                    or which is an offer, followed by real evidence of acceptance, or written
                    articles or conditions proved by written evidence to have been adopted by the
                    parties, or even a written obligation to grant a lease. The singular successors
                    of the lessor will be bound where he is bound, provided (1) that the lease is
                    definite as to subject, rent, and term of duration, and (2) that possession
                    shall have followed as a badge of real right under the statute (1449, c. 17).
                    Thus, while a lease of any duration will be good against the lessor and his
                    heirs, as against singular successors it must in general have a definite term of
                    duration, unless it be specially warranted and homologated. The usual term in
                    agricultural leases is nineteen years, and longer terms are common for building
                    and mining leases, but there appears to be some uncertainty as to whether any
                    and what limit must be imposed on the length of a term. So, as to rent, it may
                    be as against the grantor a merely nominal sum, or may be retained by the lessee
                    for debt; but as against singular successors it must stand payable. Rent, it is
                    said, may be either in money, grain, or service, but it must not be elusory.
                    Rent in money is generally payable at the ‘ ‘ legal terms” Whitsunday and
                    Martinmas. The obligation to pay rent is extinguished l&gt;y the destraction of
                    the subject, and this principle appears to have been applied to the partial
                    destruction of the subject occasioned by the disastrous failure of a particular
                    season. “When the destraction is partial, the point is more doubtful; and the
                    distinction seems to be that, if it be permanent though partial, the failure of
                    the subject let will give relief by entitling the tenant to renounce the lease
                    unless a deduction be allowed, but, that if it be merely temporary and
                    occasional, it will not entitle the tenant to relief. In the decisions, however,
                    relief has been given to a greater extent than that distinction would authorize;
                    thus devastation of the crop by storms, &amp;c., if plus quam tolerabile, has
                    been admitted as aground of abatement; but as the tenant takes the risk of the
                    seasons it must at least be some extraordinary event that will justify such a
                    decision” (Bell’s Principles'). And it would appear that the tenant has no
                    relief against such partial destraction of the subject let as may be occasioned
                    by a subsequent law, as for example in the case of a fishing lease, by an Act
                    extending the close time. Rent may be recovered either by personal action or by
                    the equivalent of distress, viz., hypothec. (But see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hypothec.)</hi> In Scotch law there is not, as in English, a prima facie right
                    in the tenant to assign the lease or sublet the premises. On the principle of
                    delectus persona, the landlord is presumed to have excluded all save those whom
                    lie has expressly admitted, at least in ordinary leases, though a different rale
                    prevails in longer leases. Even the heirs of tenants were at one time excluded,
                    but they now succeed to the lease. The obligations of the parties as to mode of
                    cultivation, amount of rent, length of term, repair, and so on are for the most
                    part regulated as in England by the express provisions of the lease. The tenant
                    is bound to give up the premises at the expiration of the term without
                    compensation for any permanent or unexhausted improvement thereon. “It is
                    implied,” says Bell, “in the contract of lease that any buildings, fences, or
                    improvements which the tenant may spontaneously make are made in contemplation
                    of his own interest and for his own use only. And so he has no claim for such
                    meliorations at the end of his lease without special stipulation. But, if the
                    tenant’s possession be terminated abruptly and prematurely, he ought in equity
                    to be entitled to recompense.”</p>
                <p>Ireland.—The law of landlord and tenant has been until recently substantially the
                    same as that which has already been described for England, and it will only be
                    necessary to notice here the more important changes that have been made in
                    Ireland by legislation. It may be pointed out, without touching at all on the
                    vexed Irish land question, that the inconvenience of the situation in which a
                    limited class own the soil, and let it out on hire on what terms they please to
                    cultivators, has been felt with particular force in Ireland. Agriculture is the
                    one industry of the country, and that industry was carried on under conditions
                    which made it all but impossible. The Irish tenant was, equally with the English
                    tenant, at the mercy of his landlord. If he made improvements he did so at the
                    risk of losing them by eviction or by being taxed for them by an increased rent.
                    The insecurity of his tenure gave him the alternative of doing nothing to better
                    his farm or bettering his farm without bettering himself. At the same time there
                    existed in Ireland, in consequence of circumstances peculiar to the people, an
                    excessive competition for land such as has never been paralleled in England. The
                    natural outcome of this condition of things was a demand for some change in the
                    law which could give tenants a reasonable security for their industry. And the
                    way was paved for such changes by the existence in Ulster of a local custom
                    having virtually the force of law, which did provide such a security.. This was
                    not a custom of which the courts could take judicial notice, and any landlord
                    who chose to do so might insist upon <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> This is
                    inferred from the fact that the grantor has knowingly permitted acts “not
                    unimportant to be done by the lessor on the faith of the contract.” <pb

                    was the custom in itself everywhere clear or uniform. “It is a strange thing to
                    say,” says Mr Butt, “but it would be impossible to frame any statement as to the
                    nature and meaning of the custom which would be universally accepted as a
                    correct description of its character.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    however, two main features— fixity of tenure, and free right of sale by the
                    tenant of his interest. “So long as the tenant pays his rent the landlord will
                    not use his legal powers to put an end to the tenancy,” says Judge Longfield,
                    describing the system, and the same authority adds that “the sale by an outgoing
                    tenant of his tenant right is to be with the approbation of the landlord. This
                    approbation is not to be capriciously refused, but on the other hand the tenant
                    is not at liberty to select any substitute that he thinks proper irrespective of
                    his character and possession of sufficient means for the efficient cultivation
                    of the land. ’ ’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An

                    R. Barry O'Brien, London, 1880.</p></note> The strength of the custom may be
                    estimated from a statement made by one of the witnesses before the Devon
                    commission :— “If systematic attempts were made amongst the proprietors of
                    Ulster to invade tenant right, I do not believe there is a force at the disposal
                    of the Horse Guards sufficient to keep the peace of the province.” And Mr Butt
                    estimates that the sum which tenants under the Ulster custom would receive on
                    the sale of their tenant right would amount to more than £20,000,000.</p>
                <p>The Landlord and Tenan t (Ireland) Act, 1870, enacts, section 1, that “the usages
                    prevalent in the province of Ulster (in this Act intended to be included under
                    the denomination of the Ulster tenant right custom) are hereby declared to be
                    legal, and shall in the case of any holding in the province of Ulster proved to
                    be subject thereto be enforced in the manner provided by this Act.” By section 2
                    like usages elsewhere than in Ulster are in like manner legalized. And a tenant
                    who is not entitled to compensation under sections 1 and 2 is nevertheless
                    declared to be entitled to the following rights:—(1) if holding under a tenancy
                    created after the passing of the Act he is disturbed in his holding by the
                    landlord, he shall be entitled to compensation for the loss which the court
                    shall find to have been incurred by him, subject to a scale of maximum amounts
                    varying from seven years’ rent on holdings of the annual value of £10 and under
                    to one year’s rent on holdings of the value of £100 and over, and in no case
                    exceeding £250; and (2) he may, on quitting his holding, claim compensation in
                    respect of improvements made by himself or his predecessors in title, subject to
                    certain considerable exceptions, as regards tenancies and improvements. The
                    second part of the Act contains clauses to facilitate the purchase by tenants of
                    the f.·e simple of their holdings, and the third part authorizes the
                    commissioners of public works in Ireland to advance moneys both to landlords for
                    payment of compensation for improvements and to tenants for the purchase of
                    their holdings. Section 44 enacts that the board, if they are satisfied with the
                    security, may advance to any tenant for the purpose of purchasing his holding,
                    in pursuance of the Act, any sum not exceeding two-thirds of the price of such
                    holding, and upon an order being made by the board such holding shall be deemed
                    to be charged with an annuity of five pounds for every one hundred pounds of
                    such advance, and so in proportion for any less sum, such annuity to be limited
                    in favour of the board, and to be declared to be repayable in the term of
                    thirty-five years. Section 46 requires the Landed Estates Court on the sale of
                    estates to afford as far as may be consistent with the interests of the persons
                    concerned facilities for such purchases by tenants, whether by selling the
                    estate in suitable lots or otherwise. The principle of transferring the
                    occupying tenants into peasant proprietors which these clauses are intended to
                    carry out is associated with the name of Mr Bright. The Bright clauses have not
                    had the practical success that was hoped for,—a result which is attributed to
                    the unfitness of the Landed Estates Court for working them.<note anchored="true"

                    vii.</p></note> And it may be added that the Act of 1870 failed to satisfy the
                    wishes of the Irish people, rackrenting and eviction being still possible, and
                    the process for obtaining compensation being tedious and expensive.</p>
                <p>The Land Law (Ireland) Act, 1881, was accordingly passed. Section 1 provides that
                    the tenant for the time being of every holding not specially excepted may sell
                    his tenancy for the best price that can be obtained, subject to certain
                    conditions and provisions specified in sixteen subsections. A tenant from year
                    to year is not permitted to subdivide or sublet his holding without permission
                    of the landlord. A person to whom a tenant has bequeathed the tenancy is in the
                    same position as a purchaser after sale. When a landlord demands an increase of
                    rent from a present or future tenant, then (1), if the tenant submits, his
                    tenancy shall become a statutory tenancy, subject to statutory conditions for
                    the period of fifteen years; (2) a future tenant not accepting increase but
                    selling shall be entitled to receive such amount as a court may fix for
                    depreciation of the selling value by the increased rent; (3) a tenant, not
                    accepting but not selling, is entitled to compensation as for disturbance; (4)
                    and a present tenant may apply to the court to have a rent fixed. A tenant
                    during a statutory term shall not be compelled to pay a higher rent than the
                    rent payable at the commencement, and shall not be compelled to quit except on
                    breach of the statutory conditions, some of which are as follows:—the tenant
                    must pay rent at the appointed time, must not commit persistent waste, must not
                    subdivide or sublet or erect a dwelling house otherwise than is provide&lt;l in
                    the Act. Agistment, or letting for pasture, and letting on conacre for growing
                    potatoes or other green crop are not within this prohibition. The landlord
                    retains the right to enter for the purpose of taking minerals, stone, timber,
                    making roads, hunting, shooting, fishing, and so on. The tenant may not open a
                    public house without the landlord’s consent. The section is not to prejudice any
                    ejectment for non-payment of rent in respect of rent accrued due for a holding
                    before the commencement of the statutory term.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The right of ejectment for non-payment of
                    rent was conferred on landlords by special législation. It is unknown to English
                    law, where non-payment only gives a right of re-entry if protected by a special
                    proviso to that effect in the lease.</p></note></p>
                <p>Sections 6 and 7 amend the law as to compensation for disturbance and
                    compensation for improvements as contained in the Act of 1870. Section 8
                    authorizes the court (to be created by the Act) to fix a fair rent on the
                    application of either party, and such judicial rent shall be the rent of the
                    tenancy for the statutory term of fifteen years as above described. The court is
                    to determine what is a fair rent after hearing parties, having a due regard to
                    their respective interests and to the circumstances of the case, holding, and
                    district. A new statutory term shall not begin until the expiration of a
                    preceding one, and an alteration of judicial rent shall not take place at less
                    intervals than fifteen years. Two important subsections deserve to be specially
                    noticed. It is provided (subsection 2) that the court may disallow the tenant’s
                    application if it be satisfied that ‘ ‘ the permanent improvements” on the
                    holding, which if executed by the tenant would have entitled him to compensation
                    under the Acts of 1870 and 1881, have been made and maintained, by the landlord
                    and his predecessors in title and not made or acquired by the tenant or his
                    predecessors. On the other hand, no rent shall be allowed or made payable in
                    respect of improvements made by the tenant or his predecessors in title for
                    which, in the opinion of the court, they shall not have been paid by the
                    landlord or his predecessors in title. When application is made to the court to
                    fix a judicial rent on a holding not subject to the Ulster tenant right or other
                    analogous custom, the parties by agreement or the court may fix a value on the
                    tenancy; and, if during the term the tenant should give notice to the landlord
                    of his intention to sell, the landlord may purchase the tenancy at the value so
                    fixed, subject to addition for subsequent improvements and deduction for
                    dilapidations. Subsection 10 provides that “the amount of money or money’s worth
                    that may have been paid or given for the tenancy of any holding by a tenant or
                    his predecessors in title, otherwise than to the landlord or his predecessors in
                    title, shall not of itself, apart from other considerations, be a ground for
                    reducing or increasing the rent of such holding.”</p>
                <p>The Act may be excluded by agreement as follows. The landlord and tenant may
                    agree to a “judicial lease” for thirty-one years and upwards, which if approved
                    by the court will take effect, and the holding will be regulated by the lease
                    and not be deemed subject to the Act. The parties may agree to a “fixed
                    tenancy,” which shall not be deemed subject to the Act, which shall be held upon
                    such conditions as parties may agree upon, and with reference to which the court
                    shall consider the interest of persons entitled to an estate or interest after a
                    present limited owner. In such a case the tenant shall pay a fee farm rent,
                    which may or may not be subject to revaluation by the court, and shall not be
                    compelled to quit his holding except on breach of some of the conditions
                    previously declared to be statutory.</p>
                <p>These are the main provisions of the Act, establishing more or less completely
                    what are known as the three F’s—“fair rents,” “fixed tenure,” and “free sale.”
                    Miscellaneous provisions supplemental to these can only be briefly noticed.
                    Section 20 enacts that the “tenancies to which the Act applies shall be deemed
                    to have determined whenever the landlord has resumed possession of the holding
                    either on the occasion of a purchase by him of the tenancy or default of the
                    tenant in selling, or by operation of law or reverter or otherwise.” But a
                    tenant holding under an Ulster or other analogous custom shall be entitled to
                    the benefit of such custom, notwithstanding the determination of his tenancy by
                    breach of a statutory condition. Section 21 deals with existing leases, which
                    are to remain in force, but at the expiration of such leases the tenants shall
                    be deemed to be tenants of “present ordinary tenancies from year to year,” and
                    therefore subject to the Act. Section 22 allows a tenant whose holding is of the
                    annual value of £150 to contract himself out of this or the previous Act, and
                    there is a special clause dealing with the case in which a landlord has before
                    the Act purchased the Ulster tenant right; but otherwise any provision contained
                    in any lease or contract of tenancy inconsistent with the provisions of the Act
                    shall be void. Part 5 relates to the acquisition<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n293/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0293-0278"/> of land by tenants, reclamation of land, and
                    emigration. Part 6 describes the form of proceedings to be taken under the Act.
                    In addition to the civil bill court of the county which has “jurisdiction in
                    respect of all disputes arising between landlord and tenant under the Act,” a
                    special land commission has been constituted, in which proceedings may be
                    commenced or to which if commenced in the civil bill court they may be
                    transferred. Three commissioners are named in the Act, and an indefinite number
                    of assistant commissioners is authorized. The land commission is vested with the
                    general powers of the Act; but it is directed to grant an appeal to the court of
                    appeal, in proper cases, not including decisions as to fair rent or other
                    matters left to the discretion of the commissioners. (E. R. )</p>
