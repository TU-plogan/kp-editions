                <p><label type="entry">LOIRE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Haute-</hi></label>, a department
                    of central France, made up of Velay and portions of Vivarais and Gévaudan, three
                    districts formerly belonging to the old province of Languedoc, of a portion of
                    Forez formerly belonging to Lyonnais, and of a portion of lower Auvergne, is
                    bounded on the N. by Puy de Dôme and Loire, on the E. by Loire and Ardèche, on
                    the S. by Ardèche and Lozère, and on the W. by Lozère and Cantal, and lies
                    between 44° 40' and 45° 25' N. lat. and between 3° 5' and 4° 30' E. long.,
                    having an extreme length of 68 miles, a maximum breadth of 54 miles, and an area
                    of 1916 miles. It belongs almost wholly to the Loire basin, but a few square
                    kilometres to the north of Mont Mézenc are drained by the Erieux, a tributary of
                    the Rhone. The highest point, Mont Mézenc, on the borders of Ardèche, is 5745
                    feet; it belongs to the Cévennes system, which sends ramifications throughout
                    the entire department, giving it a mean altitude of 2950 feet. Reckoning from
                    east to west are the Boutières, the Mégal or Meygal, the Velay hills, those of
                    La Margeride, and finally the Luguet. The first mentioned ridge separates
                    Haute-Loire from Ardèche, and ranges from 3280 to 4590 feet; it has a crust of
                    lava thrown out from Mont Mézenc; efforts towards replantation are being made.
                    Meygal presents a series of jagged peaks, recalling the Pyrenees on a small
                    scale. It also has been covered by an immense flow of lava some 37 miles long
                    and 490 feet thick, through which the Loire has forced a passage by means of
                    gorges more than 1600 feet in depth. The highest point of the Meygal properly so
                    called is upwards of 4590 feet. The Velay hills, which separate the Loire from
                    the Allier (mean height about 3300 feet), consist of granitic rocks overlaid
                    with the eruptions of more than one hundred and fifty craters, one of which <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0831-0808"/> is now occupied by the singular lake of
                    Bouchet. Westward from the Allier are the forest-clad granitic hills of La
                    Margeride, which rise to a height of nearly 5000 feet. The Luguet massif (3300
                    feet) rises in the north-west of the department on the left bank of the Alagnon,
                    a tributary of the Allier. The river Loire, to which the department owes its
                    name, enters at a point 16 miles distant from its source, and 2923 feet above
                    the level of the sea. Within the 63 miles of its course through the eastern
                    portion of the department, first in a northerly and afterwards in a
                    north-easterly direction, it falls 1565 feet. The Allier, which joins the Loire
                    at Nevers, traverses the western portion of Haute-Loire in a northerly
                    direction, entering at a point 25 miles distant from its source, and 2369 feet
                    above the sea; it traverses a narrow and deep valley overhung by lofty hills,
                    and falls 1090 feet. The chief affluents of the Loire within the limits of the
                    department are the Borne on the left, joining it near Buy, and the Lignon, which
                    descends from the Mézenc, between the Boutières and Meygal ranges, on the right.
                    The climate, owing to the altitude, the northward direction of the valleys, and
                    the winds from the Cevennes, is cold, the winters being long and rigorous.
                    Storms and violent rains are frequent on the higher grounds, and would give rise
                    to serious inundations were not the rivers for the most part confined within
                    deep rocky channels. Two-fifths of the area is occupied by arable lands,
                    one-fifth by natural meadow and by orchards, and a somewhat smaller proportion
                    by wood. The rest consists of pasture lands, vineyards, and uncultivated
                    lands.</p>
                <p>Numerous cattle of the celebrated Mézenc breed are reared, and also sheep and
                    mules. The crops raised are wheat, meslin, rye, barley, oats, maize, potatoes
                    (in large quantity), hemp, colza, and second-class wine. The woods yield pine,
                    fir, oak, and beech. Large quantities of aromatic and pharmaceutical plants are
                    found in the Mézenc massif. The department has two coal basins, —those of
                    Brassac and Langeac, both on the Allier; in 1880 their total output was 225,153
                    tons. Copper, iron, zinc, argentiferous lead, arsenic, antimony, barytes, and
                    fluor spar are also obtained, and there are good quarries of trachyte and
                    limestone, as well as numerous unutilized mineral springs. Lace-making in
                    various materials is the most extensive industry, occupying from 100,000 to
                    130,000 persons, and producing goods to the annual value of about £ 1,000,000.
                    Ribbons and cloth are manufactured to some extent, and silk-dressing,
                    wool-spinning, caoutchouc-making, various kinds of smith work, paper-making,
                    glass-blowing, brewing, wood-sawing, and flour-milling are also earned on. There
                    are three arrondissements—Puy, Bnoude, and Yssingeaux; the capital is Buy. The
                    population in 1876 was 313,721.</p>
