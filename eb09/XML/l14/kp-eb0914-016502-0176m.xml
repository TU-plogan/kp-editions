                <p><label type="entry">LABOUR <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi></label> LABOUR LAWS.
                    With some exceptions in the case of labour imposed as a punishment for crime or
                    as a test or condition of aid to the poor under the poor laws, the labour here
                    to be spoken of is labour by freemen,—that is to say, labour by persons having
                    the primary right to choose whether they will labour or not, and to choose the
                    terms on which they will consent to labour, if labour be their choice. Further,
                    although voluntary labour of men is undertaken from various motives,—for their
                    own profit, for self-preservation, for love, from public or private duty apart
                    from the prospect of immediate gain,—the labour now treated of relates
                    especially to that rendered to others for pecuniary reward, for money or money’s
                    worth,—in other words, for <hi rend="italic">wages.</hi> This class of persons
                    consists of all those who serve their employers by hand labour, whether rude or
                    skilled, in any branch of productive industry or manufacture, including
                    agriculture, mining, and the like, as well as the processes by which skilled
                    artisans elaborate raw material to its final destination and use. Purely
                    domestic service and the service of shopmen and clerks, as well as the work of
                    contractors for the service of others, who do not work with their own hands, is
                    excluded from specific notice here. The labourers falling within the class thus
                    popularly described comprise upwards of a moiety of the present adult male
                    population of the British Isles.</p>
                <p>Although this article deals with free labour, the present position of the free
                    labourer cannot be rightly understood without a glance at past history, and some
                    attention to the distinction between voluntary and forced labour.</p>
                <p>In every age and country, until times comparatively recent, compulsory personal
                    servitude appears to have been the lot of a large, perhaps the greater, portion
                    of mankind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“The simple
                    -wish to use the bodily powers of another person as a means of ministering to
                    one’s own ease or pleasure is doubtless the foundation of slavery, and as old as
                    human nature" (Maine).</p></note> The slave was a man who had been captured in
                    war or procured by purchase, or who had surrendered himself to the dominion of
                    another as the alternative of starvation or in discharge of a debt, and it was
                    his hands that tilled the soil, dug the mine, wove the cloth, and built the
                    walls in ancient Greece and Italy. It has been asserted that in the early state
                    of Rome the proportion of slaves, who were valued as property, was more
                    considerable than that of hired servants, who could be computed only as an
                    expense. It was thought more for the interest of the merchant or manufacturer to
                    purchase than to hire his workmen, and in the country slaves were employed as
                    the cheapest and most laborious instruments of agriculture. On the other hand,
                    it has been inferred from <hi rend="smallcaps">guγ</hi> scanty materials that,
                    as the Roman empire extended, the agricultural labourer and the citizen in
                    Spain, Gaul, and Britain, in Syria and Egypt, maintained himself, as in the
                    present day, by his own labour and that of his household, without the aid of any
                    slave; but this is probably too favourable a picture. In the decline of the
                    Roman empire, Roman captives were taken home by the northern conquerors. The
                    useful craftsmen—smiths, carpenters, workmen in the metals, shoemakers, tailors,
                    dyers, and others—employed their skill for the use or profit of their masters;
                    while those who were destitute of art but capable of labour were condemned,
                    without regard to their former rank, to tend the cattle and cultivate the lands
                    of the victors. This, however, was only turning the tables on the Romans, for
                    capture in war forms one of the principal sources of supply of slaves wherever
                    slavery exists.</p>
                <p>The Germans, in their primitive settlements, were accustomed to the notion of
                    slavery, incurred, not only by captivity, but by crimes, by debt, and the wager
                    of personal liberty in gaming. In the glimpses we get of the conditions of
                    labour elsewhere the same essential features are discernible. In the changes of
                    time and of geographical area of observation the harsher word slave may
                    disappear; yet the thing not only survived the introduction of Christianity but
                    was long regarded as not inconsistent with it, and was recognized as a national
                    institution in civilized Europe. Whether under the name of slavery or of
                    serfdom, or without either name, north, south, east, and west, an absolute
                    right, apart from contract, to earnings and to the person of the labourer was
                    accepted, if not openly vindicated. In looking at the present day at the
                    vestiges of man’s former and most permanent handiwork, it is instructive to
                    regard them with an eye to the distinctions between periods of forced and
                    voluntary labour. The pyramids of Egypt and the wall of China are monuments of
                    slave labour; and the same is the case with the classic remains at Athens and
                    Rome, so far at least as relates to the labour involved in the quarrying and
                    hewing of stone, and the making of bricks and placing them in position. As
                    regards Britain, our knowledge is too slight, and the conjectures as to the
                    origin and objects of such structures as Stonehenge and Avebury are too varied,
                    to allow of positive assertion; but it seems legitimate to conclude that the
                    labour was forced. British and Romau camps <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n177/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0177-0166"/> and earthworks for military purposes probably
                    exhibit the result of organized military labour combined with the forced labour
                    of the inhabitants of the district. In this aspect the fortresses and defences
                    destined for use consequent on the campaigns of a Caesar or a Napoleon, of an
                    Alexander or a Clive, do not materially differ. The remains still to be seen of
                    Agricola’s works on the line between the Firths of Clyde and Forth, as well as
                    of the Roman walls and roads throughout England, and the later but ruder
                    gigantic earth work of the Mercian king between England and Wales, may be
                    regarded as fruits of slave labour. The stupendous aqueducts of Roman brickwork
                    in various parts of southern Europe are naturally compared with the viaducts of
                    the present age. The comparison may well extend to the accompanying conditions
                    of labour.</p>
                <p>Passing over the general effect of serfdom throughout northern Europe, and of the
                    gradual manumission of toilers, as only a minute part of a very large subject,
                    and directing our attention to the conditions of ordinary daily labour in the
                    earliest period of the history of the British islands, we find it necessary to
                    classify labour in relation to its particular application.</p>
                <p>At the present day the most obvious natural distinction to be observed in this
                    connexion is that between the labour of the husbandman on the one hand and the
                    labour of the mechanic and artisan on the other, a distinction to some extent
                    parallel with a division into rural and urban labour. In an attempted division
                    of labour in this country recorded in writing, which, although not in its
                    present form earlier than the 15th century, and distorted by a fanciful notion
                    of adapting everything to triads, probably gives us a knowledge of a very
                    primitive people, the following divisions of labour are found:—(1) domestic art,
                    with its three primary branches—husbandry or cultivation of land, pastoral
                    cares, and weaving; and (2) mechanical arts—smith craft, carpentry, and
                    stone-masonry <hi rend="italic">(Ancient Laws, &lt;Lc., of Wales,</hi>
                    1841).</p>
                <p>The social status of these various labourers is a very difficult question. It
                    seems clear that the heads of departments of labour, although working for the
                    lord or chief, were freemen. The authority just cited expressly says that
                    smiths, stone-masons, and carpenters had equal privileges, and every one
                    following those trades was entitled, besides his maintenance and firing, to a
                    fixed measure of land for cultivation, independently of what he might have by
                    birthright. It is clear that there must have been subdivisions, as in the
                    present day, between craftsmen and labourers engaged in the same trade, as
                    between a mason and his labourer, between a ploughman and the driver of the
                    team, and between the shepherd responsible for the flock and the cowherd who
                    merely drove cattle to and from the pasture; a freeman might perform one branch
                    of duty and an absolute slave or serf another on the same land, and for the same
                    chief <hi rend="smallcaps">qγ</hi> head. It cannot be denied that slavery in the
                    strictest sense was an institution among the Saxons in England, and that in the
                    earliest English laws such slaves are found, but the true slave class was a
                    small one, and it has been doubted whether the labour of an ordinary serf was
                    practically more severe, or the remuneration in one form or another much less,
                    than that of an agricultural labourer in some parts of England at this day. On
                    the other hand, a fully qualified freeman might be a simple husbandman.</p>
                <p>Of the main conditions of labour at an early period in English towns we have no
                    details. With the gradual development of urban populations around the castle of
                    the lord, it is improbable that in any great number of cases the inhabitants
                    long continued in the condition of personal serfage. The city populations of
                    this island had not the habit and use of slavery. Serfs and oppressed labourers
                    from adjacent estates may have been glad to take refuge from taskmasters more
                    than ordinarily severe, but there is no doubt that freemen gradually united with
                    them under the lord’s protection, that strangers engaged in trade sojourned
                    among them, and that a race of artisans gradually grew up in which original
                    class feelings were greatly modified. From these and other causes the
                    distinctions between agricultural labourers and mechanics and artisans grew and
                    became permanent.</p>
                <p>Proceeding to notice the legislation of England on the subject of labour, we
                    observe, in passing, that the provisions of Magna Charta were not in the
                    interests of labour. The stipulations against the forced building of new bridges
                    and embankments, and for removing all weirs in rivers, were not by way of
                    protest against involuntary labour, but in relief of a higher class. Direct
                    legislation on labour dates as far back as the twenty-third year of the reign of
                    Edward III., when the first Statute of Labourers was passed. The population had
                    been much reduced by pestilence, and the demand for labour naturally led working
                    classes to insist on higher wages, and there were “some rather willing to beg in
                    idleness than by labour to get their living.” The statute reciting these facts,
                    and the “lusts especially of ploughmen and such labourers,” enacted that “every
                    man and woman of our realm of England, of what condition he be, free or bond,
                    able in body, and within the age of threescore years, not living in merchandise,
                    nor exercising any craft, not having of his own whereof to live, nor land about
                    whose tillage he might employ himself, nor serving any other,” should be bound
                    to serve if he is in convenient service, his estate considered, at the wages
                    accustomed to be given in the twentieth year of that reign, or five or six years
                    before. If he refused, he was to be committed to jail till he found surety to
                    enter into the service. No persons were to pay more than the old wages, upon
                    pain of forfeiting double what they paid. If the lords of the towns or manors
                    presumed to infringe the law, they were to be sued for treble the sum paid or
                    promised by them or their servants. Artificers and workmen were put under the
                    same restrictions, upon pain of imprisonment for taking more. This statute is
                    remarkable as the first in which any notice occurs of the free labourer for
                    hire, for the necessity of a statute to force him to work at fixed wages
                    recognizes his otherwise free state.</p>
                <p>A statute passed two years later (25 Edward III.), reciting that the earlier
                    ordinance was disobeyed, contained minute regulations as to wages. If labourers
                    or artificers left their work and went into another county, process was to be
                    issued to the sheriff to arrest and bring them back. In 1360 (34 Edward III.)
                    the former Statute of Labourers was confirmed, except that labourers were not to
                    be punished by fine and ransom. Instead thereof, the lords of towns <hi
                    rend="italic">(seigneurs</hi><hi rend="italic">des villes)</hi> might take and
                    imprison them for fifteen days if they would not do as required by law, and then
                    send them to the next jail, “there to abide without bail till they will do so
                    according to the statute.” The statute enacted that “all alliances and covins of
                    masons and carpenters, and congregations, chapters, ordinances, and oaths
                    betwixt them made, or to be made, shall from henceforth be void and wholly
                    annulled, so that every mason and carpenter, of what condition soever he be,
                    shall be compelled by his master to whom he serveth to do every work that to him
                    pertaineth to do, either of free stone or of rough stone, and also every
                    carpenter in his degree. But it shall be lawful to every lord or other to
                    bargain and covenant for their works in gross with such labourers and artificers
                    when it pleaseth them, so that they perform such works well and lawfully,
                    according to the bargain and covenant with them thereof made.” A workman
                    absenting himself from his service, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n178/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0178-0167"/> and going to another town or county, was to be
                    proceeded against under the previous statute, to outlawry, to be followed by
                    imprisonment till he did as required by law, and made satisfaction to the party;
                    nevertheless he was to be burnt in the forehead with the letter F, “in token of
                    the falsity,” if the party aggrieved so required, and if the justices should so
                    advise. Eight years later, in the same reign (1368,42 Edward HL), the statute
                    and ordinance concerning labourers was confirmed, and commissions directed to
                    justices to hear and determine matters concerning it.</p>
                <p>Indubitable records still exist, proving that before the passing of those
                    statutes, and down to the 15th century, workmen of various descriptions were
                    pressed by writs addressed to sheriffs to work for their king at wages,
                    regardless of their will as to the terms and place of work. Diggers and hewers
                    of stone, masons, and carpenters, as well as ordinary labourers, were so
                    impressed, and by services thus obtained the buildings at Windsor for the
                    Knights of the Round Table, on the institution of the order of the Garter, were
                    erected. In this case the sheriffs were commanded to take security from the
                    workmen not to depart from Windsor without the permission of William of Wykeham,
                    the king’s surveyor. Notwithstanding these precautions, many workmen, so
                    impressed, secretly left, in order to work for other persons at higher wages,
                    and writs were directed to the sheriffs of London, commanding them to make
                    proclamation prohibiting any person from employing or retaining any of the
                    workmen on pain of forfeiting all their goods, and, as regards the workmen,
                    commanding their arrest and imprisonment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These proceedings were no doubt founded on notions of the
                    royal prerogative, of which the impressment of seamen affords a more recent
                    illustration. This forcing men to work for the king at low wages may he
                    contrasted with proceedings within the present reign. Workmen employed in
                    building the Queen’s Palace at Westminster (the Houses of Parliament) struck for
                    wages in the winter of 1841, and, having nothing to do, availed themselves of
                    vacant seats in the Court of Queen’s Bench, where her Majesty was constructively
                    present. Here they were seen from day to day enjoying the comfortable
                    temperature, undisturbed by any fear of writs or other compulsory process to
                    force them to return to their work.</p></note></p>
                <p>An Act was passed in the reign of Richard II. (1388, 12 Richard II.) by which no
                    servant or labourer, whether man or woman, could depart out of the hundred to
                    serve elsewhere, unless bearing a letter patent under the king’s seal,
                    expressing the cause of going and the time of return. Wages were fixed in a way
                    that shows the classification of agricultural labour. The “bailiff for
                    husbandry” stands first. The “master hine,” the carter, and the shepherd are on
                    an equality; the ploughman follows; after him the oxherd and cowherd, then the
                    swineherd, the dairymaid and other women receiving equal wages, and every other
                    labourer and servant according to his degree; no servant of artificers is to
                    take more than the servants and labourers above named after their estate. The
                    givers and takers forfeited the excess, or double or treble if attainted before;
                    “and, if the taker so attainted have nothing whereof to pay the said excess, he
                    shall have forty days imprisonment.” This was followed by a remarkable clause:
                    “also it is ordained and assented that he or she which useth to labour at the
                    plough and cart, or other labour or service of husbandry, till they be of the
                    age of twelve years, shall from thenceforth abide at the said labour, without
                    being put to any trade or handicraft; and, if any covenant or bond of
                    apprenticeship be from henceforth made to the contrary, the same shall be holden
                    for none.” By a statute of the following year (13 Richard II.), the justices
                    were to settle and proclaim between Easter and Michaelmas what should be the
                    wages of day labourers.</p>
                <p>Early in the 15th century we have a glimpse of something beyond this continued
                    legislation interfering with freedom of labour, in a reservation in favour of
                    children being sent to school. An Act of 7 Henry IV., putting a property
                    qualification on apprenticeship and requiring children to be put to such labour
                    as their fathers or mothers are of, or as their estates require, on penalty of
                    one year’s imprisonment, fine, and ransom, and of one hundred shillings for
                    receiving such apprentices, has this sentence: “But any person may send their
                    children to school to learn literature.” Labourers and artificers are to be
                    sworn to observe the statutes in force or be put in the stocks, and a penalty is
                    imposed on towns neglecting to have stocks. In 1414, by a statute (2 Henry V.)
                    reciting that the servants and labourers of the shires of the realm flee from
                    county to county because they would not conform to the law, and because the law
                    was not put in force in every county, the former Acts were confirmed and
                    directed to be put in force and proclaimed by the sheriff. Justices of the peace
                    were empowered to send writs to the sheriffs for fugitive labourers in like
                    manner as the justices have power to send to every sheriff for the felons or
                    thieves before they are indicted, and to examine all kinds of labourers,
                    servants, and their masters as well as artificers, and to punish them upon
                    confession in accordance with the statutes.</p>
                <p>Early in the following reign (2 Henry VI., 1423) further power was given to
                    justices to compel by process an appearance before them of masters as well as
                    servants for examination as to the execution of the statute of Henry V., and to
                    give offenders a month’s imprisonment. Four years later (1427) the conclusion
                    was drawn that the statutes of Richard II. were faulty,—that of 12 Richard II.
                    because it was too hard upon the masters, that of 13 Richard II. because no
                    penalty was attached to its breach; and, besides remedying the defects, it was
                    enacted (6 Henry VI. c. 3) that justices should fix and make proclamation of
                    wages. Two years earlier (1425) legislation had been directed against meetings
                    of masons. The statute 3 Henry VI. c. 1 recites that, “by the annual
                    congregations and confederacies made by masons in their general chapters
                    assembled, the good courses and effect of the Statutes of Labourers are publicly
                    violated and broken, in subversion of the law, and grievous damage of all the
                    commonalty”; and such chapters and congregations were forbidden. It was made
                    felony to cause them to be assembled and held, and masons attending them were to
                    be punished by imprisonment and fine. In 1444 (23 Henry VI.) a scale of wages in
                    agriculture and trade was fixed (including freemasons and “rough” masons, master
                    carpenters and mesne carpenters, and master tilers and slaters), and a servant
                    in husbandry was required before departing to give half a year’s warning or else
                    to serve his master the year following. Persons refusing to serve or labour were
                    to be committed to jail, there to remain until they found sufficient surety to
                    serve, and masters were entitled to a fixed fine on such.</p>
                <p>A statute towards the close of the 15th century (1495, 11 Henry VII.) referring
                    to previous statutes, especially to the 23 Henry VI., and complaining of their
                    inadequacy or imperfect execution, proceeds to fix the wages of artificers and
                    labourers with great minuteness. This Act contained a remarkable clause against
                    unlawful conspiracy by workmen engaged in building; if such artificers or
                    labourers “make or cause to be made any assembly to assault, harm, or hurt any
                    person assigned to control and oversee them in their working, that he or they so
                    offending have imprisonment for a year without letting to bail or mainprise, and
                    further to make fine at the king’s will.” It is not surprising that even with so
                    very limited <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n179/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0179-0168"/> knowledge of principles a short time sufficed to
                    show how ineffectual minute legislation was to control wages. The statute was
                    repealed in the following year, “for divers and many reasonable considerations
                    and causes, the king’s highness moving, and for the common wealth of the poor
                    artificers, as freemasons, carpenters, and other persons necessary and
                    convenient for the reparations and buildings, and other labourers and servants
                    of husbandry.” But what is surprising is that (although the first legislation of
                    the 16th century was in favour of masters<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In 1512 (4 Hen. VIII.) the penalties for giving of wages
                    contrary to the statute 12 Rich. II. were repealed so far and only so far as
                    relates to the masters.</p></note>) we find in 1514 a statute regulating wages
                    and hours of work and even the summer day sleep of artificers and labourers, and
                    in fact a re-enactment of the law of 1495.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Miners and workers for tin, lead, iron, or silver, colliers
                    for sea coal, and glass makers were excepted.</p></note> The London workmen
                    could not endure this restriction as to wages, and in the following year were
                    allowed to take the previous rate when working within the city or its liberties;
                    the king’s works were, however, excepted.</p>
                <p>At this point it is necessary to refer to the provisions made against vagrancy in
                    the 16th century, these being closely connected with compulsory labour. The
                    great social revolution caused by the suppression of the monasteries, and by the
                    consequent withdrawal of the support which those institutions afforded to the
                    indigent, and too often to the idle, had led to the dispersion over the face of
                    the country of a multitude of beggars, many of whom were able to work but
                    preferred idleness, often adding theft and robbery to mendicancy. Under these
                    circumstances harsh and cruel statutes were passed in the reigns of Henry VIII.,
                    Edward VL, and Elizabeth.</p>
                <p>In 1530 (22 Henry VIII.) any person, being whole and mighty in body and able to
                    labour, found begging or being vagrant, and giving no satisfactory account how
                    he lawfully obtained his living, might be arrested by a constable, and a justice
                    might, in his discretion, cause every such idle person to be taken to the
                    nearest town and there tied to the end of a cart naked, and to be beaten with
                    whips throughout the town “till his body be bloody by reason of such whipping.”
                    He was then required to take an oath to return to his home “and put himself to
                    labour as a true man ought to do.” The whipping was to be repeated as often as
                    he made default; but five years later the punishment for “rufflers, sturdy
                    vagabonds, and valiant beggars” persisting in not working after a whipping was
                    increased to having the upper part of the gristle of his right ear clean cut
                    off. If still persistent he was to be tried, and executed as a felon.</p>
                <p>On the accession of Edward VI. a law was passed by which a serving man wanting a
                    master, or loitering or wandering, and not applying himself to honest labour,
                    might on conviction be marked with the letter V, and adjudged to be the slave
                    for two years of the person buying him, giving him only bread and water or small
                    drink, and such refuse of meat as the master should think fit, and causing him
                    to work by beating, chaining, or otherwise. If he ran away he might not only be
                    punished by his master in the same way, but the justices, on conviction, were to
                    have him marked on the forehead or ball of the cheek with an hot iron with the
                    letter S, and adjudge him to be the master’s slave for life. If he again ran
                    away the offence became felony, and he was to suffer the pains of death “as
                    other felons ought to do.” Any child of a vagabond, above the age of five and
                    under fourteen, might be adjudged the servant or apprentice of any person
                    willing to take it until the age of twenty-four if a male and twenty if a
                    female; if it ran away slavery followed for life. The master might put a ring of
                    iron about the neck, arm, or leg of his slave to prevent his running away, with
                    a penalty on any person helping him to take it off, and if the slave resisted
                    correction he was to be executed as a felon. The slave might be sold or devised
                    by will as other goods and chattels. This statute was repealed three years
                    after, but it remains on the rolls of parliament, and nothing can obliterate the
                    fact and the consequent disgrace attaching for all time to the parliament that
                    could pass such a law, and to the country that could endure it for a day. This
                    réintroduction of slavery in England by name, and in its worst form, is
                    memorable, and serves to mark the alteration of opinion and feeling that has
                    since taken place, much more than any contrast between freedom of labour and
                    wages in the sense of the political economist.</p>
                <p>Early in the reign of Elizabeth (5 Elizabeth, 1562) the statute commonly called
                    “the Statute of Labourers” repealed all former statutes relating to labourers in
                    husbandry and artificers or labourers engaged in particular trades, and
                    consolidated and amended many former provisions. Its chief object was to provide
                    a new rate of wages, and, in addition, to regulate in many respects the terms of
                    employment as between the employer and the employed. This Act admits that the
                    wages laid down by former statutes are in divers places too small in view of the
                    general rise of prices, but approves of the principle and aims of previous
                    legislation, the substance of which it seeks to digest into a single statute.
                    The statute draws a main distinction between artificers and labourers in
                    husbandry. The former may not be hired for a less term than a year, and any
                    unemployed person brought up in a craft or who had practised it for more than
                    three years was bound, on pain of imprisonment, to accept service if required
                    “by any person using the art or mystery wherein he has been exercised,” unless
                    he had a farm in tillage, an estate worth 40 shillings a year, or goods to the
                    yearly value of £10. Similar provision was made in respect of service in
                    husbandry. Every person between the ages of twelve and sixty was in like manner
                    bound to serve in husbandry unless possessed of property of specified amount, or
                    employed as a fisherman or mariner, or in mining, or in any of the arts or
                    sciences previously mentioned, or unless born a gentleman, or unless a member of
                    a university or school. Minute regulations were made with reference to the
                    rights and obligations both of master and servant. No person retained in
                    husbandry or trade was to go out of the county or shire where he last served, to
                    serve in any other, without a testimonial. No person leaving his service could
                    be taken into another without showing such testimonial to the authorities of the
                    place in which he was about to serve. If he broke this regulation he was to be
                    imprisoned till he could procure a testimonial, and unless he did so within
                    twenty-one days he was to be whipped. Every person retaining a servant without
                    the latter showing such testimonial forfeited &lt;£5. Besides empowering
                    justices in session to make a rate of wages, the statute fixed with great
                    minuteness the hours of labour. In the time of harvest, justices or constables
                    or other head officers might require artificers and persons meet for labour to
                    serve by the day in mowing, reaping, shearing, getting, or turning of corn,
                    grain, or hay, according to the skill and quality of the person, and upon
                    refusal might put him in the stocks for two days and a night. Even single women
                    between the ages of twelve and forty might be compelled to serve in such
                    employment as the justices might direct, under pain of imprisonment. Amended
                    provision was made towards the close of the reign for justices yearly fixing the
                    rate of wages.</p>
                <p>It will be seen by the preceding summary how great <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n180/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0180-0169"/> were the restraints still placed by the
                    legislature on the free action of labour. After this mass of unwholesome
                    legislation it is instructive to notice the state of the labouring classes in
                    England in the 16th century, as recorded by Harrison. After dividing English
                    people into four sorts— gentlemen, citizens or burgesses, yeomen, and artificers
                    and labourers—and describing the first three classes, he says :—</p>
                <p>“The fourth and. last sort of people in England are day labourers, poor
                    husbandmen, and some retailers (which have no free land), copyholders, and all
                    artificers, as tailors, shoemakers, carpenters, brickmakers, masons, &amp;e. As
                    for slaves and bondmen, we have none; nay, such is the privilege of our country,
                    by the especial grace of God and bounty of our princes, that, if any come hither
                    from other realms, so soon as they set foot on land they become so free of
                    condition as their masters. . . . This fourth and last sort of people have
                    neither voice nor authority in the common wealth, but are to be ruled, and not
                    to rule others; yet they are not altogether neglected, for in cities and
                    corporate towns, for default of yeomen, they are fain to make up their inquests
                    of such manner of people, and in villages they are commonly made churchwardens,
                    sidemen, ale conners, now and then constables, and many timesenjoy the name of
                    headboroughs. Unto this sort also may our great swarms of idle serving-men be
                    referred, of whom there runneth a proverb, Young serving-men, old beggars,
                    because service is none heritage. . . . This, furthermore, among other things I
                    have to say of our husbandmen and artificers, that they were never so excellent
                    in their trades as at this present. But, as the workmanship of the latter sort
                    was never more fine and curious to the eye, so was it never less strong and
                    substantial for continuance and benefit of the buyers. Neither is there anything
                    that hurteth the common sort of our artificers more than haste, and a barbarous
                    or slavish desire to turn the penny, and by ridding tl’eir work to make speedy
                    utterance of their wares; which enforceth them to bungle up and despatch many
                    things they care not how so they be out of their hands, whereby the buyer is
                    often sore defrauded, and findeth to his cost that haste maketh waste, according
                    to the proverb. Oh, how many traders and handicrafts are now in England whereof
                    the commonwealth hath no need! How many needful commodities have we which are
                    perfected with great cost, &amp;c., and yet may with far more ease and less cost
                    be provided from other countries if we could use the means! I will not speak of
                    iron, glass, and such like, which spoil much wood, and yet arc brought from
                    other countries better cheap than we can make them here at home. I could
                    exemplify also in many others.”</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding compulsory legislation, and the forcing of labour for the
                    sovereign already noticed, it is evident that the condition of the labourer,
                    even when employed on royal property, was undergoing amelioration. In a
                    remarkable but apparently unpublished letter of Humphrey Mitchell, surveyor of
                    the queen’s works at Windsor (and for some time member of parliament for that
                    borough), to Lord Burghley, written in 1575, he says—“At my first entry into
                    this charge I could scarce get workmen by commission; since, with monthly ‘
                    payes,’ impressing through the mayor those contumacious in work, rewarding the
                    diligent, and thrusting out the evil where I perceive them loitering, I hive
                    brought them into such an obedience and a desire to work here that where I have
                    one I can have twenty to serve her Majesty; and when at the first entry into the
                    works, they had their breakfast at eight of the clock in the morning, and
                    drinking at three in the afternoon, I have taken that idle custom from them, and
                    have only allowed them two hours at noon, and, as necessity serveth, sometimes
                    but one, with their contentation; and for that also I would have them they must
                    know their duty, I bring them to the lecture at the college [Windsor] twice
                    every week, losing no hour’s work thereby, for those days they rest at twelve. I
                    suffer not a swearer nor filthy talker in the works to my knowledge, by all
                    which means I think her Majesty hath her work done as diligently as any other
                    private man hath.”</p>
                <p>Light is thrown on the arrangement of hours by a clause in the above-mentioned
                    Statute of Labourers of the fifth year of the Queen’s reign. It enacted
                    that—</p>
                <p>“All artificers and labourers being hired for wages by the day or week shall,
                    betwixt the midst of the months of March and September, be and continue at their
                    work at or before five of the clock in the morning, and continue at work and not
                    depart until betwixt seven and eight o clock at night (except it be ιu the time
                    of breakfast, dinner, or drinking), the which time at the most shall nut exceed
                    above two hours and a half in a day, that is to say, at every drinking one half
                    hour, for his dinner one hour, and for his sleep when he is allowed to sleep,
                    the which is from the midst of May to the midst of August, half an hour at the
                    most, and at every breakfast one half hour; and all the said artificers and
                    labourera betwixt the midst of September and the midst of March shall be and
                    continue at their work from the spring of the day in the morning until the night
                    of the same day, except it be in time afore appointed for breakfast and dinner,
                    upon pain to lose and forfeit one penny for every hour’s absence, to be deducted
                    and de-faulked out of his wages that shall so offend.”</p>
                <p>In the first parliament after the accession of James an attempt made towards the
                    close of the previous reign to enforce the rating of wages and the payment of
                    the rated amounts was renewed. The Act recites, in the same terms as were used
                    only two years before, that the Act of 1562 “hath not, according to the true
                    meaning thereof, been duly put in execution,” and, in order to remove a doubt as
                    to the application of the principle of assessing wages, expressly extends it “to
                    rate wages of any labourers, weavers, spinsters, or workmen whatsoever, either
                    working by the day, week, month, year, or taking any work at any person or
                    persons’ hand whatsoever, to be done in great or otherwise.” The giving or
                    receiving mere or less than the proclaimed price was expressly declared to be an
                    offence.</p>
                <p>In Scotland we find complaints in the 16th century by masters of salt-pans of the
                    great rise in wages, and early in the 17th century (1617) justices were directed
                    to fix at quarter sessions the ordinary rate of hire and wages of workmen,
                    labourers, and servants, and to imprison those who refused to serve for the
                    appointed hire. At the same time, “that servants may be the more willing to obey
                    the ordinance,” power was given to the justices to compel payment of wages. This
                    law was re-enacted in 1661. Some years previously (1606) any one hiring a
                    collier or salter without a sufficient testimonial from his last master was
                    compelled to deliver him up if demanded; and colliers and salters were empowered
                    to apprehend vagabonds and sturdy beggars and force them to labour. In 1621, in
                    consequence of “the great straits and necessities that the poor labourers of the
                    ground” were driven to by the “fraud and malice” of s3rvants who either refused
                    to be hired without the promise of great wages, or else hired themselves from
                    Martinmas to Whitsunday, then “casting them loose” on purpose to make their gain
                    and advantage by extraordinary works, such as casting and winning peats or
                    turfs, building fold dykes, and shearing in the harvest, hired servants were
                    forbidden to leave unless upon proof to a justice of the peace that they were
                    hired to another. If it was found that a servant was not so hired, his master
                    was empowered to detain him at the previous rate of wages. Power was given to
                    apprehend a servant “who broke loose,” and to deliver him to a constable or
                    justice, and a power to all persons to apprehend loose and masterless men and
                    women found within their own bounds; and the justices and constables were
                    empowered to compel them to serve for competent hire and wages. Twenty years
                    later servants in manufactories were compelled to work at reasonable rates, and
                    not to hire without their previous master’s consent. Houses of correction were
                    erected for disobedient servants, and in 1672 masters of correction houses were
                    empowered to receive such servants and to force them to work, and to correct
                    them according to their demerits. These later laws of Scotland were accompanied
                    by others directed against vagrancy.</p>
                <p>Passing over legislation which either affected only particular trades (although
                    denoting the growth of manufacturing industry), or related rather to the poor
                    laws than <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n181/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0181-0170"/> directly to the subject of this article, and
                    arriving at the middle of the 18th century, we find the legislature no longer
                    employed in compelling labourers or artisans to enter into involuntary service,
                    but regulating the summary jurisdiction of justices in the matter of disputes
                    between employers and employed, in relation to contracts and agreements, express
                    or implied, presumed to have been entered into voluntarily on both sides.</p>
                <p>The statute 20 Geo. II. c. 19 (passed in 1746) provided that all complaints,
                    differences, and disputes arising between masters and servants in husbandry
                    hired for one year or longer (extended by a subsequent statute of the same reign
                    to those hired for less than a year), or arising between masters and artificers,
                    handicraftsmen, and miners (applied in 1829 to labourers of every sort), were to
                    be determined by one or more justices, who, upon complaint of the servant, might
                    determine any dispute as to wages and order payment of any sum found to be due,
                    not exceeding £10 in case of a servant in husbandry, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >£5</hi> in case of artificers and other labourers, and, in the event of
                    non-payment, might levy the same by distress on the goods of the master. In case
                    of complaint by the master, the authority of the justice was still larger. He
                    had power to entertain a complaint of “any misdemeanour, miscarriage, or ill
                    behaviour of the servant in his or her service or employment,” and to hear,
                    examine, and determine the same. If the decision was adverse to the servant, the
                    justice might either abate some part of the wages due to such servant, or
                    discharge him from the service, or he might punish the offender by committing
                    him to the house of correction, “there to be corrected,” which term was held to
                    mean correction by whipping and holding to hard labour for a reasonable time,
                    not exceeding a month.</p>
                <p>A statute of 1823 (4 Geo. IV. c. 34), the next general statute on this subject,
                    took a somewhat wider scope, dealing with breaches of contract on the part of
                    the servant in not entering into the agreed service at all, as well as in
                    quitting it before the term agreed on had expired, and subjecting these breaches
                    as well as any misdemeanour or misconduct while in the service to the
                    jurisdiction of the justice, who might adjudge the offender to be imprisoned in
                    the house of correction for a term not exceeding three months (but without any
                    power to order corporal punishment), abating a proportional part of his wages in
                    the future, or adjudging him to lose the whole or part of his wages already
                    earned; or, he might dismiss him from the service.</p>
                <p>Thus stood the statute law until 1867. In consequence of considerable
                    dissatisfaction on the part of workmen with the adjudication of justices, a
                    select committee of the House of Commons was appointed in the previous year to
                    inquire into the state of the law as regards contracts of service between master
                    and servant, and as to the expediency of amending it. That committee
                    reported—</p>
                <p>1. That the law as it then existed was objectionable.</p>
                <p>2. That all cases arising under the law of master and servant should be publicly
                    tried in England and Ireland before two or more magistrates, or before a
                    stipendiary magistrate, and in Scotland before two or more magistrates, or the
                    sheriff.</p>
                <p>3. That procedure should be by summons in England and Ireland, and warrant to
                    cite in Scotland, and, failing appearance of defendant in answer to summons or
                    citation, the court should have power to grant warrant to apprehend.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi> 4. That punishment should be by fine, and failing
                    payment by distress or imprisonment.</p>
                <p>5. That the court should have power when such a course is deemed advisable to
                    order the defendant to fulfil the contract, and also, if necessary, to compel
                    him to find security that he will do so.</p>
                <p>6. That in aggravated cases of breach of contract, causing injury to person or
                    property, the magistrate or sheriff should have the power of awarding punishment
                    by imprisonment instead of fine.</p>
                <p>7. That the arrest of wages in Scotland in payment of fines should be
                    abolished.</p>
                <p>The Master and Servant Act 1867, sometimes called Lord Elcho’s Act, was framed
                    upon the report of the committee, and embodied most of the recommendations. As
                    regards simple breaches of contract, the position of servants was considerably
                    improved. Imprisonment, which, under the former Acts, the magistrate was
                    authorized to impose in the first instance as a punishment for a breach of the
                    contract, was taken away, except as auxiliary to the jurisdiction, as the
                    consequence of disobedience to the order of the court; and wherever imprisonment
                    might, under the former Acts, have been accompanied by hard labour, the power to
                    order hard labour was taken away. Lord Elcho’s Act did not, however, remove the
                    dissatisfaction felt on the part of workmen, and the events of a few years
                    rendered it desirable to reconsider the whole law, with reference not only to
                    breaches of contract but to other special legislation of a criminal kind, and to
                    the general law of conspiracy affecting the relation of employer and
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Commissioners reported in 1875 recommending, so far as relates to the scope of
                    this article, that the proceedings should be altogether divested of a penal
                    character and assume that of a civil proceeding for specific performance or
                    recovery of damages, and that, to effect the main object, Lord Elcho’s Act
                    should be amended or a new Act framed in clearer language. Within a few months
                    of the presentation of the report, Mr Cross, then secretary of state, introduced
                    two bills, the one an “Employers and Workmen Bill, <hi rend="italic">” and</hi>
                    the other a “Conspiracy and Protection of Property Bill,” and these bills, after
                    undergoing considerable discussion and alteration in their different stages,
                    were passed and came into operation on the 1st September 1875. This article only
                    deals with the former Act. While carrying out the recommendation of the
                    commissioners regarding Lord Elcho ⅛ Act, and placing all provisions of a penal
                    character in a separate Act (“Conspiracy and Protection of Property ”), the
                    legislature thought fit to go further and take away the right of enforcing
                    performance of contracts of labour (although that is a very important branch of
                    civil procedure in relation to various matters of contract), and make it a mere
                    question of recovery of damages, unless both parties agree that security for
                    performance of the contract shall be given instead of damages. Adjudication can
                    be by courts of summary jurisdiction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In England such courts are a police or stipendiary
                    magistrate, or, where there is no such magistrate, two or more justices sitting
                    at some place appointed for holding petty sessions, or, in the city of London,
                    the lord mayor or an aiderman sitting at the Mansion House or Guildhall. In
                    Scotland the court of summary jurisdiction is the small debt court of the
                    sheriff of the county. In Ireland the court is constituted of one or more of the
                    divisional justices of the police district of Dublin metropolis, and elsewhere
                    in Ireland of two or more justices of the peace in petty sessions, sitting at a
                    place appointed for holding petty sessions. These courts are, for the purposes
                    of the Act, civil courts.</p></note></p>
                <p>Neither this Act nor its predecessor takes away the right of parties to sue in
                    the ordinary civil tribunals of the country; but the Act puts county courts (in
                    Scotland the ordinary sheriff court of the county, in Ireland the civil bill
                    court) practically on the same footing with courts of summary jurisdiction,—the
                    jurisdiction of magistrates being simply because the county courts in most
                    places do not sit sufficiently often for the practical adjudication of these
                    differences. The title of the Act, “to enlarge the powers of county courts in
                    respect of disputes between employers and workmen, and to give other courts a
                    limited civil jurisdiction in respect of such disputes,” indicates its general
                    scope, which is borne out by its provisions. It <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n182/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0182-0171"/> extends to “any dispute between an employer and a
                    workman arising out of or incidental to their relation as such.” The expression
                    “workman” does not include a domestic or menial servant, but means any person
                    who, being a labourer, servant in husbandry, journeyman, artificer,
                    handicraftsman, miner, or otherwise engaged in manual labour, whether under the
                    age of twenty-one years or above that age, has entered into or works under a
                    contract with an employer, whether the contract be made before or after the
                    passing of the Act, be express or implied, oral or in writing, and be a contract
                    of service or a contract personally to execute any work or labour. Payment of
                    damages and debts under the Act, as in other cases of judgment debts, is
                    enforceable by imprisonment for a term not exceeding six weeks, only on proof of
                    ability and neglect to pay, whether the proceedings be in the county court or in
                    the court of summary jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>Two circumstances show the rapid strides made in a few years in the position of
                    labour in relation to legislation. Lord Elcho’s Act in 1867 received the title
                    of “The Master and Servant Act.” In eight years that title is silently dropped,
                    and “Employers and Workmen” substituted. In 1867 the prime minister spoke in
                    high terms of eulogy of Lord Elcho’s Act as securing valuable rights for
                    workmen. In 1875 the same prime minister, speaking a few weeks after the passing
                    of the Act of that year, remarked that for the first time in the history of the
                    country the employer and employed sat under equal laws.</p>
                <p>Although the general tendency of colonial legislation is to follow that of the
                    parent country, where it can be applied, that is not the case in some important
                    British colonies in relation to the enforcement of labour contracts.</p>
                <p>In New South Wales, servants, including artificers, journeymen, and
                    handicraftsmen, and all agricultural labourers, as well as domestic servants,
                    are dealt with under a colonial Act of 1857. For not fulfilling a contract,
                    whether by deserting or not entering upon the service, or for other misconduct
                    or ill behaviour, justices upon conviction may impose a fine not exceeding £10.
                    In default of distress, imprisonment, not exceeding fourteen days, or forfeiture
                    of wages then due may follow. Obtaining advances of money after entering into a
                    contract and refusing to go to the place of service, or refusing to perform work
                    to the extent of the advance without reasonable cause, is punishable by direct
                    imprisonment with or without hard labour for any term not exceeding three
                    months. Persons knowingly concealing or employing absconding or absenting
                    servants or persuading them to violate agreements are liable to a penalty not
                    exceeding £10, and in default imprisonment for fourteen days. On the other hand
                    wages not exceeding £50 and full costs may be recovered by distress, and in
                    default imprisonment for fourteen days; masters are also liable to a penalty for
                    withholding property of their servants. Independently of these provisions,
                    justices may hear and determine in a summary manner any complaint, difference,
                    or dispute between a servant and his master, and the award may be enforced by
                    cancelling an agreement or imposing a fine, and in default of distress by
                    imprisonment not exceeding fourteen days. The power of imprisonment under the
                    Act does not extend to women.</p>
                <p>In South Australia, by an Act of 1878 (following in the main the tenor of Lord
                    Elcho’s Act, rather than the legislation of 1875), whenever the employer or
                    employed neglects or refuses to fulfil any contract, or the employed neglects or
                    refuses to enter or continue his service or absents himself, or whenever any
                    dispute arises between the parties, the case may be summarily decided by
                    justices, who may order an abatement of wages due, or direct the fulfilment of
                    the contract, with a direction to the party complained against to find security
                    by recognizance or bond with or without sureties; or the contract may be
                    annulled and the amount of wages or compensation apportioned; or, where
                    pecuniary compensation will not, in the opinion of the justices, meet the
                    circumstances of the case, they may impose a fine not exceeding £20. The neglect
                    or refusal to find security for performance of contract may be enforced by
                    imprisonment not exceeding three months.</p>
                <p>The Victorian statutes relating to master and servant were consolidated in 1864.
                    Under that Act all agricultural and other labourers and workmen and artisans, as
                    well as domestic servants, were made liable on summary conviction to
                    imprisonment not exceeding three months, or abatement of wages, for breaches of
                    contract or for disobedience or other misconduct or misdemeanour. The like
                    imprisonment was provided for obtaining advances of wages and refusing to serve,
                    and also for wilful or negligent acts involving a destruction of work or
                    materials committed to the <hi rend="smallcaps">xhλλ</hi> w <hi

                    Wages and amends for ill-treatment were made recoverable by order.</p>
                <p>It is impossible within the limits of this article to follow the αιiterent
                    provisions in various colonies affecting the relation of employer and employed.
                    To render a summary of practical value, local peculiarities and exegencies must
                    be borne in mind. Where native or foreign races form a material part of the
                    industrial population, or where changes have occurred in their condition, the
                    facts must be taken into account; for example, the legislation of Jamaica,
                    although now constituted an ordinary British colony, must be considered in
                    relation to the former existence of slavery and to the intermediate status of
                    apprenticeship before its abolition. So in British Guiana, the large number of
                    emigrants from the East Indies, many of them working on the estates under
                    indentures, must not be lost sight of.</p>
                <p>With regard to India, that vast area cannot be dealt with as if the industrial
                    population consisted of Europeans, manufacturing in its cities. Although natives
                    are increasingly sharing in the labour and ownership involved in the production
                    of manufactures, the cultivation of the soil forms the basis of the support of
                    two-thirds of the population. The true view of India is that as a whole it is
                    divided into a vast number of independent self-acting organized groups,
                    cultivating, trading, and manufacturing, governed by law made up to a great
                    extent of local usages and customs, and where caste is often merely a name for
                    trade or occupation,—the village communities comprising families who are
                    hereditary weavers, potters, blacksmiths, harness makers, and so forth.</p>
                <p>The condition of the law in European states at the present time with regard to
                    the enforcement of labour contracts is this. In France contracts of work and
                    service stand on the same footing as other contracts. The breach of such
                    contracts is regarded as a private matter, as the subject cf a claim for
                    damages, but not of the application of the criminal law. The recovery of damages
                    is regulated by the Code Napoleon. The juge de paix decides the amount when the
                    sum claimed is under 200 francs, when above that amount the tribunal of first
                    instance. So in Belgium there is no criminal penalty attaching to the breach of
                    a contract of labour; such a contract entitles .the aggrieved party, as a
                    general rule, only to pecuniary damages; and the same is the case in the
                    Netherlands, Austria Hungary, Italy, Portugal, Sweden, Norway, and Russia. In
                    Switzerland there is no criminal liability, provided the dereliction of duty
                    involves no consequences injurious to the public welfare or to the life or
                    health of other persons. The performance of contracts, however, in the larger
                    works in Switzerland is secured by the system of “décompte,” or portion of wages
                    retained as security by the employer. In Prussia, although in 1869 all the penal
                    regulations previously existing against breaches of contract and wrongful
                    cessation of work on the part of workmen in mills, mines, and metallurgical
                    establishments and in underground quarries and pits were repealed, police laws
                    are, it seems, still capable of being enforced by way of fine, and, in default,
                    by a short imprisonment in some provinces, against agricultural labourers, and
                    against boatmen or workmen engaged in special field or forest work.</p>
                <p>Of the United States, the English representative wrote thus to the Foreign Office
                    in 1869:—“There are few countries in which the working man is held in such
                    regard as in the United States of America. The labouring classes may be said to
                    embrace the entire American nation. Every man works for a living, follows a
                    profession, or is engaged either in mercantile or industrial pursuits.” As might
                    be expected, it may be said that, as to both parties to a contract for labour
                    and service, they stand upon the mere footing of contract, and such contract is
                    not distinguished from any other contract. The matter does not belong to the
                    province of federal legislation, but to the regulation of each particular State.
                    There has been no legislation, however, making the breach of a contract for
                    labour or services the subject of criminal liability. Contracts of
                    apprenticeship are, nevertheless, enforced by statutory provisions.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto dealt with the mode of enforcing contracts of labour. It remains
                    to speak of the extent to which the contracts themselves are controlled.</p>
                <p>With reference to the period of service, there is no law directly limiting it. A
                    right even to perpetual service founded on a contract may not perhaps be illegal
                    and void; for, if a man can contract to serve for one year, there seems to be no
                    reason to prevent his contracting to serve for one hundred years if he should so
                    long live,—though the courts would be inclined to consider it an improvident
                    engagement, and would not be very strict in enforcing it (Christian). No such
                    perpetual contracts, however, exist in actual practice, and where no time is
                    expressly stipulated or implied the contract is generally construed to endure
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n183/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0183-0172"/> until determined by a reasonable notice on either
                    side, to be construed by the general usage in relation to the particular
                    employment. If a time is expressed or implied, the silent continuing in the
                    service after its expiration draws with it in general a renewal of the same
                    terms as were originally stipulated for. In agriculture the general engagement,
                    express or implied, is for a year. In manufacture it is seldom so long, and in
                    journeyman handicrafts it is sometimes by the hour, but the usage to calculate
                    earn-iugs and the time of payment by the hour or day is often of course quite
                    distinct from the duration of the contract. Payment by measure or quantity
                    (piece work) is very general, and so far as the calculation of earnings is
                    concerned supersedes reference to time. Nevertheless the obligation to serve may
                    be conditional on the employer finding a reasonable quantity of work, or may
                    expressly or implicitly endure until a reasonable notice is given on either
                    side. In the pottery manufacture in North Staffordshire most of the workmen in
                    the different branches of the trade are paid by the quantity according to a
                    price list, the engagement being by usage, from Martinmas to Martinmas; and in
                    this and in most other manufactures where the artisan works on the material and
                    in the manufactory or the workshop of the employer he is subject to the usual
                    hours of work, although only paid by the quantity.</p>
                <p>Most workmen of all classes and descriptions of labour are paid weekly, in
                    whatever way their earnings accrue or are calculated. The contracts of infants
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Infant)</hi> for their personal services as necessary
                    for their maintenance are enforceable, for unless they could make such contracts
                    they might starve. As long as these contracts, were enforceable by imprisonment
                    the courts looked closely into them, refusing to enforce them unless they were
                    mutual, that is, capable of being enforced against the employer as well as
                    against the servant. If there were an agreement to serve under circumstances
                    which involved no obligation to employ, the courts would not enforce the
                    contract, and young servants were not unfrequently discharged from custody on
                    the ground that no obligation to serve existed by reason of the onesidedness.
                    Contracts of <hi rend="smallcaps">Apprenticeship</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(jpυ.)</hi> are beyond the limits of this article.</p>
                <p>The will of the parties is uot interfered with as regards the description of
                    labour or the adequacy of the remuneration agreed upon. In the absence of any
                    verbal or written stipulation, the performance of labour upon an express or
                    implied request in general involves an implied agreement to pay the value of it
                    in the current coin of the realm; and wherever a mutuality of agreement can be
                    implied, that is to say, where it is not onesided, it can be enforced. As the
                    employer and employed are free, they would primarily have a right to stipulate
                    that the remuneration for service should be for something else than money, as
                    for articles of value, or for an exchange of labour; but the primary right of
                    employer and employed to make their own arrangements as to the mode of
                    remuneration is interfered with in England by legislation, especially by the
                    so-called Truck Act, 1 and 2 Will IV. c. 37, applying to all persons employed in
                    the manufacture of iron from raising the stone to the completion of the making
                    of the products of iron and steel, and the manufacture of all other hardware and
                    cutlery, and the getting of coal, stone and slate, salt and clay, and the
                    manufacture of pottery, and the weaving, preparation, and dyeing of woollen,
                    worsted, cotton cloth, and silk. The object of the statute is to compel payment
                    of wages in money. For this purpose it prohibits agreements for paying wages
                    otherwise, and prohibits paying them in goods or money’s worth. To insure
                    obedience, it enables the artificer to repudiate a contract and payment contrary
                    to its provisions, and, however fairly he may have been dealt with, to enforce
                    payment in such case over again. It is obvious that such a provision is open to
                    two most important objections :—(1) it interferes with that freedom of contract
                    and conduct which is universally recognized as of the greatest benefit; (2) it
                    enables an artificer who may have requested and received payment otherwise than
                    in money, and who may have benefited thereby and been most justly and kindly
                    treated, to commit a great dishonesty by enforcing payment again. But, grave as
                    these objections are, the legislature has deemed it necessary to face them, in
                    order to guard against the mischiefs of a system under which the workman may
                    receive directly from his employer, or indirectly, as through “tommyshops” in
                    which the employer has an interest, articles not a real equivalent of the wages;
                    so that but for the statute an employer might engage a man to work for him with
                    a promise of payment in goods, and cheat him by giving him goods of inferior
                    quality or overcharged, or engaging him with a promise of money and then
                    cheating him by a pressure to take goods, or by supplying the man with goods
                    beyond his wages, get him into his debt, and then exercise an injurious control
                    over him. It is in vain to say that the master would cheat in cases where money
                    wages were agreed for, by withholding money agreed to be paid, and that the law
                    would redress the one wrong as readily as the other. The answer is that such a
                    cheat is too barefaced, and would certainly be successfully resisted; while more
                    or less of inferiority in the quality or value of goods might be endured, or, if
                    contested, would give rise to more doubtful inquiries. Whether these mischiefs
                    are worth the remedy, or whether the remedy is the best, is not the question to
                    be discussed or determined in this article.</p>
                <p>As servants in husbandry are often remunerated in part in other ways than by
                    money, as by land or its produce, or by house room, and in a variety of ways,
                    the Truck Act especially exempts them. Domestic servants are also specially
                    exempted. Moreover, by express provision, the Act does not prevent any employer
                    of any artificer or agent of such employer from supplying or contracting to
                    supply medicine or medical attendance, or any fuel, or any materials, tools, or
                    implements employed by the artificer in his trade or occupation if employed in
                    mining, or any hay, corn, or other provender for horses or other beasts of
                    burden employed by such artificer in his trade or occupation, nor from letting
                    any tenement at a rental to any artificer, workman, or labourer within the Act,
                    nor from supplying or contracting to supply to any artificer any victuals
                    dressed or prepared under the roof of the employer and there to be consumed by
                    such artificer, nor from making deductions or stoppages, or advancing money for
                    any of these purposes, provided that only the real value is charged, and that
                    the agreement for any such stoppage or deduction is in writing. Employers are
                    not prevented from advancing money to an artificer for his contributions to a
                    friendly society or to a savings bank, or for his relief in sickness, or for the
                    education of his children, or from making deductions for such education, if the
                    agreement for such deduction is in writing. The interpretation of the Truck Act
                    has exercised the most subtle intellects. It has been determined by the majority
                    of judges that the obligation to render services personally is necessary to make
                    the Act applicable. The circumstances under which stoppages and deductions may
                    be made, and other exceptions from the operation of the prohibitory clauses of
                    the Act, have also been the subject of divergent opinions. A custom having
                    prevailed among the employers of artificers in the hosiery manufactures of
                    letting out frames and machinery to the artificers employed by them, in 1874
                    contracts to stop wages for frames were declared illegal, and the stoppage of
                    waees made unlawful. Bv a provision of the Employers <pb break="no"

                <p>Great evils having arisen in Scotland through the arrestment of wages for debts
                    of labourers, manufacturers, artificers, and other work people, the power to
                    arrest wages earned there not exceeding twenty shillings a-week was in 1870
                    taken away, and limited in amount where the wages are above that sum. A
                    provision of a statute of the reign of George II., “to prevent oppression of the
                    labourers and workmen employed in any respect in or about making or
                    manufacturing of gloves, breeches, boots, shoes, slippers, wares or goods of
                    that sort,” requires the true weight, quantity, or tale to be declared of goods
                    and materials delivered out to be wrought up in those manufactures.</p>
                <p>The system of the “livret” (still the law in some European states, although
                    fallen into disuse as no longer in harmony with the direction of modern views),
                    by which it is a condition precedent to a workman entering into a contract, or
                    being engaged by a fresh employer, to produce a document certifying that he has
                    fulfilled his previous engagements, is unknown now in England. The former system
                    of rules stood much on the same footing, and there is something closely
                    resembling it introduced into the rules regulating the employment of drivers of
                    public vehicles in the metropolis. It is only in relation to domestic service
                    that a new employer concerns himself with the antecedents of a servant or with
                    anything beyond the capacity to work; and the former employer in whose interests
                    “livrets” were imposed does not in general deem it worth while, with the present
                    abundance of labour in every field of work, to impose any restraint on the
                    departure of a dissatisfied workman. The practical ground of complaint is not so
                    much a workman exchanging employers, as a neglect of work while remaining in
                    service.</p>
                <p>The legal remedies at present in existence for breaches of contract have been
                    necessarily stated in the outline of the last statute on the subject of employer
                    and employed. The weak point is the absence in England of any mode by which the
                    performance of contracts of labour can be enforced, as contracts of other kinds
                    can be where damages do not afford a remedy. Lord Elcho’s Act of 1867 purposely
                    gave a remedy in the nature of specific performance, and where carefully applied
                    was found to work very well. The commission of 1875 expressly recommended the
                    retention of this power as quite distinct from criminal punishment. Provision
                    for compelling the performance of a contract exists in many countries where any
                    application of criminal law is repudiated. Nevertheless, not so much from any
                    objection on the part of the framers to compulsory performance as from fear of
                    its abuse by the heavy hand (the bane of administrative legislature as of
                    inventive genius), the power is gone. The result is undoubted hardship to
                    employers, particularly to those (and there are many of them) who are themselves
                    workers and entirely dependent on the due performance of contracts by their
                    fellow-workers. That home legislation is defective in this respect may be
                    inferred from the fact that subsequent colonial legislation has given the means
                    of getting labour contracts performed without trenching on the domain of
                    criminal law. As, however, there is little probability of an amendment of home
                    law in the direction indicated, it is to be hoped that compensation for
                    diminished legal remedy will be found in an increased sense of moral
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>Arbitration is frequently employed to settle differences between masters and
                    workmen.</p>
                <p>The institution of “conseils de prud’hommes” is known by name as in force in most
                    of the manufacturing districts of France and Belgium and other Continental
                    countries. The council is a recognized tribunal consisting of equal numbers of
                    employers and employed. All disputes between master and workmen, whether as to
                    quality of work or rate of. wages, are first submitted to a committee, which
                    sits privately, to endeavour to settle the question amicably and at a nominal
                    expense; failing this, the case is referred to the council, which sits in public
                    once a month, or oftener if required. Though the right of appeal to the regular
                    courts exists, it is seldom resorted to.</p>
                <p>In Austria a law of 1869 instituted arbitration courts of this description in
                    every important manufacturing town and district, to settle all disputes
                    respecting wages, continuance of work, fulfilment of contracts, and claims on
                    benefit clubs and relief funds and matters of that kind. Each court of
                    arbitration must be composed of at least twelve and at most twenty-four
                    members,—one half of them employers elected by employers, and the other half
                    workmen elected by workmen, each class voting separately. Workmen sitting on
                    cases judged by these courts are paid by the commune for every day’s sitting. In
                    the case of the minor trades, which cannot maintain regular arbitration courts,
                    the trade laws assign the adjudication of all disputes between masters and men
                    in the first instance to the representatives of the trade in which such disputes
                    arise, and, in places where the necessary quorum for that purpose cannot be made
                    up by the local representatives of any particular trade, the deficiency is
                    supplied by a certain number of workmen temporarily appointed by the municipal
                    authorities from amongst the most respectable and intelligent members of their
                    class to act as arbitrators in such cases. Disputes which cannot be settled in
                    this way must be decided by the common law courts; and it is only a court of law
                    which can take cognizance of a claim raised thirty days after the expiration of
                    a contract to which it refers.</p>
                <p>In England no such compulsory legislation exists. The old guilds acted as
                    arbitration courts, and, although their decision was practically binding, the
                    guilds were only adapted to deal with small craftsmen acting singly. In modern
                    times the law has been very reluctant to give effect even to voluntary
                    agreements for referring disputes to arbitration, on a notion that to take away
                    the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals and to set up another was contrary to
                    settled principles. There are now several statutes, however, for giving legal
                    effect to the awards of arbitrators in trade disputes voluntarily referred to
                    arbitration and sitting in the way pointed out. The most successful arbitrations
                    between employers and employed appear to be under voluntary submissions, in
                    accordance with rules previously agreed to by employers and employed, in
                    particular manufactures, the decisions being acted upon independently of any
                    legislative aid.</p>
                <p>Applied to the one pre-eminently important—probably the only great—question, the
                    rate of wages, reference to arbitration is full of difficulties. The difference
                    relates to the future, not to the past. It is an erroneous notion that strikes
                    and lock-outs involve any breach of contract. In former days it may have been
                    that employer and employed refused to carry out a contract on the ground that
                    the other side had first failed in the performance of some condition precedent
                    to the right to call on the other to perform work or to pay for it, as the case
                    might be; but in the present day the disturbance of the previous relationship of
                    employer and employed generally occurs without any such allegation on one side
                    or the other. Thus, in a strike terminated while this article is in the press,
                    the contracts <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n185/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0185-0174"/> between employers and employed in the pottery
                    trade of North Staffordshire were previously at an end by lapse of time. The
                    question in such cases is on what terms the parties will agree for the future
                    relationship of employer and employed, there being no such relationship when the
                    strike began, and of course none while it is pending. This goes to the root of
                    the whole matter, although it may seem a technical mode of looking at it. But if
                    no such obstacle existed, there are difficulties of another kind. In such cases
                    a board of conciliation is inevitably equally divided, and reference to an
                    umpire becomes necessary. To give confidence, he must not be an employer or
                    employed in the trade. In general, therefore, he must know nothing previously of
                    the subject he has undertaken to settle. He must deal with it on such imperfect
                    knowledge as he can acquire in the arbitration, and apply such general
                    principles as may occur to him. Nevertheless much good has been done by a
                    good-tempered calm inquiry in which both sides learn perhaps for the first time
                    the grounds on which the demand is made or resisted.</p>
                <p>A recent important Act of Parliament, the Employers’ Liability Act 1880, must be
                    noticed. To render its provisions intelligible, it is necessary to state the
                    general law on the subject of civil liability for negligence. A person who
                    causes injury to the person or property of another is liable in damages to that
                    person, and if the injury has resulted in death the right of action is extended
                    to the representatives, on behalf of the widow or children, independently of any
                    criminal liability incurred by the negligence. If the person who committed the
                    negligent act is in the service of another, and the negligent act was committed
                    in the course of the discharge of his duty, the civil liability extends to the
                    master. This liability of the master is important to the injured person, because
                    the servant is in most cases a much poorer person than the master. If they were
                    equally able to pay damages, nothing would be gained by resorting to the master.
                    But the liability of the latter was not, before 1880, extended to make the
                    master responsible in damages if the person injured and the negligent servant
                    were both in his service and both were performing the same kind of duty, a
                    “common employment” as it has been termed, and if the master, so far from being
                    guilty of any actual negligence himself, had employed a generally competent
                    person, and had provided him with the means of properly performing his duty. No
                    vindication of the then law seems necessary, for, whether the liability of an
                    employer to strangers is just or not, there is an obvious distinction between
                    such a liability and responsibility where all parties are “rowing in the same
                    boat,” to adopt an expression used in one case, whether the injured person be a
                    servant or guest of the master. Both are volunteers, and both know that the
                    master will not personally intervene. There does not appear to be any injustice
                    in such a case in confining the liability to that of the servant personally
                    guilty of the negligence, although a poor man. However, some apparently hard
                    cases, especially arising out of accidents on railways, where, while a passenger
                    could sue the company for negligence, an engine-driver or a guard’s remedy was
                    limited to the person actually guilty of the negligence, led to the attention of
                    parliament being called to the subject. In 1877 a committee of the House of
                    Commons, pointing out that the development of modern industry has created large
                    numbers of employing bodies, such as corporations and public companies, to whom
                    it is not possible to bring home personal default, and that there are other
                    cases in which masters leave the whole conduct of their business to agents and
                    managers, themselves taking no personal part whatever either in the supply of
                    materials or in the choice of subordinate servants, reported thus :—</p>
                <p>“Your committee arc of opinion that in cases such as these, that is, where the
                    actual employers cannot personally discharge the duties of masters, or where
                    they deliberately abdicate their functions and delegate them to agents, the acts
                    or defaults of the agents who thus discharge the duties and fulfil the functions
                    of masters should be considered as the personal acts or defaults of the
                    principals and employers, and should impose the same liability on such
                    principals and employers as they would have been subject to had they been acting
                    personally in the conduct of their business, notwithstanding that such agents
                    are technically in the employment of the principals. The fact of such a
                    delegation of authority would have to be established in each case, but this
                    would not be a matter of difficulty. Your committee are further of opinion that
                    the doctrine of common employment has been carried too far when workmen employed
                    by a contractor and workmen employed by a person or company who has employed
                    such contractor are considered as being in the same common employment”</p>
                <p>Three years afterwards the Act in question was passed. By sect. 1, where personal
                    injury is caused to a workman—</p>
                <p>“ (1) By reason of any defect in the condition of the ways, works, machinery, or
                    plant connected with or used in the business of the employer; or (2) by reason
                    of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer, who has any
                    superintendence entrusted to him, whilst in the exercise of such
                    superintendence; or (3) by reason of the negligence of any person in the service
                    of the employer to whose orders or directions the workmen at the time of the
                    injury was bound to conform and did conform, where such injury resulted from his
                    having so conformed; or (4) by reason of the act or omission of any person in
                    the service of the employer done or made in obedience to the rales or bye-laws
                    of the employer, or in obedience to particular· instructions given by any person
                    delegated with the authority of the employer in that behalf; or (5) by reason of
                    the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has the charge
                    or control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a
                    railway,—the workman, or in case the injury results in death the legal personal
                    representatives of the workman, and any persons entitled in case of death, shall
                    have the same right of compensation and remedies against the employer as if the
                    workman had not been a workman of nor in the service of the employer, nor
                    engaged in his work.”</p>
                <p>Section 2 provides that a workman shall not be entitled under the Act to any
                    right of compensation or remedy against the employer in any of the following
                    cases :—</p>
                <p>(1) Under subsection 1 of section 1, unless the defect therein mentioned arose
                    from, or had not been discovered or remedied owing to, the negligence of the
                    employer, or of some person in the service of the employer, and entrusted by him
                    with the duty of seeing that the ways, works, machinery, or plant were in proper
                    condition; (2) under subsection 4 of section 1, unless the injury resulted from
                    some impropriety or defects in the rales, bye-laws, or instructions therein
                    mentioned; provided that, when a rule or byelaw has been approved or has been
                    accepted as a proper rule or byelaw by one of her Majesty’s principal
                    secretaries of state, or by the Board of Trade, or any other department of the
                    Government, under or by virtue of any Act of Parliament, it shall not be deemed
                    for the purposes of this Act to be an improper or defective rule or bye-law; (3)
                    in any case where the workman knew of the defect or negligence which caused his
                    injury and failed within a reasonable time to give, or cause to be given,
                    information thereof to the employer or some person superior to himself in the
                    service of the employer, unless he was aware that the employer or such superior
                    knew of the said defect or negligence.”</p>
                <p>Compensation under thia Act (which extends to a railway servant and any person to
                    whom the Employers and Workmen Act 1875, already noticed, applies) is enforced
                    by action in the county court (in Scotland the sheriff’s court, in Ireland the
                    civil bill court) after notice within six weeks of the nature and particulars of
                    the claim (unless there was reasonable excuse for the want of notice in the case
                    of death). The compensation is limited to three years’ earnings, and the action
                    must be commenced within six months from the occurrence of the accident, or in
                    case of death within twelve months from the time of death.</p>
                <p>Neither in the United Kingdom nor abroad does the right to damages for breach of
                    contracts override the general law as to offences, so that, if any of the
                    parties do anything amounting to a criminal offence, a prosecution may follow
                    although a breach of contract is involved for which breach damages may be
                    recovered. There are moreover a variety of Acts of Parliament from the reign of
                    Anne still in force <pb break="no"

                    employed in various trades in working up materials, not only as regards the

                    fraudulent contrivances for misrepresenting the amount of work done. For such
                    offences fine or imprisonment may be inflicted.</p>

                    the benevolent exertions of the earl of Shaftesbury, and extended by Lord
                    Aberdare as secretary of state for the home department and others, is most
                    important (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Factory Acts).</hi> The indirect effects of
                    those provisions in causing better order in the conduct of manufacturing
                    industries cannot be overlooked. The Agricultural Gangs Act 1867, arising out of
                    the practice in the east of England of persons known as gang masters hiring
                    children, young persons, and women, with a view to contracting with farmers and
                    others for agricultural work is a recent illustration of the direct objects of
                    such legislation. The fencing of machinery, the careful working of coal and
                    metalliferous mines, and the like, have been the subject of minute legislative
                    provisions, which, as well as the Explosives Act 1875, intimately affect the
                    wellbeing of the labouring community and the general safety.</p>
                <p>The wants of servants are considered in the preference shown to claims for wages
                    in the case of death and bankruptcy, and the general need of all classes of
                    workmen is kept in view in the provisions relating to workmen’s dwellings, and
                    the obligation of railway companies to afford facilities for their conveyance at
                    a low rate. Less directly they are considered in the legislation relating to
                    friendly and provident societies; of equivocal effect was the legislation
                    respecting small loans, intended to facilitate the purchase of tools, but taken
                    advantage of to form loan societies of doubtful general benefit to the
                    community. We cannot notice here the effect of the laws regulating the land and
                    sea forces on contracts relating to labour by persons entering the army or navy.
