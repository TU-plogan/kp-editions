                    whence at the age of eighteen he was driven by the evil fortunes of the family
                    patron, after suffering arrest and imprisonment, to Padua, in which university
                    he studied law and letters for about six years. On the completion of his studies
                    he joined his father at Bologna, and afterwards, the constable having died, went
                    to Rome in the suite of Charles V. For some time he held the position of auditor
                    of the rota at Rome, but in 1534, encouraged by the fair promises of Cardinal de

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0523-0504"/> Grammont, he returned to France. The death of his
                    patron soon afterwards seriously impaired his prospects; but after he had
                    entered himself of the Parisian bar, his marriage, in 1537, to a daughter of the
                    lieutenant-criminel procured for him the post of counsellor to the parliament of
                    Paris. This office he held until 1547, when he was sent by Henry II. on a
                    mission to Bologna, where the council of Trent was at that time sitting; after
                    sixteen months of wearisome inactivity there, he was by his own desire recalled
                    at the close of 1518. L’Hôpital now for some time held the position of
                    “chancellor” in the household of the princess Margaret, duchess of Berri, and in
                    1554 he was made superintendent of the royal finances. In 1559 he accompanied
                    his mistress, now duchess of Savoy, to Nice, where, on the following year,
                    tidings reached him that he had been chosen to succeed Olivier in the
                    chancellorship of France. One of his first acts after entering on the duties of
                    his office (in July 1560) was to cause the parliament of Paris to register the
                    edict of Romorantin, of which he is sometimes, but erroneously it would seem,
                    said to have been the author. Designed as it was to protect so-called heretics
                    from the secret and summary methods of the Inquisition, it certainly had his
                    sympathy and approval. In accordance with the consistent policy of inclusion and
                    toleration by which the whole of his official life was characterized, he induced
                    the council to call the Assembly of Notables, which met at Fontainebleau in
                    August 1G60 and agreed that the States General should be summoned, all
                    proceedings against heretics being meanwhile suppressed, pending the reformation
                    of the church by a general or national council. The States General met in
                    December; the edict of Orleans (July 1561) followed, and finally, after the
                    colloquy of Poissy, that of January 1562, the most liberal (except that of
                    Nantes) ever obtained by the Protestants of France. Its terms, however, were not
                    carried out, and during the war which was the inevitable result of the massacre
                    of Vassy in May, L’Hôpital, whose dismissal had been for some time urged by the
                    papal legate Hippolytus of Este, found it necessary to retire to his estate at
                    Vignay near Étampes, whence he did not return until after the pacification of
                    Amboise (March 19, 1563). It was by his advice that Charles IX. was declared of
                    age (August 17, 1563) at Rouen, a measure which really increased the power of
                    Catherine de’ Medici; and it was under his influence also that the parliament of
                    Paris in 1564 refused to sanction the publication of the acts of the council of
                    Trent, on account of their inconsistency with the Gallican liberties. In 1564-66
                    he accompanied the young king on an extended tour through France; and in 1566 he
                    was instrumental in the promulgation of an important edict for reform of abuses
                    in the administration of justice. The renewal of the religious war in September
                    1567, however, was at once a symptom and a cause of diminished influence to
                    L’Hôpital, and in February 1568 he obtained his letters of discharge, which were
                    registered by the parliament on May 11, his titles, honours, and emoluments
                    being reserved to him during the remainder of his life. Henceforward he lived a
                    life of unbroken literary seclusion at Vignay, his only subsequent public
                    appearance being by means of a “mémoire” which he addressed to the king in 1570
                    under the title <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">but de la

                    through the troubles of the St Bartholomew, but did not long survive them. His
                    death took place either at Vignay or at Bélesbat (Courdimanche, Etampes) on
                    March 13, 1573.</p>
