                    means, having already placed three sons in the army, destined this one for the
                    church, and sent him to the Jesuits at Amiens, where he continued till his
                    father’s death. After this he would remain with the Jesuits no longer, and, not
                    yet seventeen years of age, started for the seat of war at Bergen-op-Zoom,
                    before which place one of his brothers had already been killed. Mounted on an
                    old horse, with a boy from the village as attendant, and furnished by a lady
                    with a letter of introduction to a colonel, he reached his destination on the
                    evening before a battle. Next morning the colonel found that the new and very
                    diminutive volunteer had posted himself in the front rank of a body of
                    grenadiers, and could not be induced to quit the position. In the battle, the
                    company which he had joined became exposed to the fire of the enemy’s artillery,
                    and in the confusion of retreat was forgotten. All the officers and subalterns
                    were killed, and not more than fourteen men were left, when the oldest grenadier
                    seeing there were no more French in sight proposed to the young volunteer so
                    soon become commandant to withdraw his men. This he refused to do without
                    orders. These at last arrived; and for his bravery he was made an officer on the
                    spot, and soon after was named to a lieutenancy.</p>
                <p>After the peace, the regiment was sent to Monaco. There it happened that one of
                    his comrades playfully lifted him by the head, and to this it was imputed that
                    he was seized with disease of the glands of the neck, so severe as to
                    necessitιfe grave surgical interference, and put a stop to his military
                    career.</p>
                <p>The courage of Lamarck, so early exhibited, was in future to be shown by the
                    maintenance of his opinions in the absence of any friendly support, and by
                    fortitude amid many adversities; while his activity was to be displayed, not
                    only in manifold speculation, but in copious and varied scientific work. He went
                    to Paris and began the study of medicine, supporting himself by working in a
                    banker’s office. He early became interested in meteorology and in physical and
                    chemical speculations of a chimerical kind, but happily threw his main strength
                    into botany, and in 1778 published his <hi rend="italic">Flore</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">française,</hi> a work in which by a dichotomous system of
                    contrasting characters he enabled the student with facility to determine
                    species. This work, which went through several editions and long kept the field,
                    gained for its author immediate popularity as well as the honour of admission to
                    the Academy of Sciences.</p>
                <p>In 1781 and 1782, under the title of botanist to the king, an appointment
                    obtained for him by Buffon, whose son accompanied him, he travelled through
                    various countries of Europe, extending his knowledge of natural history; and on
                    his return he began those elaborate contributions to botany on which his
                    reputation in that science principally rests, namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dictionnaire de Botanique</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrations de
                    Genres,</hi> voluminous works contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie
                    Méthodique</hi> (1785). In 1793, when he was already forty-nine years of age, in
                    consequence of changes in the organization of the natural history department at
                    the Jardin du Roi, where he had held a botanical appointment since 1788, Lamarck
                    was presented to a zoological chair, and called on to lecture on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vermes</hi> of Linnaeus, the
                    animals for which he introduced the term <hi rend="italic">Invertebrata,</hi>
                    still employed. Thus driven, comparatively late in life, to devote his principal
                    attention to zoology instead of botany, he had the misfortune soon after to
                    suffer from impaired vision; and the malady progressing resulted subsequently in
                    total blindness. Yet his greatest zoological work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertèbres,</hi> was published from 1815 to
                    1822, with the assistance, in the last two volumes, of his eldest daughter and
                    of M. Latreille. A volume of plates of the fossil shells of the neighbourhood of
                    Paris was collected in 1823 from his memoirs in the <hi rend="italic">Annales
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">Museum.</hi> The later years of his blind old age were
                    spent in straitened circumstances and accumulating infirmities, solaced,
                    however, by the devotion of bis family, and particularly of his eldest daughter,
                    of whom Cuvier records that she never left the house from the time that he was
                    confined to his room. He died 18th December 1829.</p>
                <p>The character of Lamarck as a naturalist is remarkable alike for its excellences
                    and its defects. His excellences were width of scope, fertility of ideas, and a
                    pre-eminent faculty of precise description, arising not only from a singularly
                    terse style, but from a clear insight into both the distinctive features and the
                    resemblances of forms. That part of his zoological work which still finds a
                    large and important place in the science of the present day, and constitutes his
                    solid claim to the highest honour as a zoologist, is to be found in his
                    extensive and detailed labours in the departments of living and fossil <hi
                    rend="italic">Invertebrata.</hi> His endeavours at classification of the great
                    groups were necessarily defective on account of the imperfect knowledge
                    possessed in his time in regard to many of them, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    echinoderms, ascidians, and intestinal worms; yet they are not without interest,
                    particularly on account of the comprehensive attempt to unite in one great
                    division as <hi rend="italic">Articulata</hi> all those groups that appeared to
                    present a segmented construction. Moreover, Lamarck was the first to distinguish
                    vertebrate from invertebrate animals by the presence of a vertebral column, and
                    among the Invertebrata to found the groups <hi rend="italic">Crustacea,
                    Arαchnida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Annelida.</hi> In 1785 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hist. de l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Acad.)</hi> he evinced his appreciation of
                    the necessity of natural orders in botany by an attempt at the classification of
                    plants, interesting, though crude and falling immeasurably short of the system
                    which grew in the hands of his intimate friend Jussieu. The problem of taxonomy
                    has never been put more philosophically than he subsequently put it in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Animaux sans Vertèbres</hi><hi rend="italic">:—</hi> “What
                    arrangement must be given to the general distribution of animals to make it
                    conformable to the order of nature in the production of these beings 1”</p>
                <p>The most prominent defect in Lamarck must be admitted, quite apart from all
                    consideration of the famous hypothesis which bears his name, to have been want
                    of control in speculation. Doubtless the speculative tendency furnished a
                    powerful incentive to work, but it outran the legitimate deductions from
                    observation, and led him into the production of volumes of worthless chemistry
                    without experimental basis, as well as into spending much time on fruitless
                    meteorological predictions.’ His <hi rend="italic">Annuaires
                    Météorologiques</hi> were published yearly from 1800 to 1810, and were not
                    discontinued until after an unnecessarily public and brutal tirade from
                    Napoleon, administered on the occasion of being presented with one of his works
                    on natural history.</p>
                <p>To the general reader the name of Lamarck is chiefly interesting on account of
                    his theory of the origin of life and of the diversities of animal forms. The
                    idea, which appears to have been favoured by Buffon before him, that species
                    were not through all time unalterable, and that the more complex might have been
                    developed from pre-existent simpler forms, became with Lamarck a belief or, as
                    he imagined a demonstration. Spontaneous generation, he considered<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n243/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0243-0232"/>, might be easily conceived as resulting from such
                    agencies as heat and electricity causing in small gelatinous bodies an utricular
                    structure, and inducing a “singular tension,” a kind of “éréthisme” or
                    “orgasme”; and, having thus accounted for the first appearance of life, he
                    explained the whole organization of animals and formation of different organs by
                    four laws :—</p>
                <p>“1. Life by its proper forces tends continually to increase the volume of every
                    body possessing it, and to enlarge its parts, up to a limit which it brings
                    about.</p>
                <p>“2. The production of a new organ in an animal body results from the supervention
                    of a new want (besoin) continuing to make itself felt, and a new movement which
                    this want gives birth to and encourages.</p>
                <p>“3. The development of organs and their force of action are constantly in ratio
                    to the employment of these organs.</p>
                <p>“4. All which has been acquired, laid down, or changed in the organization of
                    individuals in the course of their life is conserved by generation and
                    transmitted to the new individuals which proceed from those which have undergone
                    those changes.”</p>
                <p>It is the second law which has been principally associated with Lamarck’s name,
                    and is often referred to as his hypothesis of the evolution of organs in animals
                    by appetence or longing, although Lamarck does not teach that the animal’s
                    desires affect its conformation directly, but that altered wants lead to altered
                    habits, which result in the formation of new organs as well as in modification,
                    growth, or dwindling of those previously existing. Thus, he suggests that,
                    ruminants being pursued by carnivora, their legs have grown slender; and, their
                    legs being only fit for support, while their jaws are weak, they have made
                    attack with the crown of the head, and the determination of fluids thither has
                    led to the growth of horns. So also the stretching of the giraffe’s neck to
                    reach the foliage he supposes to have led to its elongation; and the kangaroo,
                    sitting upright to support the young in its pouch, he imagines to have had its
                    fore-limbs dwarfed by disuse, and its hind legs and tail exaggerated by using
                    them in leaping. The length to which he carried such notions can be fairly
                    estimated by the illustration which, long after the publication of his
                    Philosophic Zoolpgiquc, he selected in the introduction to the Hist. Nat. des
                    Anim. sans Vert. ‘ ‘ I conceive that a gasteropod mollusc, which, as it crawls
                    along, finds the need of touching the bodies in front of it, makes efforts to
                    touch those bodies with some of the foremost parts of its head, and sends to
                    these every time quantities of nervous fluids, as well as other liquids. I
                    conceive, I say, that it must result from this reiterated afflux towards the
                    points in question that the nerves which abut at these points will, by slow
                    degrees, be extended. Now, as in the same circumstances other fluids of the
                    animal flow also to the same places, and especially nourishing fluids, it must
                    follow that two or more tentacles will appear and develop insensibly in those
                    circumstances on the points referred to.”</p>
                <p>However absurd this may seem, it must be admitted that, unlimited time having
                    been once granted for organs to be developed in series of generations, the
                    objections to their being formed in the way here imagined are only such as
                    equally apply to the theory of their origin by natural selection. Thus, for
                    example, neither theory considers that it has to deal, not with crude heaps of
                    mere functional organs, but with exquisitely orderly forms, nor accounts for the
                    symmetrical first appearance of parts or for sex; nor, though Lamarck tried
                    hard, has he or any later writer reduced to physical law the rise of
                    consciousness in association with structures wlιich in their physical relations
                    are mere mechanisms capable of reflex actions.</p>
                <p>In judging the reasonableness of the second law of Lamarck as compared with more
                    modern and now widely received theories, it must be observed that it is only an
                    extension of his third law; and that third law is a fact. The strengthening of
                    the blacksmith’s arm by use is proverbially notorious. It is, therefore, only
                    the sufficiency of the Lamarckian hypothesis to explain the first commencement
                    of new organs which is in question, if evolution by the mere operation of forces
                    acting in the inorganic world be granted; and surely the Darwinian theory is
                    equally helpless to account for the boginnings of a new organ, while it demands
                    as imperatively that every stage in the assumed hereditary development of an
                    organ must have been useful.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, to no writer more recent than Lamarck can be attributed the credit
                    of first pointing attention to the repetition of acquired variations in the
                    progeny, or the idea of weaving that fact into a theory of the origin of
                    species. His words are ^“Everything which nature has caused individuals to
                    acquire or lose by the influence of the circumstances to which their race is
                    long exposed, and consequently by the influence of the predominant employment of
                    such organ, or its constant disuse, she preserves by generation to the new
                    individuals proceeding from them, provided that the changes are common to the
                    two sexes, or to those which have produced these new individuals” (Phil. Zook,
                    i. 235). It is interesting to note in this passage that he hesitated to believe
                    that peculiarities could become permanent unless possessed by both parents.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding his attempt to e÷olve all vital action from the forces at work in
                    the inorganic world, Lamarck made a broad dis tinction between the “power of
                    life,” to which he attributed the production of ‘ ‘ a real progression in the
                    composition of the organization of animals,” and the modifying effects of
                    external circumstances. The existence of such a progression cannot now be
                    doubted, and constitutes evolution in the only sense in which it is universally
                    admitted. Lamarck, equally with Darwin, teaches the more speculative doctrine
                    that the complex forms are descended from simpler ancestors. In the modus
                    operandi by which they hold this to have been accomplished both have admitted
                    the action of a variety of modifying circumstances. Lamarck gave great
                    importance to the influence of new wants acting indirectly by stimulating growth
                    and use. Darwin has given like importance to the effects of accidental
                    variations acting indirectly by giving advantage in the struggle for existence.
                    The speculative writings of Darwin have, however, been interwoven λvith a vast
                    number of beautiful experiments and observations bearing on his speculations,
                    though by no means proving his theory of evolution; while the speculations of
                    Lamarck lie apart from his wonderful descriptive labours, unrelieved by
                    intermixture with other matters capable of attracting the numerous class who,
                    provided they have new facts set before them, are not careful to limit
                    themselves to the conclusions strictly deducible therefrom. But those who read
                    the Philosophie Zoologique will find how many truths often supposed to be far
                    more modern are stated with abundant clearness in its pages. (J. CL.)</p>
