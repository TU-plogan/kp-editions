                <p><label type="entry">LAODICEA</label> (Greek Λαoδικ∈ια) is the name of at least
                    eight cities, founded or renovated in the later Hellenic period. Most of them
                    were founded by the Seleucid kings of Syria. Seleucus, founder of the dynasty,
                    is said by Appian to have named five cities after his mother Laodice. Many other
                    women of the family bore the same name, which also passed by marriage into the
                    family of the Pontic kings. The victories of Alexander introduced Greek
                    civilization over Asia; the organizing and city-building energy of his
                    successors established and consolidated it. They either founded new cities in
                    favourable situations or reorganized native cities after the Greek model: thus
                    over the immense realm of the Seleucidae from the Aegean Sea to the borders of
                    India we find numberless cities called Seleucia, Laodicea, &amp;c. So long as
                    Greek civilization held its ground, these were the great commercial and social
                    centres of the country. We find a Laodicea <hi rend="italic">ad Lyσum</hi> in
                    the Maeander valley, on the borders of Phrygia, Caria, and Lydia; another
                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Combusta</hi> on the borders of Phrygia, Lycaonia,
                    and Pisidia; a third in Pontus; a fourth, <hi rend="italic">αd mare,</hi> on the
                    coast of Syria; a fifth, <hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Libanum,</hi> beside the Lebanon mountains; and three others in the far
                    east—Media, Persia, and the lower Tigris valley. In the latter countries Greek
                    civilization was overwhelmed in Orientalism after a century or two, and the last
                    three cities disappeared; the other five continued great throughout the Greek
                    and Roman period, and the second, third, and fourth retain to the present day
                    the ancient name under the pronunciation Ladik, Ladikiyeh, or Latakia (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Latakia).</hi></p>
                <p>Laodicea ad Lycum was founded probably by Antiochus II. Theos (261-46 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> and named after his wife Laodice. Its site, called
                    by the Turks <hi rend="italic">Eski Hissar,</hi> “the old castle,” is now
                    solitary and deserted; but it retains an undying interest as one of the oldest
                    homes of Christianity and the seat of one of the seven churches of the
                    Apocalypse. Pliny tells us (v. 29) that the town was called in older times
                    Diospolis and Rhoas; but it is certain that at an early period Colossae, a few
                    miles to the east, and Hierapolis, six miles to the north, were the great cities
                    of the neighbourhood, and that Laodicea was a place of no importance till the
                    Seleucid <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> foundation (Str., p. 578). A favourable
                    site was found on some low’ hills of alluvial formation, about 2 miles south of
                    the river Lycus (Churuk Su) and 9 miles east of the confluence of the Lycus and
                    Maeander. Smaller rivers of the neighbourhood are the Asopus, Captus, and
                    Cadmus, the last named after the lofty range of Mount Cadmus (Baba Dagh), which
                    overhangs the Maeander valley on the south. The great trade route from the
                    Euphrates and the interior passed through Apamea to Laodicea. There it forked,
                    one branch going straight down the Maeander valley to Magnesia and thence north
                    to Ephesus, a distance of about 90 miles, and the other branch crossing the
                    mountains by an easy pass to Philadelphia and the Hermus valley, Sardis,
                    Thyatira, and at last Pergamus. St Paul (Col. iv. 15) alludes to the situation
                    of Laodicea beside Colossae and Hierapolis; and the order in which the last five
                    churches of the Apocalypse are enumerated (Rev. i. 11) is explained by their
                    position on the road just described. Placed in this important situation, in the
                    centre of a very fertile district, Laodicea became a rich city. It was famous
                    for its money transactions (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Ad Fam.,</hi> ii. 17; iii.
                    5), and for the beautiful soft wool grown by the sheep of the country (Str.,
                    578). Both points are referred to in the message to the church (Rev. it 17,
                    18).</p>
                <p>Little is known of the history of the town. It suffered greatly from a siege in
                    the Mithridatic war, hut soon recovered its prosperity under the Roman empire.
                    The Zeus of Laodicea, with the curious epithet Azeus or Azeis, is a frequent
                    symbol on the city coins, and is one of the widest-known deities of western Asia
                    Minor. He is represented standing, holding in the extended right hand an eagle,
                    in the left a spear, the hαstα purα. Not far from the city was the temple of Men
                    Karou, with a great medical school; while Laodicea itself produced some famous
                    Sceptic philosophers, and gave origin to the royal family of Polemon and Zenon,
                    whose curious history has been illustrated in recent times (Waddington, Mélanges
                    de Humism., ser. ii.; Mommsen, Ephem. Epigraph., i. and ii.; Rayet, Milet et le
                    Golfe Latmique, chap. v. ). The coinage of Laodicea continues in a rich unbroken
                    series to the time of the emperor Diocletian. Under the Byzantine rule its
                    greatness remained, but finally the city fell into decay in the frontier wars
                    with the Turkish invaders. Its ruins are of wide extent, but not of great beauty
                    or interest; there is no doubt, however, that much has been buried beneath the
                    surface by the frequent earthquakes to which the district is exposed (Str., 580;
                    Tac., Ann., xiv. 27). For an account of the ruins see the works of Leake,
                    Hamilton, Arundel, Texier, &amp;c., and especially the beautiful drawings of
                    Cockerell in the Antiquities of Ionia, vol. iii. pl. 47-51.</p>
