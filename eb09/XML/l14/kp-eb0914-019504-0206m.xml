                    obscure. His very name is doubtful; his birthplace, whether in Italy or in
                    Africa, is uncertain; it is impossible to say with any accuracy when his
                    writings were published; and the date of his death is unknown. His parents were
                    heathens; he was a pupil of Arnobius in Sicca in Africa; he went to Nicomedia in
                    Bithynia while Diocletian was emperor to teach rhetoric, but found little work
                    to do in that Greekspeaking city; he became a convert to Christianity, probably
                    late in life; and about ten or twelve years before his death (312-318) he went
                    to Gaul on the invitation of Constantine the Great, and became tutor to his
                    eldest son Crispus. These facts, with his writings, are all that is known about
                    Lactantius. His chief work <hi rend="italic">Divinarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutionum Libri Septem</hi> is a long introduction to Christianity, written
                    in exquisite Latin, but displaying such ignorance as to have incurred the charge
                    of favouring the Arian and Manichaean heresies. The date of publication has been
                    variously given from 302 to 323 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> One sentence
                    seems to say that a persecution, which can scarcely be any other than the
                    Diocletian, was raging while the book was being written (v. 17, 5); whilst in
                    the first, second, fourth, and fifths books Constantine is addressed as emperor.
                    Those who assert the earlier date of publication point out that the references
                    to Constantine are omitted in several MSS. Others adopt the conjecture of Baluze
                    that an early edition was published in Nicomedia and a later twenty years
                    afterwards <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Ebert, <hi rend="italic">üeber</hi><hi

                    them either by the author or by a later editor. The first, <hi rend="italic">De

                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine Erroris,</hi> attack the polytheism of
                    heathendom, show the unity of the God of creation and providence, and try to
                    explain how men have wandered from truth into polytheistic error. The third
                    book, <hi rend="italic">De Falsa</hi><hi rend="italic">Sapientia,</hi> describes
                    and criticizes the various systems of prevalent philosophy, showing how baseless
                    and contradictory they are. The fourth book, <hi rend="italic">De Vera</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sapientia et Religione,</hi> insists upon the inseparable union of
                    true wisdom and true religion, and maintains that this union is made real in the
                    person of Christ. The fifth book, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Justitia,</hi> maintains that true righteousness is not to be found apart from
                    Christianity, and that it springs from piety which consists in the knowledge of
                    God. The sixth book, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vero Cultu,</hi>
                    describes the true worεhip of God, which is righteousness, and consists chiefly
                    in the exercise of Christian love towards God and man. The seventh book, <hi
                    rend="italic">De Vita Beata,</hi> discusses, among a variety of subjects, the
                    chief good, immortality, the second advent, and the resurrection. Jerome tells
                    us that Lactantius wrote an epitome of these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutions,</hi> and such a work was discovered in the royal library at Turin
                    in 1712 by C. M. Pfaff; it is doubtful, however, whether this MS. is the epitome
                    of Lactantius. Besides the <hi rend="italic">Institutions,</hi> Lactantius wrote
                    a treatise, <hi rend="italic">De Ira Dei,</hi> addressed to one Donatus and
                    directed against the Epicurean philosophy; an argument for the wisdom and
                    goodness of God as exhibited in the creation and preservation of the world, <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Opificio</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei sive
                    de</hi><hi rend="italic">Formatione Hominis</hi>; and a very celebrated treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mortibus Persecutorum,</hi> which
                    describes God’s judgments on the persecutors of his church from Nero to
                    Diocletian, and has served as a model for numberless subsequent writings of a
                    like nature. <hi rend="italic">De Mort. Persecut.</hi> is not included in the
                    earlier editions of Lactantius; it was discovered and printed by Baluze in 1679.
                    Many critics do not believe it to be the work of our author, and ascribe it to
                    an unknown Lucius Caecilius (see the work of Ebert above quoted). Jerome speaks
                    of Lactantius as a poet, and several poems have been attributed to him :— <hi
                    rend="italic">De Phenice, Symposium, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pascha</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Felicem Episcopum,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Passione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Domini.</hi> It is extremely probable that all these are the productions of a
                    much later age.</p>
                <p>MSS. of Lactantius are very numerous; a very complete catalogue of these and of
                    the earlier printed editions will be found in Le Brun and Lenglet Dufresnoy’s
                    edition, 2 vols. Paris, 1748. The best editions besides Dufresnoy’s are those of
                    Walch, Leipsic, 1715; of Biinemann, Leipsic, 1739; and in Migne’s Ραtrologiα
                    Latina, vols. vi. and vii. A new edition is promised in the Vienna Corpus
                    Script. Eccles. Latin.</p>
