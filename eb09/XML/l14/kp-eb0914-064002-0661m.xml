                    Lilburn would quarrel with John, and John with Lilburn.” He appears at one time
                    to have been law-clerk to Prynne. In February 1638, for the part he had taken in
                    importing and circulating the <hi rend="italic">Merry Litany</hi> and other
                    publications of Bastwick and Prynne, offensive to the bishops, he was sentenced
                    to be publicly whipped from the Fleet prison to Palace Yard, Westminster, there
                    to stand for two hours in the pillory, and afterwards to be kept in jail until a
                    fine of £500 had been paid. Though gagged at the pillory, and confined in
                    prison, he was not the man to give up his opinions or forego the pleasure of
                    expressing them, and in the following year he did not improve his prospects of a
                    speedy release by the kind of literary activity to which he devoted his enforced
                    leisure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    the House of Commons. In 1641 he received an indemnity of £3000. He now entered
                    the army, and in 1642 was taken prisoner at Brentford and tried for his life;
                    sentence would no doubt have been executed had not the parliament by threatening
                    reprisals forced his exchange. He soon rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel,
                    but in April 1645, having become dissatisfied with the general conduct of
                    affairs, and especially with the predominance of Presbyterianism, he resigned
                    his commission, presenting at the same time to the Commons a petition for
                    considerable arrears of pay. His violent language in Westminster Hall about the
                    speaker and other public men led in the following July to his arrest and
                    committal to Newgate, whence he was discharged, however, without trial, by order
                    of the House, in October. In January 1647 he was again committed to the Tower
                    for accusations which he had brought against Cromwell, but was again set at
                    liberty in time to become a disappointed spectator of the failure of the
                    levelling or ultrademocratic party in the army at the Ware rendezvous in the
                    following December. The scene produced a deep impression on his mind, and in
                    February 1649 he along with other petitioners presented to the House of Commons
                    a paper entitled <hi rend="italic">The Serious Apprehensions of a part of the
                    People on behalf of the Commonwealth,</hi> which he followed up with a pamphlet,
                    <hi rend="italic">England's New Chains Discovered</hi> (March 1, 1649),
                    criticizing Ireton, and another exposing the conduct of Cromwell, Ireton, and
                    other leaders of the army since June 1647 <hi rend="italic">{The Hunting of the

                    violent outburst against “the dominion of a council of state, and a constitution
                    of a new and unexperienced nature,” became the subject of discussion in the
                    House, and led anew to the imprisonment of its author in the Tower on April 11.
                    His trial in the following October, on a charge of seditious and scandalous
                    practices against the state, resulted in his unanimous acquittal, followed by
                    his release in November. In January 1652, for printing and publishing a petition
                    against Sir Arthur Hasilrig and the Haberdasher’s Hall for what he conceived to
                    have been an injury done to his uncle George Lilburne in 1649, he was sentenced
                    to pay fines amounting to £7000, and moreover to be banished the Commonwealth,
                    with prohibition of return under the pain of death. In June 1653 he nevertheless
                    came back from the Low Countries, where he had busied himself during the
                    interval in pamphleteering and such other agitation as was possible, and was
                    immediately arrested; the trial, which was protracted from July 13 to August 20,
                    indeed issued in his acquittal, to the great joy of London, but it was
                    nevertheless thought proper to keep him in captivity for “the peace of the
                    nation.” He was detained successively in the Tower, in a castle at Jersey, and
                    in Dover Castle. At Dover he came under Quaker influence, and signified his
                    readiness at last to be done with “carnal sword fightings and fleshly bustlings
                    and contests”; and in 1656, on giving security for his good behaviour, he was
                    set free. He now settled at Eltham in Kent, frequently preaching at Quaker
                    meetings in the place and neighbourhood during the brief remainder of his
                    troubled life. He died on August 29, 1657.</p>

                    makes John more of a hero than Godwin does, though Godwin is not unfavourable.

                    England, but think he was an ass.”</p>
