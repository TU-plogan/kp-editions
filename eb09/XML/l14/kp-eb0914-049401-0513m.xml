                    (1774-1809), American explorer, was born near Charlottesville, Virginia, August
                    18, 1774. In 1794 he volunteered with the troops called out to suppress the
                    “whisky insurrection,” was commissioned as ensign in the regular army in 1795,
                    and as captain in 1800, and was President Jefferson’s private secretary from
                    1801 to 1803. On Jefferson’s recommendation he was appointed by Congress to
                    conduct, in connexion with Captain William Clarke, an expedition to the
                    headwaters of the Missouri river, and thence across the mountains to the Pacific
                    Ocean—the first extended exploration of the north-western portion of the *United
                    States. The States had as yet acquired no claim to this region, and the
                    exploration was designed by Jefferson in the interests not only of geographical
                    science but of territorial acquisition. Lewis and Clarke, setting out late in
                    1803 with twenty-eight men, spent the winter at the mouth of the Missouri. Early
                    in the spring the party embarked in several boats, and during the summer made
                    the difficult ascent of the Missouri as far as 47° 2Γ N. lat., where the second
                    winter was passed among the Mandan Indians. In 1805 the ascent of the Missouri
                    was continued as far as the tributary which they named Jefferson river, which
                    was followed to its source in the south-western part of what is now Montana
                    territory. Procuring a guide and horses from the Shoshone Indians, they pushed
                    westward through the mountains, and on October 7 embarked in canoes on a
                    tributary of the Columbia river, the mouth of which they reached on November 15.
                    They had travelled upwards of 4000 miles from their starting point, had
                    encountered various Indian tribes never before seen by whites, had made
                    scientific collections and observations, and were the first explorers to reach
                    the Pacific by crossing the continent north of Mexico. After spending the winter
                    upon the Columbia, they made the return journey across the mountains and down
                    the Missouri, reaching the Mississippi in September 1806. The reports of the
                    Lewis and Clarke expedition attracted great attention at the time, and it has
                    scarcely been exceeded in romantic interest by later explorations in any quarter
                    of the globe. The leaders and men of the exploring party were rewarded with
                    liberal grants of land, and Lewis was made governor of the territory of
                    Missouri. In the unwonted quiet of his new duties his mind, always subject to
                    melancholy, became unbalanced, and, while on his way to Washington, he committed
                    suicide near Nashville, Tennessee, October 11, 1809.</p>
