                <p>Copyright, 1882, by John Bigelow.</p>
                <p>MARIE JEAN PAUL ROCH YVES GILBERT MOTIER, MARQUIS DE LA FAYETTER (1757-1834), was
                    born at the château of Chavagniac in Auvergne, France, September 6, 1757. Left
                    an orphan with a princely fortune at the tender age of thirteen, he married at
                    sixteen a daughter of the Due d’Ayen and granddaughter of the Due de Noailles,
                    then one of the most influential families in the kingdom. In selecting a career,
                    the choice of a young man of his rank in France at that time was practically
                    limited to the court or the camp. He chose to follow the career of his father,
                    and entered the Guards.</p>
                <p>La Fayette was nineteen years of age and a captain of dragoons when the English
                    colonies in America proclaimed their independence. “At the first news of this
                    quarrel,’’ he afterwards wrote in his memoirs, “my heart was enrolled in it.”
                    The count de Broglie, whom he consulted, discouraged his zeal for the cause of
                    liberty. “I have seen your uncle die in the wars of Italy; I witnessed your
                    father’s death at the battle of Minden; and I will not be accessory to the ruin
                    of the only remaining branch of the family.” Finding his purpose unchangeable,
                    however, the count presented the young enthusiast to the Baron de Kalb, who was
                    also seeking service in America, and through Deane, an American agent in Paris,
                    an arrangement was concluded, December 7,1776, by which La Fayette was to enter
                    the American service as major-general. At this critical moment the news arrived
                    of a series of grave disasters to the American arms, including the evacuation of
                    New York. La Fayette’s friends again advised him to abandon his purpose. Even
                    the American envoys, Franklin and Lee, who had superseded Deane the very day
                    after the contract was signed, and who did not feel authorized to confirm his
                    engagements, deemed it their duty to withhold any further encouragement of the
                    plans of the marquis, and the king himself forbade his leaving. So far from
                    being discouraged by these difficulties La Fayette proceeded to purchase a ship
                    on his own account, and to invite such of his friends as were willing to share
                    his fortunes. The British ambassador at Versailles remonstrated, and at his
                    instance orders were issued to seize the ship then fitting out at Bordeaux, and
                    La Fayette himself was arrested. But the ship was sent from Bordeaux to the
                    neighbouring port of Pasajes in Spain, La Fayette escaped from the custody of
                    his guards in disguise, and before a second <hi rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de cachet</hi> could reach him he was afloat with eleven chosen
                    companions. Though two British cruisers had been sent in pursuit of him, he
                    effected a safe landing near Georgetown in South Carolina, after a tedious
                    voyage of nearly two months, and hastened to Philadelphia, then the seat of
                    government of the colonies.</p>
                <p>When this lad of nineteen, with the command of only what little English he had
                    been able to pick up on his voyage, presented himself to the Congress of the
                    Revolution, then sitting in Philadelphia, with Deane’s authority to demand a
                    commission of the highest rank after the commander-in-chief, it is not
                    surprising that his reception seemed to him a little chilly. Nor did he then
                    know all the disadvantages under which he presented himself. Deane’s contracts
                    were so numerous, and for officers of such high rank, that it was quite
                    impossible for Congress t) ratify them without injustice to Americans who had
                    become entitled by their service to promotion. La Fayette appreciated the
                    situation as soon as it was explained to him, and immediately addressed a note
                    to the president of Congress, in which he expressed his desire to be permitted
                    to serve in the American army upon two conditions,—that he should receive no
                    pay, and that he should act as a volunteer. These terms were so different from
                    those made <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n213/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0213-0202"/> by other foreigners, they had been attended with
                    such substantial sacrifices, and they promised such substantial indirect
                    advantages, that Congress had no hesitation in passing a resolution, on the 31st
                    of July 1777, “that his services be accepted, and that, in consideration of his
                    zeal, illustrious family, and connexions, he have the rank and commission of
                    major-general of the United States.” Next day La Fayette met Washington, who
                    invited him to make the quarters of the commander-in-chief his own, and to
                    consider himself at all times as one of his family. This invitation, as useful
                    as it was flattering to the young officer, was joyfully accepted, and thus
                    commenced a friendship which only death terminated. La Fayette was now anxious
                    to have active employment, but it appeared that Congress intended his
                    appointment as purely honorary, and the question of giving him a command was
                    left entirely to Washington’s discretion. At the time La Fayette went into camp
                    the British commander was trying to secure possession of Philadelphia and the
                    line of the Hudson from the Canadian frontier to New York, which, if
                    accomplished, might prove fatal to the American cause. By the capture of
                    Burgoyne at Saratoga, on the 17th of October 1777, that portion of the scheme
                    was effectually spoiled. In the southern campaign the British arms were more
                    fortunate. The fall of Philadelphia was one of the immediate results of the
                    battle of Brandywine on the 11th of September. This was the first battle in
                    which La Fayette was engaged, and in an attempt to rally his troops in their
                    retreat he had the good fortune to receive a musket ball in his leg. We say good
                    fortune, for it doubtless secured him what of all things in the world he most
                    desired, the command of a division—the immediate result of a communication from
                    Washington to Congress of November 1, 1777, in which among other things he said
                    :—</p>
                <p>“The Marquis de la Fayette is extremely solicitous of having a command equal to
                    his rank. I do not know in what light Congress will view the matter, but it
                    appears to me, from a consideration of his illustrious and important connexions,
                    the attachment which he has manifested for our cause, and the consequences which
                    his return in disgust might produce, that it will be advisable to gratify his
                    wishes, and the more so as several gentlemen from France who came over under
                    some assurances have gone back disappointed in their expectations. His conduct
                    with respect to them stands in a favourable point of view,—having interested
                    himself to remove their uneasiness and urged the impropriety of their making any
                    unfavourable representations upon their arrival at home. Besides, he is
                    sensible, discreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language,
                    and from the disposition he discovered at the battle of Brandywine possesses a
                    large share of bravery and military ardour.”</p>
                <p>The recommendation of Washington was conclusive, and La Fayette’s happiness was
                    now complete. Barely twenty years of age, he found himself invested with a most
                    honourable rank, purchased by his blood in fighting at once to secure the
                    independence of a strange people and to punish the enemies of his own. He had
                    justified the boyish rashness which his friends deplored and his sovereign
                    resented, and had already acquired a place in history.</p>
                <p>Of La Fayette’s military career in the United States there is not much to be
                    said. Though the commander of a division, he never had the command of many
                    troops, and whatever military talents he possessed were not of the kind which
                    appeared to conspicuous advantage on the theatre to which his wealth and family
                    influence rather than his soldierly gifts had called him, He fought at the
                    battle of Monmouth in 1778, and received from Congress a. formal recognition of
                    his services in the field, and of his probably more valuable exertions in
                    healing dissensions between the French and native officers. His retreat from
                    Barren Hill was also commended as masterly.</p>
                <p>The treaty of commerce and defensive alliance, signed by the insurgents and
                    France on the 6th of February 1778, was promptly followed by a declaration of
                    war by England against the latter, and La Fayette felt it to be his duty to ask
                    leave to revisit France and copsuit his king as to the farther direction of his
                    services. This leave was readily granted; it was not difficult for Washington to
                    replace the major-general, but it was impossible to find another equally
                    competent, influential, and devoted champion of the American cause near the
                    court of Louis XVI. In fact, he went on a mission rather than a visit. He
                    embarked in January 1779, and on the 4th of March following Franklin wrote to
                    the president of Congress: “The Marquis de la Fayette, who during his stay in
                    France has been extremely zealous on all occasions, returns again to fight for
                    it. He is infinitely esteemed and beloved here, and I am persuaded will do
                    everything in his power to merit a continuance of the same affection from
                    America.”</p>
                <p>La Fayette was absent from America about six months, and his return was the
                    occasion of a complimentary resolution of Congress. From this time until October
                    1781 he was charged with the defence of Virginia, in which Washington gave him
                    the credit of doing all that was possible with the forces at his disposal; and
                    he showed his zeal by borrowing money from the bankers in Baltimore on his own
                    account to provide his soldiers with necessaries. The battle of Yorktown, in
                    which La Fayette bore an honourable if not a distinguished part, was the last
                    serious trouble of the war, and terminated his military career in the United
                    States. He immediately sought and obtained leave to return to France, where it
                    was supposed he might be useful in the negotiations looking to a general peace,
                    of which prospects had begun to dawn. He was also much occupied in the
                    preparations for a combined French and Spanish expedition against some of the
                    British West India Islands, of which he had been appointed chief of staff, and a
                    formidable fleet had already assembled at Cadiz, when, on the 30th of November
                    1782, the preliminary treaties of peace between the several belligerents put an
                    end to the war. To La Fayette was accorded the grateful privilege of first
                    communicating this welcome intelligence to Congress. He returned to his native
                    land one of the heroes of a noble conflict, and fortified with the most
                    flattering testimonials from his commander-in-chief and from the Government he
                    had served, which were crowned by a notification from the French minister of war
                    that he should have the same rank in the army of his sovereign that he had held
                    in America, his commission to date from the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown.
                    He visited the United States again in 1784, to gratify his curiosity as well as
                    his affections, and while he remained—some five months— was the guest of the
                    nation, and received every mark of public and private consideration which h⅛
                    hosts supposed would be acceptable.</p>
                <p>La Fayette did not appear again in public life until 1787, when he took his seat
                    in the Assembly of Notables. From this time till near the close of the
                    Revolution he was a conspicuous figure in the history of France, and almost the
                    only one who, at no stage of that cycle of horrors, seems to have lost his
                    reason or his humanity.</p>
                <p>When the States-General, convened after the Assembly of Notables had proved
                    wholly unequal to its task, met at Versailles in May 1789 the throne was
                    occupied by a shadow. The royal authority was gone. France was already, though
                    few if any, and least of all the sovereign, suspected it, in full revolution. On
                    the 11th of July 1789 La l⅜yette presented to the National Assembly, into which
                    the States-General had been fused, a declaration of rights, modelled on
                    Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence in 1776. The struggle between the
                    expiring monarchy and popular sovereignty was already big with the horrors of
                    the French Revolution. The palace and the assembly were guarded by troops; a
                    national guard was organized, which soon embraced the whole kingdom, and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n214/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0214-0203"/> numbered over three millions of men, the command
                    of which was confided to La Fayette. For the succeeding three years, until the
                    -end of the constitutional monarchy in 1792, his history is largely the history
                    of France. His life was beset with inconceivable responsibility and perils, for
                    he was ever the minister of humanity and order among a frenzied people who had
                    come to regard order and humanity as phases of treason. He rescued the queen
                    from the murderous hands of the populace on the 5th and 6th of October 1789, not
                    to speak of multitudes of humbler victims who had been devoted to death. He
                    risked his life in many unsuccessful attempts to rescue others. He was obliged
                    to witness the butchery of Foulon, and the reeking heart of Berthier torn from
                    his lifeless body and held up in triumph before him. Disgusted with enormities
                    which he was powerless to prevent and could not countenance, he resigned his
                    commission; but so impossible was it to replace him that he was induced to
                    resume it. In the Constituent Assembly, of which he was a member, his influence
                    was always felt in favour of Republican principles, for the abolition of
                    arbitrary imprisonment, for religious tolerance, for popular representation, for
                    the establishment of trial by jury, for the gradual emancipation of slaves, for
                    the freedom of the press, for the abolition of titles of nobility, and the
                    suppression of privileged orders. When the Constitution was proclaimed, on the
                    14th of July 1790, the first anniversary of the destruction of the Bastille, he
                    again and definitively resigned his command, and retired to private life.
                    Shortly after his resignation he was invited by the friends of liberty with
                    order to stand for the office of mayor of Paris. By a strange madness the
                    remnants of the royal party supported his competitor Péthion, the most rancorous
                    of Jacobins, and were for the royal family but too fatally successful.</p>
                <p>The royalist party, and certain members of the royal family who had taken refuge
                    in frontier states, were already intriguing with the Austrian Government to
                    march an army into France and restore absolutism, while the king, after an
                    unsuccessful attempt to escape from France, was reduced to the humiliating
                    necessity of declaring war against Austria and her allies. Three armies of
                    50,000 each were levied. Of one of these the command was given to La Fayette.
                    But it was with sad misgivings that the general left his country retreat to take
                    this command. As he passed through Paris the president of the Assembly said to
                    him in full session that “the nation would oppose to its enemies the
                    constitution and La Fayette”; but what was to be expected of a war conducted by
                    a king in secret league with the nation’s enemies, or of a legislature
                    conspiring to destroy the king and constitution to which they had only just
                    sworn allegiance and support? La Fayette’s loyalty to his king, to his
                    constitution, and to his country seemed only to strengthen as the situation grew
                    desperate. Four days before the outrages which occurred at the Tuileries on the
                    16th June 1792 he publicly denounced the Jacobin Club, and called upon the
                    Assembly to suppress them. Henceforth he became the special object of Jacobin
                    rage. On the 8th of August a motion was made to have him arrested, and tried as
                    an enemy of his country. Though the motion was defeated by 446 votes against
                    224, scarce two days elapsed before tho palace was stormed, and the king and
                    queen were sent to the prison from which they passed to the scaffold.</p>
                <p>With the destruction of the constitution, the monarchy, and the Government, La
                    Fayette’s occupation as the priest of liberty, humanity, and order was gone. He
                    would have marched to Paris to defend the constitution, but his troops were too
                    generally infected with the sentiments which triumphed in the disorders of the
                    10th of August. He was compelled to take refuge in the neutral territory of
                    Liège, where he was taken by the Austrians and held as a prisoner of state for
                    five years, first in Prussian and afterwards in Austrian prisons, in spite of
                    the intercession of America and the pleadings of his wife. Napoleon, however,
                    who called him a “noodle,” stipulated for his release, 19th September 1797. He
                    was not allowed to return to France by the Directory; when he did, it was to
                    vote against the life consulate of Napoleon, as he, later on, voted against the
                    imperial title. Many years of his life were then spent in retirement at the
                    castle of La Grange. He was called from it to become vice-president of the
                    Assembly, under Louis XVIΠ., before the battle of Waterloo. He afterwards sat
                    for Meaux and became a frequent speaker upon foreign politics and military
                    economy. But his early influence was gone, except in America, to which he
                    returned in 1824, to be overwhelmed with popular applause and to be voted the
                    sum of $200,000 and a township of land. During the Revolution of 1830 he again
                    took command of the National Guard and pursued the same line* of conduct, with
                    equal want of success, as in the first Revolution. In 1834 he made his last
                    speech,—on political refugees. He died at Paris, May 20, 1834.</p>
                <p>Few men have owed more of their success and usefulness in the world to their
                    family rank than La Fayette, and still fewer have abused it less. He never
                    achieved distinction in the field, and his political career proved him to be
                    incapable of ruling a great national movement; but he had strong convictions
                    which always impelled him to study the interests of humanity, and a pertinacity
                    in maintaining them, which, in all the marvellous vicissitudes of his singularly
                    eventful life, secured him a very unusual measure of public respect. No citizen
                    of a foreign country has ever had so many and such warm admirers in America, nor
                    does any statesman in France appear to have ever possessed uninterruptedly for
                    so many years so large a measure of popular influence and respect. He had what
                    Jefferson called a “canine appetite” for popularity and fame, but in him the
                    appetite only seemed to make him more anxious to merit the fame which he
                    enjoyed. He was brave even to rashness; his life was one of constant personal
                    peril, and yet he never shrank from any danger or responsibility if he saw the
                    way open to spare life or suffering, to protect the defenceless, to sustain tho
                    law and preserve order.</p>
