                    London on 21st April 1806. l·Iis father, Thomas F. Lewis of Harpton Court,
                    Radnorshire, after holding subordinate office in various administrations became
                    a poor-law commissioner. He was made a baronet in 1846. Lewis was educated at
                    Eton, and at Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he took a first-class in
                    classics and a second-class in mathematics. He then entered the Middle Temple,
                    and was called to the bar in 1831. In the year before he had, with John Romilly
                    and John Stuart Mill, attended the celebrated lectures on jurisprudence
                    delivered by John Austin at London University. In 1832 he undertook his first
                    public work as one of the commissioners to inquire into the condition of the
                    poor Irish residents in the United Kingdom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    affairs generally in Ireland. To this fact we owe his work on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church Question</hi> (London,
                    1836), in which he condemned the existing connexion between church and state,
                    proposed a state provision for the Catholic clergy, and maintained the necessity
                    of an efficient workhouse organization. During this period of apprenticeship to
                    politics Lewis’s mind was much occupied with the phenomena of language. Before
                    leaving college he had published some observations on Whately’s doctrine of the
                    predicables, and soon afterwards he assisted Thirlwall and Hare in starting the
                        <hi rend="italic">Philological Museum.</hi> Its successor, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Classical Museum,</hi> he also supported by occasional
                    contributions. In 1835 he published an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Origin and
                        Formation of the liomance Languages</hi> (re-edited in 1862), which, though
                    anticipated by Schlegel, may be taken as the first effective criticism in
                    England of Raynouard’s theory of a uniform romance tongue, represented by the
                    poetry of the troubadours. He also set an excellent example to county gentlemen
                    by compiling a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire and the
                    adjoining counties. But the most important work of this earlier period was one
                    to which his logical and philological tastes both contributed. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political Terms</hi>
                    (London, 1832) may have been suggested by Bentham’s <hi rend="italic">Look of
                        Parliamentary Fallacies,</hi> but it shows all that power of clear sober
                    original thinking which marks his larger and later political works. And yet this
                    original mind did more than most scholars in the humbler walk of useful
                    translation. He translated Boeckh’s <hi rend="italic">Public Economy of
                        Athens</hi> and Miiller’s <hi rend="italic">History of Greek
                        Literature,</hi> and he assisted Tufnell in the translation<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0512-0493"/> of Miiller’s <hi rend="italic">Dorians.</hi>
                    Some time afterwards he edited a text of the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of
                    Babrius. While his friend Hayward conducted the <hi rend="italic">Law
                        Magazine,</hi> he wrote in it frequently on such subjects as secondary
                    punishments and the penitentiary system. In 1836, at the request of Lord
                    Glenelg, he accompanied John Austin to Malta, where they spent nearly two years
                    reporting on the condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One
                    leading object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese in the
                    responsible government of the dependency. On his return to England Lewis
                    succeeded his father as one of the principal poor-law commissioners. But his
                    literary activity did not cease. In 1841 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                        the Government of Dependencies,</hi> a systematic statement and discussion
                    of the various relations in which colonies may stand towards the mother country.
                    In 1844 Lewis married Lady Maria Theresa Lister, sister of Lord Clarendon, and a
                    lady of literary tastes. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House,
                    Knightsbridge. They had no children. In 1847 Lewis resigned his office. He was
                    then returned for the county of Hereford, and Lord John Russell appointed him
                    secretary to the Board of Control, but a few months afterwards he became under
                    secretary to the Home Office. In this capacity he introduced two important
                    bills, one for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management of highways
                    by a mixed county board, the other for the purpose of defining and regulating
                    the law of parochial assessment. On the latter subject his evidence before the
                    select committee (Lords) of 1850 is the clearest statement of general results
                    which we have. In that year he succeeded Hayter as financial secretary to the
                    Treasury. About this time, also, appeared his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                        Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion.</hi> Lewis seems to have
                    thought that authority was too much divided to be of much use in theological
                    matters, while in the world of science he found sufficient authority for
                    declaring that homoeopathy, mesmerism, and phrenology were all impostures. On
                    the dissolution of parliament which followed the resignation of Lord John
                    Russell’s ministry in 1852, Lewis was defeated for Herefordshire and then for
                    Peterborough. Excluded from parliament he accepted the editorship of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> which the death of Empson had left
                    vacant. Lord Halifax offered him, in 1853, the governorship of Bombay, but he
                    remained editor until 1855. During this period he did some public work on the
                    Oxford commission, and on the commission to inquire into the government of
                    London. But its chief fruits were the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Methods
                        of Observation and Reasoning in Politics,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Enquiry into the Credibility of the Early Roman History,</hi><note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Translated into German by
                            Liebrecht, ∏anover, 1858.</p></note> in which he vigorously attacks the
                    theory of epic lays and other theories on which Niebuhr’s reconstruction of that
                    history had proceeded. In 1855 Lewis succeeded his father in the baronetcy. He
                    was at once elected member for the Radnor boroughs, and Lord Palmerston made him
                    chancellor of the exchequer. The position was difficult, for he had a war loan
                    to contract and heavy additional taxation to impose. But his industry, method,
                    and clear vision carried him safely through. His financial statement of 13th
                    February 1857, and his speech on 12th February</p>
                <p>1858 on the bill for the better government of India were most successful efforts.
                    After the change of ministry in</p>
                <p>1859 Sir George became home secretary under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, much
                    against his wish, he succeeded Sidney Herbert (Lord Herbert of Lea) at the War
                    Office. The closing years of his life were marked by increasing intellectual
                    vigour. In 1859 he published an able <hi rend="italic">Essay on Foreign
                        Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals,</hi> a subject to which the
                    attempt on Napoleon’s life, the discussions on the Conspiracy Bill, and the
                    trial of Bernard, had drawn general attention. He advocated the extension of
                    extradition treaties, and condemned the principal idea of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Weltrechtsordnung</hi> which Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed. His two
                    latest works were the <hi rend="italic">Survey of the Astronomy of the
                        Ancients,</hi> in which, without professing any knowledge of Oriental
                    languages, he applies a sceptical analysis to the ambitious Egyptology of
                    Bunsen; and the <hi rend="italic">Dialogue on the Best Form of Government,</hi>
                    in which, under the name of Crito, the author points out to the supporters of
                    the various systems that there is no one abstract government which is the best
                    possible for all times and places. An essay on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Characteristics of Federal, National, Provincial, and Municipal
                        Government</hi> does not seem to have been published. Sir George died in
                    April 1863. A marble bust by Weekes stands in Westminster Abbey. He has two
                    other monuments—the reprint from the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> of
                    his long series of papers on the <hi rend="italic">Administrations of Great
                        Britain</hi> (1864), and his <hi rend="italic">Letters to various
                        Friends</hi> (1870), edited by his brother, who succeeded him in the
                    baronetcy.</p>
                <p>Lewis was a man of mild and affectionate disposition, much beloved by a large
                    circle of friends, among whom were Sir E. Head, the Grotes, the Austins, Lord
                    Stanhope, J. S. Mill, Dean Milman, the Duff Gordons. In public life he was
                    distinguished, says Lord Aberdeen, “for candour, moderation, love of truth.” He
                    had a passion for the systematic acquirement of knowledge, and a keen and sound
                    critical faculty. Nothing is more remarkable than the practical good sense of
                    his speculative writings. Sometimes he betrayed a slight intellectual
                    impatience: but this was merely the passing irritation of a healthy and modest
                    judgment.</p>
