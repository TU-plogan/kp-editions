                    he commenced master of arts. On his father’s death in 1671, removing to England,
                    he entered himself as a student of law at the Temple, but soon afterwards turned
                    his attention to theology, and took orders in 1680. Seven years later he became
                    chancellor of the cathedral of Connor and a justice of the peace, and began a
                    long career of public controversy by responding in public disputation at
                    Monaghan to the challenge of the Roman Catholic bishop of Clogher. Although an
                    eager and uncompromising opponent of Roman Catholicism, Leslie was a firm
                    supporter of the Stuart dynasty, and, having declined at the Revolution to take
                    the oath to William and Mary, he was on this account deprived of his benefice.
                    In 1689 the growing troubles in Ireland induced him to withdraw to England,
                    where he employed himself for the next twenty years in writing various
                    controversial pamphlets in favour of the nonjuring cause, and in numerous
                    polemics against the Quakers, Jews, Socinians, and Papists, and especially in
                    that against the Deists with which his name is now most commonly associated. A
                    warrant having been issued against him in 1710 for his pamphlet <hi
                    rend="italic">The Good Old Cause, or Lying in Truth,</hi> he in that year
                    resolved to quit England and to accept an offer made by the Pretender (with whom
                    he had previously been in frequent correspondence) that he should reside with
                    him at Bar-le-duc. After the failure of the Stuart cause in 1715, Leslie
                    accompanied his patron into Italy, where he remained until 1721, in which year,
                    having found his sojourn amongst Roman Catholics extremely unpleasant, he sought
                    and obtained permission to return to his native country. He died at Glaslough,
                    Monaghan, on April 13, 1722.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Theological JVorks</hi> of Leslie were collected and
                    published by himself in 2 vols, folio in 1721; a later edition, slightly
                    enlarged, appeared at Oxford in 1832 (7 vols. 8vo). They handle the controverted
                    points of which they treat with considerable force of argument and vigour of
                    style; he had the somewhat rare distinction of making several converts by his
                    reasonings, and probably persons might still be found who are prepared to concur
                    in Dr Johnson’s dictum that “Leslie was a reasoner, and a reasoner who was not
                    to be reasoned against.” But the questions in dispute are no longer discussed on
                    the basis which seems to have been pretty unanimously accepted by the orthodox
                    theologians of that age. This is sufficiently seen when the promise given in the
                    title of his best-known work is contrasted with the actual performance. The book
                    professes to be <hi rend="italic">A Short and Easy Method with the Deists,
                    wherein the certainty of the Christian Religion is Demonstrated by Infallible
                    Proof from Four Rules, which are incompatible to any imposture that over yet has
                    been, or that can possibly be</hi> (1697). The four rules which, according to
                    Leslie, have only to be rigorously applied in order to establish not the
                    probability merely but the absolute certainty of the truth of Christianity are
                    simply these:—(1) that the matter of fact be such as that men’s outward senses,
                    their eyes and ears, may be judges of it; (2) that it be done publicly, in the
                    face of the world; (3) that not only public monuments be kept up in memory of
                    it, but some outward actions be performed; (4) that such monuments and such
                    actions or observances be instituted and do commence from the time that the
                    matter of fact was done. Other publications of Leslie are <hi rend="italic">The
                    Snake in the Grass</hi> (1696), against the Quakers; <hi rend="italic">A Short
                    Method with the</hi> Jews(1689); <hi rend="italic">The Socinian Controversy
                    Discussed</hi> (1697); <hi rend="italic">The True Notion of the Catholic
                    Church</hi> (1703); and <hi rend="italic">The Case Stated between the Church of
                    Rome and the Church of England</hi> (1713).</p>
