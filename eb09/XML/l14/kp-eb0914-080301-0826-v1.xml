                <p><label type="entry">LOGOS</label>. This term is one of the most constant factors
                    in ancient speculation. As it is double-sided, however, expressing both <hi
                        rend="italic">reason</hi> and <hi rend="italic">word,</hi> the conceptions
                    which it covers differ widely. Taken broadly the doctrine of the Logos may be
                    said to have run in two parallel courses— the one philosophical, the other
                    theological; the one the development of the Logos as reason, the other the
                    development of the Logos as word; the one Hellenic, the other Hebrew.</p>
                <p>1. To the Greek mind, which saw in the world a <hi rend="italic">κόσμος,</hi> it
                    was natural to regard the world as the product of reason, and reason as the
                    ruling principle in the world. So we find a Logos doctrine more or less
                    prominent from the dawn of Hellenic thought to its eclipse. It rises in the
                    realm of physical speculation, passes over into the territory of ethics and
                    theology, and makes its way through at least three well-defined stages. These
                    are marked off by the names of Heraclitus of Ephesus, the Stoics, and Philo.</p>
                <p>It acquires its first importance in the theories of Heraclitus. There it is
                    intimately associated with the dominant ideas of a flux in all things, and of
                    fire as the material substrate or primary form of existence. On the one hand the
                    Logos is identified with <hi rend="italic">γνώμη</hi> and connected with δόσ;,
                    which latter seems to have the function of correcting deviations from the
                    eternal law that rules in things. On the other hand it is not positively
                    distinguished either from the ethereal fire, or from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >tlμapμevη</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">ανάγκη</hi> according to which all
                    things occur. In consistency with his hylozoic doctrine Heraclitus holds that
                    nothing material can be thought of without this Logos, but he does not conceive
                    the Logos itself to be immaterial. Whether it is regarded as in any sense
                    possessed of intelligence and consciousness is a question variously answered.
                    But there is most to say for the negative. This Logos is not one above the world
                    or prior to it, but in the world and inseparable from it. Man’s soul is a part
                    of it. It is <hi rend="italic">relation,</hi> therefore, as Schleiermacher
                    expresses it, or reason, not speech or word. And it is objective, not
                    subjective, reason. The process of transition between opposites, in which all
                    things are involved, is a process according to orderly relations and definite
                    measures, and the Logos is the eternal principle of this world-process which
                    shows itself in the form of a constant conflict between opposites. Like a law of
                    nature, objective in the world, it gives order and regularity to the movement of
                    things, and makes the system rational.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Between Heraclitus and the Stoics comparatively little was done in developing a
                    special Logos doctrine. With Anaxagoras a conception entered which gradually
                    triumphed ovei that of Heraclitus, namely, the conception of a supreme,
                    intellectual principle, not identified with the world but independent of it.
                    This, however, was νους, not Logos. In the Platonic and Aristotelian systems,
                    too, the Logos appears. But it is subordinate to other more distinctive
                    conceptions, and lacks the definiteness of a doctrine. With Plato the term
                    selected for the expression of the principle <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0827-0804"/> to which the order visible in the universe is
                    due is νους or <hi rend="italic">σοφία,</hi> not λόγος. It is in the
                    pseudo-Platonic <hi rend="italic">Epinomis</hi> that λόγος appears as a synonym
                    for νους. In Aristotle, again, the principle which sets all nature under the
                    rule of thought, and directs it towards a rational end, is νους, or the divine
                    spirit itself; while λόγος is a term with many senses, used as more or less
                    identical with a number of phrases, oυ ένεκα, εvεpγειa, εvτελεχειa, <hi
                        rend="italic">ουσία, είδος, μορφή,</hi> &amp;C.</p>
                <p>With the Stoics, however, the Logos doctrine reappears in great breadth. It is a
                    capital element in their system. With their teleological views of the world they
                    naturally predicated an active principle in connexion with it, living in it and
                    determining it. This operative principle is called both Logos and God. It is
                    conceived of as material, and is described in terms used equally of nature and
                    of God. There is at the same time the special doctrine of the λόγος <hi
                        rend="italic">σπερματικός,</hi> the seminal Logos, or the law of generation
                    in the world, the principle of the active reason working in dead matter. This
                    parts into λόγοι <hi rend="italic">σπερματικοί,</hi> which are akin, not to the
                    Platonic ideas, but rather to the λόγοι εvυλoι of Aristotle. In man, too, there
                    is a Logos which is his characteristic possession, and which is <hi
                        rend="italic">ενδιάθετος,</hi> as long as it is a thought resident within
                    his breast, but <hi rend="italic">προφορικός</hi> when it is expressed as a
                    word. This distinction between Logos as <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> and Logos
                    as <hi rend="italic">oratio,</hi> so much used subsequently by Philo and the
                    Christian fathers, had been so far anticipated by Aristotle’s distinction
                    between the <hi rend="italic">εξω</hi><hi rend="italic">λόγος</hi> and the λόγος
                        <hi rend="italic">εν</hi><hi rend="italic">τy ψvχy.</hi> Th© Logos of the

                <p>In the period between the Stoics and Philo there are few names of distinct
                    interest in this connexion. But in the Alexandrian philosophy the Logos doctrine
                    assumes a leading place, and shapes a new career for itself. The chief
                    representative of this school is the Hellenized Jew, Philo (born about 25 B.c.).
                    With him God is absolute and incorporeal perfection, apprehensible only by
                    reason, and incapable of contact with matter. An intermediate agent, therefore,
                    is affirmed, the Logos or idea of ideas. This Logos is not eternal in the sense
                    in which God is eternal, but has its being from Him. It is His elder son, as the
                    world is His younger. It resides with God as His wisdom, and is in the world as
                    the divine reason. It is God’s instrument in creation and in revelation. Both in
                    the world and in man it is twofold. In man it subsists as the λόγος <hi
                        rend="italic">ενδιάθετος</hi> or immanent reason, and as the λόγος <hi
                        rend="italic">προφορικός</hi> or uttered reason. In the case of the world
                    there is the Logos which has its residence with the archetypal ideas, and there
                    is the Logos which appears in the form of many λόγοι or rational germs of things
                    material. Philo’s doctrine is moulded by three forces—Platonism, Stoicism, and
                    the Old Testament. His Logos is the representative of the world to God as well
                    as of God to the world. It is described as the “image of God” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(εlκωv θεου,</hi> i. 6) and the “archetypal man” (ό κατ’ εικόνα <hi
                        rend="italic">άνθρωπος,</hi> i. 427), as the “son of God” and the “high
                    priest” <hi rend="italic">(άρχιερευς,</hi> i. 653), as the “first-born son”
                    (πρωτόγονος, i. 414), the “man of God” <hi rend="italic">(άνθρωπος</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">θεοv,</hi> i. 411), &amp;c. It wavers all the while between
                    attribute and substance, between the personal and the impersonal.</p>
                <p>In the later developments of Hellenic speculation nothing essential was added to
                    the doctrine of the Logos. Philo’s distinction between God and His rational
                    power or Logos in contact with the world was generally maintained by the
                    eclectic Platonists and Neo-Platonists. By some of these this distinction was
                    carried out to the extent of predicating (as was done by Numenius of Apamea)
                    three Gods :—the supreme God; the second God, or Demiurge or Lo»os:</p>
                <p>and the third God, or the world. Plotinus explained the λόγοι as constructive
                    forces, proceeding from the ideas and giving form to the dead matter of sensible
                    things <hi rend="italic">(Enneads,</hi> v. 1, 8, and Richter’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Neu-Plat.</hi><hi rend="italic">Studien}.</hi></p>
                <p>2. The doctrine of the Logos in Hellenic thought thus remains substantially a
                    doctrine of the Logos as reason. The other side, the doctrine of the Logos as
                    word, belongs as essentially to Hebrew thought. The roots of this conception lie
                    in the Hebrew Scriptures. The God who is made known in the Old Testament is one
                    who reveals Himself actively in history. He is exhibited, therefore, as
                    speaking, and by His word communicating His will. The word of the God of
                    revelation is represented as the creative principle (Gen. i. 3; Psalm xxxiii.
                    6), as the executor of the divine judgments (Hosea vi. 5), as healing (Psalm
                    cvii. 20), as possessed of almost personal qualities (Isaiah lv. 11; Psalm
                    cxlvii. 15). Along with this comes the doctrine of the angel of Jehovah, the
                    angel of the covenant, the angel of the presence, in whom God manifests Himself,
                    and who is sometimes identified with Jehovah or Elohim (Gen. xvi. 11, 13; xxxii.
                    29-31; Exod. iii. 2; xiii. 21), sometimes distinguished from Him (Gen. xxii. 15,
                    &amp;c.; xxiv. 7; xxviii. 12, &amp;c.), and sometimes presented in both aspects
                    (Judges ii., vi; Zech. i.). To this must be added the doctrine of Wisdom, given
                    in the books of Job and Proverbs. As the Word of God is represented in the
                    theocratic sections of the Old Testament as the creative principle of the world,
                    so Wisdom appears with somewhat similar functions in these books. At one time it
                    is exhibited as an attribute of God (Prov. iii. 19). At another it is strongly
                    personified, so as to become rather the creative thought of God than a quality
                    (Prov. viii. 22). Again it is described as proceeding from God as the principle
                    of creation and objective to Him. In these and kindred passages (Job xv. 7,
                    &amp;c.) it is on the way to become hypostatized.</p>
                <p>The Hebrew conception is partially associated with the Greek in the case of
                    Aristobulus, the predecessor of Philo, and, according to the fathers, the
                    founder of the Alexandrian school. He speaks of Wisdom in a way reminding us of
                    the book of Proverbs. The pseudo-Solomonic <hi rend="italic">Book of Wisdom</hi>
                    (generally supposed to be the work of an Alexandrian flourishing somewhere
                    between Aristobulus and Philo) deals both with the Wisdom and with the Logos. It
                    fails to hypostatize either. But it represents the former as the framer of the
                    world, as the power or spirit of God, active alike in the physical, the
                    intellectual, and the ethical domain, and apparently objective to God. Points of
                    affinity between the Hellenic and Hebrew conceptions are also seen in the books
                    of Maccabees (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 2 Macc. iii. 38). In these
                    instances, however, and even in Philo, the Hebrew elements are only partially
                    grasped and appropriated. In the Targums, on the other hand, the three doctrines
                    of the w ord, the angel, and the wisdom of God converge in a very definite
                    conception. In the Jewish theology God is represented as purely transcendent,
                    having no likeness of nature with man, and making no personal entrance into
                    history. Instead of the immediate relation of God to the world the Targums
                    introduce the ideas of the <hi rend="italic">Memrâ</hi> (word) and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Shechîna.</hi> This Memra, or, as'it is also designated, <hi
                        rend="italic">DMΑra,</hi> is an hypostasis that takes the place of God when
                    direct intercourse with man is in view. In all those passages of the Old
                    Testament where anthropomorphic terms are used of God, the Memra is substituted
                    for God. The Memra proceeds from God, and retains the creaturely relation to
                    God. It does not seem to have been identified with the Messiah.<note

                <p>The Hebrew Logos and the Old Testament doctrine reach their climax in the
                    prologue to John’s Gospel. The three conceptions of the active Word, the Angel,
                    and the Wisdom of God, which had been fused in the Rabbinical idea of a Memra,
                    meet there in the final grandeur of the Word of God incarnate. The question of
                    the <hi rend="italic">genesis</hi> of the Johannine doctrine has been greatly
                    debated. There is a remarkable similarity between John’s terms and Philo’s. But
                    this is due mainly to the fact that John and Philo made use of the same
                    inherited phraseology for the expression of their several doctrines. The
                    Johannine doctrine is not derived from the Philonic. The Logos of Philo is
                    distinctively reason; the Logos of John is Word. The one is metaphysical; the
                    other is theological. In Philo the Logos is the divine principle that creates
                    and sustains. In John the Logos who creates also redeems. In Philo the Logos
                    hovers midway between the personal and the impersonal. In John he is a distinct
                    personality. To Philo the idea of an incarnation of God is alien and abhorrent.
                    The heart of John’s doctrine is the historical fact that the Word was made
                    flesh.</p>
                <p>In many of the early Christian writers, as well as in the heterodox schools, the
                    Logos doctrine is influenced by the Greek idea. The Syrian Gnostic Basilides
                    held (according to Irenaeus, i. 24) that the Logos or Word emanated from the <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">foûs,</hi> or personified reason, as this latter emanated
                    from the unbegotten Father. The completest type of Gnosticism, the Valentinian,
                    regarded Wisdom as the last of the series of aeons that emanated from the
                    original Being or Father, and the Logos as an emanation from the first two
                    principles that issued from God, Reason <hi rend="italic">(voυs)</hi> and Truth.
                    Justin Martyr, the first of the sub-apostolic fathers, taught that God produced
                    of His own nature a rational power <hi rend="italic">(tivvaμiv</hi><hi

                        rend="italic">(Apol.,</hi> i. 46; it 13, &amp;c. ). With Tatian <hi
                        rend="italic">(Cohort, ad. Gr.,</hi> chap. 5, &amp;c.) the Logos is the
                    beginning of the world, the reason that comes into being as the sharer of God’s
                    rational power. With Athenagoras <hi rend="italic">(Suppl.,</hi> chap. 9, 10) He
                    is the prototype of the world and the energizing principle (iδe'α <hi
                        rend="italic">κal lvtρytιa)</hi> of things. Theophilus <hi rend="italic">(Ad
                        Autolyc.,</hi> ii. 10, 24) taught that the Logos was in eternity with God as
                    the λ&lt;iγos ivδ&lt;d0eτos, the counsellor of God, and that when the world was
                    to be created God sent forth this counsellor <hi rend="italic">(σiμβoυKos)</hi>
                    from Himself as the <hi rend="italic">xiyos</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >προφορικός,</hi> yet so that the begotten Logos did not cease to be a part
                    of Himself. With Hippolytus <hi rend="italic">(Refut., x.</hi> 32, &amp;c.) the
                    Logos, produced of God’s own substance, is both the divine intelligence that
                    appears in the world as the Son of God, and the idea of the universe immanent in
                    God. The early Sabellians (comp. Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Hist. Eccl.,</hi> vi.
