                    Cerium,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Didymium.</hi></p>
                <p>In an abandoned copper mine at Riddarhyttan, Westmanland, in Sweden, there occurs
                    a heavy compact mineral, which, though pretty abundant there, is hardly met with
                    anywhere else. This mineral was long mistaken for tungsten (syn. scheelite),
                    until Klaproth of Berlin in 1803 found in it a peculiar earth, which he called
                    <hi rend="italic">ochroite earth,</hi> as it becomes yellow when heated in air.
                    About the same time Berzelius and Hisinger made the same discovery; and,
                    (rightly) presuming the new earth to be an oxide of a new metal, they called the
                    latter <hi rend="italic">cerium</hi> (after the planet Ceres, the then latest
                    discovery in astronomy) and the mineral <hi rend="italic">cerite,</hi> which
                    names have been retained to this day. Only the name “cerium” now has a more
                    specific meaning, it having been shown by Mosander (in 1839-41) that Berzelius’s
                    cerium is a mixture of three metallic radicles, namely, cerium proper, lanthanum
                    (from <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">aνfjaνevν,</hi> “to be
                    concealed”), and didymium (from δίδυμος, “twin”). These metals are very closely
                    related to one another in their chemical character, and may be conveniently
                    trea·ted together. The extraction from cerite, of the oxide group, offers no
                    difficulty. According to Marignac <hi rend="italic">{Ann. Chim. Phys.</hi> [3],
                    vol. xxvii.), the powdered mineral is made into a thick paste with oil of
                    vitriol, and the reaction which sets in allowed to accomplish itself. The
                    remaining dry white powder is placed in a crucible, and kept there for a long
                    time at a temperature below redness, but sufficient to chase away the bulk of
                    the free sulphuric acid. The residue is added in small instalments to a quantity
                    of cold water, and the gangue (ferruginous silica) filtered off. The solution is
                    boiled, when the greater part of the <hi rend="italic">cerite-oxides</hi> comes
                    down in the form of sulphate almost free from foreign oxides. The sulphates can
                    be purified by redissolving them in the least quantity of water at 5° to 6° C.,
                    filtering, and reprecipitating by boiling. What remains in the mother-liquors is
                    recovered by precipitation with sulphate of potash (which must be added as a
                    solid and in sufficient quantity to saturate the solution) as an alum-like
                    double sulphate. The purified sulphates are dissolved in cold water,
                    precipitated as oxalates by means of oxalate of ammonia, and the washed oxalates
                    ignited, when the pure cerite-oxide mixture remains. The separation of the three
                    oxides from one another offers very great difficulties. Comparatively easy is
                    the extraction of approximately pure oxide of cerium—by Berzelius’s method.
                    Dissolve the mixed oxide (which must be free of sulphate if the method is to
                    succeed) in nitric acid, evaporate to dryness, ignite the residue, and treat it
                    with nitric acid diluted with one hundred times its weight of water. Only
                    lanthanum and didymium dissolve, impure binoxide of cerium (CeO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>) remaining, which can be further purified by treatment
                    with more concentrated nitric acid, which, however, besides the lanthanum and
                    didymium, dissolves a good deal of the cerium itself. This method (like any of
                    the rest) is founded upon the fact that salts of sesquioxide of cerium (Ce <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) are readily oxidized
                    into salts of the feebly basic binoxide CeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> under
                    circumstances which effect no higher oxidation in La <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> or Di <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.</p>
                <p>For the preparation of the oxides of lanthanum and didymium we may utilize the
                    nitric mother-liquors obtained in the extraction of cerium-oxide. These are
                    evaporated to dryness, the residue is ignited, and treated with very dilute
                    nitric acid, which dissolves the lanthanum and didymium with only little cerium
                    (Mosander, Marignac). A more complete elimination of the cerium is effected
                    (Bunsen) by converting the nitrates into sulphates (by evaporation with
                    sulphuric acid to dryness, and igniting the residue), dissolving these in
                    sulphuric acid water, and boiling with powdered magnesite (MgCO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>). From the filtrate the lanthanum and didymium are
                    precipitated (after acidulation by muriatic) with oxalic acid, and the oxalates
                    filtered off, washed, and ignited. By repeating the magnesia and oxalic acid
                    process two or three times, the oxides are obtained cerium-free. They are then
                    made into anhydrous, neutral sulphates; these are dissolved in a minimum of
                    water at 0° to 5° O., and the solution is heated to 30° to 35° C., when
                    lanthanum sulphate chiefly separates out in small crystals, which are filtered
                    off with the help of a filter-pump. A relatively lanthanum-free didymium
                    sulphate remains dissolved (Mosander).</p>
                <p>The metals were known only in a powdery form up to 1876, when Hillebrand and
                    Norton succeeded in preparing them in a compact form by the electrolysis of the
                    fused chlorides. The three metals are very similar to one another; they are
                    steel-grey ductile true metals, melting at a somewhat lower temperature than
                    silver. Specific gravities range from 6 ’ 1 to 6 ’ 6. They are more readily
                    inflammable than magnesium.</p>
                <p>The atomic weights of the three elements are now (1882) quoted as Ce = 141, La
                    =139, Di =147.</p>
                <p>Oxides and Salts.—Cerium has long been known to form two oxides, namely, a lower
                    (“cerous ”) oxide, which is a pretty strong, and a higher (“ceric”) oxide, which
                    is a feeble base. 16 ( = 0)parts of oxygen are combined, in the former with 92
                    (= “F”) parts, in the latter with ∣F parts of metal. Formerly F was looked upon
                    as the atomic weight, and the oxides formulated as FO and F.O. respectively<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n307/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0307-0292"/>. But Mendelejeff on theoretical grounds insisted
                    that the lower oxide must be looked upon as a sesquioxide Ce <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, where Ce <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> = 3F or Ce = ∣F, and the higher (accordingly) as a
                    binoxide, Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> or
                    rather CeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>. And he asserted the same in regard to
                    the reputed monoxides of lanthanum and didymium. These remarks were little
                    heeded even by the specialists until Hillebrand (partly in conjunction with
                    Norton) succeeded in obtaining the three metals as such, and in a truly metallic
                    condition, which admitted of an exact determination of the specific heats. The
                    specific heats were found to be— for Ce Ό4479, for La ’ 04485, for Di Ό4563; and
                    these numbers must be multiplied with Mendelejeffs atomic weight to produce
                    “atomic heats” (6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6; 6'23; 6 ’ 6), approximating
                    to values obtaining for other metals of established atomic weight. Hence
                    Mendelejeff was right.</p>
                <p>Cerous oxide, Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is
                    obtained by heating the oxalate in an atmosphere of hydrogen, as a bluish-grey
                    powder. The higher oxide CeO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> is obtained when any
                    certain salt of a volatile acid {e.g., nitric) is ignited in air; it is a white
                    powder, which when cold has only a slight touch of yellow in it, but at high
                    temperatures assumes a deep orange-red colour. Cerous chloride, CeCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, is obtained by heating the metal, or a mixture of
                    either oxide and charcoal, in dry chlorine gas, as a yellowish-white sublimate,
                    uniting with water into indistinct crystals Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> + 5H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. The cerous
                    sulphate, Ce <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, separates out when its solution is heated. It is
                    soluble in 6 parts of cold, and in about 60 of hot water, and forms a
                    difficultly soluble double salt with sulphate of potash. To obtain the ceric
                    sulphate, when the dioxide is treated with cold concentrated sulphuric acid,
                    .and the solution formed by addition of water allowed to evaporate, the salt Ce
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi> (ous) + 2Ce(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> (ic) + 25H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O separates out
                    in red. crystals looking like bichromate of potash. The mother-liquor yields
                    yellow crystals of =Ce(SO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>) <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> +4H <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> O.</p>
                <p>The most characteristic test for cerium salts is that the colourless cerous
                    solutions, on addition of hypochlorite of soda, give a red precipitate of a
                    ceric hydrate.</p>
                <p>Didymium (Di <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)
                    solutions have an astringent sweetish taste and a rose-red or violet colour. But
                    their most characteristic property is their beautiful absorption-spectrum, which
                    cφnes out distinctly with as little as half an inch deep of a solution
                    containing <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of a
                    per cent, of the oxide (Gladstone).</p>
                <p>Lanthanum (La <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>)
                    solutions have a similar taste to those of didymium salts. They are colourless.
                    The chloride when volatilized between the poles of an induction coil yields a
                    highly characteristic rich line-spectrum, by means of which the least traces of
                    the metal can be detected (Bunsen).</p>
                <p>Of higher oxides of lanthanum or didymium we had hitherto only indications; but
                    quite lately Dr Brauner {Chcm. News for 1881, December 23), in Roscoe’s
                    laboratory, succeeded in preparing a definite pentoxide, Di <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi>, of didymium, and also a hydrate of it,
                    Di <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>.3H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O.</p>
                <p>Sources.—Cerite, though the most abundant, is not the only native source of
                    cerium, lanthanum, and didymium. A. Cossa has found traces of the metals in the
                    ashes of numerous plants, and even in the human body. But it is more important
                    to state that there are a number of rare minerals, of which the chief are known
                    by the names of gadolinite, euxenite, samarskite, which, along with more or less
                    of cerite-metals, contain other rarer earth-metals similar to these. Until
                    lately the handbooks of chemistry quoted only three such rarer members of the
                    family under the names of yttrium, erbium, and terbium; but these reputed
                    individual elements have, during the last few years, been searchingly analysed
                    by Marignac, Μ. Delafontaine, L. F. Nilson, P. T. Clève, J. L. Smith, and
                    others, and under their hands resolved themselves into about a dozen separate
                    elements. The rare earth-metals in fact bid fair to multiply like the little
                    planets in astronomy; and, although in chemistry no firmly established fact can
                    justly be called unimportant, the minor rare earths, in the meantime, are of no
                    general interest, even to the general chemist.</p>
