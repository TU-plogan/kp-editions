                <p><label type="entry">LIEN</label>, in English and American law, properly means a
                    right of detaining goods of another in your possession until a debt due to you
                    from the owner of the goods is paid. To the original or common law conception of
                    a lien it would appear to be necessary that the goods over which lien is claimed
                    should be actually in the possession of the creditor, and further that the debt
                    should have been incurred with reference to the goods which are detained. Such
                    is the lien of the workman to whom articles are delivered for the purpose of
                    being operated upon by him in the way of his trade. He is entitled to keep the
                    article he has worked at until remuneration for his labour has been made to him.
                    Of precisely the same character is the lien of the carrier over the goods
                    conveyed by him, for the fare; of the farrier over the horse which he has cured,
                    for his fee; of blacksmiths, shipwrights, and other artificers for the wages
                    they have earned by working at or on the thing detained. This, the true lien of
                    the English law, is denominated a particular lien in contradistinction to a
                    right of detainer exercisable over the property of another for a debt not
                    incurred in relation to the thing detained. The latter is a general lien. The
                    former is said to be favourably, the latter strictly, construed by the law. The
                    former arises by implication of law from the relation of the parties; the latter
                    requires a special contract either expressed in terms or to be inferred from the
                    usage of trade. Again, as possession is the foundation of lieu in common law, a
                    parting with the possession would in general operate as a waiver <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0589-0570"/> or forfeiture of the lien. The same effect would
                    follow of course from any agreement by the lien holder to give up his right
                    while retaining possession of the property. Again as a general rule lien means
                    only a right of detention, not a power of sale,—a fact which distinguishes it
                    from a pledge of property in security for a loan. But in special cases powers of
                    sale have by statute or judicial decision been added to liens. Thus innkeepers
                    now have, in addition to their ordinary right of lien, power to sell goods and
                    chattels left with them after six weeks (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 38). In the United
                    States the principle of the particular lien has been developed in a notable
                    manner in protecting the rights of workmen employed in building. At common law,
                    the building belongs absolutely to the owner of the soil; and accordingly, when
                    a house is erected by contract, the contractor may receive payment from his
                    employer and may fail to pay the labourers he has employed, who are consequently
                    left without redress. The “mechanics’ liens,” created by statute in several of
                    the American States, give labourers a lien over the building which they have
                    erected for their unpaid wages. Notice having been filed in the prescribed
                    manner, they acquire a right to have their wages paid out of the property, which
                    may if necessary be sold for that purpose. A similar preferential charge, not
                    depending on possession, is recognized by the law in various cases, and goes by
                    the name of lien. Thus in equity an unpaid vendor has a charge for the amount of
                    the purchase money, or the balance thereof, over the estate, although it may no
                    longer be in his possession. Charges of this kind are sometimes denominated
                    equitable liens. Of the same nature is the charge acquired over a ship by a
                    person who has supplied her with necessaries for the voyage under a lawful
                    contract with the master (maritime lien).</p>
