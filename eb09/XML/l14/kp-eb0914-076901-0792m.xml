                    ship consists of four parts, viz., the log-glass, log-line, log-reel, and
                    log-ship. The word log may have been derived from the fact that a piece of wood
                    was thrown overboard, to lie as a log in a fixed position, motionless; now the
                    same name is applied to many contrivances and ingenious inventions for
                    indicating directly, or for registering, the ship’s progress through the
                    water.</p>
                <p>Though such information now appears to be so essential, nay, imperatively
                    necessary to the safe conduct of a ship, it is a fact that no such simple means
                    as the log and line was devised before the 17th century, or the subject even
                    thought of theoretically before 1570. At least nothing can be found in ancient
                    writings, or even in the works professedly treating upon navigation, till after
                    1620, while, on the contrary, various passages occur from which we may fairly
                    infer that there was nothing better at the command of the mariner than a rough
                    unassisted estimate. The work of Martin Cortes (Seville, 1556), after giving
                    much valuable information for that day, including a description and use of the
                    cross-staff, astrolabe, &amp;c., a table of the sun’s declination, with much
                    else, makes no other reference to the ship’s motion through the water than
                    this,—the pilot must estimate the distance, making allowance for the effects of
                    winds and currents, every day, and as the estimation “is imperfect, especially
                    in a long voyage and long time, it is convenient that he should rectify his
                    position by the corresponding position of the heavens.” Mr J. Tapp, who
                    published a translation and improved edition of Martin Cortes fifty-three years
                    after (1609), made no alteration in that part of the work.</p>
                <p>In 1578 William Bourne published <hi rend="italic">Inventions and Devices.</hi>
                    There are one hundred and thirteen subjects treated of, many of them highly
                    interesting, as they contain the crude germ of useful inventions. The
                    twenty-first device is a close approach to Massey’s self-registering log, which
                    was found so useful two hundred and sixty years later. The credit of the device
                    is ascribed to Humfray Cole; the probable date is 1570. The proposal was to have
                    a “little small close boat” with a wheel, or wheels, and an axletree, to turn
                    clock-work in the little boat, with dials and pointers to indicate respectively
                    fathoms, leagues, scores of leagues, and hundreds of leagues. If a small screw
                    rotator had been used instead of a wheel, this might have been a great success.
                    It was only a suggestion, perhaps untried; and in common with seamen and writers
                    about that time the author allows only 5000 feet to a mile. Edward Wright’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Certain Errors in Navigation detected and corrected</hi> (1610)
                    gives much new and useful information, but the nearest allusion to the ship’s
                    speed is in the part translated from the Spanish of Roderigo Samorano, under the
                    head of finding the ship’s place on the chart, called the “point of
                    imagination.” “This point doth presuppose the knowledge of two things: to wit,
                    the rhumb by which we have sailed, and that is known by the compass, and the
                    leagues which we have run; and this hath no certainty, but is a little more or
                    less than a good mariner according to his imagination supposeth that he hath
                    sailed; whereof the said point took its name.” In 1624 an edition of Gunter by
                    Edward Weaver, after much valuable geometric information, proposes at chap, vi.,
                    in a long rambling manner, that an account should be kept of the ship’s way.
                    “The way that a ship maketh may be known to an old seaman by experience, by
                    others it may be found,” as he recommends, with the log-line or by known marks
                    on the ship’s side, bearing the proportion to a league or mile, that a certain
                    number of seconds do to an hour. So far good; but he reckons a mile as 5866 feet
                    (214 too little), and states that seamen count in paces of 5 feet each, and 1000
                    to a mile, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> only 5000 feet. He also proposes to <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n793/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0793-0770"/> divide the degrees into one hundred parts, each
                    to be called “centesmes.” The whole subject is treated as a new thing. It is
                    stated by Purchas (1625) that Christopher Columbus (1492) deceived his crew with
                    respect to the distance sailed from home, and that “even the pilots did not know
                    how far they had gone” as they glided so smoothly with a continuous fair wind.
                    Had any kind of log been hove, the ship’s speed would have been publicly known.
                    Mr Burnaby <hi rend="italic">{Ancient Geography,</hi> p. 554) states that “no
                    ancient writer has preserved any account of the mode in which ancient navigators
                    computed distance.” Following such an authority and the quotations above, we may
                    safely agree with the statement of Purchas that it was first used in 1607. Also
                    we know that it did not become general till many years after. In one of our best
                    works on navigation, printed in 1843, the log is inaccurately described.</p>
                <p>If we are surprised that so many centuries passed, and that long voyages were
                    made, after the discovery of the compass, without any means of measuring the
                    distance sailed, we may be almost as much so at the diversity of opinion which
                    prevailed among seamen with regard to the length of the log-line and the length
                    of a mile. At the present day the principle upon which this log is arranged is
                    easily understood. The mean degree of the meridian (see vol. x. p. 198) is
                    assumed to be 69Ό9 statute miles, which gives 6080 feet to the mean nautical
                    mile,—an estimate sufficiently accurate for navigating upon any part of the
                    sphere. The distances upon the log-line being marked by pieces of line placed
                    between the strands and carrying the requisite number of knots, this has given
                    the name of knot to the nautical mile. The line is marked to knots and half
                    knots (a single knot) only; the intermediate fractions are estimated. Two
                    measurements are now in common use; that in the British navy is 47 feet 3 inches
                    of line for each knot made per hour, which corresponds with a twenty-eight
                    second glass—thus (28 × 6080) ÷3600 = 47,288 feet; in the merchant service a
                    knot is 50 feet 7 inches, which is the correct proportion to a mile with the
                    half minute glass. When a ship is going more than five or six knots, a short
                    glass is used, fourteen or fifteen seconds, then the indications by the line are
                    doubled. The shorter measure was probably chosen in consequence of the custom in
                    vogue till about 1833 of marking the run on the log-board, or book, in knots and
                    fathoms (or sea furlongs); the fractions are now invariably entered as tenths.
                    The whole length of line is 60 to 80 fathoms, according to the speed
                    anticipated; 10 to 20 fathoms of which is allowed as stray line, that the
                    log-ship may be in a fair position, before the rag of bunting called the turn
                    mark passes the hand. The line should be stretched and well wet before it is
                    measured, and should be remeasured every day at sea. The inner end of the line
                    is made fast to a light reel upon which it is wound.</p>
                <p>The “log-ship” (fig. 1) is a piece of wood about ⅜ inch thick and the fourth part
                    of a circle, having a radius of 5 or 6 inches, weighted with lead round the
                    curve in order to keep it upright in the water, but not to sink it. Two holes
                    are bored, about 1⅛ inches from the lower angles; through one a short piece of
                    line is passed and knotted; the other end of the line has a bone or hard peg
                    spliced to it, which . is inserted in the other hole, thus forming a span t^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1S a</hi> ^ <hi rend="superscript"> ac</hi> hed to the
                    log-line, and hangs square.</p>
                <p>When the log is used,&gt; man holds the reel over his head, the officer places
                    the peg in the log-ship, and throws it Well clear of the wake, then allows it to
                    run the “stray line” off without assistance, steadying it just before the turn
                    mark comes to hand; as the mark passes he calls to his assistant with the glass
                    to “turn.” As the sand runs pay out freely till the word “stop” is expected,
                    then bring the line into a state of tension similar to what it was in when the
                    turn mark passed. At the word “stop” nip the line instantly, count the nearest
                    knots, and estimate the tenths. When the line is stopped the strain should cause
                    the peg to draw from the log-ship, and it can easily be hauled in. In ships of
                    war it is hove every hour. The value of the operation depends, of course,
                    entirely upon the care bestowed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ground-Log.—</hi> In large rivers, such as Rio de la Plata,
                    where a strong current runs, and shoals are found out of the sight of land, a
                    lead of four or five pounds weight is used instead of the log-ship; the lead
                    rests on the bottom, the line and sand-glass being used in a manner similar to
                    that above described. This is called the ground-log, and indicates the speed at
                    which the ship is passing over the ground, irrespective of currents or tides; it
                    will show also the lateral effect of current as it is hauled in; this is the
                    only log which can do so.</p>
                <p>The sand-glasses are very primitive contrivances for measuring the requisite
                    number of seconds; they are much affected by damp and change of temperature, and
                    no reliance can be placed on their accuracy. In 1868 a timepiece sounding a gong
                    at the required intervals was devised by the late Admiral Sir Walter Tarleton,
                    and was tried on board some of Her Majesty’s ships, but failed after a short
                    time from damp or other causes. The writer of this article was then attempting
                    to produce a log-gong, but abandoned it on being told that they could be
                    obtained below his estimated cost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Screw Logs.—</hi> In 1725 Henry de Saumarez described a machine
                    which was to supersede the ordinary log. This was on the principle of the screw,
                    having vanes which caused it to revolve and communicate a rotary motion to a
                    piece of rope; this most probably went inboard to clockwork; hence the failure.
                    Mr Smeatonmade many experiments about 1751; he found the results very irregular,
                    especially at high velocities, just as the writer of this article did with one
                    of Massey’s flies and a line or wire attached to a spindle, supported by large
                    friction rollers inboard; both experiments were dead failures on account of the
                    friction. In 1773 two screw logs were tried on board H.M. ship “Racehorse”
                    during a short voyage to the Polar Sea; each was made to communicate motion to a
                    counter inboard. In 1792 Mr Gower took out a patent for a screw log. None of
                    these experiments were sufficiently successful to gain the confidence of
                    seamen.</p>
                <p>We see that the principle was not new in 1834 when Mr Massey patented a screw
                    log, which has been so generally adopted that it deserves special notice and
                    description. Though Massey took out other patents, and others have followed with
                    modifications, the principle of all is the same, and likely to remain in use
                    with the “common log” for many years to come. Massey fitted his log to the
                    sternpost of a few vessels, a vertical spindle conveying the rotations of the
                    fly to a register in the cabin above, but it did not answer.</p>
                <p>The log of 1836 which came into general use is represented in fig. 2. It consists
                    of two parts united by 2 or 3 feet of rope. The “fly” consists of a hollow
                    copper cylinder about 9 or 10 inches long with four fins or blades placed at a
                    given angle, causing it to rotate once in a certain distance. The rope is
                    attached to the fly and to a spindle which freely revolves in a brass box; an
                    endless screw acting upon a system of wheel-work records the fractions of a mile
                    on one dial, units upon a second, and tens up to one hundred on the third, on
                    the same principle with the index of a gas meter.</p>
                <p>The last patent was for the “frictionless log” shown in fig. 3, which is similar
                    to the former except that, by dispensing with the piece of rope and part of the
                    heavy box, it is much more compact and less liable to foul,—an accident to which
                    all logs when towed after a ship are very liable. Walker’s harpoon log is very
                    similar <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n794/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0794-0771"/> to the last of Massey’s, but has a plate at the
                    back in the shape of a harpoon to prevent the upper part from revolving. This
                    log is now supplied to Her Majesty’s ships. The fins or blades which cause the
                    rotation in each of the logs above described are flat pieces of brass (not
                    portions of a screw) soldered to a cylinder, which is hollow in order to
                    diminish the tendency to sink when going slowly; but if the log be left
                    overboard when the ship stops, the tow-line will allow it to sink about 100
                    feet, the pressure of water will then fill it, and there is no means provided
                    for getting the water out. Screw logs will also at low speeds hang obliquely and
                    be useless. Mr Friend tried a log with paddles protruding from a brass box
                    instead of using a screw; but the plan was not adopted. However accurate the
                    registering logs may be, an hourly log cannot be dispensed with, unless the ship
                    be on one course during the whole twenty-four hours, or her speed be uniform;
                    even then the old log and line should not be neglected. Both Massey and Walker
                    are now trying logs the rotators of which are towed, while the dials for
                    registering are on the ship’s stem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pressure Bog.—</hi> In 1849 the Rev. E. L. Berthon patented a
                    log (fig. 4), indicating the speed of the ship by means of the pressure of water
                    due to the velocity acting upon a tube about f of an inch diameter in the clear,
                    closed at the end, protruding some 8 inches below the ship’s bottom, with an
                    aperture of about an ∣ of an inch in diameter in the front side, near the closed
                    end. A vane was used to turn the aperture in the direction of the ship’s
                    progress (course and leeway combined). At the upper end of the the same pipe a
                    pointer indicated the amount of leeway. To take into account the effect which
                    change of draught would produce, another pipe was used having the aperture in a
                    neutral direction (41° 30) with regard to the ship’s progress, so that the water
                    was neither· forced in nor drawn out. The two pipes communicated with
                    air-vessels, which were allowed to be about half full of water; thence two
                    flexible tubes conveyed the pressure to the ends of an inverted siphon partly
                    filled with mercury, one leg of which forms a glass index tube, a graduated
                    scale being placed behind it, calculated upon the principle that the pressure
                    will increase according to the square of the velocity. As the specific gravity
                    of mercury is so great, the scale even up to 16 knots is brought within a
                    convenient compass; and it can be hung in gimbals (as a barometer) in any part
                    of the ship. The leeway indicator in more recent fittings has been abandoned.
                    The writer of this article first saw it in one of the Jersey packets, when she
                    was steaming about 13 knots; it appeared to be very sensitive, and he was
                    strongly impressed in its favour. For details respecting this log see paper by
                    Vaughan Pendred, before the Society of Engineers, December 6, 1869.</p>
                <p>The motions or disturbances imparted to the water by the body of the ship passing
                    through it at high velocity must vitiate in a great degree all attempts to
                    measure the speed by instruments placed near the hull of the ship, and under
                    varying circumstances of draught, speed, and foulness of bottom. For the results
                    of experiments and opinions on this point, by the late W illiam Froude, F. R.
                    8., and Mr R. Edmund Froude, see <hi rend="italic">Brit. Assoc. Rep.,</hi> 1874,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Electric Log.—</hi> In the chronological order in which we have
                    taken various descriptions of log, the last deserving notice is Kelway’s
                    “electric log,” the only uch log known to the public. Its chief feature is the
                    making and breaking of an electric circuit by means of a screw revolving in the
                    water aud an electric battery connected with the step motion indicator. One of
                    the difficulties to be overcome was that of securing a chamber wherein to form
                    the electric contacts, which should remain watertight under the pressure due to
                    its depth below the surface of the sea, particularly in the event of the ship
                    stopping and suffering it to sink when being towed with 50 fathoms of line. Mr
                    Kelway now believes that he has overcome that difficulty, and his log has been
                    tried on board several of Her Majesty’s ships at Portsmouth, with satisfactory
                    results, a screw similar to Massey’s being towed, while in electric connexion
                    with a dial on board.</p>
                <p>What is considered by Mr Kelway to be an improved application of the principle is
                    now (1882) on view in the International Exhibition at the Crystal Palace. It is
                    intended that a hole should ba cut in the ship’s bottom, by preference in the
                    engine-room, large enough to allow a short cylinder (fig. 5) containing the
                    screw R to pass down below the ship’s bottom. The cylinder is open in a
                    fore-and-aft line and attached to a cage H, which is drawn up or lowered by
                    means of a large screw G working through a stuffing box F. The iron box D
                    containing the cage is 4 feet in height, made in three parts; the lower part
                    (high enough to receive a sluice valve C) is to be bolted to the ship’s bottom,
                    and must, with the rest of the box, be nearly as strong; the central part is
                    secured to the valve box and covered by a lid E, there being space enough above
                    the sluice valve for the cage and screw.</p>
                <p>To place the log, let the sluice valve C be lightly closed; open two small taps
                    to let the water out of the box and to prove that the valve is acting. Open the
                    lid, ran the lowering screw through the cage, place it, secure the lid, open the
                    sluice valve, and lower the rotator to the desired distance. The blades of the
                    rotator are portions of a true screw. An endless screw on the spindle of the
                    rotator communicates the revolutions to a vertical spindle M, which moves a
                    train of wheels in a watertight box N; the last of these wheels revolves once in
                    a mile, and on the same spindle is a wheel having eight ratchet teeth, which by
                    moving a lever complete an electric current, which passes by the wire O to a
                    dial placed in any part of the ship, sounding a bell and causing one hand of the
                    dial to make a step and mark an eighth; one revolution indicates a mile, and
                    other dials carry the register up to 100 miles. This form of electric log has,
                    however, the disadvantage pointed out as affecting the Berthon or any log placed
                    under the hull of a ship.</p>
                <p>The electric towing log (by Kelway) promises to show continuously on board the
                    ship what she is doing, while keeping a record of what has been done. A rating
                    table would be at the dial, in any part of the ship; or several dials could be
                    worked by the same electric current. It will be exposed to the danger of fouling
                    seaweed, &amp;c., as other towing logs are.</p>
                <p>The logs now generally used are Massey’s, Walker ’ sy⅞nd a few of Berthon’s,
                    generally in conjunction with the old log-ship and line. (H. A. Μ.)</p>
