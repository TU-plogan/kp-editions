                    situated nearly in the centre of the West Riding, in the wapentake of Skyrack,
                    and in the pleasant and well cultivated valley of the river Aire. The
                    surrounding country possesses much cheerful beauty; and the view from Woodhouse
                    Moor, one of the most elevated parts of the borough, is not excelled in any part
                    of the Riding. For manufacturing and commercial purposes, the situation of Leeds
                    is highly <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n424/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0424-0407"/> advantageous. It is distant from London by the
                    Great Northern Railway 185 miles, from Edinburgh 225, from Liverpool 74, from
                    Manchester 42∣, and from Birmingham 113, and may be said to occupy a central
                    position in the railway system of England. It has also communication with
                    Liverpool by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, and with Hull by the Aire and Calder
                    navigation, and through these means of transit has the highest facility for the
                    transmission to the principal seaports of England of its various manufactures,
                    and for receiving raw material at the lowest rate of charge. It is, moreover,
                    the centre of an extensive coal and iron district. All the advantages for the
                    successful working of machinery are therefore within its reach, and hence it has
                    become the seat of several important industries, especially the woollen and
                    linen manufactures, iron working, and machine-making.</p>
                <p>Though regarded as the capital of the great manufacturing district of the West
                    Riding, Leeds is not in its centre, but on its border. Eastward and northward
                    the country is wholly agricultural, while to the west and south-west the
                    populous villages resound with the shuttle and the steam-engine. In this
                    district are carried on a woollen manufacture of great extent and of
                    considerable antiquity and a worsted manufacture of extraordinary vigour (a
                    graft on the woollen manufacture); to these have latterly been added the iron
                    manufacture and that of machines and steam-engines, and the making of boots and
                    ready-made clothing, besides a manufacture of flax, which now constitutes one of
                    the staple trades of Leeds.</p>
                <p>Cloth is the staple trade of the town, although the manufacture itself is not the
                    leading one within the borough, being carried on, to a large extent, in
                    townships out of the parish and borough of Leeds. In the town, however, the
                    trade centres, and there the cloth is finally prepared for the market by what is
                    technically termed finishing or dressing—a department quite distinct in Leeds
                    from that of the manufacturer. In this respect the Yorkshire cloth trade differs
                    essentially from that of the west of England, where the manufacturer conducts
                    the two operations of making and finishing the cloth within the same premises.
                    Several Leeds firms conduct their business on the west of England model; but, as
                    the rule, the order of the trade is as follows. The great bulk of the cloths
                    sold in Leeds are produced either in the out-townships of the borough, or in the
                    villages lying west of Leeds, and principally in Pudsey, Farsley, Rawden,
                    Yeadon, Horsforth, and Guiseley, which are all in other parishes, within an
                    extreme radius of 10 miles from Leeds. The cloths so manufactured are sold in
                    the unfinished or <hi rend="italic">balk</hi> state to the merchants of Leeds,
                    by whom they are put out to the cloth-dressers or finishers, whose special craft
                    it is to raise the pile or nap on the face of the cloth, and to complete it for
                    the purposes of the tailor and the final consumer. In former times a
                    considerable proportion of the business between the manufacturer and the
                    merchant was conducted in the cloth halls, which are two in number. In these the
                    manufacturers formerly took their stand and waited the custom of the merchants,
                    but within the last twenty or thirty years a great change has taken place in the
                    mode of transacting business, and the cloth halls have practically fallen into
                    disuse. The merchant now orders his goods direct from the manufacturer,
                    specifying the weight, colour, and quality <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n425/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0425-0408"/> of the articles he wants, and these are delivered
                    to him without passing through the halls. Thus a picturesque and characteristic
                    feature of life in Leeds seems likely at no distant date to become extinct. At
                    one period it seemed probable that the business of the cloth trade would assume
                    the west of England type. Mr William Hirst, a very skilful manufacturer,
                    introduced goods of superior texture and quality, and by his success induced
                    many capitalists to erect mills on a large scale, in which all the processes of
                    the manufacture and finishing were conducted. The change was, however, only
                    temporary. Many of these mills are now occupied for finishing only, and some
                    have been devoted to other branches of the local manufactures. The spinning of
                    flax by machinery was commenced in the township of Holbeck (in the borough of
                    Leeds) more than one hundred years since, by Mr John Marshall, who was one of
                    the first to apply the principle of Sir Richard Arkwright’s water frame,
                    invented for the cotton manufacture, to the spinning of linen yarn. The works of
                    Messrs Marshal &amp; Company are very extensive, and one portion of them is an
                    object of attraction to all strangers visiting the town. It is a vast room 400
                    feet by 220, filled with machinery, all of which is turned by shafting which
                    requires two coupled engines of 350 horse-power to impel it. Light is admitted
                    by glass cupolas. The whole building is held together by a double series of iron
                    ties, uniting the iron pillars which sustain the many-arched roof. The external
                    form is Egyptian.</p>
                <p>The spinning of worsted yarn and the weaving of worsted goods were formerly
                    carried on to a considerable extent in Leeds, but have now nearly died out,
                    Bradford, Bingley, and Keighley, with the villages immediately adjoining, having
                    attracted almost the entire trade. Amongst the smaller branches of the textile
                    manufactures carried on in Leeds must be enumerated those of silk and carpeting,
                    neither of them unimportant, though falling far short of the flax and woollen
                    trades.</p>
                <p>It is probable that the iron trade in its different branches, including the
                    casting of metal, and the manufacture of steam-engines, of steam-ploughs, of
                    machinery of every kind, and of mechanical tools, now gives employment to a
                    larger number of persons within the borough of Leeds than any other branch of
                    industry. The great works founded by the late Sir Peter Fairbairn, as well as
                    those of Messrs Kitson &amp; Co. and of Messrs John Fowler &amp; Co., in the
                    last-named of which the Fowler steam-plough is the staple article of
                    manufacture, occupy places in the front rank of such establishments in the
                    country; while Messrs Greenwood &amp; Batley and other tool-makers give
                    employment to a large number of hands, and export the goods they produce to all
                    parts of the globe.</p>
                <p>Leeds was at one time famed for the production of artistic pottery, and very fine
                    specimens of old Leeds ware are still occasionally to be discovered among the
                    residences of the poor in the town. This branch of manufacture, however, became
                    extinct about eighty years ago. Within the last three years it has been revived,
                    and once more attention has been directed to the high artistic merit which the
                    pottery of the town has attained.</p>
                <p>In addition to these particular branches of industry, the manufacture of
                    ready-made clothing has become one of great importance. In some of the
                    establishments for this purpose such as that of Messrs John Barrow &amp; Sons,
                    the number of hands employed is so large that from a thousand to twelve hundred
                    suits of clothing can be produced daily. Machinery is now used in all the
                    departments in these places, and the work is conducted with a rapidity and at a
                    price which would have seemed incredible thirty years ago. Leeds has in recent
                    years become famous as the chief seat of the cap manufacture in the United
                    Kingdom. The leather trade is also one of great importance in the borough, many
                    large tanning establishments being erected on the outskirts, while the wholesale
                    manufacture of boots and shoes for army and other purposes is carried on in
                    workshops which are the largest of their kind in the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>No religious census has been taken in Leeds since that of 1851. There are,
                    however, 181 places of worship in the town, these being divided as follows
                    :—Church of England, 46; λVesleyan Methodist, 40; Primitive Methodist, 30;
                    United Methodist Free Church, 12; Congregational, 12; Baptist, 11; Methodist New
                    Connexion, 10; Catholic, 6; Unitarian, 3; Presbyterian, 2; Friends, 2; various,
                    5. The Leeds school board, which was established immediately after the passing
                    of the Education Act in 1870, has now (1882) 47 schools under its control within
                    the limits of the borough, and these accommodate 30,000 children. In addition to
                    these there are 34 national and parochial schools, 8 Roman Catholic schools, and
                    6 Wesleyan schools. The educational institutions of a higher order in the town
                    are numerous and important. Of these the principal is the Yorkshire College,
                    established in 1875 for the purpose of supplying instruction in the artsand
                    sciences which are applicable to the manufactures, engineering, mining, and
                    agriculture of the county. It has a staff of 19 professors, instructors, and
                    assistant lecturers, and upwards of 350 day and 160 evening students. The
                    college, which has carried on its operations hitherto in temporary premises,
                    will shortly remove to permanent buildings designed by Mr Waterhouse, A. R. A.
                    These buildings, which when completed will cost upwards of £100,000, will occupy
                    a site of about 3⅜ acres, and will comprise extensive laboratories and
                    workshops, large lecture theatres, and a college library and museum. The Leeds
                    Public Library, established under the Public Libraries’ Act, now takes the first
                    place amongst similar institutions in the borough. The reference library
                    contained 26,000 volumes at the close of 1881, and the lending libraries 83,000
                    volumes, the expenditure for the year being £4150. The issue of volumes during
                    the year reached the large total of 639,616. The Leeds Old Library, a private
                    institution, founded in 1768 by Dr Priestley, who was at that time minister at
                    the Unitarian chapel in the town, contains a very valuable selection of books,
                    numbering about 75,000 volumes, and is in possession of commodious premises in
                    Commercial Street. The Philosophical and Literary Society <hi rend="superscript"
                    > 7</hi>, established in 1820, possesses a handsome building in Park Row,
                    containing a laboratory, a lecture room, and a museum, with many fine specimens
                    in natural history, geology, and archaeology. The society also possesses a
                    library of upwards of 16,000 volumes, chiefly rare scientific works. During the
                    winter months, lectures on scientific and literary subjects are given in the
                    lecture hall by men of eminence. The Leeds Mechanics’ Institute in Cookridge
                    Street is a striking building in the Italian style. It comprises a large
                    circular lecture room, with gallery, capable of seating 1500 persons, besides a
                    library, reading, committee, and class rooms. The foundation stone was laid in
                    1865, and the total cost of the building has been nearly £30,000. Day and
                    evening classes and an art school are carried on within the building, and are
                    largely frequented. The Young Men’s Christian Association, another educational
                    institute of importance, occupies the building in South Parade formerly used as
                    a mechanics’ institute. The Grammar School, a handsome building, erected at
                    Woodhouse Moor, has endowments producing over £3000 yearly. There are six
                    exhibitions of £50 a year, each tenable for four years at Oxford, Cambridge, and
                    Durham. It provides education for about 280 scholars. There is also a large
                    training college for students purposing to enter the Wesleyan Methodist ministry
                    at Headingley <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, one of the suburbs of Leeds. The
                    principal charitable institution of the town is the general infirmary in Great
                    George Street, a Gothic building, built of brick, with stone dressings, from
                    designs by Sir Gilbert Scott. It is arranged upon the pavilion system, each ward
                    being isolated from the rest of the building, and has a highly ornamental
                    exterior, whilst the internal accommodation is suited to the requirements of the
                    patients and the medical staff. The total cost of the erection was more than
                    £100,000. The house of recovery for fever patients, founded in 1802, now
                    occupies a handsome building at Burmantofts. There are also a large building
                    used as a public dispensary in North Street, an institution for the blind, deaf,
                    and dumb in Woodhouse Lane, a School of Medicine and other hospitals and
                    charitable institutions.</p>
                <p>The town and borough of Leeds was incorporated by letteιs patent, 2 Charles I.,
                    but this charter was cancelled or surrendered. A new charter was granted, 13
                    Charles II., under the style of mayor, aidermen, and burgesses of the borough of
                    Leeds. The corporation consisted of a mayor, 12 aidermen, 24 assistants, and a
                    staff of 13 officials. The Municipal Act of 1834 gave Leeds a corporation of 16
                    aidermen and 48 councillors, which has effected great improvements in the
                    management of local matters. In addition to the powers granted to it by <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> the Municipal Reform Act, the town council has
                    acquired, through successive Improvement Acts, <pb break="no"

                    of the streets within the borough, as well as considerable powers for enforcing
                    the consumption of smoke. It has also acquired the whole of the water supply of
                    Leeds, and it controls the public markets, the lighting and watching of the
                    streets, the execution of the Public Health Acts, &amp;c. The supply of water
                    for Leeds is now derived from the valley of the Washburn, one of the tributaries
                    of the Wharfe, where very extensive reservoirs have been provided, at a cost of
                    £1,400,000. The gas supply of the town is also in the hands of the corporation,
                    which purchased the whole of the gas works from the two companies then in
                    existence in 1870, at the cost of nearly £1,000,000. The entire suite of
                    markets, comprising the corn exchange, the Smithfield cattle market, and the
                    produce markets, have been acquired at different periods, and the corporation
                    has expended upon this property £240,000. The rateable value of the municipal
                    borough is £1,122,000, and the income of the borough derived from the borough
                    rate £88,106. The debt of the town amounted in 1881 to £3,884,000. Of the places
                    of recreation in Leeds, the principal is the Grand Theatre, a handsome building
                    erected from the designs of Mr Corson, in Upper Briggate, in 1879. Large
                    assembly-rooms adjoin this theatre. There is another theatre in King Charles
                    Croft, and there are one or two music halls. Some years ago <hi rend="subscript"
                    > #</hi> the corporation acquired, at a large expenditure, Boundhay Park, an
                    estate of great beauty in the neighbourhood of the town. After a portion of the
                    ground had been laid out as building sites, the central part of the estate,
                    comprising splendid lawns, woods of great extent, and a lake covering 40 acres,
                    were reserved as a place of public recreation, and the park is now a favourite
                    resort of the people of Leeds, and also of the inhabitants of the surrounding
                    country. It is under the management of a committee of the corporation, and,
                    though situated at an inconvenient distance from the centre of the town, is
                    largely frequented during the summer months. Woodhouse Moor, a common occupying
                    an elevated position northwest of the town, has been planted with trees and
                    provided with walks within the last ten years; and in other parts of the town
                    the corporation have laid out pieces of land, which had long been left bare and
                    neglected, as recreation grounds.</p>
                <p>The external appearance of the town has been greatly improved within the last
                    twenty years. The event which had the greatest influence in promoting the
                    erection of more handsome buildings than those of which Leeds was formerly
                    constituted was the opening of the town-hall by the Queen in the year 1858. This
                    is a noble building in the Grecian style. It is 250 feet long and 200 broad, and
                    is crowned by a tower 225 feet high. The principal apartment in it is the
                    Victoria Hall, a richly ornamented chamber 161 feet long, 72 feet wide, and 75
                    feet high. The building, which cost, including the site and fittings, more than
                    £130,000, is adorned with statues and portraits of local celebrities. The
                    municipal offices, including school board offices and buildings for the public
                    library, are now in course of erection in the immediate neighbourhood of the
                    town-hall, and will cost when completed upwards of £100,000. The other public
                    buildings of importance in the town are the royal exchange, in Perpendicular
                    Gothic, the foundation of which was laid in 1872, the corn exchange, a fine oval
                    edifice, and the bank of Messrs Beckett &amp; Co., one of the best works of Sir
                    Gilbert Scott.</p>
                <p>Leeds has long been distinguished for the activity of its political and public
                    life. It has taken a leading part in many of the great questions which have
                    agitated the country during the present century, and among its successive
                    representatives in parliament have been Lord Macaulay, Sir William Molesworth,
                    Mr Marshall, three members of the Baines family, ami other men whose names are
                    familiar in the annals of the Liberal party, to which upon the whole the borough
                    has given a consistent support since its enfranchisement in 1832. The newspapers
                    published in the town are the <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury,</hi> daily,
                    Liberal, established in 1718; the <hi rend="italic">Yorkshire Post and Leeds
                    Intelligencer,</hi> daily, Conservative, established in 1754; the <hi
                    rend="italic">Leeds Express,</hi> evening, Radical; the <hi rend="italic">Leeds
                    Daily Mews,</hi> evening, Conservative; and the <hi rend="italic">Leeds
                    Times,</hi> weekly, Liberal. The <hi rend="italic">Leeds Mercury</hi> for eighty
                    years has been the property of Messrs Edward Baines &amp; Sons, and has long
                    been considered one of the most influential of provincial journals.</p>
                <p>The area of the municipal and parliamentary borough is 21,572 acres. In addition
                    to the township of Leeds some ten out-townships are included in this area. The
                    population (207,165 in 1861 and 259,212 in 1871) in 1881 was 309,126, the number
                    of inhabited houses being 65,034. Leeds is one of the boroughs which under the
                    Reform Act of 1867 return three members of parliament.</p>
                <p>The name of Leeds has been attributed to a cnief named Leod. Traces of Roman
                    workmanship have at various times been discovered in the town, and in the parish
                    church several very interesting Anglo-Saxon crosses, discovered when the church
                    was rebuilt in 1838, are preserved. The castle of Leeds occupied a site on Mill
                    Hill, and is supposed to have been built by Ilbert de Laci at the time of the
                    Conquest, but no traces of it remain.</p>
