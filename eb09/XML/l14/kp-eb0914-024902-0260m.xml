                    water is conveyed to and from the gills. By means of their mouth they fasten
                    themselves to stones, boats, &lt;fcc∙., as well as to other fishes, their object
                    being to obtain a resting place on the former, whilst they attach themselves to
                    the latter for the purpose of deriving nourishment from them. The inner surface
                    of their cup-shaped mouth is armed with pointed teeth, with which they perforate
                    the integuments of the fish attacked, scraping off particles of the flesh and
                    sucking the blood. Mackerel, cod, pollack, and flat-fishes are the kinds most
                    frequently attacked by them in the sea; of river-fish the migratory <hi
                    rend="italic">Salmonidae</hi> and the shad are sometimes found with the marks of
                    the teeth of the lamprey, or with the fish actually attached to them. About ten
                    species are known from the coasts and rivers of the temperate regions of the
                    northern and southern hemispheres. In Great Britain and Europe generally, three
                    species occur, of which the two larger, if not all three, are met with also in
                    North America, viz., the large spotted Sealamprey <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Petromyzon</hi><hi rend="italic">marinus);</hi> the River-lamprey or Lampern
                    (F. <hi rend="italic">fluviatilis)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Small
                    Lampern or “Pride” or “Sand-Piper” (P. <hi rend="italic">branchialis).</hi> The
                    first two are migratory, entering rivers in the spring to spawn; of the
                    river-lamprey, however, specimens are met with in fresh water all the year
                    round. Lampreys, especially the sealamprey, are esteemed as food, and were
                    formerly even more so than at present; but their flesh is not easy of digestion.
                    Henry I. is said to have fallen a victim to this, his favourite dish. The
                    species of greatest use is the river-lamprey, which as bait is preferred to all
                    others in the cod and turbot fisheries of the North Sea. Yarrell states that
                    formerly the Thames alone supplied from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 lamperns
                    annually, but their number has so much fallen off that, for instance, in 1876
                    only 40,000 were sold to the cod-fishers. That year, however, was an unusually
                    bad year: the lamperns, from their scarcity, fetched £8, 10s. a thousand, whilst
                    in ordinary years <hi rend="italic">£5</hi> is considered a fair price. The
                    season for catching lamperns closes in the Thames about the middle of March. The
                    origin of the name lamprey is obscure; its Latinized form <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lampetra,</hi> which occurs in all ichthyological works of the Middle Ages, was
                    unknown in classical times; and its derivation from <hi rend="italic">lambere
                    petras</hi> is a specimen of etymological ingenuity. The development of lampreys
                    has received much attention on the part of naturalists, since Aug. Müller
                    discovered that they undergo a metamorphosis, and that the minute worm-like
                    lamperns previously known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ammοc&lt;xtes,</hi> and abundant in the sand and mud of many streams, were
                    nothing but the undeveloped young of the river-lampreys and small lamperns. See
