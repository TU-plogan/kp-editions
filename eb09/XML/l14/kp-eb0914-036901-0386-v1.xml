                <p><label type="entry">LAW, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1686-1761).
                    The events of the life of this remarkable man may be very briefly stated. He was
                    born in 1686 at King’s Cliffe; in 1705 he entered as a sizar at Emmanuel
                    College, Cambridge; in 1711 he was elected fellow of his college and received
                    holy orders, and in 1712 he took his M.A. degree. He resided at Cambridge,
                    taking pupils and occasional duty until the accession of George I., when his
                    conscience forbade him to take the oaths of allegiance to the new Government and
                    of abjuration of the Stuarts; his staunch Jacobitism had already been betrayed
                    in a tripos speech which brought him into trouble; and he was now deprived of
                    his fellowship, and became a nonjuror. For the next few years he is said to have
                    been a curate in London, but the point is doubtful. In 1727 we find him
                    domiciled at Putney as tutor to Edward Gibbon, father of the historian, and “the
                    much honoured friend and spiritual director of the whole family” (Gibbon, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Memoirs of my Life and Writings).</hi> In the same year he
                    accompanied his pupil to Cambridge, and resided with him as governor, in term
                    time, for the next four years. His pupil then went abroad, but Law was left at
                    Putney, where he remained in Mr Gibbon’s house for more than ten years, acting
                    as a religious guide not only to the family but to a number of pious men who
                    used to make pilgrimages to consult the Putney sage. The most eminent of these
                    were the two brothers John and Charles Wesley, Dr Byrom the poet, Dr Cheyne the
                    famous physician, and Mr Archibald Hutcheson, M.P. for Hastings. In 1737 Mr
                    Gibbon the elder died, and the household was, a short time afterwards,
                    dispersed. Law therefore was parted from his friends, leaving behind him, the
                    historian tells us, “in our family the reputation of a worthy and pious man, who
                    believed all that he professed, and practised all that he enjoined.” In 1740 Law
                    retired to his native village, where he had inherited from his father a house
                    and a small property. There he was presently joined by two ladies, Mrs
                    Hutcheson, the rich widow of his old friend, who recommended her on bis
                    death-bed to place herself under Law’s spiritual guidance, and Miss Hester
                    Gibbon, sister to his late pupil. This curious trio lived for twenty-one years a
                    life wholly given to devotion and charity, until the death of Law in 1761.</p>
                <p>Such was the singularly uneventful life of this good man; but during the whole
                    period from the time when he became a non-juror almost to the day of his death
                    he was busily engaged in literary work which places him in the very first rank
                    of 18th century divines. As a writer, it will be convenient to consider him
                    under three heads.</p>
                <p>1. As a singularly able controversialist. The first of his controversial works
                    was <hi rend="italic">Three Letters to the Bishop of Bangor</hi> (1717), which
                    were considered both by friend and foe as one of the most powerful contributions
                    to the Bangorian controversy on the High Church side. Dean (afterwards Bishop)
                    Sherlock declared that “Mr Law was a writer so considerable that he knew but one
                    good reason why his lordship did not answer him.” Law’s next controversial work
                    was <hi rend="italic">Remarks on Mandeville's Fable of the Bees</hi> (1723), in
                    which he vindicates morality on the highest grounds; for pure style, caustic
                    wit, and lucid argument this is a perfect gem; it was enthusiastically praised
                    by John Sterling, and has been republished by F. D. Maurice. Law’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Case of Reason</hi> (1732), in answer to TindaΓs <hi
                        rend="italic">Christianity as old as the Creation</hi> is to a great extent
                    an anticipation of Bishop Butler’s famous argument in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Analogy.</hi> In this work Law shows himself at least the equal of the
                    ablest champion of Deism. His <hi rend="italic">Letters to a Lady inclined to
                        enter the Church of Rome</hi> are excellent specimens of the attitude which
                    a High-Churchman maintains against Romanism.</p>
                <p>2. As a very effective writer on practical divinity. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life</hi> (1729), together with its
                    predecessor, <hi rend="italic">A Treatise of Christian Perfection</hi> (1726),
                    deeply influenced the chief actors in the great Evangelical revival. The
                    Wesleys, Whitefield, Venn, Scott, and Adam all express their deep obligation to
                    the author. The <hi rend="italic">Serious Call</hi> affected other’s quite as
                    deeply. Dr Johnson, Gibbon, Lord Lyttelton, and Bishop Horne all speak
                    enthusiastically of its merits; and it has been, until lately, perhaps the only
                    work by which its author was popularly known. In a tract entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">The Absolute Unlawfulness of Stage Entertainments,</hi> Law,
                    unlike himself, was tempted by the undoubted corruptions of the stage of the
                    period to use language which transcends the bounds of reason.</p>
                <p>3. As one of the few English mystics. Though the least popular, by far the most
                    interesting, original, and suggestive of all Law’s works are those which he
                    wrote in his later years, after he had become an enthusiastic admirer (not a
                    disciple) of Jacob Boehme, the Teutonic theosopher. From his earliest years he
                    had been deeply impressed with the piety, beauty, and thoughtfulness of the
                    writings of the Christian mystics, but it was not till after his accidental
                    meeting with the works of Boehme, about 1734, that pronounced mysticism appears
                    in his works. It would far transcend the limits of this article to describe,
                    however briefly, the purport of Law’s mystic writings. All are very beautiful;
                    some are wild and fanciful; but not one of them is inconsistent with his
                    position as a churchman, and even a very high churchman of the spiritual type.
