                    (1621-1695), one of the most popular and original of French poets, was born at
                    Château Thierry in Champagne, probably on the 8th of July 1621’, and died at
                    Paris on the 13th of April 1695. His father was Charles de La Fontaine, “maître
                    des eaux et forêts”—a kind of deputy-ranger—of the duchy of Château Thierry; his
                    mother was Françoise Pidoux. On both sides his family was of the highest
                    provincial middle class, but was not noble; his father was also fairly wealthy.
                    Jean, who was the eldest child of his parents, was educated <pb break="no"

                    (grammar school) of his native town, and at the end of his school days he had,
                    singularly enough, an idea of taking orders. He entered the Oratory in May 1641,
                    and the seminary of St Magloire in October of the same year; but a very short
                    sojourn proved to him that he had mistaken his vocation. He then apparently
                    studied law, and is said to have been admitted as <hi rend="italic">avocat,</hi>
                    though there does not seem to be actual proof of this. He was, however, settled
                    in life, or at least might have been so, somewhat early. In 1647 his father
                    resigned his rangership in his favour, and arranged a marriage for him with
                    Marie Héricart, a young girl of sixteen, who brought him twenty thousand livres,
                    and expectations. She seems to have been both handsome and intelligent, but the
                    two did not get on well together. There appears to be absolutely no ground for
                    the vague scandal as to her conduct, which was, for the most part long
                    afterwards, raised by gossips or personal enemies of La Fontaine. AU that is
                    positively said against her is that she was a negligent housewife and an
                    inveterate novel reader; La Fontaine on the other hand was constantly away from
                    home, was certainly not strict in point of conjugal fidelity, and was so bad a
                    man of business that his affairs became involved in hopeless difficulty, and a
                        <hi rend="italic">separation</hi><hi rend="italic">de biens</hi> had to take
                    place in 1658. This was for the benefit of the family, and was a perfectly
                    amicable transaction; by degrees, however, the pair, still without any actual
                    quarrel, ceased to live together, and for the greater part of the last forty
                    years of La Fontaine’s life he himself lived in Paris while his wife dwelt at
                    Château Thierry, which, however, he frequently visited. One son was born to them
                    in 1653, and was educated and· taken care of wholly by his mother.</p>
                <p>Even in the earlier years of his marriage La Fontaine seems to have been much at
                    Paris, but it was not till about 1656 that he became a regular visitor to the
                    capital. The duties of his office, which were only occasional, were compatible
                    with this non-residence, and he continued to hold it till 1672. It was not till
                    he was past thirty that his literary career began, for he was by no means a
                    precocious writer. The reading of Malherbe, it is said, first awoke poetical
                    fancies in him, but for some time he attempted nothing but trifles in the
                    fashion of the time— epigrams, ballades, rondeaux, &amp;c. His first serious
                    work was a translation or adaptation of the <hi rend="italic">Eunuchus</hi> of
                    Terence (1654). At this time the Maecenas of French letters was the
                    superintendant Fouquet, to whom La Fontaine was introduced by Jacques Jannart, a
                    connexion of his wife’s. Few people who had paid their court to Fouquet went
                    away empty-handed, and La Fontaine soon received a pension of 1000 livres
                    (1659), in repayment possibly of the poem of <hi rend="italic">Adonis</hi> which
                    in 1658 he had, in manuscript, dedicated to the financier. He began too a medley
                    of prose and poetry, entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Songe de Vaux,</hi> on
                    Fouquet’s famous country house. It was about this time, as has been said, that
                    his wife’s property had to be separately secured to her, and he seems by degrees
                    to have had to sell everything of his own; but, as he never lacked powerful and
                    generous patrons, this was of small importance to him, especially as he had no
                    establishment to maintain. In the same year he wrote a ballet, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Les Rieurs</hi><hi rend="italic">du Beau-Richard,</hi> and this was
                    followed by many small pieces of occasional poetry addressed to various
                    personages great and small, from the king downwards. Fouquet soon incurred the
                    royal displeasure, but La Fontaine, like most of his literary protégés, was not
                    unfaithful to him, the well-known elegy <hi rend="italic">Pleurez, Nymphes de
                        Vaux,</hi> being by no means the only proof of his devotion. Indeed it is
                    thought not improbable that a journey to Limoges which he took in 1663 in
                    company with Jannart, and of which we have an account written to his wife, was
                    not wholly spontaneous, as it certainly was not on Jannart’s part. · Just at
                    this time his affairs did not look promising. His father and himself had assumed
                    the title of esquire, to which they were not strictly entitled, and, some old
                    edicts on the subject having been put in force by the king, an informer procured
                    a sentence against the poet fining him 2000 livres, which from what is known of
                    the state of his private affairs it was probably impossible for him to pay. He
                    found, however, a new protector in the duke and still more in the duchess of
                    Bouillon, his feudal superiors at Château Thierry, and nothing more is heard of
                    the fine. Some of La Fontaine’s liveliest verses are addressed to the duchess,
                    Anne Mancini, the youngest of Mazarin’s nieces, and it is even probable that the
                    taste of the duke and duchess for Ariosto had something to do with the writing
                    of his first work of real importance, the first book of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Contes,</hi> which appeared in 1664. He was then, let it be remembered,
                    forty-three years old, and his previous printed productions had been
                    comparatively trivial, though, as was the habit of the time, much of his work
                    was handed about iu manuscript long before it was regularly published. It was
                    about this time that the quartette of the Rue du Vieux Colombier, so famous in
                    French literary history, was formed. It consisted of La Fontaine, Racine,
                    Boileau, and Molière, the last of whom was almost of the same age as La
                    Fontaine, the other two considerably younger. Chapelle was also a kind of
                    outsider in the coterie. There are many anecdotes, some of which are pretty
                    obviously apocryphal, about these meetings. The most characteristic of these is
                    perhaps that which asserts that a copy of Chapelain’s unlucky <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pucelle</hi> always lay on the table, a certain number of lines of which
                    was the appointed punishment for offences against the company. The coterie
                    furnished under feigned names the personages of Lι Fontaine’s version of the
                    Cupid and Psyche story, which, however, with <hi rend="italic">Adonis,</hi> was
                    not printed till 1669. Mean while the poet continued to find friends. In 1664 he
                    was regularly commissioned and sworn in as gentleman to the duchess dowager of
                    Orleans, and was installed in the Luxembourg. He still retained his rangership,
                    and in 1666 we have something like a reprimand from Colbert suggesting that he
                    should look into some malpractices at Château Thierry. In the same year appeared
                    the second book of the <hi rend="italic">Contes,</hi> and in 1668 the first six
                    books of the <hi rend="italic">Fables,</hi> with more of both kinds in 1671. In
                    this latter year a curious instance of the docility with which the poet lent
                    himself to any influence was afforded by his officiating at the instance of the
                    Port-Royalists as editor of a volume of sacred poetry dedicated to the Prince de
                    Conti. A year afterwards his situation, which had for some time been decidedly
                    flourishing, showed signs of changing very much for the worse. The duchess of
                    Orleans died, and he apparently had to give up his rangership, probably selling
                    it to pay debts. But there was always a providence for La Fontaine. Madame de la
                    Sablière, a woman of great beauty, of considerable intellectual power, and of
                    high character, invited him to make his home in her house, where he lived for
                    some twenty years. He seems to have had no trouble whatever about his affairs
                    thenceforward; he was free to amuse himself or to work as he liked, and as a
                    matter of fact he worked steadily at his two different lines of poetry. Besides
                    these he ventured on a third, in which he met and indeed deserved much less
                    success,—that of theatrical composition.</p>
                <p>The next event of importance in La Fontaine’s life, apart from the publication of
                    his works, did not occur till after nearly ten years. In 1682 he was a man of
                    more than sixty years old, recognized as one of the first men of letters of
                    France. Madame de Sévigné, one of the soundest literary critics of the time, and
                    by no means given to praise <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n216/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0216-0205"/> were novelties, had spoken of his second
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> published in the winter of 1678 as
                    divine; and it is pretty certain that this was the general opinion. It was not
                    unreasonable therefore that he should present himself to the Academy, and,
                    though the subjects of his <hi rend="italic">Contes</hi> were scarcely
                    calculated to propitiate that decorous assembly, while his attachment to Fouquet
                    and to more than one representative of the old Frondeur party made him suspect
                    to Colbert and the king, most of the members were his personal friends. He was
                    first proposed in 1682, but was rejected for Dangeau. The next year Colbert died
                    and La Fontaine was again nominated. Boileau was also a candidate, but the first
                    ballot gave the fabulist sixteen votes against seven only for the critic. The
                    king, whose assent was necessary, not rtιerely for election but for a second
                    ballot in case of the failure of an absolute majority, was ill-pleased, and the
                    election was left pending. Another vacancy occurred, however, some months later,
                    and to this Boileau was elected. The king hastened to approve the choice
                    effusively, adding, “Vous pouvez incessamment recevoir La Fontaine, il a promis
                    d’être sage.” His admission was indirectly the cause of the only serious
                    literary quarrel of his life. A dispute,.into the particulars of which there is
                    no need to enter here, took place between the Academy and one of its members,
                    Furetière, on the subject of the latter’s French dictionary, which was decided
                    to be a breach of the Academy’s corporate privileges. Furetière, a man of no
                    small ability, bitterly assailed those whom he considered to be his enemies, and
                    among them La Fontaine, whose fault probably was not so much that he was a
                    principal offender as that the unlucky <hi rend="italic">Contes</hi> made him
                    peculiarly vulnerable. His second collection of these tales had been actually
                    the subject of a police condemnation, of which, as may be supposed, Furetière
                    did not fail to make the most. The death of the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Roman Bourgeois,</hi> however, put an end to this quarrel. Shortly
                    afterwards La Fontaine had a share in a still more famous affair, the celebrated
                    ancient-and-modern squabble in which Boileau and Perrault were the chiefs, and
                    in which La Fontaine (though he had been specially singled out by Perrault for
                    favourable comparison with Aesop and Phaedrus) took the ancient side. About the
                    same time (1685-87) he made the acquaintance of the last of his many hosts and
                    protectors, Monsieur and Madame d’Hervart, and fell in love with a certain
                    Madame Ulrich, a lady of some position but of doubtful character. This
                    acquaintance was accompanied by a great familiarity with Vendome, Chaulieu, and
                    the rest of the libertine coterie of the Temple; but, though Madame de la
                    Sablière had long given herself up almost entirely to good works and religious
                    exercises, La Fontaine continued an inmate of her house until her death in 1693.
                    What followed is told in one of the best known of the many stories bearing on
                    his childlike nature. Hervart on hearing of the death, had set out at once to
                    find La Fontaine. He met him in the street in great sorrow, and begged him to
                    make his home at his house. “J’ y allais” was La Fontaine’s answer. He had
                    already undergone the process of conversion during a severe illness which befell
                    him the year before. An energetic young priest, M. Poucet, had brought him, not
                    indeed to understand, but to acknowledge the impropriety of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Contes,</hi> and it is said that the destruction of a new play
                    of some merit was demanded and submitted to as a proof of repentance. A pleasant
                    story is told of the young duke of Burgundy, Fénelon’s pupil, who was then only
                    eleven years old, sending 50 louis to La Fontaine as a present of his own
                    motion. But though La Fontaine recovered for the time he was quite broken by age
                    and infirmity, and his new hosts had to nurse rather than to entertain him,
                    which they did very carefully and kindly. He did a little more work, completing
                    his <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> among other things; but he did not survive
                    Madame de la Sablière much more than two years, dying on the 13th of April 1695,
                    at the age of seventy-three. He was buried in the cemetery of the Holy
                    Innocents. His wife survived him nearly fifteen years, and his posterity lasted
                    until the present century.</p>
                <p>The curious personal character of La Fontaine, like that of some other men of
                    letters, has been enshrined in a kind of myth or legend by literary tradition.
                    At an early age his absence of mind and indifference to business gave a subject
                    to Tallemant des Réaux, the most indefatigable and least scrupulous (at best the
                    least critical) of gossips. His later contemporaries helped to swell the tale,
                    and the 18th century finally accepted it. We have neither space nor desire to
                    recount the anecdotes of his meeting his son, being told who he was, and
                    remarking, “Ah, yes, I thought I had seen him somewhere !” of his insisting on
                    fighting a duel with a supposed admirer of his wife, and then imploring him to
                    visit at his house just as before; of his going into company with his stockings
                    wrong side out, &lt;fcc. It may be taken for granted that much of this is
                    apocryphal, and the companion anecdotes of his awkwardness and silence, if not
                    positive rudeness, in company are still more doubtful. It ought to be
                    remembered, as a comment on the unfavourable description which La Bruyère gives
                    or is supposed to give of his social abilities, that La Fontaine was a special
                    friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyère’s chief literary enemy, who long
                    prevented the author of the <hi rend="italic">Caractères</hi> from entering the
                    Academy. But after all deductions much will remain, especially when it is
                    remembered that one of the chief authorities for such anecdotes is Louis Racine,
                    a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his
                    father, La Fontaine’s attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the
                    best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier
                    quartette, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising
                    their wits upon “le bonhomme” or “le bon” (by both which titles La Fontaine was
                    familarly known), remarked to a bystander “nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils
                    n’effaceront pas le bonhomme.” They have not effaced him and will not do so, and
                    the half contemptuous term “nos beaux esprits” marks well enough the sound
                    judgment of the greatest of the four as to the merits of his companions.</p>
                <p>The works of La Fontaine, the total bulk of which is considerable, fall no less
                    naturally than traditionally into three divisions, the Fables, the Contes, and
                    the miscellaneous works. Of these the first may be said to be known universally,
                    the second to be known to all lovers of French literature, the third to be with
                    a few exceptions practically forgotten. This distribution of the judgment of
                    posterity is as usual just in the main, but not wholly. There are excellent
                    things in the Oeuvres Diverses, but their excellence is only occasional, and it
                    is not at the best equal to that of the Fables or the Contes. It was thought by
                    contemporary judges who were both competent and friendly that La Fontaine
                    attempted too many styles, and there is something in the criticism. His dramatic
                    efforts are especially weak, and indeed it is evident that his forte lay neither
                    in the dramatic delineation of character nor in the arrangement of dramatic
                    action. The best pieces usually published under his name—Ragotin, Le Florentin,
                    La Coupe Enchantée, were not originally fathered by him but by Champmeslé, the
                    husband of the famous actress who captivated Racine and Charles de Sévigné. His
                    avowed work was chiefly in the form of opera, a form of no great value at its
                    best. Psyche has all the advantages of its charming story and of La Fontaine’s
                    style, but it is perhaps principally interesting nowadays because of the
                    framework of personal conversation already alluded to. The mingled prose and
                    verse of the Songe de Vaux is not uninteresting, but its best things, such as
                    the description of night—</p>
                <p>“Laissant tomber les fleurs et ne les semant pas,” which has enchanted French
                    critics, are little more than conceits, though as in this case sometimes very
                    beautiful conceits. The elegies, the epistles, the epigrams, the ballades,
                    contain many things which would be very creditable to a minor poet or a writer

                    and judged simply according to their rauk in that kind, they fall far below the
                    merits of the two great collections of verse narratives which have assured La
                    Fontaine’s immortality.</p>
                <p>Between the actual literary merits of the two there is not much to choose, but
                    the change of manners and the altered standard of literary decency has thrown
                    the Contes into the shade. These tales are identical in general character with
                    those which amused Europe from the days of the early fabliau writers through the
                    period of the great Italian novelliert to that of the second great group of
                    French tale-tellers ranging from Antoine de la Salle to Béroalde de Verville.
                    Light love, the misfortunes of husbands, the cunning of wives, the breach of
                    their vows by ecclesiastics, constitute the staple of their subject. In some
                    respects La Fontaine is the best of such tale-tellers, while he is certainly the
                    latest who deserves such excuse as may be claimed by a writer who does not
                    choose indecent subjects from a deliberate knowledge that they are considered
                    indecent and with a deliberate desire to pander to a vicious taste. No one who
                    followed him in the style can claim this excuse; he can, and the way in which
                    contemporaries of stainless virtue such as Madame de Sévigné speak of his work
                    shows that though the new public opinion was growing up it was not finally
                    accepted. In the Contes La Fontaine for the most part attempts little
                    originality of theme. He takes his stories (varying them it is true in detail
                    not a little) from Boccaccio, from Marguerite, from the Cent Nouvelles
                    Nouvelles, &amp;c. He applies to them his marvellous power of easy sparkling
                    narration, and his hardly less marvellous faculty of saying more or less
                    outrageous things in the most polite and gentlemanly manner. These Contes have
                    indeed certain drawbacks. They are not penetrated by the half pagan ardour for
                    physical beauty and the delights of sense which animates and excuses the early
                    Italian Renaissance. They have not the subtle mixture of passion and sensuality,
                    of poetry and appetite, which distinguishes the work of Marguerite and of the
                    Pléiade. They are emphatically contes pour rire, a genuine expression of the
                    esprit gaulois of the fabliau writers and of Rabelais, destitute of the
                    grossness of envelope which had formerly covered that spirit. A comparison of
                    “La Fiancee du Roi de Garbe” with its original in Boccaccio (especially if the
                    reader takes Μ. Émile Montegut’s admirable essay as a commentary) will
                    illustrate betteι ’ than anything else what they have and what they have not.
                    Some writers have pleaded hard for the admission of actual passion of the
                    poetical sort in such pieces as “La Courtisane Amoureuse,” but as a whole it
                    must be admitted to be absent.</p>
                <p>The Fables, with hardly less animation and narrative art than the Contes, are
                    free from disadvantages (according to modern notions) of subject, and exhibit
                    the versatility and fecundity of the author’s talent perhaps even more fully. La
                    Fontaine had of course many predecessors in the fable and especially in the
                    beast fable. In his first issue, comprising what are now called the first six
                    books, he adhered to the path of these predecessors with some closeness; but in
                    the later collections he allowed himself far more liberty, and it is in these
                    parts that his genius is most fully manifested. The boldness of the politics is
                    as much to be considered as the ingenuity of the moralizing, as the intimate
                    knowledge of human nature displayed in the substance of the narratives, or as
                    the artistic mastery shown in their form. It has sometimes been objected that
                    the view of human character which La Fontaine expresses is unduly dark, and
                    resembles too much that of La Rochefoucauld, for whom the poet had certainly a
                    profound admiration. The discussion of this point would lead us too far here. It
                    may only be said that satire (and La Fontaine is eminently a satirist)
                    necessarily concerns itself with the dark rather more than with the lighter
                    shades. Indeed the objection has become pretty nearly obsolete with the
                    obsolescence of what may be called the sentimental-ethical school of criticism.
                    Its last overt expression was made some thirty years ago, in a curious outburst
                    of Lamartine’s, excellently answered by Sainte-Beuve. Exception has also been
                    taken to the Fables on more purely literary grounds by Lessing, but, as this
                    exception depends on differences inevitable between those who would shape all
                    literature on rules derived from the study of Greek models and those who with
                    the highest respect for those models rank them only among and not above others,
                    it is equally needless to enter into it. Perhaps the best criticism ever passed
                    upon La Fontaine’s Fables is that of Silvestre de Sacy, to the effect that they
                    supply three several delights to three several ages: the child rejoices in the
                    freshness and vividness of the story, the eager student of literature in the
                    consummate art with which it is told, the experienced man of the world in the
                    subtle reflexions on character and life w ιich it conveys. Nor has anyone, with
                    the exception of a few paradoxem like Rousseau and a few sentimentalists like
                    Lamartine, denied that the moral tone of the whole is as fresh and healthy as
                    its literary interest is vivid. The book has therefore naturally become the
                    standard reading book of French both at home and abroad, a position which it
                    shares in verse with the Télémaque of Fénelon in prose. It is no small testimony
                    to its merit that not even this use or misuse has interfered with its popularity
                    among French men of letters, who, with hardly an exception, speak as
                    affectionately of it as if they had never been kept in on a summer’s day to
                    learn La Cigale et la Fourmi.</p>
                <p>The general literary character of La Fontaine is, with allowance made for the
                    difference of subject, visible equally in the Fables and in the Contes, and it
                    is necessary to say a few words as to the nature of this character. Perhaps one
                    of the hardest sayings in French literature for au English student is the dictum
                    of Joubert to the effect that “Il y a dans La Fontaine une plénitude de poésie
                    qu’on ne trouve nulle part dans les autres auteurs Français.” Most English
                    critics would probably admit at once La Fontaine’s claim to a position in the
                    first class of writers, but would demur to his admission to the first class of
                    poets. The difference arises from the ambiguity of the terms. In Joubert’s time,
                    and perhaps a good deal later, inventiveness of fancy and diligent observation
                    of the rules of art were held to complete the poetical differentia, and in both
                    these La Fontaine deserves if not the first almost the first place among French
                    poets. _ As to the first point there is hardly any dispute; few writers either
                    in French or any other language have ever equalled him in this respect. In his
                    hands the oldest story becomes novel, the most hackneyed moral piquant, the most
                    commonplace details fresh and appropriate. As to the second point there has not
                    been such unanimous agreement. It used to be considered that La Fontaine’s
                    ceaseless diversity of metre, his archaisms, his licences in rhyme and
                    orthography, were merely ingenious devices for the sake of easy writing,
                    intended to evade the trammels of the stately couplet and rimes difficiles
                    enjoined by Boileau. Lamartine in the attack already mentioιied affects contempt
                    of the “vers boiteux, disloqués, inégaux, sans Symmetrie ni dans l’oreille ni
                    sur la page.” This opinion may be said to have been finally exploded by the most
                    accurate metrical critic and one of the most skilful metrical practitioners that
                    France has ever had, Μ. Théodore de Banville; and it is only surprising that it
                    should ever have been entertained by any professional maker of verse. There can
                    be little doubt that La Fontaine saw the drawbacks of the “Alexandrine prison,”
                    as it has been called, but in freeing himself from it he by no means took refuge
                    in merely pedestrian verse. His irregularities are strictly regulated, his
                    cadences carefully arranged, and the whole effect may be said to be (though of
                    course in a light and tripping measure instead of a stately one) similar to that
                    of the stanzas of the English pindaric ode in the hands of Dryden or Collins.
                    There is therefore nothing against La Fontaine on the score of invention and
                    nothing on the score of art. But something more, at least according to English
                    standards, is wanted to make up a “plenitude of poesy,” and this something more
                    La Fontaine seldom or never exhibits. In words used by Joubert himself
                    elsewhere, he never “transports.” The faculty of transporting is of course
                    possessed and used in very different manners by different poets. In some it
                    takes the form of passion, in some of half mystical enthusiasm for nature, in
                    some of commanding eloquence, in some of moral fervour. La Fontaine has none of
                    these things: he is always amusing, always sensible, always clever, sometimes
                    even affecting, but at the same time always more or less prosaic, were it not
                    for his admirable versification. The few passages which may be cited to the
                    contrary are doubtfully admissible, and cannot in any case suffice to leaven so
                    great a mass of other work. It is needless to say that this is no discredit to
                    him. A man can but be the very best in his own special line, and that very best
                    La Fontaine assuredly is. He is not a great poet, and a deficiency very similar
                    to that which deprives him of this name deprives him of the name of a great
                    humorist; but he is the most admirable teller of light tales in verse that has
                    ever existed in any time or country; and he has established in his verse-tale a
                    model which is never likely to be surpassed, and which has enriched literature
                    with much delightful work.</p>
                <p>La Fontaine did not during his life issue any complete edition of his works, nor
                    even of the two greatest and most important divisions of them. The most
                    remarkable of his separate publications have already been noticed. Others were
                    the Poëme de la Captivité de St Male (1673), one of the pieces inspired by the
                    Port-Royalists, the Poëme du Quinquina (1602), a piece of task work also, though
                    of a very different kind, and a number of pieces published either in small
                    pamphlets or with the works of other men. Among the latter may be singled out
                    the pieces published by the poet with the works of his friend Maucroix (1685).
                    The year after his death some posthumous works appeared, and some years after
                    his son’s death the scattered poems, letters, &amp;c., with the addition of some
                    unpublished work bought from the family in manuscript, were carefully edited and
                    published as Oeuvres Diverses (1729). During the 18th century two of the most
                    magnificent illustrated editions ever published of any poet reproduced the two
                    chief works of La Fontaine. The Fables were illustrated by Oudry (1755-59), the
                    Contes by Eisen (1762). This latter under the title of “Edition des
                    Fermiers-Généraux” fetches a high price. During the first thirty years of the
                    present century Walckenaer, a great student of French 17th century classics,
                    published for the house of Didot three successive editions of La Fontaine, the
                    last (1826-27) being perhaps entitled to the rank of the standard edition. More
                    recently the editions of Μ. Marty-Laveaux in the Bibliothèque Elzévirenne, A.

                    Lemerre, and L. Moland in that of Μ. Garnier supply in different forms all that
                    can be wished. The second is the handsomest, the third, which is complete,
                    perhaps the most generally useful. Editions, selections, translations, &amp;c.,
                    of the Fables, especially for school use, are innumerable; but an illustrated
                    edition published by the Librairie des Bibliophiles (1874) deserves to be
                    mentioned as not unworthy of its 18th century predecessors. (G. SA. )</p>
