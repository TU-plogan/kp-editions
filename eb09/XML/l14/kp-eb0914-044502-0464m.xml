                    (1615-1705), was the daughter of a gentleman of good position in Touraine. Her
                    long and eventful life divides into two periods, during the former of which she
                    was the typical Frenchwoman of the gayest and most licentious society of the
                    17th century, during the latter the recognized leader of the fashion in Paris,
                    and the friend of wits and poets. Of her earlier life the less said the better,
                    and in her defence all that can be pleaded is that she had been educated by her
                    father in the epicurean and sensual beliefs made popular by Montaigne, and that
                    she retained throughout the frank demeanour, and disregard of money, which won
                    from Saint Évremond the remark that she was an <hi rend="italic">honnête
                    homme.</hi> Against her, and the numerous specious defences set up for her by
                    contemporaneous and subsequent French writers, must be mentioned her absolute
                    want of maternal feeling and even of natural shame. The well-known visit of
                    Queen Christina to her attests the extent of her renown, or infamy, and the
                    inefficacy of the threats of Anne of Austria prove her power. Of a perfectly
                    different character was her later life, when, though she had continued her
                    career of debauchery for a preposterous length of time, she settled down to the
                    social leadership of Paris. Then there were to be found in her salon all that
                    was most witty and refinedin France,—“ladies as well as gentlemen of the highest
                    birth,” remarks a correspondent to Madame de Sevigné, poets like Molière, abbés
                    like Chateauneuf, Genevese preachers like Turretin, the protégé of Saint
                    Évremond. It became the fashion for young men as well as old to throng round
                    her, and the best of all introductions for a young man who wished to make a
                    figure in society was an introduction to Mdlle. de Lenclos. The cause for this
                    surpassing social success is to be found perhaps as much in her past notoriety,
                    and past intimacy with the great names of the last generation, as in the wit and
                    tact, to which Saint Évremond, and after him Sainte-Beuve, ascribe it. Her long
                    friendship with Saint Évremond must be shortly noticed. They were of the same
                    age, and had been intimate in their youth, and throughout his long exile the wit
                    seems to have kept a kind remembrance of Ninon. The few really authentic letters
                    of Ninon herself are those addressed to her old friend, and the letters of both
                    in the last few years of their equally long lives are exceptionally touching,
                    and unique in the polite compliments with which they try to keep off old age. If
                    Ninon owes part of her posthumous fame to the old wit, she owes at least as much
                    to the young Arouet, who was presented to her as a promising boy poet by the
                    abbé de Chateauneuf, to whom she left 2000 francs to buy books, and who, as
                    Voltaire, was to write a letter on her which was to be the chief authority of
                    many subsequent biographers. Her personal appearance is, according to
                    Sainte-Beuve, best described in a novel of Mdlle. de Scudéry, and the
                    characteristic of it was neither beauty nor wit, but high spirits, and perfect
                    evenness of temperament.</p>
                <p>The letters of Ninon published after her death were, according to Voltaire, all
                    spurious, and the only authentic ones are those to Saint Évremond, which can be
                    best studied in DauxmesniΓs edition of <hi rend="italic">Saint Évremond,</hi>
                    and his notice on her. Sainte-Beuve has an interesting notice of these letters
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Causeries du Lundi,</hi> vol. iv. Most biographies of
                    Ninon are full of unauthentic stories.</p>
