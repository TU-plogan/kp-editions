                    son’s youth, the lands of Lauriston near Edinburgh. John lived at home till he
                    was twenty, and then went to London. He had already studied mathematics, and the
                    theory of commerce and political economy, with much interest; but he was known
                    rather as a fop than as a scholar. In London he gambled, drank, and flirted till
                    in April 1694 a love intrigue resulted in a duel. He killed his antagonist, and
                    was arrested, tried, found guilty, and condemned to death. His life was spared,
                    but he was detained in prison. He found means to escape, and fled to Holland,
                    then the greatest commercial country in Europe. Here he observed with close
                    attention the practical working of banking and financial business, and conceived
                    the first ideas of his celebrated “system.” After a few years spent in
                    foreign.travel, he returned to Scotland, then exhausted and enraged by the
                    failure of the Darien expedition (1695-1701). He propounded plans for the relief
                    of his country in a work<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>A work entitled <hi rend="italic">Proposals and Reasons for constituting a
                    Council of Trade in Scotland</hi> was published anonymously at Edinburgh in
                    1701. It was republished at Glasgow in 1751 with Law’s name attached; but
                    several references in the state papers of the time mention William Paterson
                    (1658-1719), founder of the Bank of England, as the author of the plan therein
                    propounded. Even if Law had nothing to do with the composition of the work, he
                    must have read it and been influenced by it. This may explain how it contains
                    the germs of many of the developments of the “system.” Certainly the suggestion
                    contained in the pamphlet of a central board, to manage great commercial
                    undertakings, to furnish occupation for the poor, to encourage mining, fishing,
                    and manufactures, and to bring about a reduction in the rate of interest, is a
                    plan which was to no inconsiderable extent actually realized in the Mississippi
                    scheme. See Bannister’s <hi rend="italic">Life of William Paterson</hi> (ed.
                    1858), and <hi rend="italic">Writings of William Paterson</hi> (2d ed., 3 vols.,

                    Proposal for Supplying the Nation with Money</hi> (1705). This attracted some
                    notice, but had no practical effect, and Law again betook himself to wandering
                    over the Continent. He visited Brussels, Paris, Vienna, Genoa, Rome, making
                    large sums by gambling and speculation, and spending them in a lavish and
                    reckless manner. He was in Paris in 1708, and made some proposals to the
                    Government as to their financial difficulties, but Louis XIV. declined to treat
                    with a “Huguenot,” and D’Argenson, chief of the police, had him expelled the
                    city as a suspicious character. He had, however, become intimately acquainted
                    with the duke of Orleans, and, when in 1715 the king died, and that prince
                    became regent, Law at once returned to the French capital. The extravagant
                    expenditure of the late monarch had plunged the kingdom into apparently
                    inextricable financial confusion. The debt was 3 milliard livres, the estimated
                    annual expenditure, exclusive of interest payments, 148 million livres, and the
                    income about the same.</p>
                <p>The advisability of declaring a national bankruptcy was seriously discussed, and
                    though this plan was rejected measures hardly less violent were resorted to. By
                    a <hi rend="italic">visa,</hi> or examination of the state liabilities by a
                    committee with full powers of quashing claims, the debt was reduced nearly a
                    half, the coin in circulation was ordered to be called in and reissued at the
                    rate of 120 for 100,—a measure by which foreign coiners profited greatly; and a
                    chamber of justice was established to punish speculators, to whom the
                    difficulties of the state were ascribed. These measures had so little success
                    that the <hi rend="italic">billets d!etat</hi> which were issued as part
                    security for the new debt at once sank 75 per cent, below their nominal value.
                    At this crisis Law came forward and unfolded a vast scheme to the perplexed
                    regent. A royal bank was to be founded. It was to manage the trade and currency
                    of the kingdom, to collect the taxes, and free the country from debt. The
                    council of finance then under the duke of Noailles, opposed the plan, but the
                    regent allowed Law to go on with part of it in a tentative way. By an edict of
                    2d May 1716, a private institution called <hi rend="italic">La Banque</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Generale,</hi> and managed by Law, was founded. The capital was 6
                    million livres, divided into 1200 shares of 5000 livres, payable iu four
                    instalments, one-fourth in cash, three-fourths in <hi rend="italic">billets
                    cl</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">etat.</hi> It was to perform the ordinary functions
                    of a bank, and had pow er to issue notes payable at sight in the weight and
                    value of the money mentioned at day of issue. The bank was a great and immediate
                    success. By providing for the absorption of part of the state paper it raised to
                    some extent the credit of the Government. The notes were a most desirable medium
                    of exchange, for they had the element of fixity of value, which was, owing to
                    the arbitrary mint decrees of the Government, wanting in the coin of the realm.
                    They were also found the most convenient instruments of remittance between the
                    capital and the provinces, and they thus developed and increased the industries
                    of the latter. The rate of interest, previously enormous and uncertain, fell
                    first to 6 and then to 4 per cent.; and when another decree (10th April 1717)
                    ordered collectors of taxes to receive notes as payment, and to change them for
                    coin at request, the bank so rose in favour that it had soon a note issue of 60
                    million livres. Law now gained the full confidence of the regent, and was
                    allowed to proceed with the development of the “system.”</p>
                <p>The trade of the large and fertile region in North America about the Mississippi
                    had been granted to a speculator named Crozart. He found the undertaking too
                    large, and was glad to give it up. By a decree of August 1717 Law was allowed to
                    establish the <hi rend="italic">Compagnie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Indes-Occidentales,</hi> and to endow it with privileges
                    practically amounting to sovereignty over the most fertile region of North
                    America. The capital was 100 millions, divided into 200,000 shares of 500
                    livres. The payments were to be one-fourth in coin and three-fourths in <hi
                    rend="italic">billets d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">etat.</hi> On these last the
                    Government was to pay 3 millions livres interest yearly to the company. As the
                    state paper was depreciated the shares fell much below par. The rapid rise of
                    Law had made him many enemies, and they took advantage of this to attack the
                    system. D’Argenson, the former chief of the police, and now, in succession to De
                    Noailles, head of the council of finance, with the brothers Paris of Grenoble,
                    famous tax farmers of the day, formed what was called the “anti-system.” The
                    farming of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0385-0368"/> taxes was let to them, under an assumed name, for
                    48⅛ million livres yearly. A company was formed the exact counterpart of the
                    Mississippi company. The capital was the same, divided in the same manner, but
                    the payments were to be entirely in money. The returns from the public revenue
                    were sure; those from the Mississippi scheme were not. Hence the shares of the
                    latter were for some time out of favour. Law proceeded unmoved with the
                    development of his plans. On the 4th December 1718 the bank became a Government
                    institution under the name of <hi rend="italic">La Banque</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Loyale.</hi> Law was director, and the king guaranteed the notes. The
                    shareholders were repaid in coin, and, to widen the influence of the new
                    institution, the transport of money between towns where it had branches was
                    forbidden. The paper issue now reached 110 millions. Law had such confidence in
                    the success of his plans that he agreed to take over shares in the Mississippi
                    company at par at a near date. The shares began rapidly to rise. The next move
                    was to unite the companies <hi rend="italic">Des Indes Orientales</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">De Chine,</hi> founded in 1664 and 1713 respectively, but now
                    dwindled away to a shadow, to his company. The united association was called <hi
                    rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Compagnie des Indes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> it had practically the monopoly of the foreign trade of France. These
                    proceedings necessitated the creation of new capital to the nominal amount of 25
                    million livres. The payment was spread over 20 months. It required four of the
                    old shares and a premium of 50 livres to obtain a new one. All these 500 livre
                    shares rapidly rose to 750, or 50 per cent, above par. Law now turned his
                    attention to the obtaining of additional powers within France itself. On the
                    25th July 1719 an edict was issued granting the company for nine years the
                    management of the mint and the coin issue. For this privilege the company paid 5
                    million livres, and the money was raised by a new issue of shares of the nominal
                    value of 500 livres, but with a premium of other 500. The list was only open for
                    twenty days, and five of the former shares were required to obtain a new one. At
                    the same time two dividends per annum of G per cent, each were promised. Again
                    there was an attempt to ruin the bank by the commonplace expedient of making a
                    run on it for coin; but the conspirators had to meet absolute power managed with
                    fearlessness and skill. An edict appeared reducing, at a given date, the value
                    of money, and those who had withdrawn coin from the bank hastened again to
                    exchange it for the more stable notes. Public confidence in Law was increased,
                    and he was enabled rapidly to proceed with the completion of the system. A
                    decree of 27th ∕∖,ugust 1719 deprived the rival company of the farming of the
                    revenue, and. gave it to the <hi rend="italic">Compagnie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Indes</hi> for nine years in return for an annual payment of 52 million
                    livres. Thus at one blow the anti-system was crushed. One thing yet remained;
                    Law proposed to take over the national debt, and manage it on terms advantageous
                    to the state. The mode of transfer was this. The debt was over 1500 million
                    livres. Notes were to be issued to that amount, and with these the state
                    creditors were to be paid in a certain order. Shares were to be issued at
                    intervals corresponding to the payments, and it was expected that the notes
                    would be used in buying these. The Government was to pay 3 per cent, for the
                    loan. It had formerly been bound to pay 80 millions, it would now pay under 50,
                    a clear gain of over 30. As the shares of the company were almost the only
                    medium for investment, the transfer would be surely effected. The creditors
                    would now look to the Government payments and the commercial gains of the
                    company for their annual returns. Indeed the creditors were often not able to
                    procure the shares, for each succeeding issue was immediately seized upon. The
                    third, on the 2d October, for 500 millions, divided into shares of (with
                    premium) 5000 livres each, was taken up as eagerly as its predecessors, and the
                    shares immediately resold at 8000 livres in the Rue Quincampoix, then used as a
                    bourse. They went on rapidly rising as new privileges were still granted to the
                    company. Law had now more than regal power. The exiled Stuarts paid court to
                    him; the proudest aristocracy in Europe humbled themselves before him; and his
                    liberality made him the idol of the populace. After, as a necessary preliminary,
                    becoming a Catholic, he was made controller-general of the finances in place of
                    D’Argenson, who was removed to make way for him. Finally, in February 1720, the
                    bank was in name as well as in reality united to the company.</p>
                <p>The system was now complete; but it had already begun to decay. In December 1719
                    it was at its height. The shares then had mounted to 20,000 livres, forty times
                    their nominal price. A sort of madness possessed the nation. Men sold their all,
                    and hastened to Paris to speculate. The population of the capital was increased
                    by an enormous influx of provincials and foreigners. Trade received a vast
                    though unnatural impulse. Everybody seemed to be getting richer, no one poorer.
                    Those who could still reflect saw that this prosperity was not real. The whole
                    issue of shares at the extreme market price valued 12 milliard livres. It would
                    require 500 million annual revenue to give a 5 per cent, dividend on this. Now,
                    the whole income of the company as yet was hardly sufficent to pay 5 per cent,
                    on the original capital of 1 milliard 677 million livres. The receipts from the
                    taxes, &amp;c., could be precisely calculated, and it would be many years before
                    the commercial undertakings of the company—with which only some trifling
                    beginning had been made—would yield any considerable return. People began to
                    sell their shares, and to buy coin, houses, land,—anything that had a stable
                    element of value in it. There was a rapid fall in the shares, a rapid rise in
                    all kinds of property, and consequently a rapid depreciation of the paper money.
                    Law met these new tendencies by a succession of the most violent edicts. The
                    notes were to bear a premium over specie. Coin was only to be used in small
                    payments, and only a small amount was to be kept in the possession of private
                    parties. The use of diamonds, the fabrication of gold and silver plate, was
                    forbidden. A dividend of 40 per cent, on the original capital was promised. By
                    several ingenious but fallaciously reasoned pamphlets Law endeavoured to restore
                    public confidence. The shares still fell. At last, on the 5th March, an edict
                    appeared fixing the price of these at 9000 livres, and ordering the bank to buy
                    and sell them at that price. The fall now was transferred to the notes, of which
                    there were soon over 2∣ milliard livres in circulation. A large proportion of
                    the coined money was removed frcm the kingdom. Prices rose enormously. There was
                    everywhere distress and complete financial confusion. Law became an object of
                    popular hatred. He lost his court influence, and was obliged to consent to a
                    decree (21st May 1720) by which the notes and consequently the shares were
                    reduced to half their nominal value. This created such a commotion that its
                    promoters were forced to recall it, but the mischief was done. What confidence
                    could there be in the depreciated paper after such a measure? Law was removed
                    from his office, and his enemies proceeded to demolish the system. A vast number
                    of shares had been deposited in the bank. These were destroyed, The notes were
                    reconverted into Government debt, but there was first a <hi rend="italic"
                    >visa</hi> which reduced that debt to the same size as before it was taken over
                    by the company. The rate of interest was lowered, and the Government now only
                    pledged itself to pay 37 instead of 80 millions annually. Finally the bank was
                    abolished, and the company reduced to a mere trading association. By November
                    the system had disappeared. With these last <pb break="no"

                    nothing to do. He left France secretly in December 1720, resumed his wandering
                    life, and died at Venice, poor and forgotten, 21st March 1729.</p>
                <p>Of Law’s writings the most important for the comprehension of the “system” is his
                    <hi rend="italic">Money and Trade Considered.</hi> In this work he says that
                    national power and wealth consist in numbers of people, and magazines of home
                    and foreign goods. These depend on trade, and that on money, of which a greater
                    quantity employs more people; but credit, if the credit have a circulation, has
                    all the beneficial effects of money. To create and increase instruments of
                    credit is the function of a bank. Let such be created then, and let its notes be
                    only given in return for land sold or pledged. Such a currency would supply the
                    nation with abundance of money; and it would have many advantages, which Law
                    points out in detail, over silver. The bank or commission was to be a Government
                    institution, and its profits were to be spent in encouraging the export and
                    manufacture of the nation. A very evident error lies at the root of the system.
                    Money is not the result but the cause of wealth, he thought. To increase it then
                    must be beneficial, and the best way is by a properly secured paper currency.
                    This is the motive force; but it is to be applied in a particular way. Law had a
                    profound belief in the omnipotence of Government. He saw the evils of minor
                    monopolies, and of private farming of taxes. He proposed to centre foreign trade
                    and internal finance in one huge monopoly managed by the state for the people,
                    and carrying on business through a plentiful supply of paper money. He did not
                    see that trade and commerce are best left to private enterprise, and that such a
                    scheme would simply result in the profits of speculators and favourites. The
                    system indeed was never so far developed as to exhibit its inherent faults. We
                    have already seen how the madness of speculators ruined the plan when only its
                    foundations were laid. One part indeed might have been saved. The bank was not
                    necessarily bound to the company, and had its note issue been retrenched it
                    might have become a permanent institution. As Μ. Thiers points out, the edict of
                    5th March 1720, which made the shares convertible into notes, ruined the bank
                    without saving the company. The shares had risen to an unnatural height, and
                    they should have been allowed to fall to their natural level. Perhaps Law felt
                    this to be impossible. He had friends at court whose interests were involved in
                    the shares, and he had enemies eager for his overthrow. It was necessary to
                    succeed completely or not at all; so Law risked and lost everything.
                    Notwithstanding the faults of the system, it cannot be denied that its author
                    was a financial genius of the first order. He had the errors of his time; but
                    his writings show that he first propounded many truths as to the nature of
                    currency and banking then unknown to his contemporaries. The marvellous skill
                    which he displayed in adapting the theory of the system to the actual condition
                    of things in France, and in carrying out the various financial transactions
                    rendered necessary by its development, is absolutely without parallel. His
                    profound self-confidence and belief in the truth of his own theories were the
                    reasons alike of his success and his ruin. He never hesitated to employ the
                    whole force of a despotic Government for the definite ends which he saw before
                    him. He was not self-seeking. He left France poorer than he entered it, nor was
                    he perceptibly changed by his sudden transitions of fortune. Montesquieu visited
                    him at Venice after his fall, and has left a description of him not without a
                    certain touch of pathos. Law, he tells us, was still the same in character,
                    perpetually planning and scheming, and, though in poverty, revolving vast
                    projects to restore himself to power, and France to commercial prosperity.</p>
