                    Scottish “Lintquhit,” and the modern northern English “Lintwhite,”—originally a
                    somewhat generalized bird’s name, but latterly specialized for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fringilla cannabina</hi> of Linnaeus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Linota</hi><hi rend="italic">cannabina</hi> of recent ornithologists. This is a
                    common and well-known song-bird, frequenting almost the whole of Europe south of
                    lat. 64°, and in Asia extending to Turkestan. In Africa it is known as a winter
                    visitant to Egypt and Abyssinia, and is abundant at all seasons in Barbary, as
                    well as in the Canaries and Madeira. Though the fondness of this species for the
                    seeds of flax <hi rend="italic">(Linum)</hi> and hemp <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cannabis)</hi> has given it its common name in so many European

                    >Härnpling.</hi></p></note> it feeds largely, if not chiefly, in Britain on the
                    seeds of plants of the order <hi rend="italic">Composite,</hi> especially those
                    growing on heaths and commons. As these waste places have been gradually brought
                    under the plough, and improved methods of cultivation have been applied to all
                    arable land, in England and Scotland particularly, the haunts and means of
                    subsistence of the Linnet have been slowly but surely curtailed, and hence of
                    late years its numbers have undergone a very visible diminution throughout Great
                    Britain, and its diminution has also been aided by the detestable practice of
                    netting it in spring—for it is a popular cage-bird—so popular indeed as to
                    require no special description. According to its sex, or the season of the year,
                    it is known as the Red, Grey, or Browh Linnet, and by the earlier English
                    writers on birds, as well as in many localities at the present time, these names
                    have been held to distinguish at least two species; but there is now no question
                    among ornithologists on this point, though the conditions under which the bright
                    crimson-red colouring of the breast and crown of the cock’s spring and summer
                    plumage is donned and doffed may still be open to discussion. Its intensity
                    seems due, however, in some degree at least, to the weathering of the brown
                    fringes of the feathers which hide the more brilliant hue, and it is to be
                    remarked that in the Atlantic islands examples are said to retain their gay
                    tints all the year round, while throughout Europe there is scarcely a trace of
                    them visible in autumn and winter; but, beginning to appear in spring, they
                    reach their greatest brilliancy towards midsummer; and it is also to be remarked
                    that they are never assumed by examples in confinement. The Linnet begins to
                    breed in April, the nest being generally placed in a bush at no great distance
                    from the ground. It is nearly always a neat structure composed of fine twigs,
                    roots, or bents, and lined with wool or hair. The eggs, often six in number, are
                    of a very pale blue marked with reddish or purplish brown. Two broods seem to be
                    commonly brought off in the course of the season, and towards the end of summer
                    the birds—the young of course greatly preponderating in number—collect in large
                    flocks and move to the sea-coast, whence a large proportion depart for more
                    southern latitudes. Of these emigrants some return the following spring, and are
                    invariably recognizable by the more advanced state of their plumage, the effect
                    presumably of having wintered in countries enjoying a brighter and hotter
                    sun.</p>
                <p>Nearly allied to the foregoing species is the Twite, so named from its ordinary
                    call-note, or Mountain-Linnet, the <hi rend="italic">Linota fiavirostris,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">L. montium</hi> of ornithologists, which can be at once
                    distinguished by its yellow bill, longer tail, and reddish-tawny throat. This
                    bird never assumes any crimson on the crown or breast, but the male has the rump
                    at all times tinged more or less with that colour. In the breeding-season it
                    seems to affect exclusively hilly and moorland districts from Herefordshire
                    northward, in which it partly or wholly replaces the common Linnet, but is very
                    much more local in its distribution, and, except in the British Islands and some
                    parts of Scandinavia, it only appears as an irregular visitant in winter. At
                    that season it may, however, be found in large flocks in the low-lying
                    countries, and as regards England even on the sea-shore. In Asia it seems to be
                    represented by a kindred form, <hi rend="italic">L. brevirostris.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Redpolls</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.v.)</hi> form a little
                    group placed by many authorities in the genus <hi rend="italic">Linota,</hi> to
                    which they are unquestionably closely allied, but in this work they may be
                    considered later; and, as before stated <hi rend="smallcaps">(Finch,</hi> vol.
                    xi. p. 192), the Linnets seem on the other hand to be related to the birds of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Lι mosticte,</hi> the species of which, in number
                    uncertain, inhabit the northern parts of NorthWest America and of Asia. The most
                    recent list of the birds of the former country by Mr Ridgway <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Bull.</hi><hi rend="italic">U.</hi><hi rend="italic">S. Nat. Museum,</hi> No.
                    21, 1881) includes four species and one local race, of which there is need here
                    to mention, only <hi rend="italic">L. tephrocotis.</hi> It is generally of a
                    chocolate colour, tinged on some parts with pale crimson or pink, and has the
                    crown of the head silvery-grey. Another species, <hi rend="italic">L.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arctoa,</hi> was formerly said to have occurred in North America,
                    but its proper home is in the Kurile Islands or Kamchatka. This has no red in
                    its plumage. The birds of the genus <hi rend="italic">Leucosticte</hi> seem to
                    be more terrestrial in their habit than those of <hi rend="italic">Linota,</hi>
                    perhaps from their having been chiefly observed where trees are scarce; but it
                    is possible that the mutual relationship of the two groups is more apparent than
                    real Allied to <hi rend="italic">Leucosticte</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
