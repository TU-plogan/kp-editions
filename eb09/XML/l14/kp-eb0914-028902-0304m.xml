                    (1531-1591), surnamed Bras-de-Fer, one of the gallant Huguenot captains of the
                    16th century, was born near Nantes in 1531, of an honourable and ancient Breton
                    family. His first exploit was the capture of Orleans at the head of only fifteen
                    cavaliers in 1567, during the second Huguenot war. At the battles of Jarnac in
                    March 1569 and of Moncontour in the following October, La Noue was taken
                    prisoner; but he was exchanged on the latter occasion in time to resume the
                    governorship of Poitou, and inflict a signal defeat on the royalist troops
                    before Rochefort. At the siege of Fontenay (1570) his left arm was shattered by
                    a bullet; and the iron limb that replaced it won him from his soldiers the
                    sobriquet of IronArm. When peace was made in France in the same year, La Noue
                    carried his sword against the Spaniards in the Netherlands, but was taken at the
                    recapture of Mons by the Spanish in 1572. Permitted to return to France, he was
                    commissioned by Charles IX. to attempt to reconcile the inhabitants of La
                    Rochelle, the great stronghold of the Huguenots, to the king. But the Rochellois
                    were too much alarmed by the recent massacre of St Bartholomew to come to any
                    terms; and La Noue, perceiving that war was imminent, and knowing that his post
                    was on the Huguenot side, gave up his royal commission, and from 1574 till 1578
                    acted as general of La Rochelle. When peace was again concluded, La Noue once
                    more went to aid the Protestant estates of the Netherlands. Holding a high rank
                    in their army, he took several towns and captured Count Egmont in 1580; but a
                    few weeks afterwards he himself fell into the hands of the Spaniards. Thrust
                    into a loathsome prison at Limburg, La Noue, the admiration of all, of whatever
                    faith, for his gallantry, honour, and purity of character, was kept confined for
                    five years by a powerful nation, whose reluctance to set him free is one of the
                    sincerest tributes to his reputation. At length, in June 1585, La Noue was
                    exchanged for Egmont and other prisoners of consideration, while a heavy ransom
                    and a pledge not to bear arms against his Catholic majesty were also exacted
                    from him. Till 1589 La Noue took no part in public matters, but in that year he
                    joined Henry of Navarre and Henry III. against the Leaguers. He was present at
                    both sieges of Paris, and at several of the chief battles; but at the siege of
                    Lamballe in Brittany he received the wound of which he died some days later at
                    Moncontour, August 4, 1591.</p>
                <p>Bentivoglio exaggerates in saying that La Noue was as famous by his pen as by his
                    sword. What writings he has left are of value enough, but it is not by them that
                    he is remembered. He was the author of Discours Politiques et Militaires, 1587;
                    Déclaration pour prise d’armes et la défense de Sedan et Jamets, 1588;
                    Observations sur l'Histoire de Guicciardini, 2 vols., 1592; and notes on
                    Plutarch’s Lives, which have not been published. His Correspondance was
                    published in 1854. See La Vie de François, seigneur de La Noue, by Moyse
