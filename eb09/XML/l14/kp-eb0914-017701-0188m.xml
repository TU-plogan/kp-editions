                    Bruyère, a crusader, is only a satirical illustration of a method of
                    selfennoblement common in France as in some other countries. Indeed he himself
                    always signed the name Delabruyère in one word, thus avowing his <hi
                    rend="italic">roture.</hi> His progenitors, however, were of respectable
                    position, and he could trace them back at least as far as his great-grandfather,
                    who had been a strong Leaguer. La Bruyère’s own father held a municipal
                    appointment in the capital, and seems as well as his son to have been in easy
                    circumstances. The son was educated by the Oratorians, and at the university of
                    Orleans; he was called to the bar, and in 1673 bought a post in the revenue
                    department at Caen, which gave the status of noblesse and a certain income. He
                    afterwards in 1687 sold this office. His predecessor in it was a relation of
                    Bossuet, and it is thought that the transaction was the cause of La Bruyère’s
                    introduction to the great orator. Bossuet, who from the date of his own
                    preceptorship of the dauphin, was a kind of agent-general for tutorships in the
                    royal family, introduced him in 1683 or 1684 to the household of the great
                    Condé, whose grandson Henri Jules de Bourbon he was charged to educate. The rest
                    of his life was passed in the household of the prince or else at <hi

                    rend="superscript"> seems</hi> to have profited by the inclination which all the
                    Condé family had for the society of men of letters without suffering from the
                    capricious and tyrannical temper which was also one of the characteristics of
                    the house. Very little is known of the events of this part or indeed of any part
                    of his life. Although he certainly mixed freely in society at a time when more
                    gossip was committed to paper than at almost any other, the notices of him are
                    very few, though they are almost always favourable. The impression derived from
                    them is of a silent observant but somewhat awkward man, resembling in manners
                    our own Addison, whose master in literature La Bruyère undoubtedly was. Yet
                    despite the numerous enemies which his book raised up for him, most of the few
                    personal notices we have are, as has been said, favourable—notably that of St
                    Simon, an acute judge and one bitterly prejudiced against roturiers generally.
                    There is a curious passage in a letter from Boileau to Racine in which he
                    regrets that “nature has not made La Bruyère as agreeable as he would like to
                    be,” which, as he at the same time calls him a “fort honnête homme,” and says
                    that he would lack nothing were it not for the conduct of nature in this
                    respect, can only refer to the want of manner just noticed. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Caractères</hi> appeared in 1688, and at once, as Malezieu had
                    predicted, brought him “bien des lecteurs et bien des ennemis.” At the head of
                    these were Thomas Corneille, Fontenelle, and Benserade, who were pretty clearly
                    aimed at in the book, as well as innumerable other persons, men and women of
                    letters as well as of society, on whom the cap of La Bruyère’s fancy-portraits
                    was fitted by manuscript “keys” which were at once compiled by the scribblers of
                    the day. The friendship of Bossuet and still more the protection of the Condés
                    defended the author quite sufficiently, and he continued to insert fresh
                    portraits of his contemporaries in each new edition of his book. Those, however,
                    whom he had attacked were powerful in the Academy, and numerous defeats awaited
                    La Bruyère before he could make his way into that guarded hold. He was defeated
                    thrice in 1691, and on one memorable occasion he had but seven votes, five of
                    which were those of Bossuet, Boileau, Racine, Pelisson, and Bussy-Rabutin. It
                    was not till 1695 that he was elected, and even then an epigram, which,
                    considering his admitted insignificance in conversation, was not of the worst,
                    <hi rend="italic">haesit</hi><hi rend="italic">lateri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:—</hi></p>
                <p>“Quand la Bruyère se présente Pourquoi faut il crier haro?</p>
                <p>Pour faire un nombre de quarante Ne falloit il pas un zéro ?”</p>
                <p>His unpopularity was, however, chiefly confined to the subjects of his sarcastic
                    portraiture, and to the hack writers of the time, of whom he was wont to speak
                    with a disdain only surpassed by that of Pope. His description of the leading
                    newspaper of the day as “immédiatement au dessous du rien” is the best
                    remembered specimen of these unwise attacks which, both in France and England,
                    retarded the establishment of an independent profession of letters for many
                    years. La Bruyère’s discourse of admission at the Academy was, like his
                    admission itself, severely criticized, yet it is certainly one of the best of
                    its kind. With the <hi rend="italic">Caractères,</hi> the translation of
                    Theophrastus, and a few letters, it completes the list of his literary work,
                    with the exception of a curious and much-disputed posthumous treatise. La
                    Bruyère died very suddenly, and not long after his admission to the Academy. He
                    is said to have become suddenly deaf in an assembly of his friends, and, being
                    carried home to the Hotel de Condé, to have expired of apoplexy a day or two
                    afterwards. It is not surprising that, considering the recent panic about
                    poisoning, the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0189-0178"/> bitter personal enmities which he had excited,
                    and the peculiar circumstances of his death, suspicions of foul play should have
                    been entertained, but there seems to be no foundation for them. Two years after
                    his death appeared certain <hi rend="italic">Dialogues</hi><hi rend="italic">sur
                    le Quiétisme,</hi> alleged to have been found among his papers incomplete, and
                    to have been completed by the editor. As these dialogues are far inferior in
                    literary merit to La Bruyère’s other works, their genuineness has been denied.
                    But the straightforward and circumstantial account of their appearance given by
                    their editor, the Abbé Dupin, a man of acknowledged probity, the intimacy of La
                    Bruyère with Bossuet, whose views in his contest with Fénelon these dialogues
                    are designed to further, and the entire absence at so short a time after the
                    alleged author’s death of the least protest on the part of his friends and
                    representatives, seem to be decisive in their favour.</p>
                <p>Although for reasons to be given shortly it is permissible to doubt whether the
                    value of the <hi rend="italic">Caractères</hi> has not been somewhat exaggerated
                    by traditional French criticism, they deserve beyond all question a high place
                    among the great works of French literature. The plan of the book is thoroughly
                    original, if that term may be accorded to a novel and skilful combination of
                    existing elements. That the little treatise of Theophrastus may have furnished
                    the first idea of it is doubtless true, but only a very small part of the
                    Frenchman’s work is due to the Greek. With the ethical generalizations and
                    social Dutch painting of Theophrastus La Bruyère combined the peculiarities of
                    the Montaigne essay, of the <hi rend="italic">Pensées</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maximes</hi> of which Pascal and La Rochefoucauld are the masters respectively,
                    and lastly of that peculiar 17th century product, the portrait or elaborate
                    literary picture of the personal and mental characteristics of an individual.
                    The result was quite unlike anything that had been before seen, and it has not
                    been exactly reproduced since, though the essay of Addison and Steele resembles
                    it very closely, especially in the introduction of fancy portraits. In the
                    titles of his work and in its extreme desultoriness La Bruyère reminds the
                    reader of Montaigne, but he aimed too much at sententiousness to attempt even
                    the apparent continuity of the great essayist. The short paragraphs of which his
                    chapters consist are made up of maxims proper, of criticisms literary and
                    ethical, and above all of the celebrated sketches of individuals baptized with
                    names taken from the plays and romances of the time. These last are undoubtedly
                    the great feature of the work, and that which gave it its immediate if not its
                    enduring popularity. They are wonderfully piquant, extraordinarily life-like in
                    a certain sense, and must have given great pleasure or more frequently exquisite
                    pain to the originals, who were in many cases unmistakable and in most
                    recognizable by a society which held to the full Madame de Sévigné’s views of
                    the usefulness of “le prochain” as a butt for satirical observation. But there
                    is something wanting in them. The criticism of Charpentier, who received La
                    Bruyère at the Academy, and who was of the opposite faction, has usually been
                    dismissed as one-sided, but it is in fact fully justified as far as it goes. La
                    Bruyère literally “est [trop] descendu dans le particulier.” He has neither like
                    Molière embodied abstract peculiarities in a single life-like type, nor has he
                    like Shakespeare made the individual pass <hi rend="italic">sub</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">speciem</hi><hi rend="italic">aeternitatis,</hi> and serve as a
                    type while retaining his individuality. He is a photographer rather than an
                    artist in his portraiture. So too his maxims, admirably as they are expressed,
                    and exact as their truth often is, are on a lower level than those of La
                    Rochefoucauld, which, rather unwisely, they sometimes follow very closely.
                    Beside the sculpturesque precision, the Roman brevity, the profoundness of
                    ethical intuition “piercing to the accepted hells beneath,” of the great
                    Frondeur, La Bruyère has the air of a literary <hi rend="italic"
                    >petit-maître</hi> dressing up superficial observation in the finery of <hi
                    rend="italic">esprit.</hi> It is indeed only by comparison that he loses, but
                    then it is by comparison that he is usually praised. There is no doubt that his
                    abundant wit and his personal “malice” have done much to give him his rank in
                    French literature, but much must also be allowed to his purely literary merits.
                    With Racine and Massillon he is probably the very best writer of what is
                    somewhat arbitrarily styled classical French. He is hardly ever incorrect—the
                    highest merit in the eyes of a French academic critic. He is always well-bred,
                    never obscure, rarely though sometimes “precious” in the turns and niceties of
                    language in which he delights to indulge, in his avowed design of attracting
                    readers by form now that in point of matter “tout est dit.” It ought to be added
                    to his credit that he was sensible of the folly of impoverishing French by
                    ejecting old words. His chapter on “Les ouvrages de 1’esprit” contains much good
                    criticism, though it shows that, like most of his contemporaries except Fénelon,
                    he was lamentably ignorant of the literature of his own tongue.</p>
                <p>The editions of La Bruyère, both partial and complete, have been extremely
                    numerous. Les Caractères de Théophraste traduits du Grec, avec les Caractères et
                    les Moeurs de ce Siècle, appeared for the first time in 1688, being published by
                    Michallet, to whose little daughter, according to tradition, La Bruyère gave the
                    profits of the book. Two other editions, little altered, were published in the
                    same year. In the following year, and in each year until 1694, with the
                    exception of 1693, a fresh edition appeared, and, in all these five, additions,
                    omissions, and alterations were largely made. A ninth edition, not much altered,
                    was put forth in the year of the author’s death. The Academy speech appeared in
                    the eighth edition. The Quietist dialogues were published in 1698; most of the
                    letters, including those addressed to Condé, not till 1867. In the last thirty
                    or forty years numerous editions of the complete works have appeared, notably
                    those of Walckenaer (1845), Servois (1867), Asselineau (a scholarly reprint of
                    the last original edition, 1872), and finally Chassang (1876); the last is one
                    of the most generally useful, as the editor has collected almost everything of
                    value in his predecessors. The literature of “keys” to La Bruyère is extensive
                    and apocryphal. Almost everything that can be done in this direction and in that
                    of general illustration was done by the late Μ. Edouard Fournier in his learned
                    and amusing Comédie de La Bruyère. (G. SA. )</p>
