                <p>HISTORY AND DESCRIPTION. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ancient Period.</hi><hi>
                    LIBRARIES</hi>, in our modern sense of collections of printed or written
                    literature, imply an advanced and elaborate civilization. If the term be
                    extended to any considerable collection of written documents, they must be
                    nearly as old as civilization itself. The earliest use to which the invention of
                    inscribed or written signs was put was probably to record important religious
                    and political transactions. These records would naturally be preserved in sacred
                    places, and accordingly the earliest libraries of the world were probably
                    temples, and the earliest librarians priests. And indeed before the extension of
                    the arts of writing and reading the priests were the only persons who could
                    perform such work as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the compilation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">Maximi,</hi> which was the duty of
                    the pontifices in ancient Rome. The beginnings of literature proper in the shape
                    of ballads and songs may have continued to be conveyed orally only from one
                    generation to another, long after the record of important religious or civil
                    events was regularly committed to writing. The earliest collections of which we
                    know anything therefore were collections of archives. Of this character appear
                    to have been such famous collections as that of the Medians at Ecbatana or the
                    Persians at Susa. It is not until the development of arts and sciences, and the
                    growth of a considerable written literature, and even of a distinct literary
                    class, that we find collections of books which can be called libraries in our
                    modern sense. It is of libraries in the modern sense, and not, except
                    incidentally, of archives that we are to speak.</p>
                <p>The researches which have followed the discoveries of Botta and Layard have
                    thrown unexpected light not only upon the history but upon the arts, the
                    sciences, and the literatures of the ancient civilizations of Babylonia and
                    Assyria. In all these wondrous revelations no facts are more interesting than
                    those which show the existence of extensive libraries so many ages ago, and none
                    are more eloquent of the elaborateness of these forgotten civilizations.</p>
                <p>In the course of his excavations at Nineveh in 1850, Layard came upon some
                    chambers in the south-west palace, the floor of which, as well as of the
                    adjoining rooms, was covered to the depth of a foot with tablets of clay,
                    covered with cuneiform characters, in many cases so small as to require a
                    magnifying glass. These varied in size <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n529/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0529-0510"/> from an inch to a foot square. A great number of
                    them were broken, as Layard supposed by the falling in of the roof, but as the
                    late Mr George Smith thought by having fallen from the upper story, upon which
                    he believed the collection to have been placed. These tablets formed the library
                    of the great monarch Assur-bani-pal—the Sardanapalus of the Greeks—the greatest
                    patron of literature amongst the Assyrians. It is estimated that this library
                    consisted of some ten thousand distinct works and documents, some of the works
                    extending over several tablets. The tablets appear to have been methodically
                    arranged and catalogued, and the library seems to have been thrown open for the
                    general use of the king’s subjects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    this library has already been brought to England and deposited in the British
                    Museum, but it is calculated that there still remain some 20,000 fragments to be
                    gathered up. For further details as to Assyrian libraries, and the still earlier
                    Babylonian libraries from which the Assyrians drew their science and literature,

                <p>Of the libraries of ancient Egypt our knowledge is much less full and precise. It
                    seems to be ascertained that the oldest hieroglyphic writings now extant run
                    some centuries farther back than 2000 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> We possess
                    a papyrus manuscript which is assigned to the age of Amenophis I. of the 18th
                    dynasty, perhaps about 1600 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and the fabric is so
                    perfect as to point to a much earlier invention.<note anchored="true"

                    came the age of books. The temples were the centres of literary activity, and to
                    each of them were attached professional scribes who occupied a very respectable
                    position. Their function was regarded as a religious one, for the distinction
                    between religion and science had not yet been made. The sacred books of
                    Thoth—forty-two in number—constituted as it were a complete encyclopaedia of
                    religion and science. But they did not forbid speculation, or a wider
                    development of the principles contained in them. So there arose a great mass of
                    literature in the shape of exposition and commentary. To such an extent did this
                    increase that at the time of the Greek conquest of Egypt the Thoth literature is
                    said to have amounted to 36,525 books.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    were collected not only in the temples but also at the tombs of kings. The most
                    famous of these libraries dates from the 14th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> and was the so-called library of King Osymandyas, described by
                    Diodorus Siculus, who relates that it bore an inscription which he renders by
                    the Greek words ΨYXHZ¾ IATPEION, “the dispensary of the soul.” Osymandyas has
                    been identified with the great king Ramses I., and the seat of the library is
                    supposed by Wilkinson to have been the Ramesseum, the magnificent palace temple
                    near Thebes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Wilkinson,

                    librarians of Osymandyas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    >Aegypter,</hi> p. 39.</p></note> According to Eustathius there was also a great
                    collection in a temple at Memphis. A heavy blow was dealt to the old Egyptian
                    literature by the Persian invasion, and many of their books were carried away by
                    the conquerors. They were only delivered from the yoke of Persia to succumb to
                    that of Greece, and henceforward their civilization was dominated by foreign
                    influences. Of the libraries of Greece under the Ptolemies we shall therefore
                    speak a little further on.</p>
                <p>Of the libraries of ancient Greece we have very little knowledge, and such
                    knowledge as we possess comes to us for the most part from late compilers.
                    Amongst those who are known to have collected books are Pisistratus, Polycrates
                    of Samos, Euclid the Athenian, Nicocrates of</p>
                <p>Cyprus, Euripides and Aristotle (Athenaeus, i. 4). At Cnidus there is said to
                    have been a special collection of works upon medicine. Pisistratus is said to
                    have been the first of the Greeks who collected books on a large scale. Aulus
                    Gellius, indeed, tells us in language perhaps “not well suited to the 6th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,”</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Grote, <hi rend="italic">History of Greece,</hi> iv. 37,
                    following Becker.</p></note> that he was the first to establish a public
                    library. The authority of Aulus Gellius is hardly sufficient to secure credit
                    for the story that this library was carried away into Persia by Xerxes and
                    subsequently restored to the Athenians by Seleucus Nicator. Plato is known to
                    have been a collector; and Xenophon tells us of the library of Euthydemus. The
                    library of Aristotle was bequeathed by him to his disciple Theophrastus, and by
                    Theophrastus to Neleus, who carried it to Scepsis, where it is said to have been
                    concealed underground to avoid the literary cupidity of the kings of Pergamus.
                    Its subsequent fate has given rise to much controversy, but, according to Strabo
                    (xiii. pp. 608, 609), it was sold to Apellicon of Teos, who carried it to
                    Athens, where after Apellicon’s death it fell a prey to the conqueror Sulla, and
                    was transported by him to Rome. The story told by Athenaeus (i. 4) is that the
                    library of Nelens was purchased by Ptolemy Philadelphus. The names of a few
                    other libraries in Greece are barely known to us from inscriptions; of their
                    character and contents we know nothing. If indeed we are to trust Strabo
                    entirely, we must believe that Aristotle was the first person who collected a
                    library, and that he communicated the taste for collecting to the sovereigns of
                    Egypt. It is at all events certain that the libraries of Alexandria were the
                    most important as they were the most celebrated of the ancient world. Under the
                    enlightened rule of the Ptolemies a society of scholars and men of science was
                    attracted to their capital. It seems pretty certain that Ptolemy Soter had
                    already begun to collect books, but it was in the reign of Ptolemy Philadelphus
                    that the libraries were properly organized and established in separate
                    buildings. Ptolemy Philadelphus sent into every part of Greece and Asia to
                    secure the most valuable works, and no exertions or expense were spared in
                    enriching the collections. Ptolemy Euergetes, his successor, is said to have
                    caused all books brought into Egypt by foreigners to be seized for the benefit
                    of the library, while the owners had to be content with receiving copies of them
                    in exchange. Nor did the Alexandrian scholars exhibit the usual Hellenic
                    exclusiveness, and many of the treasures of Egyptian and even of Hebrew
                    literature were by their means translated into Greek. There were two libraries
                    at Alexandria; the larger, in the Bruchi urn quarter, was in connexion with the
                    Museum, a sort of academy, while the smaller was placed in the Serapeum. The
                    number of volumes in these libraries was very large, although it is difficult to
                    attain any certainty as to the real numbers amongst the widely varying accounts.
                    According to a scholium of Tzetzes, who appears to draw his information from the
                    authority of Callimachus and Eratosthenes, who had been librarians at
                    Alexandria, there were 42,800 volumes or rolls in the Serapeum and 490,000 in
                    the Bruchium.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ritschi,

                    seems to refer to the librarianship of Callimachus himself under Ptolemy
                    Euergetes. In any case the figures agree tolerably well with those given by
                    Aulus Gellius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">N.</hi><hi rend="italic">A.,</hi> vi. 17.</p></note> (700,000) and

                    observed that, as the ancient roll or volume usually contained a much smaller
                    quantity of matter than a modern book—so that, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the
                    history of Herodotus might form nine “books” or volumes, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Iliad</hi> of Homer twenty-four—these numbers must be
                    discounted<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n530/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0530-0511"/> for the purposes of comparison with modern
                    collections.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This view
                    as to the smallness of the ancient book before Callimachus has been pushed
                    perhaps a little too far. See Theodor Birt’s ingenious suggestions in <hi
                    rend="italic">Bas</hi><hi rend="italic">antike Buchwesen,</hi> Berlin, 1882, p.
                    489 <hi rend="italic">sg.,</hi> &amp;c. Birt, indeed, agrees that these large
                    numbers must be discounted, but only on the ground of the very considerable
                    number of duplicates in the Alexandrian libraries.</p></note> The series of the
                    first five librarians at Alexandria appears to be pretty well established as
                    follows :—Zenodotus, Callimachus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, and Aristophanes;
                    and their activity covers a period of about a century.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ritschl, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit.,</hi>
                    19.</p></note> The first experiments in bibliography appear to have been made in
                    producing catalogues of the Alexandrian libraries. Amongst other lists, two
                    catalogues were prepared by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus, one of the tragedies,
                    the other of the comedies contained in the collections. The ∏Aακ∈ς of
                    Callimachus formed a catalogue of all the principal books arranged in 120
                    classes. When Caesar set fire to the fleet in the harbour of Alexandria, the
                    flames accidentally extended to the larger library of the Bruchium, and it was
                    destroyed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Parthey <hi
                    rend="italic">(Alexandrinisches</hi><hi rend="italic">Museum)</hi> assigns
                    topographical reasons for doubting this story.</p></note> Antony endeavoured to
                    repair the loss by presenting to Cleopatra the library from Pergamus. This was
                    very probably placed in the Bruchium, as this continued to be the literary
                    quarter of Alexandria until the time of Aurelian. Thenceforward the Serapeum
                    became the principal library. The usual statement that from the date of the
                    restoration of the Bruchium under Cleopatra the libraries continued in a
                    flourishing condition until they were destroyed after the conquest of Alexandria
                    by the Saracens in 640 <hi rend="smallcaps">λ.d.</hi> can hardly be supported.
                    It is very possible that one of the libraries perished when the Bruchium quarter
                    was destroyed by Aurelian, 273 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> In 389 or 391 an
                    edict of Theodosius ordered the destruction of the Serapeum, and its books were
                    pillaged by the Christians. When we take into account the disordered condition
                    of the times, and the neglect into which literature and science had fallen,
                    there can be little difficulty in believing that there were but few books left
                    to be destroyed by the soldiers of 'Amr. The familiar anecdote of the caliph’s
                    message to his general (vol. i. p. 494) rests mainly upon the evidence of
                    Abulfaragius, so that we may be tempted to agree with Gibbon that the report of
                    a stranger who wrote at the end of six hundred years is overbalanced by the
                    silence of earlier and native annalists. It is, however, so far from easy to
                    settle the question that a cloud of names could easily be cited upon either
                    side, while some of the most careful inquirers confess the difficulty of a
                    decision.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some of the

                <p>The magnificence and renown of the libraries of the Ptolemies excited the rivalry
                    of the kings of Pergamus, who vied with the Egyptian rulers in their
                    encouragement of literature. Despite the obstacles presented by the embargo
                    placed by the Ptolemies upon the export of papyrus, the library of the Attali
                    attained considerable importance, and, as we have seen, when it was transported
                    to Egypt numbered 200,000 volumes. We learn from a notice in Suidas that in 221
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Antiochus the Great summoned the poet and
                    grammarian Euphorion of Chalcis to be his librarian.</p>
                <p>The early Romans were far too warlike and practical a people to devote much
                    attention to literature, and it is not until the last century of the republic
                    that we hear of libraries in Rome. The collections of Carthage, which fell into
                    their hands when Scipio sacked that city (146 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi>
                    had no attractions for them; and with the exception of the writings of Mago upon
                    agriculture, which the senate reserved for translation into Latin, they bestowed
                    all the books upon the kinglets of Africa.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Romans that the first considerable collections of which we hear in Rome were
                    brought there as the spoils of war. The first of these was that brought by
                    Aemilius Paulus from Macedonia after the conquest of Perseus (167 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The library of the conquered monarch was all that
                    he reserved from the prizes of victory for himself and his sons, who were fond
                    of letters. Next came the library of Apellicon the Teian, brought from Athens by
                    Sulla (86 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> This passed at his death into the
                    hands of his son, but of its later history nothing is known. The rich stores of
                    literature brought home by Lucullus from his eastern conquests (about 67 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> were freely thrown open to his friends and to men of
                    letters. Accordingly his library and the neighbouring walks were much resorted
                    to, especially by Greeks. It was now becoming fashionable for rich men to
                    furnish their libraries well, and the fashion prevailed until it became the
                    subject of Seneca’s scorn and Lucian’s wit. The zeal of Cicero and Atticus in
                    adding to their collections is well known to every reader of the classics.
                    Tyrannion is said to have had 30,000 volumes of his own; and that M. Terentius
                    Varro had large collections we may infer from Cicero’s writing to him: “Si
                    hortum in bibliotheca habes, nihil deerit.” Not to prolong the list of private
                    collectors, Serenus Sammonicus is said to have left to his pupil the younger
                    Gordian no less than 62,000 volumes. Amongst the numerous projects entertained
                    by Caesar was that of presenting Rome with public libraries, though it is
                    doubtful whether any steps were actually taken towards its execution. The task
                    of collecting and arranging the books was entrusted to Varro. This commission,
                    as well as his own fondness for books, may have led Varro to write the book upon
                    libraries of which a few words only have come down to us, preserved by a
                    grammarian. Varro also appears to have been the first to ornament a library with
                    the statues and busts of learned men, though the idea is sometimes attributed to
                    Asinius Pollio. The greater honour of being the first actually to dedicate a
                    library to the public is said by Pliny and Ovid to have fallen to Pollio, who
                    erected a library in the Atrium Libertatis on Mount Aventine, defraying the cost
                    from the spoils of his Illyrian campaign. The library of Pollio was followed by
                    the public libraries established by Augustus. That emperor, who did so much for
                    the embellishment of the city, erected two libraries, the Octavian and the
                    Palatine. The former was founded (33 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> in honour
                    of his sister, and was placed in the Porticus Octaviae, the lower part of which
                    served as a promenade, while the upper part contained the library. The charge of
                    the books was committed to C. Melissus. The other library formed by Augustus was
                    attached to the temple of Apollo on the Palatine hill, and appears from
                    inscriptions to have consisted of two departments, a Greek and a Latin one,
                    which seem to have been separately administered. The charge of the Palatine
                    collections was given to Pompeius Macer, who was succeeded by Julius Hyginus,
                    the grammarian and friend of Ovid. The Octavian library perished in the fire
                    which raged at Rome for three days in the reign of Titus. The Palatine was, at
                    all events in great part, destroyed by fire in the reign of Commodus. The story
                    that its collections were destroyed by order of Pope Gregory the Great in the
                    6th century is now generally rejected. The successors of Augustus, though they
                    did not equal him in their patronage of learning, maintained the tradition of
                    forming libraries. Tiberius, his immediate successor, established one in his
                    splendid house on the Palatine, to which Gellius refers as the “Tiberian
                    library,” and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0531-0512"/> Suetonius relates that he caused the writings and
                    images of his favourite Greek poets to be placed in the public libraries.
                    Vespasian established a library in the Temple of Peace erected after the burning
                    of the city under Nero. Domitian restored the libraries which had been destroyed
                    in the same conflagration, procuring books from every quarter, and even sending
                    to Alexandria to have copies made. He is also said to have founded the
                    Capitoline library, though others give the credit to Hadrian. The most famous
                    and important of the imperial libraries, however, was that created by Ulpius
                    Trajanus, known as the Ulpian library, which was first established in the Forum
                    of Trajan, but was afterwards removed to the baths of Diocletian. In this
                    library were deposited by Trajan the “libri lintei” and “libri elephantini,”
                    upon which the senatus consulta and other transactions relating to the emperors
                    were written. The library of Domitian, which had been destroyed by fire in the
                    reign of Commodus, was restored by Gordian, who added to it the books bequeathed
                    to him by Serenus Sammonicus. Altogether in the 4th century there are said to
                    have been twenty-eight public libraries in Rome.</p>
                <p>Nor were public libraries confined to Rome. Besides a library at Tibur, which is
                    twice mentioned by Gellius, and was probably founded by Hadrian, the younger
                    Pliny mentions that he had himself dedicated a library to his fellow-townsmen at
                    Comum; and an inscription discovered at Milan proves that he also contributed a
                    large sum to the support of a library there. Hadrian established a library at
                    Athens; and Strabo mentions the library of Smyrna. Gellius also mentions a
                    library at Patrae. ' From one of his references (xix. 5) to the Tiburtine
                    library we may infer that it was not unusual for books to be lent out from these
                    libraries. Considerable care was bestowed by the Romans upon the placing of
                    their libraries. The room or building generally had an eastern aspect. The books
                    or rolls were arranged upon the shelves of presses running round the walls, with
                    additional presses placed in the middle of the room. Thus the library discovered
                    at Herculaneum contained 1756 MSS. placed on shelves running round the room to a
                    height of some 6 feet, with a detached central press. These presses in large
                    libraries were numbered. They were often made of precious woods and richly
                    ornamented, while the room was adorned with portraits and statues.</p>
                <p>As the number of libraries in Rome increased, the librarian, who was generally a
                    slave or freedman, became a recognized public functionary. The names of several
                    librarians are preserved to us in inscriptions, including that of C. Hymenaeus,
                    who appears to have fulfilled the double function of physician and librarian to
                    Augustus. The general superintendence of the public libraries was committed to a
                    special official. Thus from Nero to Trajan Dionysius, an Alexandrian
                    rhetorician, discharged this function. Under Hadrian it was entrusted to his
                    former tutor C. Julius Vestinus, who afterwards became administrator of the
                    Museum at Alexandria.</p>
                <p>When the seat of empire was removed by Constantine to his new capital upon the
                    Bosporus, the emperor established a collection there, in which Christian
                    literature was probably admitted for the first time into an imperial library.
                    Diligent search was made after the Christian books which bad been doomed to
                    destruction by Diocletian. Even at the death of Constantine, however, the number
                    of books which had been brought together amounted only to 6900. The smallness of
                    the number, it has been suggested, seems to show that Constantine’s library was
                    mainly intended as a repository of Christian literature. However this may be,
                    the collection was greatly enlarged by some of Constantine’s successors,
                    especially by Julian and Theodosius, at whose death it is said to have increased
                    to 100,000 volumes. Julian, himself a close student and voluminous writer,
                    though he did his best to discourage learning among the Christians, and to
                    destroy their libraries, not only augmented the library at Constantinople, but
                    founded others, including one at Nisibis, which was soon afterwards destroyed by
                    fire. From the Theodosian code we learn that in the time of that emperor a staff
                    of seven copyists was attached to the library at Constantinople under the
                    direction of the librarian. The library was burnt under the emperor Zeno in 477,
                    but was again restored.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, as Christianity made its way and a distinctively Christian literature
                    grew up, the institution of libraries became part of the organization of the
                    church. When the church of Jerusalem was founded in the 3d century a library was
                    added to it, and it became the rule to attach to every church a collection of
                    the books necessary for the inculcation of Christian doctrine. The largest of
                    these libraries, that founded by Pamphilus at Caesarea, and said to have been
                    increased by Eusebius, the his·' torian of the church, to 30,000 volumes, is
                    frequently mentioned by St Jerome. St Augustine bequeathed his collection to the
                    library of the church at Hippo, which was fortunate enough to escape destruction
                    at the hands of the Vandals.</p>
                <p>The removal of the capital to Byzantium was in its result a serious blow to
                    literature. Henceforward the science and learning of the East and West were
                    divorced. The libraries of Rome ceased to collect the writings of the Greeks,
                    while the Greek libraries had never cared much to collect Latin literature. The
                    influence of the church became increasingly hostile to the study of pagan
                    letters. The repeated irruptions of the barbarians soon swept the old learning
                    and libraries alike from the soil of Italy. With the close of the Western empire
                    in 476 the ancient history of libraries may be said to cease.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mediaeval</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Period.</hi></p>
                <p>During the first few centuries after the fall of the Western empire, literary
                    activity at Constantinople had fallen to its lowest ebb. In the West, amidst the
                    general neglect of learning and literature, the collecting of books, though not
                    wholly forgotten, was cared for by few. Sidonius Apollinaris tells us of the
                    libraries of several private collectors in Gaul. Publius Consentius possessed a
                    library at his villa near Narbonne which was due to the labour of three
                    generations. The most notable of these appears to have been the prefect
                    Tonantius Ferreolus, who had formed in his villa of Prusiana, near Nîmes, a
                    collection which his friend playfully compares to that of Alexandria. The Goths,
                    who had been introduced to the Scriptures in their own language by Ulfilas in
                    the 4th century, began to pay some attention to Latin literature. Cassiodorus,
                    the favourite minister of Theodoric, was a collector as well as an author, and
                    on giving up the cares of government retired to a monastery which he founded in
                    Calabria, where he employed his monks in the transcription of books.</p>
                <p>Henceforward the charge of books as well as of education fell more and more
                    exclusively into the hands of the church. While the old schools of the
                    rhetoricians died out new monasteries arose everywhere. Knowledge was no longer
                    pursued for its own sake, but became subsidiary to religious and theological
                    teaching. The proscription of the old classical literature, wflιich is
                    symbolized in the fable of the destruction of the Palatine library by Gregory
                    the Great, was only too effectual. The Gregorian tradition of opposition to
                    pagan learning long continued to dominate the literary pursuits of the monastic
                    orders and the labours of the scriptorium.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n532/mode/1up"

                <p>During the 6th and 7th centuries the learning which had been driven from the
                    Continent took refuge in the British Islands, where it was removed from the
                    political disturbances of the mainland. In the Irish monasteries during this
                    period there appear to have been many books, and the Venerable Bede was superior
                    to any scholar of his age. Theodore of Tarsus brought a considerable number of
                    books to Canterbury from Rome in the 7th century, including several Greek
                    authors. The library of York, which was founded by Archbishop Egbert, was almost
                    more famous than that of Canterbury. The verses are well known in which Alcuin
                    describes the extensive library under his charge, and the long list of authors
                    whom he enumerates is superior to that of any other library possessed by either
                    England or France in the 12th century, when it was unhappily burnt. The inroads
                    of the Northmen in the 9th and 10th centuries had been fatal to the monastic
                    libraries on both sides of the channel. It was from York that Alcuin came to
                    Charlemagne to superintend the school attached to his palace; and it was
                    doubtless inspired by Alcuin that Charles issued the memorable document which
                    enjoined that in the bishoprics and monasteries within his realm care should be
                    taken that there shall be not only a regular manner of life, but also the study
                    of letters. When Alcuin finally retired from the court to the abbacy of Tours,
                    there to carry out his own theory of monastic discipline and instruction, he
                    wrote to Charles for leave to send to York for copies of the books of which they
                    had so much need at Tours. While Alcuin thus increased the library at Tours,
                    Charlemagne enlarged that at Fulda, which had been founded in 774, and which all
                    through the Middle Ages stood in great respect. Lupus Servatus, a pupil of
                    Hrabanus Maurus at Fulda, and afterwards abbot of Ferrières, was a devoted
                    student of the classics and a great collector of books. His correspondence
                    illustrates the difficulties which then attended the study of literature through
                    the paucity and dearness of books, the declining care for learning, and the
                    increasing troubles of the time. Nor were private collections of books
                    altogether wanting during the period in which Charlemagne and his successors
                    laboured to restore the lost traditions of liberal education and literature.
                    Pepin le Bref had indeed met with scanty response to the request for books which
                    he addressed to the pontiff Paul I. Charlemagne, however, collected a
                    considerable number of choice books for his private use in two places. Although
                    these collections were dispersed at his death, his son Louis formed a library
                    which continued to exist under Charles the Bald. About the same time Everard,
                    count of Friuli, formed a considerable collection which he bequeathed to a
                    monastery. But the greatest private collector of the Middle Ages was doubtless
                    Gerbert, Pope Sylvester II., who showed the utmost zeal and spent large sums in
                    collecting books, not only in Rome and Italy, but from Germany, Belgium, and
                    even from Spain.</p>
                <p>The hopes of a revival of secular literature fell with the decline of the schools
                    established by Charles and his successors. The knowledge of letters remained the
                    prerogative of the church, and for the next four or five centuries the
                    collecting and multiplication of books were almost entirely confined to the
                    monasteries. Several of the greater orders made these an express duty; this was
                    especially the case with the Benedictines. It was the first • care of St
                    Benedict, we are told, that in each newly founded monastery there should be a
                    library, “et velut curia quaedam illustrium auctorum.” Monte Cassino became the
                    starting point of a long line of institutions which were destined to be the
                    centres of religion and of literature. It must indeed be remembered that
                    literature in the sense of Sb Benedict meant Biblical and theological works, the
                    lives of the saints and martyrs, and the lives and writings of the fathers. Of
                    the reformed Benedictine orders the Carthusians and the Cistercians were those
                    most devoted to literary pursuits. The abbeys of Fleury, of Melk, and of St Gall
                    were remarkable for the splendour of their libraries. In a later age the labours
                    of the congregation of St Maur form one of the most striking chapters in the
                    history of learning. The Augustinians and the Dominicans rank next to the
                    Benedictines in their care for literature. The libraries of St Genevieve and St
                    Victor, belonging to the former, were amongst the largest of the monastic
                    collections. Although their poverty might seem to put them at a disadvantage as
                    collectors, the mendicant orders cultivated literature with much assiduity, and
                    were closely connected with the intellectual movement to which the universities
                    owed their rise. In England Richard of Bury praises them for their extraordinary
                    diligence in collecting books. Sir Richard Whittington built a large library for
                    the Grey Friars in London, and they possessed considerable libraries at
                    Oxford.</p>
                <p>It would be impossible to attempt here an account of all the libraries
                    established by the monastic orders. We must be content to enumerate a few of the
                    most eminent.</p>
                <p>In Italy Monte Cassino is a striking example of the dangers and vicissitudes to
                    which monastic collections were exposed. Ruined by the Lombards in the 6th
                    century, the monastery was rebuilt and a library established to fall a prey to
                    Saracens and to fire in the 9th. The collection then reformed survived many
                    other chances and changes, and still exists. It affords a conspicuous example of
                    monastic industry in the transcription not only of theological but also of
                    classical works. The library of Bobbio was famous for its palimpsests. The
                    collection, of which a catalogue of the 10th century is given by Muratori,<note

                    transferred to the Ambrosian library at Milan. Of the library of Pomposia, near
                    Ravenna, Montfaucon has printed a catalogue dating from the 11 th century.<note

                <p>Of the monastic libraries of France the principal were those of Fleury, of Cluny,
                    of St Riquier, and of Corbie. At Fleury Abbot Macharius in 1146 imposed a
                    contribution for library purposes upon the officers of the community and its
                    dependencies, an example which was. followed elsewhere. After many vicissitudes,
                    its MSS., numbering 238, were deposited in 1793 in the town library of Orleans.
                    The library of St Riquier in the time of Louis the Pious contained 256 MSS.,
                    with over 500 works.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    catalogues dating from the 12th and from the 17th centuries. Corbie was famous
                    for the industry of its transcribers, and appears to have stood in active
                    literary intercourse with other monasteries. In 1638, 400 of its choicest
                    manuscripts were removed to St Germain-des-Prés. The remainder were removed
                    after 1794, partly to the national library at Paris, partly to the town library
                    of Amiens.</p>
                <p>The chief monastic libraries of Germany were at Fulda, Corvey, Reichenau, and
                    Sponheim. The library at Fulda owed much to Charlemagne and to its abbot
                    Hrabanus Maurus. Under Abbot Sturmius four hundred monks were hired as copyists.
                    In 1561 the collection numbered 774 volumes. The library of Corvey on the Weser,
                    after being despoiled of some of its treasures in the Reformation age, was
                    presented to the university of Marburg in 1811. It then contained 109 volumes,
                    with 400 or 500 titles. The library of Reichenau, of which several catalogues
                    are extant, fell a prey to fire and neglect, and its ruin was consummated by the
                    Thirty Years’ War. The library <pb break="no"

                    Tritheim, who was abbot at the close of the 15th century. He found it reduced to
                    10 volumes, and left it with upwards of 2000 at his retirement. The library at
                    St Gall, formed as early as 816 by Gozbert, its second abbot, still exists.</p>
                <p>In England the principal collections were those of Canterbury, York, Wearmouth,
                    Whitby, Glastonbury, Croyland, Peterborough, and Durham. Of the library of the
                    monastery of Christ Church, Canterbury, originally founded by Augustine and
                    Theodore, and restored by Lanfranc and Anselm, a catalogue has been preserved
                    dating from the 13th or 14th century, and containing 698 volumes, with about
                    3000 works. Bennet Biscop, the first abbot of Wearmouth, made five journeys to
                    Rome, and on each occasion returned with a store of books for the library. It
                    was destroyed by the Danes about 867. Of the library at Whitby there is a
                    catalogue dating from the 12th century. The catalogue of Glastonbury has also
                    been printed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By Hearne

                    perished by fire in 1091 it contained about 700 volumes. The library at
                    Peterborough was also rich; from a catalogue of about the end of the 14th
                    century it had 344 volumes, with nearly 1700 titles. The catalogues of the
                    library at the monastery of Durham have been printed by the Surtees Society, and
                    form an interesting series.</p>

                    of the limited character of the monkish collections, whether we look at the
                    number of their volumes or at the nature of their contents. We must remember
                    that the beliefs and discipline imposed upon the monk hardly allowed of his
                    caring for literature for its own sake; we must also remember that the
                    transcription of manuscripts so industriously pursued in the monasteries was a
                    mechanical employment. The scriptoria were manufactories of books and not
                    centres of learning. Indeed the very pains bestowed upon carefulness and
                    neatness of transcription, and especially upon the illustrating and ornamenting
                    of the more beautiful manuscripts, were little calculated to divert the
                    attention of the monks from the vehicle to the thought which it expressed. The
                    pride taken by so many communities in the richness and splendour of their
                    libraries was often doubtless the pride of the collector and not of the scholar.
                    That in spite of the labours of so many transcribers the costliness and scarcity
                    of books remained so great may have been partly, but cannot have been wholly,
                    due to the scarcity of writing materials. It may be suspected that indolence and
                    carelessness were the rule in most monasteries, and that but few of the monks
                    keenly realized the whole force of the sentiment expressed by one of their
                    number in the 12th century—“Claustrum sine armario quasi castrum sine
                    armamentario.” Nevertheless it must be admitted that to the labours of the
                    monkish transcribers we are indebted for the preservation of Latin
                    literature.</p>
                <p>The first conquests of the Arabians, as we have already seen, threatened
                    hostility to literature. But, as soon as their conquests were secured, the
                    caliphs became the patrons of learning and science. Greek manuscripts were
                    eagerly sought for and translated into Arabic, and colleges and libraries
                    everywhere arose. Baghdad in the East and Cordova in the West became the seats
                    of a rich development of letters and science during the age when the
                    civilization of Europe was most obscured. Cairo and Tripoli were also
                    distinguished for their libraries. The royal library of the Fatimites in Africa
                    is said to have numbered 100,000 manuscripts, while that collected by the
                    Omayyads of Spain is reported to have contained six times as many. It is said
                    that there were no less than seventy libraries opened in the cities of
                    Andalusia. Whether these figures be exaggerated or not—and they are much below
                    those given by some Arabian writers, which are undoubtedly so —it is certain
                    that the libraries of the Arabians and the Moors of Spain offer a very
                    remarkable contrast to those of the Christian nations during the same
                    period.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among the Arabs,
                    however, as among the Christians, theological bigotry did not always approve of

                    Almanzor to his reputation for orthodoxy, 978 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The literary and scientific activity of the Arabians appears to have been the
                    cause of a revival of letters amongst the Greeks of the Byzantine empire in the
                    9th century. Under Leo the Philosopher and Constantine Porphyrogenitus the
                    libraries of Constantinople awoke into renewed life. The compilations of such
                    writers as Stobaeus, Photius, and Suidas, as well as the labours of innumerable
                    critics and commentators, bear witness to the activity, if not to the lofty
                    character of the pursuits, of the Byzantine scholars. The labours of
                    transcription were industriously pursued in the libraries and in the monasteries
                    of Mount Athos and the Aegean, and it was from these quarters that the restorers
                    of learning brought into Italy so many Greek manuscripts. In this way many of
                    the treasures of ancient literature had been already conveyed to the West before
                    the fate which overtook the libraries of Constantinople on the fall of the city
                    in 1453.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile in the West, with the reviving interest in literature which already
                    marks the 14th century, we find arising outside the monasteries a taste for
                    collecting books. St Louis of France and his successors had formed small
                    collections, none of which survived its possessor. It was reserved for Charles
                    V. to form a considerable library which he intended to be permanent. In 1373 he
                    had amassed 910 volumes, and had a catalogue of them prepared, from which we see
                    that it included a good deal of the new literature. In our own country Guy, earl
                    of Warwick, formed a curious collection of French romances, which he bequeathed
                    to Bordesley Abbey on his death in 1315. Richard d’Aungervyle of Bury, the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Philobiblon,</hi> amassed a noble collection of
                    books, and had special opportunities of doing so as Edward III.’s chancellor and
                    ambassador. He founded Durham College at Oxford, and equipped it with a library
                    a hundred years before Humphrey, duke of Gloucester, made his benefaction of
                    books to the university. The taste for secular literature, and the enthusiasm
                    for the ancient classics, gave a fresh direction to the researches of
                    collectors. A disposition to encourage literature began to show itself amongst
                    the great. This was most notable amongst the Italian princes. Cosimo de’ Medici
                    formed a library at Venice while living there in exile in 1433, and on his
                    return to Florence laid the foundation of the great Medicean library. The honour
                    of establishing the first modern public library in Italy had been already
                    secured by Niccolo Niccoli, who left his library of over 800 volumes for the use
                    of the public on his death in 1436. Frederick, duke of Urbino, collected all the
                    writings in Greek and Latin which he could procure, and we have an interesting
                    account of his collection written by his first librarian, Vespasiano. The ardour
                    for classical studies led to those active researches for the Latin writers who
                    were buried in the monastic libraries which are especially identified with the
                    name of Poggio. For some time before the fall of that capital, the perilous
                    state <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n534/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0534-0515"/> of the Eastern empire had driven many Greek
                    scholars from Constantinople into western Europe, where they had directed the
                    studies and formed the taste of the zealous students of the Greek language and
                    literature. The enthusiasm of the Italian princes extended itself beyond the
                    Alps. Matthias Corvinus, king of Hungary, amassed a collection of splendidly
                    executed and magnificently bound manuscripts, which at his death are said to
                    have reached the almost incredible number of 50,000 volumes. The library was not
                    destined long to survive its founder. There is reason to believe that it had
                    been very seriously despoiled even before it perished at the hands of the Turks
                    on the fall of Buda in 1527. A few of its treasures are still preserved in some
                    of the libraries of Europe. While these munificent patrons of learning were thus
                    taking pains to recover and multiply the treasures of ancient literature by the
                    patient labour of transcribers and calligraphers, an art was being elaborated
                    which was destined to revolutionize the whole condition of literature and
                    libraries. With the invention of printing, so happily coinciding with the
                    revival of true learning and sound science, the modern history of libraries may
                    be said to begin.</p>

                <p>The British Museum ranks in importance before all the great libraries of the
                    world, with the single exception of the Bibliothèque Nationale at Parks, and far
                    excels the latter institution in the systematic arrangement and accessibility of
                    its contents. Recent changes have somewhat limited its former universality of
                    character, but it still remains the grand national repository of literature and
                    archaeology. The library consists of over 1,550,000 printed volumes and 50,000
                    manuscripts. This extraordinary opulence is principally due to the enlightened
                    energy of the late Sir Antonio Panizzi. The number of volumes in the printed
                    book department, when he took the keepership in 1837, was only 240,000; and
                    during the nineteen years he held that office about 400,000 were added, mostly
                    by purchase, under his advice and direction. It was Panizzi likewise who first
                    seriously set to work to see that the national library reaped all the benefits
                    bestowed upon it by the Copyright Act.</p>
                <p>The foundation of the British Museum dates from 1753, when effect was given to
                    the bequest (in exchange for £20,000 to be paid to his executors) by Sir Hans
                    Sloane, of his books, manuscripts, curiosities, &lt;fcc., to be held by trustees
                    for the use of the nation. A bill was passed through parliament for the purchase
                    of the Sloane collections and of the Harleian MSS., costing £10,000. To these,
                    with the Cottonian MSS., acquired by the country in 1700, was added by George
                    II., in 1757, the royal library of the former kings of England, coupled with the
                    privilege, which that library had for many years enjoyed, of obtaining a copy of
                    every publication entered at Stationers’ Hall. This addition was of the highest
                    importance, as it enriched the museum with the old collections of Archbishop
                    Cranmer, Henry prince of Wales, and other patrons of literature, while the
                    transfer of the privilege with regard to the acquisition of new books, a right
                    which has been maintained by successive Copyright Acts, secured a large and
                    continuous augmentation, the yearly average of which has now reached 8000 or
                    9000 volumes. A lottery having been authorized to defray the expenses of
                    purchases, as well as for providing suitable accommodation, the museum and
                    library were established in Montague House, and opened to the public 15th
                    January 1759. In 1763 George III. presented the well-known Thomason collection
                    (in 2220 volumes) of books and pamphlets issued in England between 1640 and
                    1662, embracing all the controversial literature which appeared during that
                    period. The Rev. C. M. Cracherode, one of the trustees, bequeathed his
                    collection of choice books in 1799; and in 1820 Sir Joseph Banks left to the
                    nation his important library of 16,000 volumes. Many other libraries have since
                    then been incorporated in the museum, the most valuable being George III.’s
                    royal collection (15,000 volumes of tracts, and 65,259 volumes of printed books,
                    including many of the utmost rarity, which had cost the king about £130,000),
                    which was presented (for a pecuniary consideration, it has been said) by George
                    IV. in 1823, and that of the Right Honourable Thomas Grenville (20,240 volumes
                    of rare books, all in fine condition and binding), which was acquired under
                    bequest in 1846. The Cracherode, Banksian, King’s, and Grenville libraries are
                    still preserved as separate collections. Other libraries of minor note have also
                    been absorbed in a similar way, while, at least since the time of Panizzi, no
                    opportunity has been neglected of making useful purchases at all the British and
                    Continental book auctions.</p>
                <p>The collection of English books is far from approaching completeness, but, apart
                    from the’ enormous number of volumes, the library contains an extraordinary
                    quantity of rarities. Few libraries in the United States equal either in number
                    or value the American books in the museum. The collection of Slavonic
                    literature, due to the initiative of the late Mr Watts, is a remarkable feature;
                    after that of the St Petersburg Imperial Library it is believed to be the
                    largest in existence. Indeed, in cosmopolitan interest the museum is without a
                    rival in the world, possessing as it does the best Hungarian collection out of
                    that country,, the best Dutch library out of Holland, and in short the best
                    library in any European language out of the territory in which the language is
                    vernacular. The Hebrew books number over 12,000, the Chinese nearly 27,000, and
                    the printed books in other Oriental languages about 13,000 volumes. Periodical
                    literature has not been forgotten, and the series of newspapers is of great
                    extent and interest. Great pains are taken by the authorities to obtain the
                    copies of the newspapers published in the United Kingdom to which they are
                    entitled by the provisions of the Copyright Act, and upwards of 1900 are
                    annually collected, filed, and bound. Under the English Copyright Act there were
                    received, in 1881, not counting single pieces, such as broadsides, songs,
                    &lt;fcc., 8857 volumesand pamphlets, and 21,792 parts of volumes, and through
                    the international copyright treaties 941 volumes and 433 parts.</p>
                <p>The department of MSS. is at least equal in importance to that of the printed
                    books. The collection of MSS. in European languages ranges from the 2d century
                    before Christ down to our own times, and includes the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Alexandrian</hi> MS. (&lt;∕.v.). The old historical chronicles of England, the
                    charters of the Anglo-Saxon kings, and the celebrated series of Arthurian
                    romances are well represented; and care has been taken to acquire on every
                    available opportunity the unprinted works of English writers. The famous
                    collections of MSS. made by Sir Robert Cotton, and Harley earl of Oxford, have
                    already been mentioned, and from these and other sources the museum has become
                    rich in early Anglo-Saxon and Latin codices, some of them exhibiting marvels of
                    skill in calligraphy and ornamentation, such as the charters of King Edgar and
                    Henry Γ. to Hyde Abbey, which are written in gold letters, others interesting
                    for different reasons, such as the book of Durham, in Latin and Anglo-Saxon<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n535/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0535-0516"/>, reputed to have been Bede’s own copy. The Burney
                    collection of classical MSS. furnished important additions, so that from this
                    source and from the collection of Arundel MSS. (transferred from the Royal
                    Society in 1831), the museum can boast.of an early copy of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> and one of the earliest known codices of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey.</hi> There is likewise an extensive series of ancient Irish texts,
                    with many modern transcripts, the Bridgewater MSS. on French history, and Lord
                    Guilford’s similar collection to illustrate the history of Italy. Special
                    reference may be made to the celebrated Bedford Missal, illuminated for the duke
                    of Bedford, regent of France, and to Henry VI.’s copy of Hardy ng’s chronicle.
                    The Oriental collection is also extremely rich and ample, including the library
                    formed by Mr Rich (consul at Baghdad in the early part of this century), and a
                    vast quantity of Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS.; the Chambers collection of
                    Sanskrit MSS.; several other collections of Indian MSS.; and a copious library
                    of Hebrew MSS. (including that of the great scholar Michaelis, and codices of
                    great age, recently brought from Yemen). The collection of Syriac MSS.,
                    embracing the relics of the famous library of the convent of St Mary Deipara in
                    the Nitrian desert, formed by the abbot Moses of Nisibis, in the 10th century,
                    is the most important in existence; of the large store of Abyssinian volumes
                    many were amassed after the campaign against King Theodore. The number of
                    genealogical rolls and documents relating to the local and family history of
                    Great Britain is very large. Altogether there are now over 50,000 MSS. (of which
                    8500 are Oriental), besides 45,000 charters and rolls.</p>
                <p>The musical works comprise upwards of 11,000 volumes of vocal and nearly 6000
                    volumes of instrumental music, the number of separate pieces amounting to more
                    than 70,000. The catalogue is in manuscript. The collection of maps, charts,
                    plans, and topographical drawings is also a remarkable one. The maps are nearly
                    116,000 in number. Letter A of a printed catalogue of the maps is already in
                    type.</p>
                <p>The name of Panizzi is inseparably connected with his circular reading-room,
                    opened in 1857. This is encompassed by the new library, with shelf-space for a
                    million and a half volumes. The presses inside the reading-room, arranged in
                    three tiers, contain upwards of 80,000 volumes, those on the ground floor
                    (20,000) being books of reference to which readers have unlimited access. The
                    comfortable accommodation for readers is briefly described below. Perhaps not
                    the least convenient arrangement here is the presence of the superintendent,
                    whose duty it is to help readers in their difficulties; the varied
                    qualifications of the present holder of the office are well known. The electric
                    light has been successfully used until 8 o’clock p. Μ. through the darker months
                    from the earlier part of October. In order to enjoy the privilege of reading at
                    the British Museum, the applicant (who must be over twenty-one years of age)
                    must obtain a renewable ticket of admission through a recommendation from a
                    householder addressed to the principal librarian. Formerly no person was
                    admitted until the ticket had been presented at the entrance, but latterly this
                    rule has been considerably relaxed. During 1881 the number of readers was
                    133,842. In spite of the hostile criticism to which it has sometimes been
                    subjected, it cannot be denied that the general catalogue of the printed books
                    (which now runs to upwards of 2000 volumes in manuscript) is a marvellous work
                    executed in a praiseworthy manner. Some slight notion of the extent of the
                    catalogue may be derived from the fact that it contains the works of over 2400
                    authors of the name of Smith. »-But the rapidly increasing size of the catalogue
                    has impelled the trustees to resort to print in order to diminish the bulk.
                    Since 1880 the titles of all accessions have been printed, and as it becomes
                    necessary to break the manuscript volumes, the titles contained in them are also
                    printed; in course of time, therefore, the whole of the titles will have been
                    put into type. The sheets are published at regular intervals, and can be
                    purchased. It is proposed to issue separately headings of special interest,
                    whether of subjects or of authors, <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi> Shakespeare,
                    Bible, Liturgies, &amp;c. Considerable progress has been made in the preparation
                    for the press of a catalogue of English books printed before the year 1640.</p>
                <p>The printed catalogues of books commence with one published in 2 vols, folio,
                    1787, followed by that of 1813-19 in 7 vols. 8vo; the next is that of the
                    library of George III., 1820-29, 5 vols, folio, with</p>
                <p>2 vols. 8vo, 1834, describing the geographical and topographical collections; and
                    then the <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Greuvilliana,</hi> 1842-72, 4 vols. 8vo.
                    The first vol. (letter A) of a general catalogue appeared in 1841 in a folio
                    volume which has never been added to. T1ιe octavo catalogue of the Hebrew books
                    came out in 1867; that of the Sanskrit and Pali literature is in 4to, 1876; and
                    the Chinese catalogue is also in 4to, 1877. There are also printed lists of the
                    books of reference (1871) and bibliographies (1881) in the reading-room. Private
                    enterprise has done a great deal towards cataloguing the American books (by Mr
                    H. Stevens, 4 vols. 8vo), and the British topographical literature has recently
                    been the subject of a similar publication by Mr J. P. Anderson, 8vo, 1881.</p>
                <p>The printed catalogues of the MSS. are—that of the old Royal Library, 1734, 4to;
                    the Sloane and others hitherto undescribed, 1782, 2 vols. 4to; the Cottonian,
                    1802, folio; the Harleian, 1808, 4 vols, folio; the Hargrave, 1818, 4to; the
                    Lansdowne, 1819, folio; the Arundel, 1840, folio; the Burney, 1840, folio; the
                    Oriental (Arabic and Ethiopie), 5 pts., folio, 1838-71; the Syriac, 1870-73,</p>
                <p>3 pts., 4to; the Ethiopie, 1877, 4to; the Persian, 1879-80, 2 vols. 4to; and the
                    Spanish, 1875-80, 3 vols. 8vo. There are also catalogues of the Greek and
                    Egyptian papyri, 1839-46, 5 pts., folio. The additional MSS. from 1831-75 are
                    described in 10 vols. 8vo, 1835-77, with indexes (1783-1835) in folio and
                    (1854-75) in 8vo. A catalogue of the MS. music was produced in 1842, 8vo; and
                    one of the MS. maps in 1844, 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p>The binding is done upon the premises, and the sum expended each year is £9000.
                    The average sum annually spent upon the purchase of books is about £10,000, and
                    upon MSS. £2500. Since the catalogues ceased to be transcribed £3000 is annually
                    spent on printing.</p>
                <p>London is very badly off as regards public libraries, and the largest general
                    collection which is available without any tedious preliminary forms is that of
                    the corporation of the city of London at the Guildhall. A library was
                    established here by Sir Richard Wlιittington between 1421-26, and several
                    notices in the civic records show how well in th,ose times the citizens cared
                    for their books. But it did not remain without accident; in 1522 the Lord
                    Protector Somerset carried off three cart-loads of books, and during the great
                    fire of 1666 the remainder was destroyed together with the library buildings.
                    Nothing was done to repair the loss until 1824, when a committee was appointed,
                    and rooms set apart for library purposes. In 1840 a catalogue of 10,000 volumes
                    was printed, and in 1859 a second was prepared of 40,000 volumes. In consequence
                    of the large and increasing number of the readers, the present fine building was
                    commenced about ten years later, and, after having cost £90,000, was opened in
                    1873 as a free public library. There are now upwards of 80,000 printed volumes
                    and 300 MSS. The contents are of a general character, and include a special
                    collection of books about London, the Solomons Hebrew and rabbinical library,
                    and the libraries of the Clockmakers’ Company and the old Dutch church in Austin
                    Friars. The only rate-supported library in&gt; the metropolis is that of the
                    united parishes of St Margaret and St John at Westminster (13,527 volumes),
                    founded in 1857, principally by the influence of the late Lord Hatherley, with a
                    small branch at Knightsbridge. The Notting Hill Free Public Library (5000
                    volumes) is supported by Mr James Heywood, and the Bethnal Green Free Library
                    and South London Free Library by voluntary subscriptions.</p>
                <p>Of libraries of a more special character, those principally devoted to theology
                    have perhaps the first claim to notice. The archiépiscopal library at Lambeth
                    was founded in 1610 by Archbishop Bancroft, and has been enriched by the gifts
                    of Laud, Tenison, Manners Sutton, and others of his successors; it is now lodged
                    in the noble hall built by Juxon. The treasures consist of the illuminated MSS.,
                    and a rich store of early printed books; of the latter two catalogues have been
                    issued by S. R. Maitland. The MSS. are described in H. J. Todd’s catalogue,
                    1812. Sion College is a guild of the parochial clergy of the city and suburbs of
                    London, and the library was founded in 1629 for their use; laymen may also read
                    (but not borrow) the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n536/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0536-0517"/> books when recommended by some beneficed
                    metropolitan clergyman. The library is especially rich in liturgies, Port-Royal
                    authors, pamphlets, &lt;fcc. The copyright privilege was commuted in 1835 for an
                    annual sum of £363,15s. 2d. The present building was erected immediately after
                    the great fire. The chamber in the old cloisters, in which the library of the
                    dean and chapter of Westminster is preserved, is well known from the charming
                    description by Washington Irving in his <hi rend="italic">Sketch Book.</hi>
                    There are about 11,000 volumes, mostly of old theology and history, including
                    many rare Bibles and other valuable books. The library of the dean and chapter
                    of St Paul’s was founded in very early times, and now numbers some 8700 volumes,
                    mainly theological, besides over 10,300 pamphlets, with a good collection of
                    early Bibles and Testaments, Paul’s Cross Sermons, and works connected with the
                    cathedral. Dr Williams’s library was founded by the will of an eminent
                    Presbyterian divine of that name; it was opened in 1729. The books (30,000
                    printed volumes and 1000 MSS.) are housed in a new building, completed in 1873.
                    Theology of all schools of opinion is represented, and there are special
                    collections of theosophical books and MSS., the works of Boehme, Law, and other
                    mystical writers. The MSS. include the original minutes of the Westminster
                    Assembly, letters and treatises of Richard Baxter, &amp;c. The British and
                    Foreign Bible Society has a remarkable collection of Bibles and Biblical
                    literature, of which a printed catalogue was published in 1855. Perhaps the best
                    library of Catholic theology in London is that of the Oratory at South
                    Kensington, established in 1849.</p>
                <p>Of the law libraries, that at Lincoln’s Inn is the oldest and the largest. It
                    dates from 1497, when John Nethersale, a member of the society, made a bequest
                    of forty marks, part of which was to be devoted to the building of a library for
                    the benefit of the students of the laws of England. A catalogue of the printed
                    books was published in 1859, and the MSS. were catalogued by the Rev. Joseph
                    Hunter in 1837. The library of the Inner Temple is known to have existed in
                    1540. In the middle of the 17th century it received a cohsiderable benefaction
                    from William Petyt, the well-known keeper of the Tower records. There are now
                    about 36,000 volumes, including the pamphlets collected by John Adolphus for his
                    <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> books on crime and prisons brought
                    together by Mr Crawford, and a selection of works on jurisprudence made by John
                    Austin. A library in connexion with the Middle Temple was in existence during
                    the reign of Henry VIII., but the date usually assigned to its foundation is
                    1641, when Robert Ashley left his books to the inn of which he had been a
                    member. Gray’s Inn Library was perhaps established before 1555. In 1669 was made
                    the first catalogue of the books, and the next, still extant, in 1689. The
                    Incorporated Law Society (1831) has a good law and general library (30,000
                    volumes), including the best collection of private Acts of Parliament in
                    England, and a large number of pamphlets relating to Anglo-Catholic
                    controversies brought together by the late Rev. Joseph Mendham. The catalogue
                    was printed in 1869.</p>
                <p>The collegiate library at Dulwich dates from 1619, and a list of its earliest
                    accessions, in the handwriting of the founder, may still be seen. There are now
                    about 7000 volumes of miscellaneous works of the 17th and 18th centuries, with a
                    few rare books. A catalogue of them was printed in 1880; and one describing the
                    MSS. (567) and the muniments (606) was issued during the succeeding year. The
                    last two classes are very important, and include the well-known “Alleyn Papers”
                    and the theatrical diary of Philip Henslow. Soon after the foundation of the
                    University of London in 1837, an endeavour was made to provide a library, but it
                    has had to look to gifts rather than to purchases for its accessions. In 1871
                    the university obtained, in this manner, the library of the historian Grote, and
                    in the same year Lord Overstone purchased and presented the mathematical
                    collection of De Morgan. A catalogue was printed in 1875. The books at
                    University College (1828) are much more numerous, and here also a considerable
                    proportion are donations, including the Morrison Chinese library of 10,000
                    volumes, the Daulby-Roscoe Icelandic books, the Graves mathematical and physical
                    library, and the Barlow Dante bequest. A printed catalogue of the greater
                    portion was brought out in 1879. The library at King’s College includes a
                    collection of works on Eastern subjects bequeathed by Dr Marsden, as well as the
                    scientific books formerly belonging to Sir Charles Wheatstone. The medical
                    library is distinct. The educational library at the South Kensington Museum
                    numbers about 42,200 volumes, and may be consulted by teachers and students of
                    the departmental schools, and by other persons on the same terms as the art
                    library mentioned below. The ninth edition of the catalogue appeared in
                    1876.</p>
                <p>The library of the Patent Office is the largest scientific and technical
                    collection, indeed the only one which is readily open to the public. There are
                    at present 80,000 volumes, including a very extensive series of the transactions
                    and journals of learned bodies. A catalogue is now in the press. Transactions
                    and proceedings of societies, with scientific periodicals, compose almost the
                    whole library of the Royal Society, which extends to about 40,000 volumes. The
                    diarist Evelyn induced the seventh duke of Norfolk to present to the Society the
                    Arundel library, part of which had formerly belonged to Matthias Corvinus. The
                    MSS., however, were sold to the British Museum in 1831 for £3559, and a quantity
                    of rare printed books have also been disposed of. Scientific inquirers are
                    freely admitted to the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, where there
                    are over 30,000 volumes on geology, mineralogy, mining, and metallurgy,
                    including the former collections of De la Beche and Murchison. A printed
                    catalogue was issued in 1878. For the libraries of other scientific institutions
                    see the tables.</p>
                <p>Medical and surgical libraries are attached to all the chief hospitals and
                    medical societies (see the tables).</p>
                <p>For the fine arts there is the National Art Library (1852) at the South
                    Kensington Museum, which is now an excellent collection of 56,000 volumes,
                    56,000 photographs, 25,000 drawings, and 80,000 prints. Art students are
                    admitted free, as are ordinary visitors on Museum pay days; otherwise a charge
                    of 6d. per week is made to the latter. The library of the Royal Academy of Arts,
                    after its journey from Somerset House to Trafalgar Square, has been lodged in
                    the old ball-room of Burlington House since 1875. At the National Gallery is
                    preserved for official use the library (3500 volumes) formerly belonging to Sir
                    C. L. Eastlake, P.R.A., which is particularly rich in catalogues and
                    descriptions of picture galleries. The Royal Institution of British. Architects
                    (1834) possesses over 6500 volumes on architectural and allied subjects,
                    including an almost complete collection of editions of Vitruvius. The library of
                    the Royal Academy of Music (1822) is almost exclusively musical, and, although
                    numbering less than 1000 volumes, contains many rare and interesting works. The
                    library of the Sacred Harmonic Society is said to be one of the best arranged
                    and most valuable musical collections in England. A third edition of the printed
                    catalogue appeared in 1872, when the library contained 4851 volumes.<note

                <p>The best library of archaeology and kindred subjects is that of the Society of
                    Antiquaries, consisting of nearly 20,000 printed volumes and 500 MSS. It is rich
                    in early printed books, topography, heraldry, and numismatics, and includes a
                    curious collection of books on pageants presented by Mr Fairholt, and the
                    remarkable assemblage of lexicographical works formerly belonging to the late
                    Albert Way, given by his widow. There is a good muster of heraldic works at the
                    Herald’s College, and the library of Sir John Soane (15,000 volumes) is still
                    preserved in the museum at his house in Lincoln’s Inn Fields. The printed
                    catalogue (1878) shows that it is a fairly good collection of books on
                    architecture and antiquities.</p>
                <p>Among subscription libraries, the London Library stands first in order of
                    importance. It was founded in 1841 as a lending library for the use of scholars,
                    and Dean Milman, Sir G. C. Lewis, Mr Gladstone, Thomas Carlyle, Henry Hallam,
                    and other eminent men took part in its formation. By means of a moderate
                    subscription, funds were raised for the purchase of books on general subjects,
                    which now amount to about 90,000 volumes. The latest catalogue was printed in
                    1875, with a supplement in 1881. The London Institution (1805) is a proprietary
                    library to which proprietor’s nominees and yearly subscribers also have
                    admission. For reference purposes reader’s tickets are very liberally granted to
                    other persons. The books now number about 70,000 volumes in general literature;
                    the departments of history and topography are especially rich, and the number is
                    rapidly growing. A complete catalogue was published in 1837-43; almost the whole
                    collection, including reference and circulating libraries very minutely
                    classified, is contained in one room. Porson filled the position of librarian
                    here at the close of his life, but he proved no better a librarian than did
                    Casaubon before him at Paris. The library of the Royal Institution of Great
                    Britain was founded in 1803 by the subscriptions of the members, amounting, in
                    1806, to £6000. There are now 40,000 volumes in scientific and general
                    literature; they are not lent out. There is an interesting series of 56 volumes
                    of MS. correspondence relating to the American war.</p>
                <p>The libraries of the two branches of the legislature may be named with those of
                    the great public offices. The Foreign Office library contains about 70,000
                    volumes, including the old library of the Board of Trade (20,000 volumes);
                    history, geography, and law are well represented, and the department of treaties
                    and diplomacy is of course very complete. The India Office library was formed by
                    a vote of the court of directors of the East India Company in 1801. The services
                    in India were also invited to aid in the creation of an institution which should
                    become a permanent repository of Oriental lore, and many munificent donations
                    were received in consequence of the appeal. The printed books now number nearly
                    40,000, chiefly on Indian and Oriental subjects, with about 10,000 Sanskrit,
                    Arabic, Persian, Pali, and other Oriental manuscripts. Loth’s excellent
                    catalogue of the Arabic codices was published in 1877, and other catalogues are
                    now ready for the press. At the Colonial Office there is a collection of about
                    12,000 works relating to colonial history and administration, and the Home
                    Office possesses about 5000 volumes of parliamentary, historical, and legal
                    works. The Admiralty library extends to about 25,000 volumes, chiefly voyages
                    and travels; a printed catalogue was issued in 1875. At the War Office there are
                    also 25,000 volumes, mainly topographical and military. The MS. records are
                    estimated to extend to 100,000 volumes, but only those of the last twenty years
                    are kept in Pall Mall, the remainder being at the Record Office. These records
                    extend from the time of Queen Elizabeth, and there are some of earlier date. The
                    older volumes belonged to the late Board of Ordnance, and the series also
                    includes the despatches from generals commanding armies on foreign service. All
                    these libraries are for official use only, but at the India Office strangers are
                    admitted upon proper introduction.</p>
                <p>Many of the principal clubs possess libraries; that of the Athenaeum is by far
                    the most important. It now numbers about 48,000 volumes of books in all
                    departments of literature, and is especially rich in well-bound and fine copies
                    of works on the fine arts, archaeology, topography, and history. The pamphlets,
                    of which there is a complete printed catalogue, as well as of the books, form a
                    remarkable series, including those collected by Gibbon and Mackintosh. Next
                    comes the Reform Club, with about 30,000 volumes, chiefly in belles-lettres,
                    with a fair proportion of parliamentary and historical works. The Oxford and
                    Cambridge Club has 20,000 volumes in general and classical literature. At the
                    Garrick there is a small dramatic collection; and the United Service Club,
                    besides a number of books on professional subjects, possesses the fine library
                    which formerly belonged to Dugald Stewart.</p>
                <p>A few libraries which could not be brought into any of the foregoing classes may
                    now be spoken of. First comes the library of the Royal Geographical Society
                    (1832), a valuable collection of 20,000 volumes of voyages and travels, and
                    works on the sciences connected with geography, with many costly Government
                    publications and geographical serials. The catalogue has been printed with
                    supplements down to 1880. The maps and charts number 35,000, with 500 atlases
                    and 240 large diagrams. Since 1854, in consideration of an annual grant of £500
                    from the treasury, the map room has been open for public reference. At the Royal
                    United Service Institution there are also about 20,000 volumes, chiefly naval
                    and military, with a printed catalogue, 1865. Besides the members, officers of
                    both services are admitted. The Royal Asiatic Society has α library of nearly
                    8000 printed books, with 750 MSS. in Sanskrit, Persian, Turkish, &lt;fcc., 5000
                    Chinese books, and 220 Japanese. Besides the art and educational libraries at
                    South Kensington, there are also deposited at the museum, and open under the
                    same regulations, the library of the Rev. Alexander Dyce, bequeathed in 1869,
                    and the books of John Forster, left in 1876. The Dyce collection (15,000
                    volumes) is strong in the English drama and poetry, Italian literature, and
                    classical authors. The Forster library (19,000 volumes) abounds in history,
                    biography, travels, plays, and fiction, tracts, Americana, proclamations,
                    ballads, &amp;c.; the manuscripts include three note-books of Leonardo da Vinci,
                    and the Garrick correspondence in 39 volumes.</p>
                <p>Notices of a considerable number of other metropolitan libraries, not mentioned
                    in the preceding pages, may be found in the tables at the end of this
                    article.</p>
                <p>With one or two exceptions, libraries are attached to the cathedrals of England
                    and Wales. Though they are of course intended for the use of the cathedral or
                    diocesan clergy, they are in most cases open to any respectable person who may
                    be properly introduced. They seldom contain very much modern literature, chiefly
                    consisting of older theology, with more or less addition of classical and
                    historical literature. They vary in extent from a few volumes, as at Llandaff or
                    St David’s, to 15,000 volumes, as at Durham. Together they possess nearly
                    150,000 printed and manuscript volumes. As a rule, very little is spent upon
                    them, and they are very little used.</p>
                <p>The library of Christ Church, Oxford, belongs alike to the college and the
                    cathedral, but will be more properly described as a college library. The
                    cathedral library of Durham dates from monastic times, and possesses many of the
                    books which belonged to the monastery. These were added to by Dean Sudbury, the
                    second founder of the library, and Bishop Cosin. The collection has been
                    considerably increased in more modern times, and now contains <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n538/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0538-0519"/> 15,000 volumes. It is especially rich in MSS.,
                    some of which are of great beauty and value; a catalogue of them was printed in
                    1825. The library has good topographical and entomological collections. The
                    chapter spend £370 per annum in salaries and in books. The library at York
                    numbers about 11,000 volumes, and has been very liberally thrown open to the
                    public. It is kept in the former chapel of the archbishop’s palace, and has many
                    valuable MSS. and early printed books. The foundation of the library at
                    Canterbury dates probably from the Roman mission to England, 596 A.B., although
                    the library does not retain any of the books then brought over, or even of the
                    books said to have been sent by Pope Gregory to the first archbishop in 601. It
                    is recorded that among Lanfranc’s buildings was a new library, and Becket is
                    said to have collected books abroad to present to the library. The collection
                    now numbers about 9900 printed books, with about 110 MS. volumes, and between
                    6000 and 7000 documents. A catalogue was printed in 1802. The present building
                    was erected in 1867 on part of the site of the monastic dormitory. The library
                    at Lincoln contains 7400 volumes, of which a catalogue was printed in 1859. It
                    possesses a fine collection of political tracts of the age of Elizabeth, James,
                    and Charles I. The present collection at Chichester dates from the Restoration
                    only; that at Ely is rich in books and tracts relating to the non-jurors. The
                    library at Exeter possesses many Saxon MSS. of extreme interest, one of them
                    being the gift of Leofric, the first bishop. The treasures of Lichfield were
                    destroyed by the Puritans during the civil war, and the existing library is of
                    later formation. Frances, duchess of Somerset, bequeathed to it nearly 1000
                    volumes, including the famous Evangeliary of St Chad. The collection at Norwich
                    is chiefly modern, and was presented by Dr Sayers. The earlier library at
                    Peterborough having almost wholly perished in the civil war, Bishop White
                    Kennett became the virtual founder of the present collection. Salisbury is rich
                    in incunabula, and a catalogue has recently been printed. Winchester Cathedral
                    Library is mainly the bequest of Bishop Morley in the 17th century. The library
                    at Bristol, then numbering 6000 or 7000 volumes, was burnt and pillaged by the
                    mob in the riots of 1831. Only about 1000 volumes were saved, many of which were
                    recovered, but few additions have been made to them. At Chester in 1691 Dean
                    Arderne bequeathed his books and part of his estate “as the beginning of a
                    public library for the clergy and city.” The library of Hereford is a good
                    specimen of an old monastic library; the books are placed in the Lady Chapel,
                    and about 230 choice MSS. are chained to oaken desks. The books are ranged with
                    the edges outwards upon open shelves, to which they are attached by chains and
                    bars. The four Welsh cathedrals were supplied with libraries by a deed of
                    settlement in 1709. The largest of them, that of St Asaph, has about 1750
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>The Bodleian Library, though it had been preceded by various efforts towards a
                    university library, owed its origin to Sir Thomas Bodley. After a long and
                    honourable career as a diplomatist he determined, as he says, to take his
                    farewell of state employments, and concluded to set up his staff at the library
                    door in Oxon. Contributing largely himself, and procuring contributions from
                    others, he opened the library with upwards of 2000 volumes in 1602. In 1610 he
                    obtained a grant from the Stationers’ Company of a copy of every work printed in
                    the country. The additions made to the library soon surpassed the capacity of
                    the room, and the founder proceeded to enlarge it. By his will he left
                    considerable property to the university for the maintenance and increase of the
                    library. The example set by Bodley found many noble imitators. Amongst the chief
                    benefactors have been Sir Henry Savile, Archbishop Laud, John Selden, Sir Kenelm
                    Digby, Lord Fairfax, Richard Gough, Francis Douce, Richard Rawlinson, Rev.
                    Robert Mason, and F. W. Hope. The library now contains almost 400,000 printed
                    volumes, and about 30,000 manuscripts. The number of separate works exceeds a
                    million. But the number of volumes conveys a very inadequate idea of the
                    valuable character of the collection. In the department of Oriental manuscripts
                    it is perhaps superior to any other European library; and it is exceedingly rich
                    in other manuscript treasures. It possesses a splendid series of Greek and Latin
                    <hi rend="italic">editiones principes,</hi> and of the earliest productions of
                    English presses. Its historical manuscripts contain most valuable materials for
                    the general and literary history of the country.</p>
                <p>The last general catalogue of the printed books was printed in 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> w</hi> ols. folio, 1843-51. In 1859 it was decided to
                    prepare a new manuscript catalogue on the plan of the great catalogue at the
                    British Museum, aud this has recently been completed in duplicate. It extends to
                    over 700 folio volumes, in which the books are entered on manifolded slips. It
                    is an alphabetical author-catalogue; and the Bodleian, like the British Museum,
                    has no accessible subject index. A catalogue on subjects is now, however, in
                    course of preparation. There are also printed catalogues of the books belonging
                    to several of the separate collections. The MSS. are in general catalogued
                    according to the collections to which they belong, and they are all indexed,
                    although they are not all catalogued as yet. Five volumes have been published
                    under the late Mr Coxe’s editorship of the “Catalogi Codicum MSS. Bibliothecae
                    Bodleiame,” 1853-63, in quarto, and there is a folio catalogue of Oriental
                    MSS.</p>
                <p>In 1860 the beautiful building known as the “Radcliffe Library,” now called the
                    “Camera Bodleiana,” was offered to the curators of the Bodleian by the Radcliffe
                    trustees. It is used as a storehouse for the more modem books, including the new
                    periodicals, which lie upon its tables; and it also serves as a reading-room. It
                    is the only room open after the hour when the older building is closed owing to
                    the rale as to the exclusion of artificial light. The separation of the books is
                    a source of some inconvenience in practice, and it has been proposed of late
                    years to remove the entire collections to a new building which should be erected
                    for the purpose of accommodating them.</p>
                <p>The library is open by right to all graduate members of the university, and to
                    others (over eighteen years of age) upon producing a satisfactory
                    recommendation. No books are allowed to be sent out of the library except by
                    special leave of the curators, in which respect there is a marked contrast with
                    the practice at the University Library at Cambridge, and still more so with the
                    conspicuous liberality in this respect of the university libraries of Germany.
                    The hours are from 9 to 4 and 9 to 3, according to the time of year, the Camera
                    being open from 10 to 10 all the year round. The library is only closed
                    altogether some tweħty-nine working days in the year. The general control of the
                    library is committed to a board of thirteen curators. The permanent endowment is
                    comparatively small; the ordinary expenditure, chiefly defrayed from the
                    university chest, is about £4500.</p>
                <p>The other important collections not connected with particular colleges are the
                    Radcliffe Library and the library of the Taylor Institution. The former was
                    founded by the famous physician Dr John Radcliffe, who died in 1714, and
                    bequeathed, besides a permanent endowment of £350 a year, the sum of £40,000 for
                    a building. The library was opened in 1749. Many years ago the trustees resolved
                    to confine their purchases of books to works on medicine and natural science.
                    When the university museum and laboratories were built in 1860, the trustees
                    allowed the books to be transferred to the museum. The completeness and
                    convenience of the arrangements make the Radcliffe the model of a working
                    scientific library. The Taylor Institution is due to the benefaction of Sir
                    Robert Taylor, an architect, who died in 1788, leaving his property to found an
                    establishment for the teaching of modern languages. The library was established
                    in 1848, and is devoted to the literature of the modern European languages. It
                    contains a fair collection of works on European philology, with a special Dante
                    collection, about 1000 Mazarinades and 400 Luther pamphlets. It contains
                    altogether 30,000 volumes, with a few MSS. The Finch collection, left to the
                    university in 1830, is also kept with the Taylor Library. Books are lent out to
                    members of the university and to others on a proper introduction. The endowment
                    affords an income of £800 to £1000 for library purposes, and about 2000 volumes
                    are added yearly.</p>
                <p>The libraries of the several colleges vary considerably in extent and character.
                    That of All Souls was established in 1443 by Archbishop Chichele, and enlarged
                    in 1710 by the munificent bequest of Christopher Codrington. It devotes special
                    attention to jurisprudence, of which it has a large collection. It possesses
                    40,000 printed volumes and 300 MSS., and fills a splendid hall 200 feet long.
                    The library of Brasenose College has a special endowment fund, so that it has,
                    for a college library, the unusually large income of £200. The library of Christ
                    Church is rich in divinity and topography. It embraces the valuable library
                    bequeathed by Charles Boyle, third earl of Orrery, amounting to 10,000 volumes,
                    the books and MSS. of Archbishop Wake, and the Morris collection of Oriental
                    books. The building was finished in 1761, and closely resembles the basilica of
                    Antoninus at Rome, now the Dogana. Corpus possesses a fine collection of
                    Aldines, many of them presented by its founder Bishop Fox, and a collection of
                    17th century tracts catalogued by Mr Edwards, with about 400 MSS. Exeter College
                    Library has 25,000 volumes, with special collections of classical dissertations
                    and English theological and political tracts. The library of Jesus College has
                    few books of later date than the early part of the last century. Many of them
                    are from the bequest of Sir Leolinβ Jenkins, who built the existing library.
                    There are also some valuable Welsh MSS. The library of Keble College consists
                    largely of theology, including the MSS. of many of Keble’s works. The library of
                    Magdalen College has about 22,500 volumes (including <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n539/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0539-0520"/> many volumes of pamphlets) and 250 MSS. It has
                    scientific and topographical collections. The library of Merton College has of
                    late devoted itself to foreign modern history. New College Library has about
                    17,000 printed volumes and about 350 MSS., several of •which were presented by
                    its founder, William öf Wykeham. Oriel College Library, besides its other
                    possessions, has a special collection of books on comparative philology and
                    mythology, with a printed catalogue. The fine library of Queen’s College is
                    strong in theology, in English and modern European history, and in English
                    county histories. St John’s College Library is largely composed of the
                    literature of theology and jurisprudence before 1750, and possesses a collection
                    of medical books of the 16th and 17th centuries. The newer half of the library
                    building was erected by Inigo Jones at the expense of Laud, who also gave many
                    printed and manuscript books. The room used as a library at Trinity College
                    formed part of Durham College, the library of which was established by Richard
                    of Bury. Wadham College Library includes a collection of botanical books
                    bequeathed by Richard Warner in 1775 and a collection of books, relating chiefly
                    to the Spanish Reformers, presented by the executors of Benjamin Wiffen.
                    Worcester College Library has of late specially devoted itself to classical
                    archaeology. It is also rich in old plays.</p>
                <p>It must be admitted that the college libraries as a rule have not been used to
                    any great extent. Of late, however, there have been signs of awakening interest.
                    About 1871 there was a meeting of college librarians; and it was agreed that the
                    colleges, instead of making merely sporadic purchases from the whole field of
                    literature, should rather husband their limited resources and restrict
                    themselves each to some special department. But the idea has not been carried
                    out very thoroughly, and a good deal must be done before the college libraries
                    can be said to be as useful and efficient as they might be.</p>
                <p>The history of the University Library at Cambridge dates from the earlier part of
                    the 15th century. Two early lists of its contents are preserved, the first
                    embracing 52 volumes dating from about 1425, the second a shelf-list, apparently
                    of 330 volumes, drawn up by the outgoing proctors in 1473. Its first great
                    benefactor was Thomas Scott of Rotherham, archbishop of York, who erected in
                    1475 the building in which the library continued until 1755. He also gave more
                    than 200 books and manuscripts to the library, some of which still remain. The
                    library received other benefactions, but nevertheless appeared “but mean” to
                    John Evelyn when he visited Cambridge in 1654. In 1666 Tobias Rustat presented a
                    sum of money to be invested to buy the choicest and most useful books. In 1715
                    George I. presented the library of Bishop Moore, which was very rich in early
                    English printed books, forming over 30,000 volumes of printed books and
                    manuscripts. The funds bequeathed by William Worts and John Manistre, together
                    with that of Rustat, produce at present about .£1500 a year. The share of
                    university dues appropriated to library purposes amounts to £3000 a year. In
                    addition the library is entitled to new books under the Copyright Acts. The
                    number of printed volumes in the library cannot be exactly stated, as no recent
                    calculation on the subject exists. It has been variously estimated at a quarter
                    or half a million. The calendar states it as 200,000. It includes a fine series
                    of <hi rend="italic">editiones principes</hi> of the classics and of the early
                    productions of the English press. The MSS. number 5723, in which are included a
                    considerable number of adversaria or printed books with MS. notes, which form a
                    leading feature in the collection. The most famous of the MSS. is the celebrated
                    copy of the four gospels and the Acts of the Apostles, which is known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex Bezae,</hi> and which was presented to the university by
                    that Reformer. A catalogue of the MSS. has been published in 4 vols., 1856-61.
                    There is no printed catalogue of the books, although the catalogue is in print,
                    the accessions being printed and cut up and arranged in volumes. The regulations
                    of the library with regard to the lending of books are very liberal, as many as
                    ten volumes being allowed out to one borrower at the same time.</p>
                <p>There is a library attached to the Fitzwilliam Museum bequeathed to the
                    university in 1816. It consists of the entire library of Lord Fitzwilliam, with
                    the addition of an archaeological library bought from the executors of Colonel
                    Leake, and a small number of works, chiefly on the. history of art, since added
                    by purchase or bequest. It contains a collection of engravings of old masters, a
                    collection of music, printed and MS., and a collection of illuminated MSS.,
                    chiefly French and Flemish, of the 14th to 16th centuries. The books are not
                    allowed to be taken out.</p>
                <p>The library of Trinity College, which is contained in a magnificent hall built by
                    Sir Christopher Wren, has about 90,000 printed and 1918 MS. volumes, and is
                    especially strong in theology, classics, and bibliography. It owes to numerous
                    gifts and bequests the possession of a great number of rare books and
                    manuscripts. Amongst these special collections are the Capell collection of
                    early dramatic and especially Shakespearian literature, the collection of German
                    theology and philosophy bequeathed by Archdeacon Hare, and the Grylls bequest in
                    1863 of 9600 volumes, including many early printed books. There are printed
                    catalogues of the Sanskrit and other Oriental MSS. by Dr Aufrecht and Professor
                    Palmer, and of the incunabula by the present librarian, Mr Sinker. The library
                    is open to all members of the college, and the privilege of using it is
                    liberally extended to properly accredited students.</p>
                <p>None of the other college libraries rivals Trinity in the number of books. The
                    library of Christ’s College received its first books from the foundress. Clare
                    College Library includes a number of Italian and Spanish plays of the end of the
                    16th century left by George Ruggle. The library of Corpus Christi College first
                    became notable through the bequest of books and MSS. made by Archbishop Parker
                    in 1575. The printed books are less than 5000 in number, and the additions now
                    made are chiefly in such branches as throw light on the extremely valuable
                    collection of ancient MSS., which attracts scholars from all parts of Europe.
                    There is a printed catalogue of these MSS. Gonville and Caius College Library is
                    of early foundation. A catalogue of the MSS. was printed in 1849, with pictorial
                    illustrations, and a list of the incunabula in 1850. The printed books of King’s
                    College includes the fine collection bequeathed by Jacob Bryant in 1804. The
                    MSS. are almost wholly Oriental, chiefly Persian and Arabic, and a catalogue of
                    them has been printed. Magdalene College possesses the curious library formed by
                    Pepys and bequeathed by him to the college, together with his collections of
                    prints and drawings and of rare British portraits. It is remarkable for its
                    treasures of popular literature and English ballads, as well as for the Scottish
                    manuscript poetry collected by Sir Richard Maitland. The books are kept in
                    Pepys’s own cases, and remain just as he arranged them himself. The library of
                    Peterhouse is the oldest library in Cambridge, and possesses a catalogue of some
                    600 or 700 books dating from 1418, in which year it was completed. It is chiefly
                    theological, though it possesses a valuable collection of modern works on
                    geology and natural science, and a unique collection of MS. music. Queen’s
                    College Library contains about 30,000 volumes, mainly in theology, classics, and
                    Semitic literature, and has a printed classcatalogue. The library of St John’s
                    College is rich in early printed books, and possesses a large collection of
                    English historical tracts. Of the MSS. and rare books there is a printed
                    catalogue. For the other college libraries see the tables.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Free Public Libraries.—</hi> In the year 1850 Mr Ewart
                    introduced the first Public Libraries Act into the House of Commons, and it has
                    since been supplemented and amended by the Acts &lt;rf 1855, 1866, 1871, and
                    1877. Mr Ewart had previously carried through parliament the Museums Act of
                    1845; and small libraries had been established in connexion with museums under
                    that Act at Salford and Warrington. The number of towns which have established
                    rate-supported libraries, or in which the Acts have been adopted, now amounts to
                    at least ninety-six, ten of these towns being in Scotland, and one only in
                    Ireland. It is noticeable that the Acts have not been adopted in any of the
                    great capital towns of the three kingdoms, except in one single parish of
                    Westminster. Many of our largest towns are also in default. Glasgow may be
                    considered to be sufficiently provided for by the munificent Mitchell bequest.
                    Of the libraries which have actually been opened sixteen are in places of over
                    100,000 inhabitants, twenty in towns of between 50,000 and 100,000 inhabitants,
                    sixteen in towns of between 30,000 and 50,000, eleven in towns of between 20,000
                    and 30,000 inhabitants, seventeen in towns of between 10,000 and 20,000
                    inhabitants, and finally six in towns of less than 10,000 inhabitants.</p>

                    1880-81, the number of volumes in stock and of the total issues is as follows.
                    In eighty-one libraries returning their number of volumes, there is a total of
                    1,448,192 volumes in stock; while the total issues for the year in seventy-six
                    libraries amounted to the enormous number of 9,023,742 volumes. Even these
                    figures afford a very inadequate idea of the service rendered by these
                    institutions in supplying popular reading. They take no account of the visits
                    made to the newsrooms which are almost invariably connected with the libraries,
                    or of the use made of the magazines and periodicals which lie upon the tables.
                    The free public libraries generally consist of a lending department, with a
                    reference library wherever the institution can provide one. A very large
                    proportion of the issues from the lending departments consists of fiction, the
                    percentage varying in different libraries from about 50 to as much as 75 per
                    cent, of the whole. It is only in the case of the wealthier institutions, such
                    as those in the great towns of Liverpool, Manchester, and Birmingham, that the
                    reference departments are so important as to claim consideration here in respect
                    of the intrinsic character of their collections. Even some of the smaller
                    libraries, however, present features of interest in their collections of local
                    books, or of books illustrating the trade or industry of the district, or the
                    life and writings of some great man connected with or born in the locality.</p>
                <p>The Salford Free Public Library was one of the libraries which were established
                    under the Museums Act of 1845, and was opened in 1850 in connexion with the
                    museum and picture gallery at Peel Park. The buildings are pleasantly situated
                    in grounds of 46 acres in extent. The reference library now contains 33,500
                    volumes, and besides the central lending departments there are three branches in
                    different parts of the borough. The income from the penny rate is about £3300;
                    but this is found to be inadequate.</p>
                <p>The Manchester Free Library was the first to be established under the Act of
                    1850. A public subscription of nearly £13,000 was raised to defray the expenses
                    of its establishment, and the library was opened in September 1852. The working
                    of this library was a success from the outset. The issues in the first year were
                    in the reference departments 61,080 volumes, and in the lending departments
                    77,232. The progress made since then may be measured by the number of volutnes
                    issued last year (1881), which amounted to 966,468, and by the fact that six
                    branch libraries have been established. The rate produces an income of £11,000.
                    The reference library now possesses a valuable collection of 65,000 volumes,
                    chiefly of standard works. It contains several special collections, chiefly
                    connected with the industries and history of the district. The library of the
                    English Dialect Society, of which a catalogue has been printed, is deposited
                    here. In addition, the library possesses a very extensive series of periodicals,
                    and a larger collection of political and commercial tracts than can be found
                    anywhere in the country except at the British Museum. A good catalogue was
                    printed in 1864, and a new and extensive index has just appeared.</p>
                <p>The library at Liverpool, which was established under a special Act passed in
                    1852, is the most successful of all the free public libraries, and is connected
                    with a splendid museum and art gallery, the former formed around the nucleus of
                    the ornithological specimens bequeathed to the town by the thirteenth earl of
                    Derby. The rapid extension of museum and library soon rendered larger premises a
                    necessity. The late Sir William Brown took upon himself the entire cost of the
                    present extensive buildings, which were opened in 1860. In 1880 was opened the
                    Picton Reading-Room. It is a circular room 100 feet in diameter, surmounted by a
                    dome, the entire height being 56 feet. It contains 50,000 volumes, and will
                    accommodate over 300 readers. Since April 1881 the electric light has been
                    employed. Under the reading-room is a large circular lecture-room accommodating
                    1500 persons, in which lectures are regularly delivered. There is a numerous
                    collection of local books and pamphlets. The Binns collection, consisting of
                    maps, plans, drawings, portraits, &amp;c., all having reference to the county of
                    Lancaster, is very interesting and valuable. The issues from the reference
                    library in 1880 were 870,716, and with the issues from the two lending
                    departments make the enormous aggregate of 1,307,131. The rate produces an
                    income of £13,000 per annum, of which more than £5000 is expended upon the
                    libraries. An elaborate catalogue of the reference library was published in
                    1872, and a supplement is now being printed. In 1853 Bolton established a
                    library which now has a circulation of over 240,000 volumes. In 1855 libraries
                    were established at Birkenhead and Sheffield. At Birkenhead the rate produces
                    £1500, and 130,000 volumes were lent out last year. At Sheffield, where the rate
                    produces £4750, there are three branches, and the total issues last year were
                    384,266. The reference library has only 9000 volumes.</p>
                <p>The Acts, after having been rejected at Birmingham in 1852, were adopted in 1860.
                    By 1868 four branches had been opened in addition to the central reference and
                    lending libraries. The issues from the lending departments last year were
                    400,000 volumes. The reference library consisted of over 50,000 volumes. The
                    Shakespeare Memorial Library consisted of about 7000 volumes. There were also
                    the Staunton Warwickshire collections of books and MSS. and the Cervantes books.
                    All these collections were unfortunately destroyed by a fire on January 11,
                    1879. The inhabitants of Birmingham have shown much public spirit in repairing
                    the losses then sustained so far as is possible, and the new central reference
                    and lending libraries are expected to be open early in 1882, when it is
                    anticipated that there will be as many volumes ready to be placed in the
                    reference library as there were when the former library was destroyed. No town
                    in England is so surrounded with free libraries as Birmingham. The rate at
                    Birmingham produces over £6000.</p>
                <p>The free library at Nottingham (1867) has recently had new quarters found for it
                    in the new university buildings. It has two branches, and its issues are about
                    160,000. The rate produces £2200. The local collections include a Byron library.
                    The library at Leeds (1868) has no less than twenty-one branches, and together
                    they count over 109,000 volumes. The issues last year, in addition to the use
                    made of the central reference library, were 639,613. The rate produces nearly
                    £5000. At Leicester there is only a halfpenny rate, which produces about £800.
                    The issues last year were 192,317. At Bradford (Acts adopted 1871) the rate
                    produces £3200, and there are five branches with a circulation of 291,276
                    volumes, besides the use made of the reference library. At Plymouth (Acts
                    adopted 1871, library opened 1876) the circulation was 171,851 last year; at
                    Rochdale (Acts adopted 1872) 168,514. At each place there is a good collection
                    of local literature, and at Rochdale a collection of works on the woollen
                    manufacture. The library at Newcastle, opened in 1880, has issued from its
                    lending departments, in its first year, no less than 301,925 volumes to about
                    14,000 readers. A splendid buildingisin courseof erectiontoaccommodate the
                    reference library. This department is intended to contain a complete collection
                    of all standard works, and also a collection of books and manuscripts relating
                    to Newcastle and the northern counties generally. The rate produces £2800. At
                    Bristol a town library had been established in 1614 by Robert Redwood and
                    Archbishop Matthew, and this has formed the nucleus of the collections formed
                    under the Acts when they were adopted in 1875. The total number of volumes is
                    about 46,000. The issues were 432,646 at the central library and its three
                    branches. At Southport (1875) Mr Atkinson gave the building called after him for
                    a library and art gallery. The issues last year were 110,778. The rate produced
                    £775, and an additional voluntary rate produced a little over £100 besides.</p>
                <p>It will be seen from this summary statement that the libraries established under
                    the Acts have in the cases mentioned been abundantly used. The merit of these
                    results is veιy largely due to the enlightened energy of those who are entrusted
                    with their administration.</p>
                <p>Amongst the English libraries that have not yet been described there are few that
                    call for special mention. Some of these have been founded by individuals, and
                    still bear their names. The most notable of these is the fine old library
                    established by Humphrey Chetham at Manchester in 1653, which is still housed in
                    the old collegiate buildings where Raleigh was once entertained by Dr Dee. The
                    collection consists largely of older literature, and numbers 40,000 volumes,
                    with 300MSS. It is freely open to the public, and may be said to have been the
                    first free library in England. Dr Shepherd’s library at Preston was bequeathed
                    by the founder, a physician of the town, to the corporation of Preston in trust
                    for the inhabitants in the year 1759. It is a library of reference, accessible
                    on a recommendation from an aiderman. The William Salt Library, a special
                    Staffordshire library with numerous MSS. and other collections, formed to bring
                    together materials for a history of Staffordshire, was opened to the public in
                    1874.</p>
                <p>Some mention should be made also of the more important subscription or
                    proprietary libraries, which were formed for the most part in the latter half of
                    the 18th century. It is difficult for us to realize how few collections of books
                    were accessible to the public of the last century even in London. The earliest
                    circulating library in the metropolis was established about the middle of the
                    century. The first in Birmingham was opened by Hutton in 1757. The idea of a
                    proprietary library appears to have been first carried out at Liverpool in 1758.
                    The library then formed still flourishes at the Lyceum, and possesses a
                    collection of 72,000 volumes and an income of £1200 a year. In 1760 a library
                    was formed at Warrington which has been merged <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n541/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0541-0522"/> in the Warrington Museum. The Leeds library was
                    established in 1768, and now has 85,000 volumes, and an income of £1430. In 1772
                    the Bristol museum and library was formed, and numbered Coleridge, Southey, and
                    Landor among its earlier members. It now reckons 50,000 volumes, and an income
                    of £1400 a year. The Birmingham (old) library was formed in 1779, and its rules
                    were drawn up by Dr Priestley, who had already taken an active share in the
                    management of the libraries at Warrington and Leeds. The library has now 40,000
                    to 50,000 volumes, and an income of £1600. Many similar institutions are noticed
                    in the tables, while others have given place to the trade circulating libraries
                    and to the libraries established under the Free Libraries Acts.</p>
                <p>A few modern collegiate libraries, finally, claim a summary notice. The library
                    of the university of Durham dates only from 1833, and was begun by a gift of
                    books from Bishop Van Mildert, to which many other donations have since
                    succeeded. The Routh collection includes a large collection of early tracts. The
                    Winterbottom collection is chiefly classical, and the Maltby collection
                    classical and theological. The library of the Owens College, Manchester, was
                    formed on the establishment of the college in 1851 by a gift of books from Mr
                    James Heywood, F.R.S. It has since been largely increased by donations and
                    bequests, including the libraries of Bishop Lee, Mr Grace Calvert, and others.
                    It has an endowment fund of £2500. The library at Stonyhurst College has
                    gradually grown since the establishment of the college in 1794. There is a
                    Etinted catalogue of books printed before 1551. The Walshian library at St
                    Mary’s College, Oscott, was established by Bishop Walsh in 1839, having been
                    purchased by him from the Marchese Marini. It has 70 MSS. and many early printed
                    books.</p>
                <p>The principal library in Scotland is that of the Faculty of Advocates, who in
                    1680 appointed a committee of their number, which reported that “it was fitt
                    that, seeing if the recusants could be made pay their entire money, there wold
                    be betwixt three thousand and four thousand pounds in cash; that the same be
                    imployed on the best and fynest lawers and other law bookes, conforme to a
                    catalogue to be condescended upon by the Facultie, that the samen may be a fonde
                    for ane Bibliothecque whereto many lawers and others may leave their books.” In
                    1682 the active carrying out of the scheme was committed to the Dean of Faculty,
                    Sir George Mackenzie of Rosehaugh, who may be regarded as the founder of the
                    library. In 1684 the first librarian was appointed, and the library appears to
                    have made rapid progress, since it appears from the treasurer’s accounts that in
                    1686 the books and furniture were valued at upwards of &lt;£11,000 Scots,
                    exclusive of donations. In the year 1700, the rooms in the Exchange Stairs,
                    Parliament Close, in which the library was kept, being nearly destroyed by fire,
                    the collection was removed to the ground floor of the Parliament House, where it
                    has ever since remained. The library retains the copyright privilege conferred
                    upon it in 1709. The number of volumes in the library is computed to amount to
                    265,000; of the special collections the most important are the Astorga
                    collection of old Spanish books, purchased by the faculty in 1824 for &lt;£4000;
                    the Thorkelin collection, consisting of about 1200 volumes relating chiefly to
                    the history and antiquities of the northern nations, and including some rare
                    books on old Scottish poetry; the Dietrich collection of over 100,000 German
                    pamphlets and dissertations, including many of the writings of Luther and
                    Melanchthon, purchased for the small sum of £80.; and the Combe collection.</p>
                <p>The faculty appear early to have turned their attention to the collection of
                    MSS., and this department of the library now numbers about 3000 volumes. Many of
                    them are of great interest and value, especially for the civil and
                    ecclesiastical history of Scotland before and after the Reformation. There are
                    thirteen monastic chartularies which escaped the destruction of the religious
                    houses to which they belonged. The MSS. relating to Scottish church history
                    include the collections of Spottiswoode, Woodrow, and Calderwood. The Woodrow
                    collection consists of 154 volumes, and includes his correspondence, extending
                    from 1694 to 1726. Sir James Balfour’s collection and the Balcarres papers
                    consist largely of original state papers, and include many interesting royal
                    letters of the times of James V., Queen Mary, and James VI. The Sibbald papers,
                    numbering over 30 volumes, are largely topographical. The Riddel notebooks,
                    numbering 156 volumes, contain collections to illustrate the genealogy of
                    Scottish families. There are about one hundred volumes of Icelandic MSS.,
                    purchased in 1825 from Professor Finn Magnusson, and some Persian and Sanskrit,
                    with a few classical, manuscripts. The department has some interesting treasures
                    of old poetry, extending to 73 volumes. The most important are the Bannatyne
                    MS., in 2 vols, folio, written by George Bannatyne in 1568, and the Auchinleck
                    MS., a collection of ancient English poetry, named after Alexander Boswell of
                    Auchinleck, who presented it in 1774.</p>
                <p>The first catalogue of the printed books was compiled in 1692, and contains a
                    preface by Sir George Mackenzie. Another was prepared under the care of Ruddiman
                    in 1742. In 1853 the late Mr Halkett commenced a catalogue, which has been
                    printed in 6 vols. 4to, with a supplement, and includes all the printed books in
                    the library at the end of 1871, containing about 260,000 entries. It is an
                    illustration of the public spirit with which they conduct their library, that
                    the whole cost of printing this extensive catalogue, over £5000, has been borne
                    by the members of the faculty. The library, managed by a keeper and staff, under
                    a board of six curators, is easily accessible to all persons engaged in literary
                    work, and is for all practical purposes the public consulting library of
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>The origin of the University Library of Edinburgh is to be found in a bequest of
                    his books of theology and law made to the town in 1580 by Clement Little,
                    advocate. This was two years before the foundation of the university, and in
                    1584 the town council caused the collection to be removed to the college, of
                    which they were the patrons. As it was the only library in the town, it
                    continued to grow and received many benefactions, so that in 1615 it became
                    necessary to erect a library building. Stimulated perhaps by the example of
                    Bodley at Oxford, Drummond of Hawthornden made a large donation of books, of
                    which he printed a catalogue in 1627, and circulated an appeal for assistance
                    from others. In 1678 the library received a bequest of 2000 volumes from the
                    Rev. James Nairne. In 1709 the library became entitled to the copy privilege,
                    which has since been commuted for a payment of £575 per annum. In 1831 the books
                    were removed to the present library buildings, for which a parliamentary grant
                    had been obtained. The main library hall (190 feet in length) is one of the most
                    splendid apartments in Scotland. One of the rooms is set apart as a memorial to
                    General Reid, by whose benefaction the library has greatly benefited. Amongst
                    the more recent accessionshave been the Halliwell-Phillips Shakespeare
                    collection, the Laing collection of Scottish MSS., the Baillie collection of
                    Oriental MSS. (some of which are of great value), and the Hodgson collection of
                    works on political economy. The library now consists of about 140,000 volumes of
                    printed books with 2000 MSS.</p>
                <p>The library of the Writers to Her Majesty’s Signet was established by the society
                    in 1755. At first it consisted of law books exclusively, but in 1788 they began
                    to collect the best editions of works in other departments of literature. During
                    the librarianship of Macvey Napier (1805-37) the number of volumes was more than
                    sextupled, and in 1812 the library was removed to the new hall adjoining the
                    Parliament House. In 1834 the upper hall was devoted to the collection. This is
                    a magnificent apartment <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n542/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0542-0523"/> 142 feet long, with a beautiful cupola painted by
                    Stothard. The library now contains nearly 70,000 volumes, exclusive of
                    pamphlets, and includes some fine specimens of early printing, as well as many
                    other rare and costly works. It is especially rich in county histories and
                    British topography and antiquities. A catalogue of the law books was printed in
                    1856. The late David Laing, who became librarian in 1837, published the first
                    volume of a new catalogue in 1871. The second volume is nearly completed. The
                    books are lent out to the Writers and even to strangers recommended by them.
                    This library, like that of the Advocates, is most liberally opened to literary
                    inquirers, and has thus acquired a quasi-public or national character.</p>
                <p>There are various other important libraries in Edinburgh, but no considerable
                    lending library open freely to the poorest of the people, and two attempts which
                    have been made to introduce the Libraries’ Acts have been unsuccessful.</p>
                <p>The first mention of a library at St Andrews is as early as 1456. The three
                    colleges λvere provided with libraries of their own about the time of their
                    foundation—St Salvator’s 1455, St Leonard’s 1512, St Mary’s 1537. The University
                    Library was established about 1612 by King James VI., and in the course of the
                    18th century the college libraries were merged in it. The copyright privilege
                    was commuted in 1837. The collection numbers 90,000 volumes exclusive of
                    pamphlets, with about 200 MSS., chiefly of local interest. About 1200 volumes
                    are added yearly. A library is supposed to have existed at Aberdeen since the
                    foundation of King’s College by Bishop Elphinstone in 1494. The present
                    collection combines the libraries of King’s College and Marischal College, now
                    incorporated in the university. The latter had its origin in a collection of
                    books formed by the town authorities at the time of the Reformation, and for
                    some time kept in one of the churches. The library has benefited by the Melvin
                    bequest, chiefly of classical books, and those of Henderson and Wilson, and
                    contains some very valuable books. The general library is located in Old
                    Aberdeen, while the medical and law books are in the New Town. The library has a
                    grant, in lieu of the copy privilege, of £320. The library of the university of
                    Glasgow dates from the 15th century, and numbers George Buchanan and many other
                    distinguished men amongst its early benefactors. A classified subject-catalogue
                    is in progress. The annual accessions are about 1500, and the commutation-grant
                    £707. Connected with the university, which is trustee for the public, is the
                    library of the Hunterian Museum, formed by the eminent anatomist Dr William
                    Hunter. It is a collection of great bibliographical interest, as it is rich in
                    MSS. and in fine specimens of the early printing, especially in Greek and Latin
                    classics. The printed books number about 13,000 volumes, and the MSS. some 600
                    volumes. All the Scottish university libraries lend books to students, on
                    deposit of £1, to graduates, for an annual subscription of half a guinea, and to
                    persons engaged in literary research, by permission of the senatus.</p>
                <p>The Mitchell Library at Glasgow bids fair to be the most important public library
                    outside Edinburgh. It was founded by a munificent bequest of £70,000 from the
                    late Mr Stephen Mitchell. The library was opened in 1877, in temporary premises,
                    and already contains over 36,000 volumes. It includes a special collection of
                    Scottish poetry called “The Poets’ Corner,” and a collection of Glasgow
                    literature, including early specimens of Glasgow printing. The library is open
                    to all persons over fourteen years of age, and the number of readers during the
                    first three years in which the library has been opened is believed to be without
                    precedent. The number of volumes issued in 1880 was 390,732.</p>
                <p>The English Libraries Act of 1850 was extended to Scotland in 1854, and the first
                    town to put it into operation was Airdrie, in 1856. The largest of the libraries
                    which have been opened under the Acts is at Dundee, which possesses 35,500
                    volumes, with a circulation of 252,314. The rate produces £2390. Although the
                    resources of the other towns in which the Acts have so far been adopted do not
                    enable them to rival the larger English towns, the results are proportionately
                    quite as satisfactory. The turnover of their stock of books is generally large,
                    and the reading done appears to be more solid and serious than in England. The
                    percentage of fiction issued is at least 10 or 15 per cent, below the average
                    rate in the English free libraries.</p>
                <p>The establishment of the library of Trinity College, Dublin, is contemporaneous
                    with that of the Bodleian at Oxford, and it is an interesting circumstance that,
                    when Chailoner and Usshcr (afterwards the archbishop) were in London purchasing
                    books to form the library, they met Bodley there, and entered into friendly
                    intercourse and co-operation with him to procure the choicest and best books.
                    The commission was given to Ussher and Challoner as trustees of the singular
                    donation which laid the foundation of the library. In the year 1601 the English
                    army determined to commemorate their victory over the Spanish troops at Kinsale
                    by some permanent monument. Accordingly they subscribed the sum of £1800 to
                    establish a library in the university of Dublin. For Ussher’s own collection,
                    consisting of 10,000 volumes and many valuable MSS., the college was also
                    indebted to military generosity. On his death in 1655 the officers and soldiers
                    of the English army then in Ireland purchased the whole collection for £22,000
                    with the design of presenting it to the college. Cromwell, however, interfered,
                    alleging that he proposed to found a new college, where the books might more
                    conveniently be preserved. They were deposited therefore in Dublin Castle, and
                    the college only obtained them after the Restoration. In 1674 Sir Jerome
                    Alexander left his law books with some valuable MSS. to the college. In 1726 Dr
                    Palliser, archbishop of Cashel, bequeathed over 4000 volumes to the library; and
                    ten years later Dr Gilbert gave the library nearly 13,000 volumes which he had
                    himself collected and arranged. In 1741 the library received a valuable
                    collection of MSS. as a bequest from Dr Stearne. In 1802 the collection formed
                    by the pensionary Fagel, which had been removed to England on the French
                    invasion of Holland, was acquired for £10,000. It consisted of over 20,000
                    volumes. In 1805 Mr Quin bequeathed a choice collection of classical and Italian
                    books. There have been many other smaller donations, in addition to which the
                    library is continually increased by the books received under the Copyright Act.
                    The library now contains 192,000 volumes and 1880 MSS., and about 3000 volumes
                    are added every year. There is no permanent endowment, and purchases are made by
                    grants from the board. The whole collections are contained in one building,
                    erected in 1732, consisting of eight rooms. The great library hall is a
                    magnificent apartment over 200 feet long. A new reading-room was opened in 1848.
                    A catalogue of the books acquired before 1872 is now in course of printing.
                    There is no printed catalogue of the MSS. Graduates of Dublin, Oxford, and
                    Cambridge are admitted to read permanently, and temporary admission is granted
                    by the board to any fit person who makes application. Books and MSS. are lent
                    out only under special regulations. A lending library has been established to
                    make provision for the needs of the students.</p>
                <p>The public library, St Patrick’s, Dublin, sometimes called Marsh’s Library after
                    its founder, was established about 1694 by Archbishop Marsh, was incorporated by
                    Act of Parliament in 1707, and endowed by its founder at his death in 1713. The
                    building was erected by the founder, and the original oak fittings still remain.
                    There is no room for additions, and a large collection of modern books was
                    refused a few years ago on that account. The endowment is too small to allow of
                    purchases from the funds of the library, so that it still retains the character
                    of a 17th century library. The books are chiefly theological, and in the learned
                    languages; they include the libraries of Bishop Stillingfleet and of Elias
                    Bouhereau, a French refugee, who was the first librarian.</p>
                <p>The library of the Royal Dublin Society was commenced shortly after thé formation
                    of the society in 1731. With the exception of about 10,000 volumes of the
                    publications of learned societies and scientific periodicals, with a few early
                    editions, its books were transferred to the state, in 1877, to assist in forming
                    the national library of Ireland. The manuscript collections of Walter Hanis on
                    Irish history were purchased and placed in the library for public use by the
                    Irish parliament. The library of the Royal Irish Academy was established on the
                    formation of the Academy in 1785, for the purpose of promoting the study of
                    science, literature, and antiquities in Ireland. The library possesses about
                    40,000 printed volumes and about 1400 MSS. There is a large collection of MSS.
                    and books relating to the history, ancient language, and antiquities of Ireland.
                    They include the Betham collection, acquired partly by public subscription in
                    1851. The library is pertly supported by a Government grant of £200 per annum,
                    and is freely open on a proper introduction. Under the direction of the present
                    honorary <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n543/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0543-0524"/> librarian, the publication of Irish MSS. in the
                    library was begun in 1870, and has since continued. The library of King’s Inns
                    was founded, pursuant to a bequest of books and legal MSS. under the will of Mr
                    Justice Robinson in 1787, to form the nucleus of a library for law students. It
                    is partly supported from the funds of the benchers, but partly also by a
                    treasury grant of £433,. 6s. 8d. in lieu of the copy privilege. No books are
                    lent out, and the use of the library is confined to students and barristers; so
                    that the public has no advantage in return, for the annual contribution of
                    public money.</p>
                <p>There is no library in Dublin corresponding in extent and public accessibility to
                    the British Museum in London, or the Advocates’ Library in Edinburgh. About 1850
                    it was proposed to supply the deficiency by combining the libraries of the
                    Dublin Society and the Irish Academy, both of which had long received grants of
                    public money, together with the collection of Archbishop Marsh. Accordingly in
                    1854 an Act of Parliament was passed “for the establishment of a national
                    gallery and for the care of a public library in Dublin.” The scheme thus
                    authorized has never been earned out. In 1877, however, the National Library of
                    Ireland was established in the apartments of Leinster House. The library is
                    under the Science and Art Department of South Kensington, and is superintended
                    by a body of twelve trustees in Dublin. For the last two years it has received
                    an annual vote of £1000 from parliament for the purchase of books. As already
                    mentioned, the books of the Royal Dublin Society have been transferred to it. It
                    is freely open to the public on a respectable introduction, and is much
                    used.</p>
                <p>The public library of Armagh was founded by Lord Primate Robinson in 1770, who
                    gave a considerable number of books and an endowment. The books are freely
                    available, either on the spot, or by loan on deposit of double the value of the
                    work applied for. At Belfast the Queen’s College Library has about 36,000
                    volumes, with a special collection of books on the languages and literatures of
                    the East. The library of the Queen’s College, Cork, contains about 25,000
                    volumes, 1600 of the most valuable of which have been presented by Mr Crawford.
                    The library is easily accessible to literary inquirers, and is much used by
                    strangers. The library of Maynootiι College is chiefly theological, and contains
                    the collections bequeathed by the late president, Monsignor Russell. There are
                    about 40,000 volumes and a few MSS.</p>
                <p>Dundalk is at present the only town that has a library under the Public Libraries
                    Acts, which were adopted there in 1856. The rate produces only about £80.</p>

                <p>French libraries (other than those in private nands) belong either to the state,
                    to the departments, to the communes, or to learned societies, educational
                    establishments, and other public institutions; the libraries of judicial or
                    administrative bodies are not considered to be owned by them, but to be state
                    property. Besides the unrivalled library accommodation of the capital, France
                    possesses a remarkable assemblage of provincial libraries. The communal and
                    school libraries also form striking features of the French free library
                    system.</p>

                    3,734,260 volumes and 44,436 MSS. In 1857 there were only 32 provincial
                    libraries which owned more than 30,000 volumes each; there are now 54 which are
                    of that extent and upwards.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Libraries of Paris.—</hi> The Bibliothèque Nationale (still the
                    most extensive library in the world) has had an advantage over all others in the
                    length of time during which its contents have been accumulating, and in the
                    great zeal shown for it by several kings and other eminent men. Enthusiastic
                    writers find the original of this library in the MS. collections of Charlemagne
                    and Charles the Bald, but these were dispersed in course of time, and the few
                    precious relics of them which the national library now possesses have been
                    acquired at a much later date. Of the library which St Louis formed in the 13th
                    century</p>
                <p>(in imitation of what he had seen in the East) nothing has fallen into the
                    possession of the Bibliothèque Nationale, but much has remained of the royal
                    collections made by kings of the later dynasties. The real foundation of the
                    institution (formerly known as the Bibliothèque du Roi) may be said to date from
                    the reign of King John, the Black Prince’s captive, who had a considerable taste
                    for books, and bequeathed his “royal library” of MSS. to his successor Charles
                    V. Charles V. organized his library in a very effective manner, removing it from
                    the Palais de la Cité to the Louvre, where it was arranged on desks in a large
                    hall of three stories, and placed under the management of the first librarian
                    and cataloguer, Claude Mallet, the king’s valet-de-chambre. His catalogue was a
                    mere shelf-list, entitled <hi rend="italic">Inventaire</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Livres du Roy nostre Seigneur estans</hi><hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">clιastel du Louvre</hi>; it is still extant, as well as the
                    further inventories made by Jean Blanchet in 1380, and by Jean le Bègue in 1411
                    and 1424. Charles V. was very liberal in his patronage of literature, and many
                    of the early monuments of the French language are due to his having employed
                    Nicholas Oresme, Raoul de Presle, and other scholars to make translations from
                    ancient texts. Charles VI. added some hundreds of MSS. to the royal library,
                    which, however, was sold to the regent, duke of Bedford, after a valuation had
                    been established by the inventory of 1424. The regent transferred it to England,
                    and it was finally dispersed at his death in 1435. Charles VII. and Louis XL did
                    little to repair the loss of the precious Louvre library, but the news of the
                    invention of printing served as a stimulus to the creation of another one, of
                    which the first librarian was Laurent Paulmier. The famous miniaturist Jean
                    Foucquet of Tours was named the king’s <hi rend="italic">enlumineur,</hi> and
                    although Louis XI. neglected to avail himself of many precious opportunities
                    that occurred in his reign, still the new library developed gradually with the
                    help of confiscation. Charles VIII. enriched it with many fine MSS. executed by
                    his order, and also with most of the books that had formed the library of the
                    kings of Aragon, seized by him at Naples. Louis XIL, oncoming to the throne,
                    incorporated the Bibliothèque du Roi with the fine Orleans library at Blois,
                    which he had inherited. The Blois library, thus augmented, and further enriched
                    by plunder from the palaces of Pavia, and by the purchase of the famous
                    Gruthuyse collection, was described at the time as one of the four marvels of
                    France. Francis I. removed it to Fontainebleau in 1534, enlarged by the addition
                    of his private library. He was the first to set the fashion of fine artistic
                    bindings, which was still more cultivated by Henry II., and which has never died
                    out in France. During the librarianship of Amyot (the translator of Plutarch)
                    the library was transferred from Fontainebleau to Paris, not without the loss of
                    several books coveted by powerful thieves. Henry IV. removed it to the Collége
                    de Clermont, but in 1604 another change was made, and in 1622 it was installed
                    in the Rue de la Harpe. Under the librarianship of J. A. de Thou it acquired the
                    library of Catherine de’ Medici, and the glorious Bible of Charles the Bald. In
                    1617 a decree was passed that two copies of every new publication should be
                    deposited in the library, but this was not rigidly enforced till Louis XIV.’s
                    time. The first catalogue worthy of the name was finished in 1622, and contains
                    a description of some 6000 volumes, chiefly MSS. Many additions were made during
                    Louis XIII.’s reign, notably that of the Dupuy collection, but a new era dawned
                    for the Bibliothèque du Roi under the patronage of Louis XIV. The enlightened
                    activity of Colbert, one of the greatest of collectors, so enriched the library
                    that it became necessary for want of space to make another removal. It was
                    therefore in 1666 installed in the Rue Vivien (now Vivienne) not far from its
                    present habitat.</p>

                <p>Th 3 departments of engravings and medals were now created, and before long rose
                    to nearly equal importance with that of books, Marolles’s prints, Foucquet’s
                    books, and many from the Mazarin library were added to the collection, and, in
                    short, the Bibliothèque du Roi had its future pre-eminence undoubtedly secured.
                    Nie. Clement made a catalogue in 1684 according to an arrangement which has been
                    followed ever since (that is, in twenty-three classes, each one designated by a
                    letter of the alphabet), with an alphabetical index to it. After Colbert’s death
                    Louvois emulated his predecessor’s labours, and employed Mabillon, Thevenot, and
                    others to procure fresh accessions from all parts of the world. A new catalogue
                    was compiled in 1688 in eight volumes by several distinguished scholars. The
                    Abbé Louvois, the minister’s son, became head of the’ library in 1691, and
                    opened it to all students —a privilege which although soon withdrawn was
                    afterwards restored. Towards the end of Louis XIV.’s * reign it contained over
                    70,000 volumes. Under the management of the Abbé Bignon numerous additions were
                    made in all departments, and the library was removed to its present home in the
                    Rue Richelieu. Among the more important acquisitions were 6000 MSS. from the
                    private library of the Colbert family, Bishop Huet’s forfeited collection, and a
                    large number of Oriental books imported by missionaries from the further East,
                    and by special agents from the Levant Between 1739 and 1753 a catalogue in
                    eleven volumes was printed, which enabled the administration to discover and to
                    sell its duplicates. In Louis XVL’s reign the sale of the La Vallière library
                    furnished a valuable increase both in MSS. and printed books. A few years before
                    the Revolution broke out the latter department contained over 300,000 volumes
                    and opuscules. The Revolution was serviceable to the library, now called the
                    Bibliothèque Nationale, by increasing it with the forfeited collections of the
                    <hi rend="italic">emigres,</hi> as well as of the suppressed religious
                    communities. In the midst of the difficulties of placing and cataloguing these
                    numerous acquisitions, the name of Van Praet appears as an administrator of the
                    first order. Napoleon increased the amount of the Government grant; and by the
                    strict enforcement of the law concerning new publications, as well as by the
                    acquisition of several special collections, the Bibliothèque made considerable
                    progress during his reign towards realizing his idea that it should be universal
                    in character. At the beginning of this century the recorded numbers were 250,000
                    printed volumes, 83,000 MSS., and 1,500,000 engravings. After Napoleon’s
                    downfall the MSS. which he had transferred from Berlin, Hanover, Florence,
                    Venice, Rome, the Hague, and other places had to be returned to their proper
                    owners. The MacCarthy sale in 1817 brought a rich store of MSS. and incunabula.
                    From that time onwards to the present, under the enlightened administration of
                    MM. Taschereau and Delisle, the accessions have been very extensive.</p>
                <p>The official estimate of the number of volumes in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Département des Imprimés</hi> now reaches the extraordinary total of about
                    2,290,000, but the contents have not been actually counted since 1791, and as
                    the above enumerates pieces of which many are included in one volume, perhaps
                    something like 1,827,000 is nearer the proper number. The annual additions are
                    about 45,000. The réserve (consisting of articles of the highest importance)
                    extends to more than 50,000 volumes. The collection of books on French history
                    is in itself an enormous library, amounting to 440,000 volumes. The maps and
                    charts, said to number 300,000, are included in this department. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Département</hi><hi rend="italic">des MSS.</hi> comprehended, in
                    1876, 91,700 volumes. The <hi rend="italic">Departement</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Médailles</hi> possessed, in 1873, 143,030 coins, medals, engraved stones,
                    &amp;c., and since that date has acquired many important accessions. More than
                    2,200,000 engravings are in the <hi rend="italic">Département des Estampes,</hi>
                    where 20,000 pieces are annually received under the copyright law. The annual

                <p>Admittance to the <hi rend="italic">Salle de Travail</hi> is obtained by a <hi

                    without difficulty. This, the reading-room for students, was built in 1868, and
                    affords accommodation for 344 readers. There are but few books of reference, and
                    readers are only allowed five books a day. The <hi rend="italic">Salle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">publique</hi> contains 40,000 books, which are freely available to
                    the public. Plans are now under consideration for an enlargement of the
                    Bibliothèque, and a sum of 3,700,000 francs is to be devoted to that
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The Bibliothèque Nationale does not possess a general catalogue at the disposal
                    of readers; the MS. catalogues of the various classes of the printed books are
                    for official use only. Besides the old catalogue of 1739-53, there is the very
                    elaborate <hi rend="italic">Catalogue de l'</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de France</hi> (1855-79, 11 vols. 4to), with a
                    lithographed supplement; the indexes will appear shortly. The third volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue des Sciences</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Médicales</hi> is now in the press, and that devoted to English history is
                    nearly finished in manuscript. The vellum books have been described by Van Praet
                    (1822-23, 6 vols. 8vo, and supplement, 1877). The MSS. are much better provided
                    for. The printed catalogues of these commence with that of Anicet Melot,
                    1739-44, 4 vols, folio, continued in a way by the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Paris is much better provided than London or any other city in the world with
                    great public libraries. Besides the Bibliothèque Nationale there are four
                    libraries, each over 120,000 volumes (with others less extensive), to which the
                    public have free access, the Bibliothèque de ΓArsenal being the largest of them.
                    The collection of the Marquis de Paulmy d’Argenson was the basis of this
                    library, which also acquired a portion of the books of the Duc de la Vallière in
                    1781. It is peculiarly rich in romances, the drama, and French poetry, and
                    possesses 80,000 volumes on French history alone. It is freely open, but there
                    are not many readers.—The Bibliothèque Mazarine was founded by the great
                    cardinal, who in 1643 placed about 12,000 volumes at the disposal of the public.
                    The books were chiefly brought together through the exertions of Gabriel Naudé,
                    who tells us that in 1648 they amounted to 40,000 volumes. After the death of
                    Mazarin, his magnificent library was bequeathed to the college bearing his name;
                    it remained under the direction of the Sorbonne from 1688 to 1791, since which
                    time it has been subject to the control of the state. It is rich in incunabula
                    and theology, including the works of Protestant di≠ines, and is annually visited
                    by over 12,000 readers.—The Bibliothèque Sainte Geneviève was founded in 1624,
                    at the abbey of that name, by Cardinal François de la Rochefoucauld. Other
                    persons also gave books, and in 1687 the library is said to have contained
                    20,000 printed volumes and 400 MSS. In 1710 C. Μ. Le Tellier bequeathed his
                    collection, and in the <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Royal</hi> of the same year an announcement appeared that the library would be
                    open to students during certain hours every day. Louis, Due d’Orléans, the son
                    of the Regent, took up his abode here, and in 1730 the library was considerably
                    enlarged by him. It was opened to the public in 1790, and at the time of the
                    Revolution there were 80,000 printed volumes and 2000 MSS.; there are now
                    120,000 volumes and 2392 MSS. The reading-room is open in the evening, and is
                    much frequented, especially by students. The library contains a good collection
                    of incunabula, many of which have been described by Dibdin, a number of rare
                    Italian and Spanish chronicles, and a very complete series of periodicals from
                    the 17th century to the empire.—The Bibliothèque de ΓUniversite (or the
                    Sorbonne) was formerly restricted to the use of the members of the five
                    faculties of Paris, but the public has been freely admitted during the last
                    thirty years.—The Bibliothèque de ΓInstitut having been plundered during the
                    Revolution, the old town library was transferred to it. Persons not members are
                    admitted upon the recommendation (which lasts twelve months) of any
                    academician.—The Bibliothèque de la Ville, founded in the 18th century, and
                    reorganized at the time of the Revolution, was destroyed in 1871. It has since
                    been entirely re-established in the Hôtel Carnavalet, which contains the
                    historical museum of the city, and comprehends 60,000 volumes of books and
                    40,000 engravings, entirely relating to the history and description of Paris.
                    The other public libraries are under the authority of the minister of public
                    instruction, but the Bibliothèque de la Ville is under the control of the
                    prefect of the Seine. The municipal libraries in Paris are 20 innumber, with
                    70,000 volumes; there are besides 440 school libraries, with 44,120 books.</p>

                <p>Besides the various collections belonging to learned and scientific societies,
                    educational institutions, and other bodies, outside Paris, over 215 French
                    provincial towns possess public libraries, which range in number of volumes from
                    2000 or 3000 to 190,000, as at Bordeaux. Most of them were founded at the end of
                    the last or the beginning of the present century, but some are earlier. The
                    library at Lyons was established by Francis I. in 1530, that at Nantes dates
                    from 1588, La Rochelle from 1604, Abbeville, Besançon, and Troyes from the
                    latter part of the same century, and Orléans from the beginning of the 17th
                    century. The large majority were formed by confiscation at the time of the
                    Revolution. In February 1790 the Assemblée Nationale abolished the different
                    religious communities, and in September of the same year the provincial
                    tribunals and parliaments met with the same fate. The books (said to number 10
                    or 12 millions) of these corporations were declared national property, a
                    committee was appointed to consider what should be done with them, and a general
                    catalogue of all the sequestered effects ordered to be drawn up. In consequence
                    of the recommendations of the committee, the Convention Nationale (January 27,
                    1794) decreed the establishment and augmentation of public libraries. The orders
                    of the Convention were not carefully executed, and i&gt;itiable stories are told
                    of valuable works sold by the yard as they ay upon the ground, of precious
                    manuscripts and printed,rarities left to rot in the open air or burnt for fuel.
                    As the government became more settled, the libraries (when not destroyed) of
                    condemned persons were restored to their representatives. A very large number of
                    books still remained, however, and it is to them that the town libraries of
                    France chiefly owe their riches. Theology, law, history, and the severer
                    literature of the 17th and 18th centuries consequently predominate, although for
                    many years more modern requirements have been mainly considered in the
                    acquisition of books. Many collections of local and provincial literature have
                    been formed, as at Angers, Auxerre, Chaumont, Grenoble, La Rochelle, Lille,
                    Marseilles, Orléans, Toulouse, Tours, and Versailles. Some of the libraries are
                    very extensive. Douai and Troyes have 100,000 volumes each; Lyons and Rouen over
                    120,000; Besançon, 130,000; Aix and Nantes, 150,000; Grenoble, 170,000; and
                    Bordeaux, 190,000 volumes. All have catalogues, mostly alphabetical; a few of
                    them are in print. The <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >général</hi><hi rend="italic">des ΛfSS. des</hi><hi rend="italic">bibliothèques
                    publiques des départements</hi> is a noble undertaking on the part of the French
                    Government. The first volume came out in 1849, and the latest, the sixth, in
                    1879; the treasures of eighteen libraries have now been catalogued (about 9650
                    MSS. ), and there remain over 45,000 MSS. to be described. Besides this, Angers,
                    Amiens, Auxerre, Caen, Carpentras, Chartres, Orléans, and Tours possess separate
                    printed catalogues of their MSS. The chambers annually vote large sums for
                    books, which are distributed to the town libraries by the minister of public
                    instruction. The sums granted by the different municipalities for their
                    libraries vary in amount; for instance, Grenoble (170,000 volumes and eight
                    persons employed) gives 26,314 francs, Bordeaux (190,000 volumes and eight
                    persons) 21,350 francs, and Nantes (150,000 volumes and four persons) 13,600
                    francs.</p>
                <p>Popular libraries of every description, including military and workmen’s
                    libraries, owe much to the “Société Franklin pour la propagation des
                    bibliothèques populaires,” which, founded in 1862, has since been of immense
                    service in originating and helping those institutions. Between 1868 and 1878 the
                    Société had spent 550,000 francs on these purposes. It issues a <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic">Populaire</hi> of a good selection
                    of recommended books, and publishes ajournai of its proceedings.</p>
                <p>School libraries had an organized existence in France as far back as 1831, and by
                    1848 the books which had been distributed by the state amounted in value to 2
                    millions of francs; two years later, however, no trace of books or libraries
                    could be found.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See De
                    Watteville, <hi rend="italic">Rapport</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les
                    Bibliothèques scolaires,</hi> 1879.</p></note> In I860 the question was again
                    taken up, and in 1862 the minister of public instruction ordered that in every
                    primary school a library should be established under the care of the
                    schoolmaster. For some years the Government annually granted 120,000 francs, a
                    sum which was raised to 200,000 francs in 1878; for their share of the expenses
                    the departments contributed in 1875 as much as 170,000 francs. As an instance of
                    the rapidity with which the school libraries have increased, it may be stated
                    that Haute-Marne, which only possessed 44 of them in 1866, ten years later had
                    548; in 1877 there were about 17,764 <hi rend="italic">bibliothèques
                    scolaires</hi> possessing 1,716,904 works, and there are now over 20,000 of them
                    in France. The libraries, which are intended not only for the use of school
                    children but also for their parents and other adults, are regulated by a
                    commission sitting at the ministry of public instruction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Germany (with Austria and Switzerland).</hi></p>
                <p>Germany is emphatically the home of large libraries; her want of political unity
                    and consequent multiplicity of capitals have had the effect of giving her a
                    considerable number of large state libraries, and the number of her universities
                    has tended to multiply considerable collections.</p>
                <p>Berlin is well supplied with libraries, seventy-two being registered by Petzholdt
                    in 1875, with about 1,293,030 printed volumes. The largest of them is the Royal
                    Library, which was founded by the “Great Elector” Frederick William, and opened
                    as a public library in a wing of the electoral palace in 1661. From 1699 the
                    library became entitled to a copy of every book published within the royal
                    territories, and it has received many valuable accessions by purchase and
                    otherwise. It is now estimated to contain upwards of 700,000 printed volumes and
                    over 15,000 MSS. The amount yearly expended upon binding and the acquisition of
                    books, &lt;fcc,, is £4800. The catalogues are in manuscript, and include a
                    general alphabetical author-catalogue, and a systematic subjectcatalogue in a
                    handy form. The building, erected about 1780 by Frederick the Great, has long
                    been too small, and a new one is in contemplation. The conditions as to the use
                    of the collections are, as in most German libraries, very liberal. Any adult
                    person is allowed to have books in the reading-room. Books are lent out to all
                    higher officials, including those holding educational offices in the university,
                    &amp;c., and by guarantee to almost any one recommended by persons of standing;
                    admission to the journalroom is more strictly limited. By special leave of the
                    librarian, books and MSS. may be sent to a scholar at a distance, or, if
                    especially valuable, may be deposited in some public library where he can
                    conveniently use them. There appears to be no limit to the number of books which
                    may be borrowed, although it is prescribed that not more than “three works” must
                    be asked for on one day. Professor Lepsius reports the issues for last year as
                    71,400 works, to above 5000 readers. The University Library (1831) numbers
                    200,000 volumes with 353 MSS. The number of volumes lent out in 1880 was 40,101.
                    The library possesβes the right to receive a copy of every work published in the
                    province of Brandenburg. Some of the governmental libraries are important,
                    especially those of the Military Academy and the General Staff, which was
                    increased in 1872 by acquiring the library of the “École d’Application” at Metz.
                    In 1850 some popular libraries were established by a society for giving
                    scientific lectures. There are now thirteen such libraries with over 54,000
                    volumes, but the yearly number of readers is only about 12,000.</p>
                <p>The libraries of Munich, though not so numerous as those of Berlin, include two
                    of great importance. The Royal Library, the largest collection of books in
                    Germany, was founded by Duke Albrecht V. of Bavaria (1550-79), who made numerous
                    purchases from Italy, and incorporated the libraries of the Nuremberg physician
                    and historian Schedel, of Widmannstadt, and of J. J. Fugger. The number of
                    printed volumes is estimated at about one million, although it is long since any
                    exact enumeration has been made. The library is especially rich in incunabula,
                    many of them . being derived from the libraries of the monasteries closed in
                    1803. The Oriental MSS. are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n546/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0546-0527"/> numerous and valuable, and include the library of
                    Martin Haug. The amount annually spent upon the library is .£5400, of which
                    £2050 is expended upon books and binding. The catalogues of the printed books
                    are in manuscript, and include (1) a general alphabetical catalogue, (2) an
                    alphabetical repertorium of each of the 195 subdivisions of the library, (3)
                    biographical and other subject catalogues. A printed catalogue of the MSS. in 8
                    volumes is nearly complete; the first was published in 1858. The library is open
                    only twenty-nine hours during the week, while the Royal Library at Berlin is,
                    except in the three winter months, open for thirty-nine. The library of the
                    British Museum is now open for sixty-six hours per week, but it lends no books
                    out. The regulations for the use of the library are very similar to those of the
                    Royal Library at Berlin. The building erected for this collection under King
                    Louis I. in 1832-43 is regarded as a model library structure. The archives are
                    bestowed on the ground floor, and the two upper floors are devoted to the
                    library, which occupies seventy-seven apartments.— The University Library was
                    originally founded at Ingolstadt in 1472, and removed with the university to
                    Munich in 1826. It participated in 1803 in the division of the literary
                    treasures of the disestablished monasteries. At present the number of volumes in
                    the general library amounts to 290,000, besides which several special
                    collections are also deposited in the library to the number of 32,800 volumes.
                    The MSS. number 1744. The various libraries of Munich have upwards of 1,400,000
                    volumes.</p>
                <p>Dr Petzholdt has registered no less than 49 libraries in Dresden, where indeed
                    his inquiries were likely to be particularly exhaustive. The Royal Public
                    Library in the Japanese Palace was founded in the 16th century. Among its
                    numerous acquisitions have been the library of Count Biinau in 1764, and the
                    manuscripts of Ebert. Special attention is devoted to history and literature.
                    The library does not claim to possess more than 350,000 volumes, although
                    Petzholdt in 1875 reckoned them as at least 500,000 printed books, as well as
                    400,000 dissertations. The MSS. number 6500 volumes. Admission to the
                    reading-room is granted to any respectable adult on giving his name, and books
                    are lent out to persons qualified by their position or by a suitable guarantee.
                    Here, as at other large libraries in Germany, works of belles-lettres are only
                    supplied for a literary purpose. The number of persons using the reading-room in
                    a year is about 3900, and about 10,000 works (not volumes) are lent to about 500
                    readers.—The “Prinzliche Secundo-Genitur” Library, now in the possession of
                    Prince George of Saxony, and of which Dr Petzholdt, the Nestor of
                    bibliographers, is librarian, is a private library to which access is

                <p>The Royal Public Library of Stuttgart, although only established in 1765, has
                    grown so rapidly that it now possesses about 425,000 “numbers” of printed works
                    and 3800 MSS. There is a famous collection of Bibles, containing 7200 volumes.
                    The annual expenditure is about £2640, of which £1250 is devoted to books and
                    binding. The library also enjoys the copy-privilege in Wiirtemberg. “The
                    borrowing of books for home use is open to all members of the German empire
                    resident in Stuttgart, whose personal and economic circumstances offer the
                    necessary guarantees for the safety of the national property. The library may,
                    moreover, be used from any part of Wiirtemberg on payment of the cost of
                    carriage.” The annual number of borrowers is over 1800, who use nearly 17,000
                    volumes. The number issued in the reading-room is at least twice as great.. The
                    number of parcels despatched from Stuttgart is nearly 900.—Admission is also
                    gladly granted to the Royal Private Library, founded in 1810, which contains
                    about 50,000 volumes and 600 MSS. The other libraries of Stuttgart, of which
                    Petzholdt reckons 11, are not of importance.—The Grand-ducal Library of
                    Darmstadt was established by the grand-duke Louis I. in 1817, on the basis of
                    the still older library formed in the 17th century. The number of volumes used
                    in the course of the year is about 30,000, of which 9000 are lent out to about
                    5000 readers.— The Ducal Library of Gotha was established by Duke Ernest the
                    Pious in the 17th century, and contains many valuable books and MSS. from
                    monastic collections. It numbers about 240,000 works, with upwards of 6000 MSS.
                    The catalogue, now in course of publication, of the Oriental MSS., chiefly
                    collected by Seetzen, and forming one-half of the collection, is one of the best
                    in existence. Other great Ducal Libraries are noticed in the tables.</p>
                <p>Libraries of varying extent and importance are attached to all the twenty-one
                    universities of Germany, most of them being coeval with the universities
                    themselves. Thus the oldest library is that of Heidelberg, which in its earlier
                    form dates from 1386. In 1608 it had become so important that Joseph ßcaliger
                    wrote of it “Locupletior est et meliorum librorum quam Vaticana.” In 1623 the
                    library was carried to Rome as a present to the pope, but some of the treasures
                    were ultimately restored. The later collection was first formed in 1703. The
                    collection of MSS. is extremely valuable. —The library of Leipsic university
                    dates from 1409, although it was not until the middle of the 16th century that
                    it was properly organized.—The library of Gottingen owes much to the labours of
                    the illustrious Heyne. It ranks as one of the most complete and best arranged of
                    the German libraries. New buildings for its accommodation are in course of
                    erection.—The library at Strasburg, although founded only in 1871 to replace
                    that which had been destroyed in the siege, already ranks amongst the largest
                    libraries of the empire. Its books and MSS. together amount to 513,000. The
                    remaining university libraries are noticed in the tables.</p>
                <p>Some of the town libraries of Germany mentioned in the tables were amongst the
                    earliest established after the revival of learning. The oldest of them is
                    perhaps that of Ratisbon, which was founded at least as early as 1430. Since
                    Ratisbon has ceased to be an imperial city it has had to part with many of its
                    treasures to the library at Munich.</p>
                <p>The whole number of libraries in the German empire enumerated by Dr Petzholdt is
                    1547, distributed amongst 584 towns.</p>
                <p>A report issued in 1873-74 by the Austrian Statistical Commission, furnishes an
                    account of the condition of the libraries in those portions of Austria which are
                    represented in the Reichsrath, as they were at the end of the year 1870. The
                    number of libraries registered was 577, of which 23, however, were private
                    libraries. Of the rest 159 belonged to religious corporations and seminaries,
                    105 were military libraries, 56 belonged to literary and scientific societies,
                    189 were of an educational and scholastic, and the remaining 45 of a public
                    character.</p>
                <p>The largest library in Austria, and one of the most important collections in
                    Europe, is the Imperial Public Library at Vienna, apparently founded by the
                    emperor Frederick III. in 1440, although its illustrious librarian Lambecius, in
                    the well-known inscription over the entrance to the library which summarizes its
                    history, attributes this honour to Frederick’s son Maximilian. However this may
                    be, the munificence of succeeding emperors greatly added to the wealth of the
                    collection, including a not inconsiderable portion of the dispersed library of
                    Corvinus. Since 1808 the library has also been entitled to the copy privilege in
                    respect of all books published in the empire. The sum devoted to the purchase of
                    books is 26,250 florins annually. The main library apartment is one of the most
                    splendid halls in Europe. Admission to the reading-room is free to everybody,
                    and books are also lent out under stricter limitations.—The University Library
                    of Vienna was established by Maria Theresa. The reading-room is open to all
                    comers, and the library is open much longer than is the rule with university
                    libraries generally. In winter, for instance, it is open frpm 5 to 8 in the
                    evening, and it is even open from 9 to 12 on Sundays. In 1879, 159,768 volumes
                    were used in the library, 16,300 volumes lent out in Vienna, and 4418 volumes
                    sent carriage free to borrowers outside Vienna. The total number of libraries in
                    Vienna enumerated by Dr Petzholdt is 101, and many of them are of considerable
                    extent.</p>
                <p>The number of monastic libraries in Austria is very considerable. Particulars are
                    furnished, in the report already quoted, of 107 of them, varying from a few
                    hundreds of volumes to as many as 80,000. Many other such libraries are known to
                    exist in the 463 monasteries. The oldest of them, and the oldest library in
                    Austria, is that of the monastery of St Peter at Salzburg, which was established
                    by St Rupert in the 6th century. It possesses 60,000 volumes, with nearly 20,000
                    incunabula. The four next in point of antiquity are Kremsmiinster (50,000),
                    Lambach (22,000), Admont (80,000), and Melk (60,000), all of them dating from
                    the 11th century. Of the 107 libraries enumerated in the report, 56 possessed
                    5000 volumes or upwards at the end of 1870. For further particulars as to the
                    larger Austrian libraries the reader is referred to the tables.</p>

                    not very numerous. The most important of them are at Buda-Pest.</p>
                <p>The public libraries of Switzerland have been very carefully registered by Dr
                    Ernest Heitz, as they existed in 1868. Altogether no less than 2096 libraries
                    are recorded, four-fifths of these belong to the class of “bibliothèques
                    populaires et celles pour la jeunesse,” and few are of literary importance. Only
                    eighteen have as many as 30,000 volumes. The largest collection of books in
                    Switzerland is the University Library of Basel, founded with the university in
                    1460. The monastic libraries of St Gall and Einsiedeln date respectively from
                    the years 830 and 946, and are of great historical and literary interest.</p>

                <p>As the former centre of civilization, Italy is of course the country in which the
                    oldest existing libraries must be looked for, and in which the rarest and most
                    valuable MSS. are preserved. The Vatican at Rome and the Laurentian Library at
                    Florence are sufficient in themselves to entitle Italy to rank before most other
                    states in that respect, and the venerable relics at Vercelli, Milan, and La Cava
                    bear witness to the enlightenment of the peninsula in times when other nations
                    were slowly taking their places in the circle of Christian polity. The local
                    rights and interests which so long helped to impede the unification of Italy
                    were useful in creating and preserving at numerous minor centres many libraries
                    which otherwise would probably have been lost during the progress of absorption
                    that results from such centralization as exists in England. In spite of long
                    centuries of suffering and of the aggression of foreign swords and foreign gold,
                    Italy is still rich in books and MSS.; there are probably more books in united
                    Italy than in any other country except France. When the Italian Government
                    published its valuable report on “Biblioteche” in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Statistica del Reyno dlItalia</hi> in 1865, a table of relative statistics was
                    given, which professed to show that, while the number of books in Austria
                    (2,408,000) was greater than the total contents of the public libraries in any
                    one of the countries of Great Britain, Prussia, Bavaria, or Russia, it was
                    surpassed in France (4,389,000) and in Italy (4,149,281), the latter country
                    thus exhibiting a greater proportion of books to inhabitants than any other
                    state in Europe, except only Bavaria. The opulent libraries of Rome and Venice
                    had not yet become Italian, and were not included in the report.<note

                    the authority of the minister of public instruction, and are subject to certain

                    1876.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the

                    under the headings of (1) national libraries of Florence, Naples, Turin,
                    Palermo, Vittorio Emanuele of Rome, the Brera of Milan, and the Marciana of
                    Venice;</p>
                <p>(2) the libraries of the universities of the first class— Bologna, Naples, Padua,
                    Pavia, Pisa, and Rome; (3) those of the universities of the second
                    class—Cagliari, Catania, Genoa, Messina, Modena, Parma, and Sassari; (4) those
                    of academies and institutions of fine arts; the last, although under Government
                    control, are ruled by special regulations of their own. Small collections are
                    sometimes handed over to the local authorities, should this be considered
                    desirable, and the state will take into its own hands the administration of
                    provincial or communal libraries if necessary. The librarians and subordinates
                    are divided into (1) prefects, librarians, and sublibrarians; (2) assistant
                    librarians;</p>
                <p>(3) attendants, or book distributors; (4) ushers, &amp;c. Those of class 1
                    constitute the “board of direction,” which is presided over by the prefect or
                    librarian, and meets from time to time to consider important measures connected
                    with the administration of the library. The candidates for posts in classes 1
                    and 2 must possess certain scholastic qualifications and serve for a specified
                    time as <hi rend="italic">alumni</hi> on probation. An important feature of the
                    regulations consists of the scheme (unfortunately not yet in working order)
                    which is eventually to supply Italy with a body of young librarians properly
                    trained in all the theoretical and technical branches of their profession. Each
                    library is to possess, alike for books and MSS., a general inventory or
                    accessions-catalogue, an alphabetical author-catalogue, and a subjectcatalogue.
                    When they are ready, catalogues of the special collections are to be compiled,
                    and these the Government intends to print, together with the subject-catalogues
                    of the MSS. Various other small registers are provided for. The sums granted by
                    the state for library purposes must be applied to (1) salaries and maintenance;
                    (2) binding and repairs; (3) purchase of books, MSS., &amp;c. Books are chosen
                    by a committee nominated by the minister, which, in the national libraries,
                    includes the members of the council of direction. In other libraries two members
                    only of the council form part of the committee. In the university libraries
                    two-fifths of the expenditure is decided by the committee, and the remainder by
                    a council formed by the professors of the different faculties. The rules for
                    lending books and MSS. allow them to be sent to other countries under very
                    special circumstances.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">biblioteche governαtive</hi> are now 32 in number, and

                    copyright, and purchases, their accessions in 1879 were 35,541, being 5187 more
                    than the previous year. The number of readers is now gradually increasing. In
                    1879 there were 895,749, who made use of 1,154,853 volumes, showing an increase
                    of 10,393 readers and 130,051 books as contrasted with the statistics of the
                    previous year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lists of

                    specimen of <hi rend="italic">Boccaccio.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>The minister of public instruction has kept a watchful eye upon the literary
                    treasures of the suppressed monastic bodies. In 1875 there were 1700 of these
                    confiscated libraries, containing two millions and a half of volumes. About 650
                    of the collections were added to the contents of the public libraries already in
                    existence; the remaining 1050 were handed over to the different local
                    authorities, and served to form 371 new communal libraries, and in 1876 the
                    number of new libraries so composed was 415.</p>
                <p>The Biblioteca Vaticana stands in the very first rank among European libraries as
                    regards antiquity, since from the middle of the 5th century we have evidence of
                    the existence of a pontifical library at Rome; and Pope Zachary (d. 752),
                    himself a Greek, is known to have added considerably to the store of Greek
                    codices. The Lateran Library shared in the removal of the papal court to
                    Avignon, and it was on the return of the popes to Rome that the collection was
                    permanently fixed at the Vatican. Nicholas V. (d. 1455) may, however, be
                    considered the true founder of the library, and is said to have added 5000 MSS.
                    to the original store. Calixtus III. also enriched the library with many volumes
                    saved from the hands of the Turks after the siege of Constantinople. So large a
                    proportion of the printed books of the 15th century having been produced by the
                    Italian presses, it is natural to expect that a great number of specimens may be
                    found in the papal library, and, but for the wholesale destruction of books and
                    MSS. during the sack of Rome by the duke of Bourbon in 1527, the <pb break="no"

                    printed literature as it is now rich in manuscripts. Sixtus V. erected the
                    present building in 1588, and considerably augmented the collection. Gregory XV.
                    received as a gift from Maximilian, duke of Bavaria, the library of the elector
                    Palatine seized by Tilly at the capture of Heidelberg in 1622. The greater part
                    of the library at Urbino, founded by Duke Federigo, was acquired in 1655 by
                    Alexander VII. for the sum of 10,000 scudi, and some of the famous palimpsests
                    from the Benedictine monastery of Bobbio were also added to the treasures of the
                    Vatican. After the death of Christina, queen of Sweden, her collection of books
                    and manuscripts, formed from the plunder seized at Prague, Wiirtzburg, and
                    Bremen by her father Gustavus Adolphus, became by succession the property of the
                    Ottoboni family, the head of which, Alexander VIII., in 1689 placed 1900 of the
                    MSS. in one of the galleries. Clement VII. and Pius II. also enriched the
                    Vatican with valuable manuscripts, including many Oriental. In 1740 Benedict
                    XIV. united with it the Ottoboniana, and in the same pontificate the Marchese
                    Aless. Capponi bequeathed his precious collections. Clement XIII. in 1758,
                    Clement XIV. in 1769, and Pius VI. in 1775 were also important benefactors. For
                    over two hundred years the history of the Vatican was one of unbroken
                    prosperity, but it suffered a serious blow at the close of the 18th century,
                    when MSS. dating before the 9th century, and the most choice artistic specimens,
                    altogether to the number of 500, were carried off by the French to Paris in
                    1798. The greater part were, however, restored in 1815, and most of the Palatine
                    MSS., which formed part of the plunder, ultimately found their way to the
                    university of Heidelberg in 1816. Pius VII. acquired for the Vatican the library
                    of Cardinal Zelada in 1800; Leo XII. was able to add the noble collection of
                    fine art literature of Count Cicognara in 1823; and Gregory XVI. also largely
                    augmented the library. Pius IX. in 1856 added 40,000 volumes belonging to
                    Cardinal Mai.</p>
                <p>Few libraries are so magnificently housed as the Biblioteca Vaticana. The famous
                    <hi rend="italic">Codici Vaticani</hi> are placed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >salone</hi> or great double hall, which is decorated with frescos depicting
                    ancient libraries and councils of the church. At the end of the great hall an
                    immense gallery, also richly decorated, and extending to 1200 feet, opens out
                    from right to left. Here are preserved in different rooms the codici Palatini,
                    Regin., Ottoboniani, Capponiani, &amp;c. Most of the printed books are contained
                    in a series of six chambers known as the <hi rend="italic">Appartamento
                    Borgia.</hi> The printed books only are on open shelves, the MSS. being
                    preserved in closed cases.</p>
                <p>The present official estimate of the number of printed volumes is about 220,000,
                    including 2500 15th century editions, of which many are vellum copies, 500
                    Aldines, and a great number of bibliographical rarities.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The books have never been actually counted,
                    and this estimate has been reduced by some persons to half the
                    number.</p></note> There are 25,600 MSS., of which 19,641 are Latin, 3613 Greek,
                    609 Hebrew, 900 Arabic, 460 Syriac, 78 Coptic, &amp;c. Among the Greek and Latin
                    MSS. are some of the most valuable in the world, alike for antiquity and
                    intrinsic importance. It is sufficient to mention the famous Biblical <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Vaticanus</hi> of the 4th century, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Virgil</hi> of the 4th or 5th century, the <hi rend="italic"

                    Cardinal Mai, and an immense number of richly ornamented codices of
                    extraordinary beauty and costliness. The archives are apart from the library,
                    and are quite inaccessible to the public; no catalogue is known to exist. Leo
                    XII. has appointed a committee to consider what documents of general interest
                    may expediently be published, and a greater liberality in the use of them is
                    said to be contemplated.</p>
                <p>The Biblioteca Vaticana is now open from 8 to 12 every morning between November
                    and June, with the exception of Sundays, Thursdays, and the principal feast
                    days. Permission to study is obtained from the cardinal secretary of state. The
                    want of proper catalogues for the use of readers is a great drawback. There are
                    imperfect written lists (for the use of the librarians alone) of the printed
                    books, and various catalogues of special classes of the MSS. have been
                    published. New catalogues, however, are in course of preparation. The Oriental
                    MSS. have been described by J. S. Assemanni, <hi rend="italic"

                    printed catalogues of the Capponi (1747) and the Cicognara (1820) libraries.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the Vatican library is the Casanatense, so called from the
                    name of its founder, Cardinal Casanata (1700). It contains about 130,000 volumes
                    of printed books, including a large number of 15th century impressions and early
                    editions with woodcuts, as well as about 2500 MSS., amongst which are one of the
                    7th century and several of the 8th, 9th, and 10th centuries. They are carefully
                    arranged in eleven rooms, the large central hall being one of the finest in
                    Rome. Books are not allowed to be taken out of the reading-rooms, but admission
                    is freely granted, and the annual number of readers is about 18,000. The
                    subvention is a small one, but additions continue to be made, and the library is
                    well administered. All the officials, in accordance with the founder’s will,
                    belong to the Dominican order. The incomplete catalogue of the printed books,
                    prepared by A. Audiffredi (Rome, 1761-88, 4 vols, folio), still remains a model
                    of cataloguing.—The Biblioteca Vittorio Emanuele forms part of the Collegio
                    Romano, and was made up from the old Jesuit library, enriched by accessions from
                    a number of other suppressed institutions. It now consists of 360,000 volumes,
                    with 5000 MSS., and is united to the Casanatense by a bridge. The entire edifice
                    is spacious enough to contain a million of volumes, besides the Kircherian and
                    other museums which are already located in it.<note anchored="true"

                    the Congregatio de Auxiliis, and the precious collections of Cardinal Passionei
                    and Lucas Holstenius.— The Biblioteca Alessandrina della R. Università di Roma,
                    founded by Alexander VII., is considerably used by students: there were in 1879
                    57,000 readers. The greater part of the printed books formerly in the collection
                    of the dukes of Urbino is now in this library.<note anchored="true"

                    rich in collections of municipal history and statutes of Italian cities. The
                    printed catalogue (1878) describes no less than 1067 statutes or volumes
                    containing them, relating to 443 localities.—The Biblioteca Vallicelliana was
                    founded by S. Filippo Neri, and contains some valuable manuscripts, including a
                    Latin Bible of the 8th century attributed to Alcuin, and some inedited writings
                    of Baronius.—In 1877 Professor A. Sarti presented to the city of Rome his
                    collection of fine-art books, 10,000 volumes, which was placed in charge of the
                    Accademia di San Luca, which already possessed a good artistic library.—Of
                    private libraries accessible by permission, we note the Biblioteca Barberina,
                    including many rare editions with valuable autographs, but especially remarkable
                    for its MSS.; these were chiefly collected by Cardinal Fr. Barberini, the nephew
                    of Urban VIII., and comprehend the letters and papers of Galileo, Bembo, and
                    Bellarmine, the reports on the state of Catholicism in England in the time of
                    Charles I., and a quantity of inedited materials for the history of the Stuarts.
                    A catalogue was published at Rome in 1681, 3 vols, folio.—The Corsiniana,
                    founded by Clement XII. (Lorenzo Corsini), is also a private library; it is rich
                    in incunabula, and includes one of the most remarkable collections of prints in
                    Italy, the series of Marc-Antonios being especially complete.—The library of the
                    Collegium de Propaganda Fide was established by Urban VIII. in 1626, and in 1687
                    the rector Andrea Bonviciui obtained permission to preserve in it prohibited

                    its present richness almost entirely to testamentary gifts, among which may be
                    mentioned those of Cardinals Borgia, Caleppi, and Pietro. It is a private,
                    collection for the use of the congregation and of those who belong to it, but
                    permission may be obtained from the superiors. There are at least thirty
                    libraries in Rome which are more or less accessible to the public. One is now in
                    course of formation which will include everything relating to the emancipation
                    of Italy.</p>
                <p>At Subiaco, a few miles from Rome, the library of the Benedictine monastery of
                    Santa Scolastica is not a very large one, comprising only 6000 printed volumes
                    and 400 MSS., but the place is remarkable as having been the first seat of
                    typography in Italy. It was in this monastery that Schweynheim and Pannartz,
                    fresh from the dispersion of Fust and Schoeffer’s workmen in 1462, established
                    their press and produced a series of very rare and important works which are
                    highly prized throughout Europe. The Subiaco Library, although open daily to
                    readers, is only visited by students who are curious to behold the cradle of the
                    press in Italy, and to inspect the series of original editions preserved in
                    their first home</p>
                <p>The great national libraries are as follows :—</p>
                <p>The Biblioteca Nazionale of Florence, formed from the union of Magliabechi’s
                    library with the Palatina, is the largest in Italy. The Magliabechi collection
                    became public property at his death in 1714, and, with the accessions made from
                    time to time, held an independent place until 1862, when the Biblioteca Palatina
                    (formed in 1815 from the old Pitti Library and the collections of Poggiali and
                    Rzewuzky) was incorporated with it. An old statute by which a copy of every work
                    printed in Tuscany was to be presented to the Magliabechi Library was formerly
                    much neglected, but has been maintained rigorously in force since 1860. There
                    are many valuable autograph originals of famous works in this library, and the
                    MSS. include the most important extant <hi rend="italic">codici</hi> of Dante
                    and later poets, as well as of the historians from Villani to Machiavelli and
                    Guicciardini. Amongst the printed books is a very large assemblage of rare early
                    impressions, a great number of the <hi rend="italic">Rappresentazioni</hi> of
                    the 16th century, at least 200 booksj&gt;τinted on vellum, and a copious
                    collection of municipal histones and statutes, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >testi</hi><hi rend="italic">di lingua,</hi> and of geographical and
                    topographical maps. The MS. portolani, 25 in number, are for the most part of
                    great importance; the oldest is dated 1417, and several seem to be the original
                    charts executed for Sir Robert Dudley (duke of Northumberland) in the
                    preparation of his <hi rend="italic">Arcano</hi><hi rend="italic">del Mare.</hi>
                    The annual increment of books in this library is about 12,000. It is open freely
                    to the public, and about 50,000 readers annually make use of it. About 60,000
                    printed volumes and 2500 MSS. are consulted annually, not including some 1500
                    books and 50 MSS., which are lent out yearly to certain students.—The Biblioteca
                    Nazionale at Naples, though only opened to the public in 1804, is the largest
                    library of that city. The nucleus from which it developed was the collection of
                    Cardinal Seripando, which comprised many MSS. and printed books of great value.
                    Acquisitions came in from other sources, especially when in the year 1848 many
                    private and conventual libraries were thrown on the Neapolitan market.<note

                    between volumes and works).</p></note> The Biblical section is rich in rarities,
                    commencing with the Mainz Bible of 1462, printed on vellum. Other special
                    features are the collection of <hi rend="italic">testi</hi><hi rend="italic">di

                    presses, particularly those executed by the typographers of Naples. The MSS.
                    include a palimpsest containing writings of the 3d, 5th, and 6th centuries under
                    a grammatical treatise of the 8th, 2 Latin papyri of the 6th century, over 50
                    Latin Bibles, and a great number of illuminated books with miniatures. There are
                    more than 40 books printed on vellum in the 15th and 16th centuries, including a
                    fine first Homer. There are several MS. maps and portolani, one of them dating
                    from the end of the 14th century. About 10,000 readers use this library,
                    consulting some 140,000 books yearly.—The Bibliotheca Nazionale of Milan, better
                    known as the Brera, founded in 1770 by a decree of the empress Maria Theresa,
                    consists of 163,123 printed volumes and 3646 MSS., with a yearly increment of
                    about 6000 volumes, and the annual number of readers is said to amount to
                    45,000. It comprises nearly 2300 books printed in the 15th century (including
                    the rare <hi rend="italic">Monte Santo di Dio</hi> of Bettini, 1477), 913 Aldine

                    service-books, with miniatures representing the advance of Italian art from the
                    12th to the 16th century. These were formerly in the Certosa at Pavia.—The
                    Bibliotheca Nazionale of Palermo, founded from the Collegio Massimo of the
                    Jesuits, with additions from other libraries of that suppressed order, is rich
                    in 15th century books, which have been elaborately described in a catalogue
                    printed in 1875, and in Aldines and bibliographical curiosities of the 16th and
                    following centuries.—The Biblioteca Nazionale of Turin is extensively used by
                    readers, whose annual number amounts to 120,000. The majority of the books are
                    works for scientific study, but amongst them are several rarities, comprising a

                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Imitatione</hi> (on which the assignment of its

                    several productions of the earliest German and Italian printers.—The Biblioteca
                    Marciana, or library of St Mark at Venice, was founded in 1362 by a donation of
                    MSS. from the famous Petrarch (most of them now lost), and instituted as a
                    library by Cardinal Bessarion in the 15th century. It is open daily, and. is
                    used by about 40,000 readers annually. The precious contents include Greek MSS.
                    of great value, of which more than 1000 were given by Cardinal Bessarion,
                    important MS. collections of λvorks on Venetian history, rare incunabula, and a
                    great number of volumes, unique or exceedingly rare, on the subject of early
                    geographical research. Amongst the MSS. is a Latin Homer in the autograph of
                    Boccaccio, an invaluable codex of the laws of the Lombards, and the autograph
                    MS. of Sarpi’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Council of Trenk</hi> Since the
                    fall of the republic and the suppression of the monasteries afterwards, a great

                    Marciana.</p>
                <p>Of the university libraries under Government control it is sufficient to notice
                    the Biblioteca della University at Bologna, founded in 1712 by Count Luigi F.
                    Marsigli or Marsili. The MSS. comprise a rich Oriental collection of 547 MSS. in
                    Arabic, 173 in Turkish, and several in Persian, Armenian, and Hebrew. Amongst
                    the Latin codices is a Lactantius of the 6th or 7th century. The other
                    noteworthy articles include a copy of the Armenian gospels (12th century), the
                    Avicenna, with miniatures dated 1194, described in Montfaucon’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Diarium Italicum,</hi> and some unpublished Greek texts. Amongst
                    the Italian MSS. is a rich assemblage of municipal histories. Mezzofanti was for
                    a long time the custodian here, and his own collection of books has been
                    incorporated in the library, which is remarkable likewise for the number of
                    early editions and Aldines which it contains. It possesses the Mainz Latin Bible
                    dated 1462; the Lactantius and Augustine <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Civitate</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei</hi> printed by Schweynheim and
                    Pannartz, the Foligno Dante of 1472, and a copy of Henry VIII.’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Assertio Sacramentorum</hi> with the royal author’s autograph. A
                    collection of drawings by Agostino Caracci is another special feature of worth.
                    The Manfredi palace, in which the library is arranged, is a fine building begun
                    in 1714 and finished in 1744. The grand hall with its fine furniture in walnut
                    wood merits particular attention. The library is open to the public; the yearly
                    number of readers is about 25,000, and of books consulted 40,000.<note

                <p>Of the remaining Government libraries the following may be named.—The Biblioteca
                    del Monastero della S. Trinità, at La Cava dei Tirreni in the province of
                    Salerno, is after the Biblioteca delΓ Archivio Capitolare at Vercelli the most
                    ancient library in the Italian kingdom, its foundation being said to be
                    contemporaneous with that of the Benedictine abbey itself (beginning of the 11th
                    century). It only contains some 10,000 volumes, but these include a number of
                    MSS. of very great rarity and value, ranging from the 8th to the 14th century.
                    Amongst these is the celebrated Codex Legum Longobardorum, dated 1004, besides a
                    well-known geographical chart of the 12th century, over 100 Greek MSS., and
                    about 1000 charters beginning with the year 840, more than 200 of which belong
                    to the Lombard and Norman periods.—At Florence the Manicelli Library, founded in
                    1752, is remarkable for its artistic wealth of early woodcuts and metal
                    engravings. The number of these and of original drawings by the old masters
                    amounts to 80,000 pieces.— At Modena is the famous Biblioteca Palatina,
                    sometimes called the Biblioteca Estense from having been founded by the Este
                    family at Ferrara in 1393; it was transferred to Modena by Cesare D’Este in
                    1598. Muratori, Zaccaria, and Tiraboschi were librarians here, and made good use
                    of the treasures of the library. It is particularly rich in early printed
                    literature and valuable codices.—The oldest library at Naples is the Biblioteca
                    Brancacciana, with many valuable MSS. relating to the history of Naples. Two
                    planispheres by Coronelli are preserved here. It was founded in 1673 by Cardinal
                    F. Μ. Brancaccio.—The Regia Biblioteca di Parma, founded definitively in 1779,
                    owes its origin to the grand-duke Philip, who employed the famous scholar
                    Paciaudi to organize it. It is now a public library containing 213,995 volumes,
                    including 4000 MSS., with an annual increment of nearly 1000 volumes. Amongst
                    its treasures is De Rossi’s magnificent collection of Biblical and rabbinical
                    MSS.</p>
                <p>Chief among the great libraries not under Government control comes the
                    world-famed Biblioteca Mediceo-Laurenziana at Florence, formed from the
                    collections of Cosimo the Elder, Pietro de’ Medici, and Lorenzo the Magnificent
                    (which, however, passed away from the family after the expulsion of the Medici
                    from Florence, and were repurchased by Cardinal Giovanni, afterwards Leo X.). It
                    was first constituted as a public library in Florence by <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n550/mode/1up"

                    construct a suitable edifice for its reception. It was opened to the public by
                    Cosimo I. in 1571, and has ever since gone on increasing in value, the
                    accessions in the 18th century alone being enough to double its former
                    importance. The printed books it contains are probably no more than 3000 in
                    number, but are almost all of the highest rarity and interest. It is, however,
                    the precious collection of MSS., amounting to about 7000 articles, which gives
                    its chief importance to this library. They comprise some of the most valuable
                    codices in the world,—the famous Virgil of the 4th or 5th century, Justinian’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Pandects</hi> of the 7th, a Homer of the 10th, and several
                    other very early Greek and Latin classical and Biblical texts, as well as copies
                    in the handwriting of Petrarch, about 100 codices of Dante, a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi> copied by a contemporary from Boccaccio’s own MS., and Cellini’s
                    MS. of his autobiography. Bandini’s catalogue of the MSS. occupies 13 vols,
                    folio, printed in 1764-78.—At Genoa the Biblioteca Franzoniana, founded about
                    1770 for the instruction of the poorer classes, is noteworthy as being the first
                    European library lighted up at night for the use of readers.— The famous
                    Biblioteca Ambrosiana at Milan was founded in 1609 by Cardinal Fed. Borromeo. It
                    contains 164,000 printed volumes and 8100 MSS. Amongst the MSS. are a Greek
                    Pentateuch of the 5th century, the famous Peshito and Syro-Hexaplar from the
                    Nitrian convent of St Maria Deipara, a Josephus written on papyrus, supposed to
                    be of the 5th century, several palimpsest texts, including an early Plautus, and
                    St Jerome’s commentary on the Psalms in a volume of 7th century execution, full
                    of contemporary glosses in Irish, Gothic fragments of Ulfilas, and a Virgil with

                    (Venice), and the editio princeps of Isocrates, both printed on vellum. Cardinal
                    Mai was formerly custodian here. In 1879 Professor C. Mensinger presented his
                    “Biblioteca Europea,” consisting of2500 volumes, 300 maps, and 5000 pieces, all
                    relating to the literature and linguistics of European countries.<note

                    without mention here, although they are private and inaccessible without special
                    permission. The former is remarkable for its collection of early editions with
                    engravings, including the Dante of 1481, with twenty designs by Baccio
                    Bandinelli. The latter is rich in MSS. with miniatures of the finest and rarest
                    kind, and in printed books of which many are unique or nearly so. It consists of
                    70,000 printed volumes.—The foundation of the monastery of Monte Cassino is due
                    to St Benedict, who arrived there in the year 529, and established the prototype
                    of all similar institutions in western Europe. He brought with him a few
                    manuscripts, four or five of which are still to be seen. The library of printed
                    booksnow extends to about 20,000 volumes, chiefly relating to the theological
                    sciences, but including some rare editions. A collection of the books belonging
                    to the monks is in course of formation; it contains about the same number of
                    volumes. But the chief glory of Monte Cassino consists of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >archivio,</hi> which is quite apart; and this includes 30,000 or 40,000 bulls,
                    diplomas, charters, and other documents, besides 1000 MSS. dating from the 6th
                    century downwards. The latter comprehend some very early Bibles and important
                    codices of patristic and other mediaeval writings. There are good written
                    catalogues, and a calendar is now being published, <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca

                    special revenues, and owe their accessions entirely to donations.—At Ravenna the
                    Biblioteca Classense has a 10th century codex of Aristophanes and two 14th
                    century codices of Dante. Here are also the autograph correspondence of
                    Muratori, and many unpublished letters of modern writers.—At Vercelli the
                    Biblioteca dell’ Archivio Capitolare, the foundation of which can be assigned to
                    no certain date, but must be referred to the early days when the barbarous
                    conquerors of Italy had become Christianized, comprises nothing but MSS., all Of
                    great antiquity and value. Amongst them is an Evangeliarium S. Eusebii in Latin,
                    supposed to be of the 4th century; also the famous codex containing the

                    thieves and fire, in 1772 the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne received considerable
                    augmentations from the libraries of the suppressed order of Jesuits, and was
                    thrown open to the public. On the occupation of Brussels by the French in 1794 a
                    number of books and MSS. were confiscated and transferred to Paris (whence the
                    majority were returned in 1815); in 1795 the remainder were formed into a public
                    library under the care of La Serna Santander, who was also town librarian, and
                    who was followed by Van Hulthem. At the end of the administration of Van Hulthem
                    a large part of the precious collections of the Bollandists was acquired. In
                    1830 the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne was added to the state archives, and the
                    whole made available for students. Van Hulthem died in 1832, leaving one of the
                    most important private libraries in Europe, described by Voisin in <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca Hulthemiana,</hi> Brus., 1836, 5 vols., and extending
                    to 60,000 printed volumes and 1016 MSS., mostly relating to Belgian history. The
                    collection was purchased by the Government in 1837, and, having been added to
                    the Bibliothèque de Bourgogne (open since 1772) and the Bibliothèque de la Ville
                    (open since 1794), formed what has since been known as the Bibliothèque Royale
                    de Belgique. The printed volumes now number 350,000, with 30,000 MSS., 100,000
                    prints, and 50,000 coins and medals. The yearly additions to the books amount to
                    between 1500 and 3000; the other departments receive few accessions. The special
                    collections, each with a printed catalogue, consist of the Fonds van Hulthem,
                    for national history; the Fonds Fétis, for music; the Fonds Goethals, for
                    genealogy; and the Fonds Müller, for physiology. The catalogue of the MSS. has
                    been partly printed, but in an imperfect manner.</p>
                <p>The University Library of Ghent, known successively as the Bibliothèque de
                    l’École Centrale and Bibliothèque Publique de la Ville, was founded upon the old
                    libraries of the Conseil de Flandres, of the College des Echevins, and of many
                    suppressed religious communities. It was declared public in 1797, and formally
                    opened in 1798. On the foundation of the university in 1817 the town placed the
                    collection at its disposal, and the library has since remained under state
                    control. The printed volumes now amount to 250,000, with 1600 MSS; the annual
                    increment is about 2500 volumes. There are important special collections on
                    archaeology, Netherlands literature, national history, books printed in
                    Flanders, and 23,000 .historical pamphlets of the 16th and 17th centuries. There
                    are printed catalogues of the works on jurisprudence (1839), and of the MSS.
                    (1852).—The Bibliothèque de l’Université Catholique of Louvain is based upon the
                    collection of Beyerlinck, who bequeathed it to his alma mater in 1627; this
                    example was followed by Jacques Romain, professor of medicine, but the proper
                    organization of the library commenced in 1636. There are now said to be 250,000
                    volumes.—The Bibliothèque de l’Université of Liège dates from 1817, when on the
                    foundation of the university the old Bibliothèque de la Ville was added to it.
                    There are now 105,746 printed volumes, 87,254 pamphlets, 1544 MSS., and 142
                    incunabula. The Liège collection (of which a printed catalogue appeared in 3
                    vols. 8vo, 1872), bequeathed by Μ. Ulysse Capitaine, extends to 12,061 volumes
                    and pamphlets. A printed catalogue of the medical books was published in 1844,
                    and one of the MSS. in 1875.</p>
                <p>The national library of Holland is the Koninklijke Bibliotheek at the Hague,
                    which was established in 1798, when it was decided to join the library of the
                    princes of Orange with those of the defunct Government bodies in order to form a
                    library for the States General, to be called the National Bibliotheek. In 1805
                    the present name was adopted; and since 1815 it has become the national library.
                    In 1848 the Baron W. Y. H. van Westreenen van Tiellandt bequeathed his valuable
                    books, MSS., coins, and antiquities to the country, and directed that they,
                    should be preserved in his former residence as a branch of the royal library.
                    There are now upwards of 200,000 volumes of printed books, with an annual
                    increment of 4000 volumes. The MSS. number 4000, chiefly historical, but
                    including many fine books of hours with miniatures. Books are lent all over the
                    country. Some twenty-five years ago it was decided for economical reasons to
                    restrict the purchases to political, historical, and legal works, but recently,
                    in consequence of an increase in the yearly subsidy, literature has been added
                    to these three classes. The library boasts of the richest collection in the
                    world of books on chess, Dutch incunabula, Elzevirs, and Spinozana. There is one
                    general written catalogue arranged in classes, with alphabetical indexes. In
                    1800 a printed catalogue was issued, with four supplements down to 1811; and
                    since 1866 a yearly list of additions has been published. Special mention should
                    be made of the excellent catalogue of the incunabula published in 1856.</p>
                <p>The next library in numerical importance is the famous Bibliotheca Academiae
                    Lugduno-Batavae, which dates from the foundation of the university of Leyden by
                    William I., prince of Orange, on February 8, 1575. It has acquired many valuable
                    additions from the books and MSS. of the distinguished scholars, Golius, Joseph
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n551/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0551-0532"/> Scaliger, Isaac Voss, Ruhnken, and Hemsterhuis.
                    The MSS. comprehend many of great intrinsic importance; the Oriental codices
                    number 2400. The library of the Society of Netherland Literature has been placed
                    here since 18f 7; this is rich in the national history and literature. The
                    Arabic and Oriental MSS. known as the Legatum Wamerianum are of great value and
                    interest; and the collection of maps bequeathed in 1870 by J. J. Bodel Nyenhuis
                    is also noteworthy. The library is contained in a building which was formerly a
                    church of the Béguines, adapted in 1860 somewhat after the style of the British
                    Museum. The catalogues (one alphabetical and one classified) are on slips, the
                    titles being printed. A catalogue of books and MSS. was printed in 1716, one of
                    books added between 1814 and 1847 in 1848, and a supplementary part of MSS. only
                    in 1850. A catalogue of the Oriental MSS. was published in 6 vols., 1851-77.</p>
                <p>The University Library at Utrecht dates from 1582, when certain conventual
                    collections were brought together in order to form a public library, which was
                    shortly afterwards enriched by the books bequeathed by Hub. Buchelius and Ev.
                    Pollio. Upon the foundation of the university in 1636, the town library passed
                    into its charge. Among the MSS. are some interesting cloister MSS. and the
                    famous “Utrecht Psalter,” which contains the oldest text of the Athanasian
                    creed. The last edition of the catalogue was in 2 vols, folio, 1834, with
                    supplement in 1845, index from 1845-55 in 8vo, and additions 1856-70, 2 vols.
                    8vo. The titles of accessions are now printed in sheets and pasted down for
                    insertion.</p>
                <p>The basis of the University Library at Amsterdam consists of a collection of
                    books brought together in the 15th century and preserved in the Nieuwe Kerk. At
                    the time of the Reformation in 1578 they became the property of the city, but
                    remained in the Nieuwe Kerk for the use of the public till 1632, when they were
                    transferred to the Athenaeum. Since 1877 the collection has been known as the
                    University Library, and in 1881 it was removed to a building designed upon the
                    plan of the new library and readingroom of the British Museum. The library
                    includes the best collection of medical works in Holland, and the Bibliotheca
                    Rosenthaliana of Hebrew and Talmudic literature is of great fame and value; a
                    catalogue of the last was printed in 18745. The libraries of the Dutch
                    Geographical and other societies are preserved here. A general printed catalogue
                    was issued in 6 vols. 8vo, Amsterdam, 1856-77; one describing the bequests of J.
                    de Bosch Kemper, E. J. Potgieter, and F. W. Rive, in 3 vols. 8vo, 1878-79; a
                    catalogue of the MSS. of Professor Moll was published in 1880, and one of those
                    of P. Camper in 1881.</p>

                <p>The commencement of the admirably managed national library of Denmark, the great
                    Royal Library at Copenhagen, may be said to have taken place during the reign of
                    Christian III. (1533-59), who took pride in importing foreign books and choice
                    MSS.; but the true founder was Frederick III. (1648-70); to him is mainly due
                    the famous collection of Icelandic literature and the acquisition of Tycho
                    Brahe’s MSS. The present building (in the Christiansborg Castle) was commenced
                    in 1667. Among notable accessions may be mentioned the collections of C.
                    Reitzer, the count of Danneskjold (8000 volumes and 500 MSS.), and Count de
                    Thott; the last bequeathed 6039 volumes printed before 1531, and the remainder
                    of his books, over 100,000 volumes, were eventually purchased. In 1793 the
                    library was opened to the public, and it has since remained under state control.
                    Two copies of every book published within the kingdom must be deposited here.
                    The incunabula and block books form an important series. There is a general
                    classified catalogue in writing in 295 folio volumes for the use of readers; and
                    an alphabetical one on slips arranged in boxes for the officials. A good
                    catalogue of the De Thott collection was printed in 12 vols. 8vo, 1789-95; a
                    catalogue of the French MSS. appeared in 1844; of Oriental MSS., 1846; of the
                    Danish collection, 1875, 8vo. Annual reports and accounts of notable MSS. have
                    been published since 1864. There were 7000 additions in 1880.</p>
                <p>The University Library, founded in 1482, was destroyed by fire in 1728, and
                    re-established shortly afterwards. A copy of every Danish publication must be
                    deposited here. The MSS. include the famous Arne-Magnean collection (see vol.
                    xii. p. 626).</p>
                <p>The chief library in Norway is the University Library at Christiania, established
                    at the same time as the university, September 2, 1811, by Frederick II., with a
                    donation from the king of many thousands of duplicates from the Royal Library at
                    Copenhagen, and since augmented by important bequests.</p>
                <p>The Royal Library at Stockholm was first established in 1585. The original
                    collection was given to the university of Upsala by Gustavus II., that formed by
                    Christina is at the Vatican, and the library brought together by Charles X. was
                    destroyed by fire in 1697. The present library was organized shortly afterwards.
                    The Benzelstjerna-Engestrom Library (14,500 printed volumes and 1200 MSS., rich
                    in materials for Swedish history) is now annexed to it. Natural history,
                    medicine, and mathematics are left to other libraries. Among the MSS. the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex Aureus</hi> of the 6th or 7th century, with its interesting
                    Anglo-Saxon inscription, is particularly noteworthy. The catalogues are in
                    writing, and are both alphabetical and classified; printed catalogues have been
                    issued of portions of the MSS. The present building was opened in 1882.</p>
                <p>The University Library at Upsala was founded by Gustavus Adolphus in 1620, from
                    the remains of several convent libraries; he also provided an endowment. The
                    MSS. chiefly relate to the history of the country, but include the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex</hi><hi rend="italic">Argenteus,</hi> containing the Gothic
                    gospels of Ulfilas. The general catalogue is in writing. A catalogue was printed
                    in 1814; special lists of the foreign accessions have been published each year
                    from 1850; the Arabic, Persian, and Turkish MSS. are described by C. J. Tomberg,
                    1846. The library at Lund dates from the foundation of the university in 1668,
                    and was based upon the old cathedral library. The MSS. include the De la Gardie
                    archives, acquired in 1848.</p>

                <p>The chief library in Spain is the Biblioteca Nacional (formerly the Biblioteca
                    Real) at Madrid. The printed volumes number 400,000 volumes, with 200,000
                    pamphlets; the accessions in 1880 amounted to 25,840 articles. Spanish
                    literature is of course well represented, and, in consequence of the numerous
                    accessions from the libraries of the suppressed convents, the classes of
                    theology, canon law, history, &amp;c., are particularly complete. The number of
                    bibliographical rarities was largely increased by the incorporation of the
                    valuable collection formed by the well-known bibliographer Don Luis de Usoz.
                    There are 30,000 MSS., contained in 10,000 volumes and bundles; they include
                    some finely illuminated codices, historical documents, and many valuable
                    autographs. The collection of prints extends to 120,000 pieces, and was
                    principally formed from the important series bought from Don Valentin Carderera
                    in 1865. In 1880 54,875 books were issued to 51,966 readers. The annual revenue
                    is only £1600. The printed books have one catalogue arranged under authors’
                    names, and one under titles; the departments of music, maps and charts, and
                    prints have subject-catalogues as well. There is a general index of the MSS.,
                    with special catalogues of the Greek and Latin codices and genealogical
                    documents. The first (and only) volume of a printed catalogue of the Greek MSS.
                    appeared in 1769. The cabinet m medals is most valuable and well arranged. Of
                    the other Madrid libraries (see the tables) it is enough to mention the
                    Biblioteca de la Academia de la Historia (20,000 volumes and 1500 MSS.), which
                    contains some printed and MS. Spanish books of great value, including the
                    well-known Salazar collection.—The history of the library of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Escorial</hi> has been given at vol. viii. p. 541. In 1808,
                    before the invasion, the Escorial is estimated to have contained 30,000 printed
                    volumes and 3400 MSS.; Joseph removed the collection to Madrid, but when it was
                    returned by Ferdinand 10,000 volumes were missing. There are now 32,142 printed
                    volumes, with 583 Greek, 1905 Arabic, 73 Hebrew, and 2050 Latin MSS. The Arabic
                    MSS. have been described by Μ. Casiri, 1760-70; and a catalogue of the Greek
                    codices by Miiller was issued at the expense of the French Government in 1848.
                    There is an imperfect written catalogue of the printed books, and the present
                    librarian is now engaged upon a catalogue of the Latin MSS. Permission to study
                    at the Escorial, which is one of the royal private libraries, must be obtained
                    by special application.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Among the libraries of Portugal the Bibliotheca Nacional at Lisbon naturally
                    takes the first place. In 1841 it was largely increased from the monastic
                    collections, which, however, seem to have been little cared for according to a
                    report prepared by the principal librarian three years later. There are now said
                    to be 200,000 volumes of printed books, among which theology, canon law,
                    history, and Portuguese and Spanish literature largely predominate. The MSS.
                    number 9415, including many of great value. There is also a cabinet of 40,000
                    coins and medals.—The Bibliotheca da Academia, founded in 1780, is preserved in
                    the suppressed convent of the Ordern Terceira da Penitencia. In 1836 the Academy
                    acquired the library of that convent, numbering 30,000 volumes, which have since
                    been kept apart. The Archivo Nacional, in the same building, contains the
                    archives of the kingdom, brought here after the destruction of the Torre do
                    Castello during the great earthquake.</p>
                <p>The Bibliotheca Publica Municipal at Oporto is the second largest in Portugal,
                    although only dating from July 9, 1833, the anniversary of the debarkation of D.
                    Pedro, and when the memorable siege was still in progress; from that date to
                    1874 it was styled the Real Bibliotheca do Porto. The regent (ex-emperor of
                    Brazil) gave to the town the libraries of the suppressed convents in the
                    northern provinces, the municipality undertaking to defray the expense of
                    keeping up the collection, but only £180 is yearly spent on books and bindings,
                    and £380 on salaries. Recent accessions consist <pb break="no"

                <p>The Imperial Public Library at St Petersburg is the third largest library in the
                    world, and now claims to possess 1,000,000 printed volumes. The commencement of
                    this magnificent collection may be said to have been the books seized by the
                    Czar Peter during his invasion of Courland in 1714; the library did not receive
                    any notable augmentation, however, till the year 1795, when, by the acquisition
                    of the famous Zaluski collection, the Imperial Library suddenly attained a place
                    in the first rank among great European libraries. The Zaluski Library was formed
                    by the Polish count Joseph Zaluski, who collected at his own expense during
                    forty-three years no less than 200,000 volumes, which were added to by his
                    brother Andrew, bishop of Cracow, by whom in 1747 the library was thrown open to
                    the public. At his death it was left under the control of the Jesuit College at
                    Warsaw; on the suppression of the order it was taken care of by the Commission
                    of Education; and finally in 1795 it was transferred by Suwaroff to St
                    Petersburg as a trophy of war. It then extended to 260,000 printed volumes and
                    10,000 MSS., but in consequence of the withdrawal of many medical and
                    illustrated works to enrich other institutions, hardly 238,000 volumes remained
                    in 1810. Literature, history, and theology formed the main features of the
                    Zaluski Library; the last class alone amounted to one-fourth of the whole
                    number. Since the commencement of this century, through the liberality of the
                    sovereigns, the gifts of individuals, careful purchases, and the application of
                    the law of 1810, whereby two copies of every Russian publication must be
                    deposited here, the Imperial Library has attained its present extensive
                    dimensions. Nearly one hundred different collections, some of them very valuable
                    and extensive, have been added from time to time. They include, for example, the
                    Tolstoi Sclavonic collection (1830), Tischendorf’s MSS. (1858), the Dolgorousky
                    Oriental MSS. (1859), and the Firkowitsch Hebrew (Karaite) collection (1862-63),
                    the libraries of Adelung (1858) and Tobler (1877), that of the Slavonic scholar
                    Jungmann (1856), and the national MSS. of Karamzin (1867). This system of
                    acquiring books, while it has made some departments exceedingly rich, has left
                    others comparatively meagre. The library was not regularly opened to the public
                    until 1814; it is under the control of the minister of public instruction. In
                    the printed book department the yearly average of readers is now 107,000, and of
                    books consulted 285,300. The annual grant from the treasury is 79,174 silver
                    roubles; an income of 3438 roubles is derived from other sources. The official
                    estimate of the number of printed books is 1,000,000 volumes, with 19,059 maps
                    and 75,000 prints and photographs. The yearly accessions amount to about 28,000.
                    The Russian books number 100,000 and the Russica 30,000 volumes; the Aldines and
                    Elzevirs form a nearly perfect collection; and the incunabula are numerous and
                    very instructively arranged.</p>
                <p>The manuscripts include 26,000 codices, 41,340 autographs, 4689 charters, and 576
                    maps. The glory of this department is the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Codex
                    Sinaiticus</hi> of the Greek Bible, brought from the convent of St Catherine on
                    Mount Sinai by Tischendorf in 1859. Other important Biblical and patristic
                    codices are to be found among the Greek and Latin MSS.; the Hebrew MSS. include
                    some of the most ancient that exist, and the Samaritan collection is one of the
                    largest in Europe; the Oriental MSS. comprehend many valuable texts, and among
                    the French are some of great historical value.</p>
                <p>The general catalogues are in writing, but the following special catalogues of
                    the printed books have been published the Tolstoi collection of early printed
                    Russian books, 1829; the Aldines, 1854; the Elzevirs, 1862, and another in 1864,
                    by C. F. Walther; editions printed during the reign of Peter the Great, by
                    Bytschkoff, 1867; the foreign books relating to Peter the Great by P. Minzloff,
                    1872; and the Russica, 2 vols., 1873. Lists of the foreign books have been
                    issued since 1863, and the <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus</hi> published since
                    1850 contain notices of the most important acquisitions.</p>
                <p>The following catalogues of the MSS. are in print the Tolstoi Slavonic
                    collection, 1825; Dom’s catalogue of the Oriental MSS., 1852; old German, 1853;
                    the Greek, by Murait, 1864; the Khanikoff Oriental codices, by Dorn, 1865;
                    Russian MSS. on the history of Peter the Great, by Bytschkoff, 1872; the French,
                    1874; Samaritan, 1875; Hebrew Biblical, 1875; Slavonic and Russian
                    miscellaneous, parts 1 and 2, 1878-80.</p>
                <p>The nucleus of the library at the Hermitage Palace was formed by the empress
                    Catherine 11., who purchased the books and MSS. of Voltaire and Diderot. In the
                    year 1861 the collection amounted to 150,000 volumes, of which nearly all not
                    relating to the history of art were then transferred to the Imperial
                    Library.</p>
                <p>The second largest library in Russia is contained in the public museum at Moscow.
                    The class of history is particularly rich, and Russian early printed books are
                    well represented. The MSS. number 5000, including many ancient Sclavonic codices
                    and historical documents of value. One room is devoted to a collection of
                    Masonic MSS., which comprehend the archives of the lodges in Russia between 1816
                    and 1821. There is a general alphabetical catalogue in writing; the catalogue of
                    the MSS. has been printed, as well as those of some of the special
                    collections.</p>

                <p>Of Indian libraries it is sufficient to notice those that have importance for
                    Oriental letters. At Calcutta the Sanskrit college has 1652 printed Sanskrit
                    volumes and 2769 Sanskrit MSS., some as old as the 14th century; there is also a
                    large collection of Jain MSS. A catalogue is now being prepared for
                    publication.—The Arabic library attached to the Arabic department of the Madrasa
                    was founded about 1781, and now includes 731 printed volumes, 143 original MSS.
                    and 151 copies; the English library of the Anglo-Persian department dates from
                    1854, and extends to 325 4 volumes.—The library of the Asiatic Society of Bengal
                    was founded in 1784, and now contains 15,000 printed volumes, chiefly on Eastern
                    and philological subjects, with a valuable collection of 9500 Arabic and Persian
                    MSS. A catalogue is now passing through the press.</p>
                <p>At Bombay the library of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Society,
                    established in 1804 as the Literary Society of Bengal, is now an excellent
                    general and Oriental collection of 40,000 printed volumes and 200 MSS.,
                    describedin a printed catalogue of 1875. The Moolla Feroze Library was
                    bequeathed for public use by Moolla Feroze, head priest of the Parsis of the
                    Kudπri sect in 1831, and consisted chiefly of MSS. in Arabic and Persian on
                    history, philosophy, and astronomy; some additions of English and Gujarati works
                    have been made, as well as of European books on Zoroastrianism. A catalogue has
                    been printed.</p>
                <p>The library of Tippoo Sahib, consisting of 2000 MSS., fell into the hands of the
                    British, and a descriptive catalogue of them by Charles Stewart was published at
                    Cambridge in 1809, 4to. A few were presented to public libraries in England, but
                    the majority were placed in the college of Fort William, then recently
                    established'. The first volume, containing Persian and Hindustani poetιy, of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Libraries of the King of Oudh,</hi> by A.
                    Sprenger, was published at Calcutta in 1854. The compiler shortly af terwards
                    left the Indian service, and no measures were taken to complete the work. On the
                    annexation of the kingdom in 1856 the ex-king is believed to have taken some of
                    the most valuable MSS. to Calcutta, but the largest portion were left behind at
                    Lucknow. During the siege the books were used to block up windows, &amp;c., and
                    those which were not destroyed were abandoned, and plundered by the soldiers.
                    Many were burnt for fuel; a few, however, were rescued and sold by auction, and
                    of these some were purchased for the Asiatic Society of Bengal.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most remarkable library in India is that of the raja of Tanjore,
                    which dates from the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century, when
                    Tanjore was under the rule of the Telugu Naiks, who collected Sanskrit MSS.
                    written in the Telugu character. In the 18th century the Marhattas conquered the
                    country, and since that date the library increased but slowly. By far the
                    greater portion of the store was acquired by Sharabh∩ji Raja during a visit to
                    Benares in 1820-30; his successor Sivajf added a few, but of inferior value.
                    There are now about 18,000 MSS. written in Devanagari, Nandinâgari, Telugu,
                    Kannada, Granthi, Malayalam, Bengali, Panjabi or Kashmiri, and Uriya; 8000 are
                    on palm leaves. Dr Burnell’s printed catalogue describes 12,375 articles.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the enlightened policy of the Government of India, we are beginning to
                    know much more respecting native libraries than was possible a few years ago,
                    and since 1868 a yearly sum of 24,000 rupees has been granted to carry on the
                    work of searching for Sanskrit MSS. The first part of a list of those in private
                    hands in southern India has been published by Dr G. Oppert; it contains a
                    description of 8376 MSS., and another volume is in course of preparation. Dr
                    Bühler, in his investigation of Santinath’s library at Cambay, found 300 MSS. of
                    great antiquity, six dating from the beginning of the 12th century. A pandit has
                    examined the Samghavina Pada Library in Pathan, and a catalogue has been
                    prepared for printing. A copy of the oldest Sanskrit dictionary, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sasvata Kosha,</hi> of which only one other copy (at the Bodleian)
                    is known, was found here. Dr Bühler also purchased 429 volumes for the
                    Government. Inquiries made in Behar have not met with much result. Notices of
                    Sanskrit MSS. in the presidency of Bengal have been prepared under the direction
                    of Dr Rajendralala Mitra; seven fasciculi (1000 pp.) have been printed,
                    describing 842 articles. The same scholar has also printed a catalogue (755 pp.)
                    of the library of the maharaja of Bikanir, describing 2000 Sanskrit MSS.; and
                    his analysis of the Sanskrit Buddhist literature of Nepal will shortly be
                    published. The total number of Sanskrit MSS. acquired in this presidency is now
                    1612, some of which are new to Europeans. Two catalogues of 180 Sanskrit MSS.
                    discovered in the NorthWestern Provinces and Oudh during 1878-80 have been
                    prepared, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n553/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0553-0534"/> and the following libraries (containing many
                    important texts) of the Punjab have been examined :—that of Pandit Bikhikesha,
                    of 500 books; Pandit Jwala Datta Prasada, 2500 MSS., the largest collection in
                    the province; and Pandit Dilaram, 430 MSS. The efforts of Dr Forchhammer will
                    probably bring to light many valuable Sanskrit MSS., both in Upper and Lower
                    Burmah.</p>
                <p>The Baffles Library at Singapore was established as a proprietary institution in
                    1844, taken over by the Government in 1874, and given legal status by an
                    ordinance passed in 1878. It now contains 11,000 volumes in general literature,
                    but books relating to the Malayan peninsula and archipelago have been made a
                    special feature, and since the acquisition of the collection of J. R. Logan in
                    1879 the library has become remarkably rich in this department.</p>
                <p>The library of the Genootschap van Künsten en Wetenschappen at Batavia contains
                    books printed in Netherlandish India, works relating to the Indian Archipelago
                    and adjacent countries, and the history of the Dutch in the East. There are now
                    20,000 printed volumes and 1630 MSS., of which 243 are Arabic, 445 Malay, 303
                    Javanese, 60 Batak, and 517 on lontar leaves in the ancient Kawi, Javanese, and
                    Bali languages, &amp;c. The last edition of the catalogue appeared in 1877;
                    printed catalogues of the Arabic, Malay, Javanese, and Kawi MSS. have also been
                    issued.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">China.—</hi> The Great Imperial Library was founded by K’in
                    Lung, 18th century, and from a catalogue which has been issued appears to have
                    contained about 12,000 works, extending to 168,000 volumes. There are many
                    provincial libraries in China, and the chief Buddhist monasteries also possess
                    collections of books.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Japan.—</hi> The library of the Tokio Fu (municipality of
                    Tokio) at Leido, in the old Chinese university, contains 63,000 Chinese and
                    Japanese volumes, and 5000 European, principally English and Dutch. The
                    reading-room is supplied with native daily papers, and the chief foreign
                    periodicals. The library is open for purposes of reference, and books may be
                    borrowed by special permission. The Asakusa Library, now occupying the former
                    fireproof rice storehouses of the shogun, is one of the oldest in the country,
                    and is reported to contain 143,000 volumes, including many ancient books and
                    MSS.; an entrance fee of about ⅜d∙ is charged here. The Imperial University has
                    a good collection of European and Japanese science and general literature. The
                    libraries of the large temples often contain rare books of value to the
                    philologist, and many of the leading towns throughout the country are provided
                    with free libraries. Lending libraries of native and Chinese literature have
                    existed in Japan from very early times.</p>

                <p>The largest collection of books in Canada is the library of parliament at Ottawa.
                    Though founded in 1815, it contained very few books until 1841, when the two
                    libraries of Upper and Lower Canada were joined. After being destroyed by fire,
                    the library was re-established in 1855, chiefly for parliamentary use. It now
                    contains 100,000 volumes, and is open to the public except when parliament is
                    sitting. Books are lent out. The main library is a handsome octagonal apartment
                    with beautiful carved work in Canadian white wood.</p>
                <p>In the South African Public Library at Capetown, which was established in 1818,
                    there are 39,000 volumes, including the collection bequeathed by Sir George
                    Grey, comprising, besides MSS. and early printed books, an unrivalled collection
                    of works in the native languages of Africa, Australia, &amp;c. The library is
                    open to any respectable person.</p>
                <p>The largest library in the Australian colonies is the Public Library of Victoria
                    at Melbourne, which was established in 1853. In 1881 it numbered 89,387 volumes
                    with 22,257 pamphlets; it possesses a collection of works on Australasia. The
                    library has a printed catalogue (1880). It is supported by an annual
                    parliamentary vote, which amounted last year to £5495. Readers are admitted
                    without any formality, and have free access to the shelves. Although books are
                    not lent out of the library individually, there is a system by which parcels of
                    from 100 to 400 books are lent to libraries, mechanics’ institutes, &amp;c., in
                    the inland towns of Victoria. There are several other not inconsiderable
                    libraries in Melbourne. Next in importance to the Melbourne Library is the
                    Sydney Free Public Library, which is said to contain the largest collection of
                    works on Australasia anywhere to be found. It has a lending as well as a
                    reference department, and is much used.</p>

                <p>United States.</p>
                <p>The libraries of the United States, as we should expect· to find in a country
                    where intelligence and education are so widely diffused, are exceedingly
                    numerous. A great mass of information with regard to them has been published by
                    the Bureau of Education, particularly in the comprehensive <hi rend="italic"
                    >Special Report on Public Libraries</hi> issued in 1876. From this report, and
                    the annual reports of the commissioners of education which have since appeared,
                    we learn that the number of public libraries already registered is 3842, with
                    upwards of 12,569,450 volumes. It is of course true that the great majority of
                    these libraries are not numerically important. On the other hand, many of them
                    are very rapidly growing, and their very youth implies that their shelves are
                    not burdened with much obsolete literature. The recent development of American
                    libraries is indeed very striking. Of the libraries reported in 1875, about 64
                    appear to have been established before 1800, and 30 of these between 1775 and
                    1800. Between 1800 and 1825 there were established 179 libraries, between 1825
                    and 1850 as many as 551, and finally between 1850 and 1875 no less than 2240,
                    which in the latter year contained as many as 5,481,068 volumes. It will be
                    convenient to deal with these libraries in groups according to the historical
                    order of their development. The earliest libraries formed were in connexion with
                    educational institutions, and the oldest is that of Harvard (1638). It was
                    destroyed by fire in 1764, but active steps were at once taken for its
                    restoration. From that time to the present, private donations have been the
                    great resource of the library. In 1840 the collection was removed to Gore Hall,
                    which was erected for the purpose with a noble bequest from Christopher Gore,
                    formerly governor of Massachusetts. There are also nine special libraries
                    connected with the different departments of the university. The total number of
                    volumes in all these collections is 259,000, exclusive of over 200,000
                    pamphlets. The annual increase is about 7000 volumes, and the library has an
                    endowment fund of over $200,000. There is a MS. card-catalogue in two parts, by
                    authors and subjects, which is accessible to the readers. The only condition of
                    admission to use the books in Gore Hall is respectability; but only members of
                    the university and privileged persons may borrow books. The library of Yale
                    College, New Haven, was founded in 1700, but grew so slowly that, even with the
                    1000 volumes received from Bishop Berkeley in 1733, it had only increased to
                    4000 volumes in 1766, and some of these were lost in the revolutionary war.
                    During the present century the collection has grown more speedily, and now the
                    main library numbers 102,000 volumes, while the special libraries in the control
                    of the college bring up the total to 143,000 volumes. The yearly increase is
                    about 4500 volumes, and the library has a book fund of $100,000. Amongst the
                    other important university libraries are those of the college of New Jersey
                    (Princeton), Dartmouth College (Hanover), Amherst College, Cornell University,
                    and Brown University (Providence, R. L). In 1875 the number of college libraries
                    (not reckoning academy and school libraries) was 312, besides 299 libraries
                    belonging to college students’ societies.</p>
                <p>The establishment of proprietary or subscription libraries runs back into the
                    first half of the 18th century, and is connected with the name of Benjamin
                    Franklin. It was at Philadelphia, in the year 1731, that he set on foot what he
                    calls “his first project of a public nature, that for a subscription library The
                    institution soon manifested its ability, was imitated by other towns and in
                    other provinces.” The Library Company of Philadelphia was soon regularly
                    incorporated, and gradually drew to itself other collections of books, including
                    the Loganian Library, which was vested in the company by the State legislature
                    in 1792 in trust for public use. Hence the collection combines the character of
                    a public and of a proprietary library, being freely open for reference purposes,
                    while the books circulate only among the subscribing members. It numbers at
                    present 123,000 volumes, of which 11,000 belong to the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0554-0535"/> Loganian Library, and may be freely lent. The
                    printed classed catalogue of the library has been praised by Brunet and
                    Allibone. In 1869 Dr James Rush left a bequest of over one million dollars for
                    the purpose of erecting a building to be called the Ridgeway branch of the
                    library. The building is very handsome, and has been very highly spoken of as a
                    library structure. Philadelphia has another large proprietary library—that of
                    the Mercantile Library Company, which was established in 1821. It possesses
                    143,135 volumes, and its members have always enjoyed direct access to the
                    shelves. The library of the Boston Athenaeum was established in 1807, and
                    numbers 122,000 volumes. It has recently published an admirable
                    dictionarycatalogue. The collection is especially rich in art and in history,
                    and possesses a part of the library of Washington. The Mercantile Library
                    Association of New York, which was founded in 1810, has the largest of all the
                    subscription libraries, counting over 193,000 volumes. New York possesses two
                    other large proprietary libraries, one of which claims to have been formed as
                    early as 1700 as the “public” library of New York. It was organized as the New
                    York Society Library in 1754, and has been especially the library of the old
                    Knickerbocker families and their descendants, its contents bearing witness to
                    its history. It contains about 80,000 volumes. The Apprentices’ Library has
                    about 63,000 volumes, and makes a special feature of works on trades and useful
                    arts. It is maintained by the General Society of Mechanics and Tradesmen.
                    Finally, the Brooklyn Library deserves mention, if only for its very useful and
                    admirable catalogue, the printing of which was completed in December 1880, and
                    which embraces 60,000 volumes.</p>
                <p>Although the State libraries of Pennsylvania and New Hampshire are known to have
                    been established as early as 1777, it was not until some time after the
                    revolution that any general tendency was shown to form official libraries in
                    connexion with the State system. It is especially within the last thirty years
                    that the number of these libraries has so increased that now every State and
                    Territory possesses a collection of books and documents for official and public
                    purposes. These collections depend for their increase upon annual appropriations
                    by the several States, and upon a systematic exchange of the official
                    publications of the general Government and of the several States and
                    Territories. The largest is that of the State of New York at Albany, which
                    contains 116,000 volumes, and is composed of a general and a law library, of
                    which a printed catalogue has been published with full subject-indexes. The
                    State libraries are libraries of reference, and only members of the official
                    classes are allowed to borrow books, although any well-behaved person is
                    admitted to read in the libraries.</p>
                <p>In addition to the libraries maintained by the several States, there are the
                    collections belonging to the general Government, most of which are at
                    Washington. The most important of them is of course the Library of Congress, but
                    there are also considerable libraries attached to the house of representatives,
                    the senate, the department of state, the patent office, and the office of the
                    surgeon-general.</p>
                <p>The Library of Congress was first established in 1800 at Washington, and was
                    burned together with the Capitol by the British army in 1814. President
                    Jefferson’s books were purchased to form the foundation of a new library, which
                    continued to increase slowly until 1851, when all but 20,000 volumes were
                    destroyed by fire. From this time the collection has grown rapidly, and now
                    consists of 396,000 volumes with 130,000 pamphlets. In 1866 the library of the
                    Smithsonian Institution, consisting of 40,000 volumes, chiefly in natural
                    science, was transferred to the library of congress. The library is specially
                    well provided in history, jurisprudence, the political sciences, and Americana.
                    Since 1832 the law collections have been constituted into a special department.
                    This is the national library. In 1870 the registry of copyrights was transferred
                    to it under the charge of the librarian of congress. As two copies of every
                    publication which claims copyright are required to be deposited in the library,
                    the receipts under this head are nearly 25,000 articles per annum. The sum
                    annually appropriated by congress for the management and increase of the library
                    is $52,840. The present accommodation is inadequate, and a separate building is
                    to be erected of size to contain two million volumes. There is an alphabetical
                    card-catalogue kept constantly up to date, and a printed catalogue of
                    subject-matters. The library is open every day in the year, except on four legal
                    holidays, from 9 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.</hi> to 4 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p.m.,</hi> and admission is granted to all persons over sixteen years of age
                    without formality or introduction, but books are only lent to members of the
                    official classes.</p>
                <p>Since the organization of the Government in 1789, no less than one hundred and
                    sixty historical societies have been formed in the United States, most of which
                    still continue to exist. Many of them have formed considerable libraries, and
                    possess extensive and valuable manuscript collections. The oldest of them is the
                    Massachusetts Historical Society, which dates from 1791.</p>
                <p>The earliest of the scientific societies owes its origin to Franklin, and dates
                    from 1743. The most extensive collection is that of the Academy of Natural
                    Sciences of Philadelphia, which consists of 35,000 volumes and 40,000 pamphlets.
                    For information as to the numerous professional libraries of the United
                    States—theological, legal, and medical—the reader may be referred to the report
                    already mentioned.</p>
                <p>Of all the libraries of the United States none have achieved a greater fame, and
                    none are more zealously and admirably conducted, than those which are supported
                    from the public funds of some of the great cities. Legislation on the subject of
                    free public libraries was almost synchronous in England and America. Of the free
                    town libraries of America, much the largest and most successful is the Boston
                    Public Library, which was established in 1852. Besides the liberal
                    appropriations made by the city for its support, it has been the object of a
                    long series of splendid gifts in money and books. Among the more conspicuous of
                    its benefactors have been Joshua Bates, Theodore Parker, and George Ticknor.
                    Since the library has been opened to the public there has thus been gathered
                    “the largest collection of books, under one administration, upon this
                    continent.” The number of volumes in the library on July 1, 1881, was 395,478,
                    and the annual accessions are over 17,000 volumes. In addition to the income
                    available from trust funds, the annual appropriation by the city is $115,000.
                    Besides the central library, with the Bates Hall and Lower Hall, there are eight
                    branches, and the total circulation is considerably over 1,000,000 volumes per
                    annum. Any inhabitant of Boston over fourteen years of age is admitted to read
                    in the library and to borrow books. The principal catalogue of the library is
                    upon cards, in addition to which there are printed catalogues of special
                    collections, and a perfect multitude of useful class catalogues and
                    bibliographical helps of various kinds. The number of persons engaged in the
                    service of the library is one hundred and forty-three. The library is open to
                    readers from 9 A.Μ. to 6 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> from October to March,
                    and until 7 P. Μ. during the rest of the year. Books are delivered for home use
                    until 9 in the evening. The periodical room is open from 9 A. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> to 9 P.M. on week days, and on Sundays from 2 to 9. A
                    new building is in contemplation.</p>
                <p>Of the remaining free town libraries, the most important-are those of Cincinnati
                    and Chicago. The public library of Cincinnati, which was established on its
                    present footing in 1867, has 122,930 volumes besides pamphlets. Its expenditure
                    last year was $51,465, and its total issues, including those from the two
                    branches, were 768,565. The reading-rooms are open every day in the year from 8
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">a.μ.</hi> to 10 P.M. The library buildings were completed
                    in 1873 at a cost of about $400,000, and are “among the handsomest in the
                    world.” The Chicago Public Library was established in 1872, and owed its origin
                    to the sympathy felt for Chicago in England after the great fire of 1871. The
                    number of volumes now in the library is 76,120. There is a very full and minute
                    card-catalogue, in one alphabet, of authors and subjects; the contents of
                    collections, volumes of essays, &amp;c., are analysed under their subjects. The
                    reading-room is open three hundred and sixty-five days in the year from 9 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. μ.</hi> to 9 P.M., and is not even closed for the purpose of
                    taking stock or cleaning. The library has not yet an appropriate building. Of
                    smaller free town libraries there is a considerable number, especially in
                    Massachusetts. Of the entire number ten only possess over 30,000 volumes each.

                <p>We cannot conclude this brief sketch without mentioning some notable
                    illustrations of that public-spirited munificence which is nowhere perhaps so
                    frequently found as in the United States. The Astor Library in New York was
                    founded by a bequest of John Jacob Astor, whose example was followed
                    successively by his son and grandson. The library was opened to the public in
                    1854, and at the end of 1880 the collection due to their joint benefaction
                    contained 192,547 volumes. It consists of a careful selection of the most
                    valuable books upon all subjects. It is a library of reference, for which
                    purpose it is freely open, and books are not lent out. It is “a working library
                    for studious persons,” and such persons on a proper introduction are allowed to
                    pursue their studies in the alcoves. In 1880 the number of general readers was
                    45,670, and the number of visits to the alcoves was 7961. The total endowment is
                    over $1,100,000. There is a printed catalogue for about half the library, with a
                    printed index of subjects, and a similar catalogue for the rest is in
                    preparation. The Lenox Library was established by Mr James Lenox in 1870, when a
                    body of trustees was incorporated by an Act of the legislature. In addition to
                    the funds intended for the library building and endowment, amounting to
                    $1,247,000, the private collection of books which Mr Lenox has long been
                    accumulating is extremely valuable. Though it does not rank high in point of
                    mere numbers, it is exceedingly rich in early books on America, in Bibles, in
                    Shakesperiana, and in Elizabethan poetry. The Peabody Institute at Baltimore was
                    established by Mr George Peabody in 1857, and contains a reference library open
                    to all comers, numbering about 72,000 volumes. The institute has an endowment of
                    $1,000,000, which, however, has to support, besides the library, a conservatoire
                    of music, an art gallery, and courses of popular lectures. The largest legacy
                    yet made for a public library has recently fallen to the citizens of Chicago in
                    the Newberry bequest of over $2,000,000 for the founding of a free public
                    library in the north division of Chicago.</p>

                <p>The importance of public libraries has been fully recognized by the Argentines,
                    and at present more than two hundred of them are in the country. They are due to
                    benefactions, but the Government in every case adds an equal sum to any
                    endowment. A central commission exists for the purpose of facilitating the
                    acquisition of books and to promote a uniform excellence of administration. The
                    most considerable is the Biblioteca Nacional at Buenos-Ayres, which contains at
                    present 40,000 volumes, and has been almost doubled since 1872. It is passably
                    rich in MSS., some of great interest, concerning the early history of the
                    Spanish colonies.</p>

                    was taken to Brazil by King Joäo VI., but was sent to Portugal on the
                    declaration of independence. Since 1873 the annual Government grant has been
                    largely increased. Among other libraries of the capital may be mentioned those
                    of the Faculty of Medicine (18,000 volumes), Marine Library (19,500 volumes),
                    National Museum (9000 volumes), Portuguese Literary Club (53,000 volumes),
                    Bibliotheca Fluminense (43,000 volumes), Benedictine Monastery (9000 volumes),
                    and the Bibliotheca Municipal (15,500 volumes). In the official report on
                    Brazil, submitted at the Philadelphia Exhibition in 1876, it was stated that the
                    aggregate number of volumes in all the libraries of the empire accessible to the
                    public was then 460,272 volumes. In 1875 the libraries were visited by 85,044
                    persons.</p>
                <p>The Biblioteca Nacional at Santiago is the chief library in Chili. The catalogue
                    is printed, and is kept up by annual supplements.</p>
                <p>Only sixteen out of the twenty-nine states and territories of the Mexican
                    republic have public libraries, and only a small proportion of the contents
                    consists of modern literature. Many, however, possess rare and valuable books,
                    of interest to the bibliographer and historian, which have come from the
                    libraries of the suppressed religious bodies. It is calculated that books in all
                    the public libraries amount to about 250,000 volumes. There are about
                    seventy-three scientific and literary associations in the republic, each
                    possessing books. The Society of Geography and Statistics, founded in 1851, is
                    the most important of them, and owns a fine museum and excellent library. After
                    the triumph of the Liberal party the cathedral, university, and conventual
                    libraries of the city of Mexico came into the possession of the Government, and
                    steps were taken to form them into one national collection. No definite system
                    was organized, however, until 1867, when the church of San Augustin was taken
                    and fitted up for the purpose. Two copies of every book printed in Mexico must
                    be presented to this library. The only other public library in the city is the
                    Biblioteca Cinco de Mayo, which is under the management of the Lancastrian
                    Society,</p>
                <p>The Biblioteca Nacional at Lima was founded by a decree of the liberator San
                    Martin on August 28, 1821, and placed in the house of the old convent of San
                    Pedro. The nucleus of the library consisted of those of the university of San
                    Marcos and of several monasteries, and a large present of books was also made by
                    San Martin. The library is chiefly interesting from containing so many MSS. and
                    rare books relating to the history of Peru in vice-regal times. The volumes
                    marked ‘ ‘ Papeles varios” contain reports on the superstitions of the Indians,
                    abstracts of the ecclesiastical councils of Lima, and memoirs on provincial
                    administration and petitions. It is reported (1881) that the whole library has
                    been seized by the Chilians and transferred to Santiago.</p>

                    libraries being precisely alike, it is impossible to lay down rules to suit all,
                    but certain principles of general application may be stated. In the first place
                    the internal arrangements ought to be devised by a person thoroughly acquainted
                    with the practical working of such a library as the building is intended to
                    accommodate. The reading-rooms, book-rooms, work-rooms, and offices should be
                    made to fall into the most convenient relations one to the other. And as
                    libraries grow with wonderful rapidity the plan ought to admit of easy
                    development. The site should be dry and airy, and permit isolation of the
                    fabric, which should be constructed of fire-proof materials, iron being
                    preferable to stone, and brick to either. Every floor should be laid upon rolled
                    iron beams, supported by lattice girders, the space between the beams being
                    fitted in with porous terra cotta, and the beams covered with concrete. To
                    protect them against fire, girders and pillars must be covered with terra cotta.
                    Iron doors (or, better still, stout wooden doors plated with thin iron) should
                    separate the different rooms.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    books must never be sacrificed to outside show. The old form of library, the
                    museum-like room with alcoves and a large block of vacant space in the centre,
                    or the series of apartments with books on the walls only, is no longer in
                    favour. The reading-room, commodious, well lighted, and supplied with works of
                    reference, should be away from the main collection, and the lending department
                    should be kept apart from the reference library. It is convenient to have
                    separate rooms for ladies and for readers to whom special facilities may be gran
                    ted; and let ample provision be made for work-rooms, librarians’ offices,
                    cataloguing rooms, and a bindery if necessary. The chief portion of the books
                    (at any rate those in most demand) should be on the ground floor, and more than
                    two stories are to be avoided. Plenty of light and good ventilation are two
                    conditions of great importance. The basement should be vaulted. As the
                    store-room, or that in which the main collection is deposited, is one to which
                    readers have seldom the right of access, the greatest economy as to shelvage and
                    passage way may be effected. Bookcases may be placed against the walls, but not
                    too close to them, and double presses, about 3 feet apart, arranged across the
                    floor. To prevent the objectionable use of high ladders, no shelf should stand
                    more than 8 feet above the ground. If the room be sufficiently lofty it may
                    contain one or more perforated iron floors, sustained by the upright portion of
                    the presses, also of iron. Spiral staircases are to be avoided. Lifts may be
                    introduced with advantage. In many college libraries in America <hi
                    rend="italic">{e.g.</hi> at Princeton) the circular form, with cases radiating
                    from the centre, has been adopted successfully. The spacious rotundas of the
                    British Museum and that of the Liverpool Free Public Library are good examples
                    of the circular reading-room.</p>
                <p>Mr Justin Winsor has devised an excellent plan for a library of one million
                    volumes capacity (see “Library Buildings,” in <hi rend="italic">Report on Public
                    Libraries of U.S.,</hi> p. 465), and the same system might be applied to one
                    much less extensive. Another distinguished American librarian, Mr W. F. Poole of
                    Chicago, has made some novel suggestions on library architecture which have met
                    with considerable approval. He objects to the waste of space in the central
                    portion of most large library rooms, to the difficulty of ventilating and
                    heating them, to shelving books in galleries on the walls, to the destruction of
                    bindings from gas and heat (“books cannot live where man cannot live ”), to the
                    excessive labour of procuring books from long distances, the insecurity from
                    fire, the inconvenience of keeping many volumes (other than those of reference)
                    in the public reading-room, and the unnecessary cost of the present system. To
                    remedy these defects a plot of land is required 200 feet square, and surrounded
                    with open spaces. At the middle of the principal side may be placed the main
                    building, 60 feet front and 75 feet deep, devoted to administrative and working
                    purposes. The books will be stored, not in one central repository, but in a
                    series of rooms thrown out in wings from the central edifice, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n556/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0556-0537"/> extending round the four sides of the quadrangle
                    with a vacant space in the middle. Each room is 50 feet wide, 15 feet high, and
                    as long as convenient. Ten of these rooms will occupy the ground floor, so that,
                    carrying the same construction four stories high, there will be forty different
                    rooms in the whole structure. Each will be devoted to one large, or two or more
                    small, classes of books. Alcoves and galleries are not to be permitted, but the
                    books will be shelved on the walls or on double presses within reach. Every room
                    will receive light on two sides, will be furnished with tables and chairs for
                    readers, and provided with an attendant; no general readingroom will therefore
                    be wanted. As a protection against fire, each room will be cut off by means of
                    brick fire-walls extending to the roof, and access from one room to the other
                    will be by a light iron corridor on the inside of the quadrangle. At the rear of
                    the central building will be a lift for readers, and there will be staircases as
                    well. In this way, on one story there will be about 25,250 square feet in the
                    different wings, which, after deducting sufficient space for readers’ tables,
                    &amp;c., will give about 20,200 square feet for books. As each square foot will
                    shelve 25 volumes, each story will hold 505,000 volumes, or on the four stories
                    2,020,000 volumes. One of the front rooms (to hold 67,500 volumes) might serve
                    as a circulating library. Mr Poole estimates the cost of such a building in
                    America at $530,000, or complete with shelving and furniture §640,000. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Library Journal,</hi> vi. 69 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> In the
                    same volume, p. 77 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> is a description of the proposed
                    plan for a new national library building at Washington. In this scheme the
                    architect has in view the centralization towards a circular reading-room, good
                    light, the possible expansion of the library for one hundred years,
                    accessibility to all parts, economical administration, and division into
                    different fire-proof compartments.</p>
                <p>Of the various systems for heating libraries open fire-places have the best
                    appearance, are very safe, and best convey heat; close stoves are the cheapest
                    at first hand. Perhaps steam heating is the safest and most economical for large
                    buildings. Unprotected gas jets are very injurious to the books. If gas be used
                    at all, the sun-light system or the Benham light is the best means of conveying
                    away the fumes and heated air. The electric light is used with great success at
                    Liverpool and in the British Museum.</p>

                    be preferred, English oak or the cheaper deal (well seasoned) is the best
                    material; or the presses may be made of iron and the shelves of slate or
                    galvanized iron. At the British Museum the presses are all on one scale and all
                    of the same model,—the standards being of galvanized iron, with holes for brass
                    pins, which are so shaped that the space is altered by merely turning them
                    half-way round. The shelves are also of galvanized iron, covered with leather,
                    on wooden frames; movable pads covered with leather protect the books at either
                    end from being nibbed, and there are leather falls to keep the dust out. In the
                    Radcliffe iron bookcase, invented by Dr Acland, the framework is of iron, and
                    the shelves of wood, faced with leather. It is 7 feet high, and stands on any
                    floor-space 48 inches by 18 inches; books are placed on both sides to the number
                    of 500 octavos. Danner’s revolving bookcase is useful for reference books; it is
                    square, stands about 5 feet high, occupies no more space than a chair, and holds
                    about 250 volumes. Economy of space is also a feature in Mr Virgo’s bookcase,
                    in'the front of which is a door,itself shelved, which, on being swung round,
                    discloses another row of shelves behind. The Eastlake portable bookcase can be
                    taken to pieces, and is madeto stand against a wall. In providing for shelf room
                    it is usual to allow about 110 square feet of shelving to 1000 volumes; and in
                    giving directions for presses and shelves it is well to have them planned upon a
                    uniform scale. Perhaps the best supports for the shelves are Tonks’s movable
                    shelf-fittings, consisting of two rows of metal strips, with oblong perforations
                    at intervals of f inch, in which are inserted small metal plates. The tops of
                    reading tables, trays and barrows for carrying books, and such shelves as may be
                    intended for heavy or choice books, should be padded. Very large volumes had
                    better be kent flat in sliding trays. There is much diversity of opinion as to
                    whether the fronts of the presses should be glazed or not, or whether they
                    should be protected by wooden doors, curtains, or wire screens; many librarians
                    object to glass doors as harbouring dry rot, and to any opaque screen as
                    concealing the books.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the reading-room of the British Museum furnishes a good
                    example of perfect supervision combined with every consideration for the comfort
                    of readers. The tables are here arranged as the spokes of a wheel, with smaller
                    square tables between them for large volumes. Each reader at the radiating
                    tables has a separate place 4 feet 3 inches long, and is screened from his
                    opposite neighbour by a division running along from one end to the other; in
                    front is a hinged desk, with racks, inkstand, and a folding shelf for books. The
                    framework of each table is of iron, forming channels by which air is conveyed
                    through screens at the top of the longitudinal divisions. A tubular foot-rail
                    affords facility for warming the feet in cold weather. The catalogue-stands
                    (with presses of special bibliographies near them) are placed in two concentric
                    circles around the enclosure of the superintendent, who can thus observe every
                    reader in the room.</p>
                <p>A speedy supply of books is ensured by the use of the automatic book-delivery
                    contrived for the Harvard bookstore (of six stories) by Mr Justin Winsor. At the
                    delivery-desk a keyboard shows the digits which combine the various shelf-marks;
                    andthe number of the book wanted, being struck upon it, is repeated at the floor
                    on which the work is located, where it is sought for by an attendant and placed
                    in a box attached to an endless belt, which carefully deposits it on a cushioned
                    receptacle close by the delivery-desk.</p>
                <p>Many English lending libraries find that a great saving of time and trouble both
                    to officials and readers is made by the use of the indicator for public
                    reference. There are many varieties of this invention, but the main principle is
                    a frame containing a series of small pigeon-holes, each numbered and referring
                    by that number to a book; when a volume is lent out, the borrower’s card,
                    &amp;c., are placed in the pigeon-hole and signify that it is absent. This
                    roughly describes the Birmingham indicator (Mr Morgan’s); in that of Mr Elliot,
                    the title of the book is pasted against each pigeonhole; Mr W. H. K. Wright uses
                    at Plymouth a system which serves as a catalogue and register of books lent as
                    well; and Mr A. Cotgreave has improved the original idea by his indicator-book,
                    a sort of ledger of the persons to whom each volume is lent, which is placed in
                    the small pigeon-hole previously spoken of. The cardledger of Mr G. Parr, used
                    at the London Institution, is for the use of the librarians alone and not for
                    the readers; it is applied to a borrowing system which permits several volumes
                    to be taken away by the same person, and also acts as a register of
                    borrowers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>- See <hi

                <p>For the purpose of stamping the name of the library on the books, &amp;c., some
                    persons prefer the embossing stamp, and some the ink stamp now very conveniently
                    made in india-rubber. Props, either to screw upon the shelves, or made of thick
                    blocks of wood, or of tin folded at right angles, are useful for preventing
                    books falling about in a slovenly manner. Reading cases are necessary for
                    periodicals and choice bindings; periodical cases are made conveniently of wood
                    with strong leather backs. In order to keep the consecutive numbers of current
                    periodicals and newspapers clean and in perfect order, some kind of temporary
                    binder is required. The contents of the different shelves or recesses may be
                    printed on labels made of leather or cloth. The “Van Everen” printed numbers and
                    letters for the marks on the shelves and the backs of the books are to be
                    purchased at a small cost.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification and Shelf-Arrangement.—</hi> The defect of most
                    classificatory systems, especially of those which profess to be particularly
                    philosophical and logical, is that they are better adapted for a systematic
                    review of human knowledge than for the arrangement of a miscellaneous collection
                    of books. A small library will not require so extensive a scheme as a larger
                    one, and a popular library needs less minute classification than one for
                    reference or for the use of more learned readers. Again, the classes which are
                    best represented in the library, and its special or local collections, deserve
                    more elaborate treatment than the classes in which it possesses but few volumes.
                    The same system cannot invariably be used in all respects both for the shelves
                    and for the catalogue, as a book can have but one position in the presses, but
                    the title may appear under any number of headings in different parts of the
                    catalogue. For these reasons, the natural order should be followed as far as
                    possible. That is to say, the books should suggest their own classification,
                    which should be made to harmonize with the requirements of the library, and the
                    various classes should not be strained to fit some arbitrary method, however
                    logical in theory. As the title of a book is often an unsafe guide to its
                    contents, no one should attempt classification by the help of the title alone.
                    In vol. ii. of Edwards’s <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Libraries,</hi> he gives a
                    number of schemes both on philosophical and on natural or practical principles;
                    and Petzholdt, in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Bibliographica</hi>
                    (Leipsic, 1866), has drawn up an account of no less than one hundred and
                    seventeen different methods of classification, a number which could now be
                    largely increased, as the practical ingenuity of American librarians alone has
                    added many to the roll. Some of these schemes have been elaborated with great
                    care, but, however interesting on account of the useful hints they may now and
                    then supply, most of them are useless eitheι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> for
                    the catalogue or the shelves. All these are systems to classify the whole range
                    of literature, but there are many classified bibliographies and other guides
                    useful for the scientific arrangement of special departments.<note

                <p>Books are usually arranged upon the shelves either in order of (1) their sizes,
                    (2) authors’ names, (3) subjects, or sometimes (4) of accession, or by a
                    modification of two or more of these systems. The arrangement by subjects is
                    that which displays <pb break="no"

                    collection. Although a library may possess the most complete of subject
                    catalogues, it cannot be considered in perfect order without classification on
                    the shelves. In carrying out shelf-arrangement ample space should be left for
                    additions, and in fixing upon the places of the bookcases those containing the
                    works in most demand should be nearest the point of delivery. In some libraries
                    the books are located without any classification, and the shelf marks are all in
                    all. At Munich and many other Continental libraries there are thirty or forty
                    classes, designated by single or double letters, and the books are arranged in
                    sets of octavo, quarto, and folio in the different classes under the names of
                    their authors, so that Macaulay’s <hi rend="italic">History of England</hi>
                    would be found in the octavo alphabet under M of the class “history.” Mr Richard
                    Garnett supplies an interesting description of the system of classifying books
                    on the shelves followed at the British Museum in the <hi rend="italic">Trans, of
                    Conf of Libs.</hi> (London, 1878, pp. 108,188). There are ten classes:— (1)
                    theology, (2) jurisprudence, (3) natural history and medicine,</p>
                <p>(4) archaeology and arts, (5) philosophy, (6) history, (7) geography, (8)
                    biography, (9) belles lettres, (10) philology; and the classes have five hundred
                    and fifteen divisions. Periodicals, academical publications, state papers, the
                    Oriental departments, the Grenville Library, and the reference library are all
                    distinct, but the principle of classification is practically identical. By
                    allowing intervals in the numbering of the presses space is allowed for new ones
                    to contain additions, and as the different presses are alike in size, they may
                    be shifted at will and no alteration of press-marks is wanted. Mr Edwards <hi
                    rend="italic">{Mem. of Libs.,</hi> ii. 814) proposes a system for a public free
                    library of upwards of thirty thousand volumes to be arran ged under (1)

                <p>(5) sciences and arts, (6) Uterature and polygraphy. A novel scheme, marked with
                    many practical advantages, is the Amherst or Dewey system,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi rend="italic">A Classification and
                    Subject-Index for Cataloguing and Arranging the Books and Pamphlets of a

                    which the library is divided into ten classes, the first being a zero or general
                    class, including bibliography, polygraphy, general periodicals, &amp;c., while
                    the others are philosophy, which is numbered 100; theology, 200; sociology, 300;
                    philology, 400; natural science, 500; useful arts, 600; fine arts, 700;
                    literature, 800; and history, 900. These classes are then separated again into
                    nine special divisions of the main subject, preceded by a zero or general
                    division. Each of these divisions again has nine sections (preceded by a zero).
                    Thus 513 is the third section (geometry) of the first division (mathematics) of
                    the fifth class (natural science). This is the classification or class number,
                    and is affixed to every book and pamphlet belonging to the library. The zero in
                    a class number has its normal power, and signifies a general treatise, so that
                    500 is a book on natural science in general. The system was devised in the first
                    instance for classifying and indexing, but it can also be used for numbering and
                    arranging books and pamphlets on the shelves. For this purpose the absolute
                    location by shelf and bookmarks is wholly abandoned, and the relative location
                    by class and book-number used instead. Accompanying the cZαss-number is the
                    δoo⅛-number, which prevents confusion of different books on the same subject.
                    Thus the first geometry catalogued is marked 513 Ί, the second 513 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2, and so on. The books of each section are all
                    together, arranged by book-numbers, and these sections are also arranged in
                    simple numerical order throughout the library. The number 513’11 will therefore
                    mean the eleventh bookin subject 513, or the eleventh geometry belonging to the
                    library.—A representative specimen of the philosophical method is that devised
                    by Dr W. J. Harris for the catalogue of the Public School Library of St Louis,
                    which is classed in a modified form of the Baconian plan. The main classes are
                    (1) science, including philosophy, theology, social and political sciences, and
                    natural science and the useful arts, (2) art, (3) history, (4) appendix,
                    including polygraphy, cyclopaedias, and periodicals. These main classes are
                    again divided into one hundred subclasses, many of which are divided still
                    further. Thus, under natural history, class 50 is zoology; 50α, vertebrates; 50«
                    i., mammals, &amp;c.—The divisions <hi rend="italic">Médecine</hi> and <hi

                <p>Every volume upon the shelves should have a mark to indicate its position. One
                    system is to designate each press by a number, each shelf by a letter, and if
                    necessary, each volume on the shelf by another consecutive number, so that 13 D
                    16 is the sixteenth volume on the fourth shelf of the thirteenth press. The
                    principles underlying numbering systems as well as shelf-arrangement are
                    discussed by Mr Melvil Dewey (see <hi rend="italic">Library Journal,</hi> iv. 7,
                    75, 117, 191), and the combined system of numbering and arranging of Mr J∙
                    Schwartz, as well as his mnemonic system of classification <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ib.,</hi> iii. <hi rend="italic">6</hi>; iy. 3), are also well worth
                    attention. The new scheme of classification devised for the use of the Boston
                    Athenaeum by</p>
                <p>Mr Cutter is also described in the <hi rend="italic">Library Jotιrnal,</hi> iv.
                    234. A catalogue for the Winchester Library (1879) was prepared by Mr Cutter on
                    the principles there detailed.</p>
                <p>Many authorities strongly recommend that, instead of a fixed mark for the
                    shelves, the location of books should be indicated by a running number or
                    combination of letters and numbers; so that, although the books should not
                    always remain in the same place, their relative position would be unaltered,
                    and, while they could be found just as readily by means of the number, any
                    quantity ot additions could be introduced without affecting the whole
                    scheme.</p>
                <p>In a circulating library it may be found convenient to designate each press by
                    letter, and to omit to number the shelves from top to bottom, but number each
                    volume consecutively. The shelf-notation may be placed inside each volume or on
                    a label upon the back.</p>

                    longer under all circumstances, and is always better treated by readers. Morocco
                    resists wear and tear and the action of gas and heated air better than any other
                    leather. Vellum is the most durable material, but it is not suitable for all
                    purposes. Then follow in order of merit calf, russia, basil, roan, buckram, and
                    cloth. Morocco should be used as much and russia as little as possible. Buckram,
                    linoleum, cretonne, leatherette, &amp;c., have met with favour from time to
                    time, but are not recommended. Olive, light brown, and red are said to be the
                    most lasting colours; then come dark blue and green, light blue and green. Black
                    is a lasting colour. Some persons assign a particular colour to each class of
                    literature, but, as there are more classes than colours to suit them, such an
                    arrangement consistently carried out can only lead to confusion; besides, a want
                    of variety on the shelves destroys at once the individual appearance which it is
                    always desirable to give to each set of books in order to make them easily
                    distinguishable. The council of the Library Association have suggested as a
                    pattern for ordinary library binding that the volumes should be sewn all along,
                    with the first and last sheets overcast, on strong cords, the slips to be drawn
                    in all along, and the backs made close (flexible); half-bound, with corners of
                    same material; smooth cloth sides; edges cut, sprinkled, and burnished, or, if
                    so directed, top edge only cut, &amp;c., the others trimmed and· left with
                    proof; end-papers of stout Cobb’s paper, with cloth joints in quartos and
                    folios; lettered with author’s name, short title, and date; gilt fillets, but no
                    other tooling; two-page plates to be guarded so as to open out flat; all
                    materials of the best quality, and the work to be done carefully.<note

                    suggested by the Library Association should be decided, upon. Full instructions
                    should always accompany work sent out, and a copy must be kept in a
                    binding-register. Rare and valuable books demand special treatment and a special
                    binder. The British Museum authorities have adopted a style of binding in
                    half-morocco, with the leather coming only just over the back to act as a hinge,
                    the sides whole cloth, the corners tipped with vellum.</p>
                <p>How to deal with pamphlets is a troublesome question. At the British Museum each
                    was formerly done up separately in slight binding. This is certainly the best
                    system, but out of the reach of most libraries from its cost. Failing this, the
                    pamphlets can be arranged in solander cases as they come in, and afterwards
                    bound up in volumes according to size and subject, with the contents marked on
                    the fly leaf of each. The rebinding of a MS. is to be avoided; it is better to
                    preserve the old cover and place the book in a case. Drawings and prints are
                    best preserved in sunk mounts, and maps, charts, &amp;c., should be backed with
                    thin linen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Practical Hints.—</hi> Collate every volume when it comes in,
                    so as to prevent binder’s imperfections; remove plate-paper when the book is
                    quite dry; strings and silk registers are to be avoided, as they tear the
                    leaves; preserve old bindings as far as possible, and do not permit book-plates,
                    the names of former owners, and MS. notes of any kind to be destroyed; be

                    hurry the binder overmuch, as he may retaliate by returning his work
                    insufficiently dried and pressed; be careful with letterings; index dictionaries
                    and works of reference on the fore edges; bind up paper wrappers; never let a
                    binder exercise his fatal proclivity to cut away full margins.</p>

                    Cataloguing.—</hi> A library is useless without a proper equipment of good
                    catalogues, which to be thoroughly efficient should be compiled upon a
                    well-considered plan, carefully kept up to date, and made accessible to every
                    reader. The variety of different catalogues is very great, and no one form can
                    be adopted alike by libraries for study and those for popular reading, nor yet
                    by those which combine the two functions in whatever proportions. As regards the
                    amount of information necessary to be given, the titles of the books may be
                    either short, or not more than a single line to each, as in the <hi
                    rend="italic">London Library Catalogue</hi> (1875); medium, or several lines to
                    each, as in the <hi rend="italic">Royal Academy Library Catalogue</hi> (1877);
                    or full, as in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Huth Library, 5</hi> vols,
                    large 8vo (1880), where the title is copied in extenso and a quantity of
                    bibliographical details are added.</p>
                <p>The chief questions to be answered by a catalogue are :—1. Has the library a
                    certain work by a certain author? 2. What has it by any given author? 3. Has it
                    a certain book of which the title only is known to the inquirer? 4. Has it a
                    certain book of which the subject only is known to the inquirer? 5. What has it
                    on a given subject? 6. What works in certain classes or languages has it? To
                    supply this information, catalogues are arranged sometimes under the names of
                    the authors in alphabetical order (1 and 2); or under the first words of the
                    titles (3); or classified under subjects, whether in alphabetical or systematic
                    order (4 and 5); or by a combination of two or more of these methods. A
                    dictionary-catalogue answers all six questions under the names of authors, the
                    titles of books, the subjects and forms of literature (t.e., essays, or French,
                    German, &amp;c.), which are arranged in one alphabet and connected one with the
                    other by a complete system of cross-references. A modified form of short-title
                    dictionary-catalogue, with the names of authors, titles of books, and subjects
                    in one alphabet, is a useful type for a popular library to adopt. No
                    authorcatalogue can be considered complete without an index of subjects,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of such an index a very
                    complete specimen may be seen in the <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Royal

                    requires an index of authors, if alphabetical, and of both authors and classes
                    if systematic. An ideal catalogue would furnish references under each name and
                    subject to every work, part of work, or even magazine article contained in the
                    library which illustrated it. This can rarely be attempted, but a near approach
                    to perfection is shown by the new catalogues of the Boston Athenaeum and the
                    Brooklyn Mercantile Library; the last is a model of thoroughness. It is becoming
                    a laudable practice to give the contents of collected works and periodicals in
                    catalogues; and good examples of the value of annotations are the catalogues of
                    the classes of history, biography, travel, and historical fiction in the Boston
                    Public Library.</p>
                <p>In making choice of a form of catalogue the way is sufficiently plain should the
                    alphabetical system under authors be adopted, neither can there be much cause
                    for discussion in fixing upon an alphabetical subject-catalogue; but, should it
                    be decided to compile a systematic subject-catalogue, the question becomes a
                    much more serious one. A subject-index of some sort is an indispensable
                    supplement to any catalogue merely arranged under authors. The references had
                    better be strictly alphabetical in form; for instance, a work on ants should be
                    indexed under that word and not under the general heading of insects or
                    entomology; but there is no reason why there should not be cross references
                    under the larger to the smaller headings. In an appendix to Mr Cutter’s article
                    on “Library Catalogues”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    rend="superscript"> δ</hi> there is a descriptive list of more than a thousand
                    printed catalogues of American libraries, among which many useful types might be
                    selected. All the printed catalogues of European libraries which were published
                    before 1840 are mentioned in Vogel’s <hi rend="italic">Literatur</hi><hi

                <p>Librarians should take a share in the compilation of their catalogues at any
                    sacrifice of time and trouble, for by no other means can they obtain so exact an
                    acquaintance with their collections. No cataloguer should be allowed to prepare
                    a title except from the very copy of the book which he is cataloguing.</p>
                <p>In order to secure precision and uniformity in the descriptions of the books and
                    in the headings under which they are placed, some well-considered code of rules
                    is absolutely necessary as a guide to the cataloguer. All such rules are founded
                    more or less upon those of the British Museum, printed in 1841,<note

                    of the Cambridge University Library have also printed their rules. In drawing up
                    a set of rules the special wants of the library and the readers should be first
                    considered, and then the most suitable rules chosen from one or other of the
                    schemes mentioned above. But when rules are decided upon, no alteration should
                    be permitted during the compilation of the catalogue, as bad rales uniformly
                    followed are better than good rales without uniformity.</p>
                <p>Among disputed questions, that of how best to describe the sizes of books is
                    perhaps the most difficult. What is wanted is a system that can be understood by
                    every one, and which is capable of being applied to old as well as to new
                    books.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See C. Evans, in

                    the introduction of machine-made paper about the beginning of the century, the
                    correct bibliographical size may be derived from the fold of the sheet, that is,
                    roughly speaking, a quarto is a sheet folded four times, an octavo eight times,
                    &amp;c. The great variety of modern papers (a different scale of sizes being
                    used in each country) renders this method no longer available, and it seems
                    generally admitted that some system of fixed measurements of heights to denote
                    certain sizes is wanted for library purposes. A report on the subject, giving
                    details of three rival schemes, including that of the American Library
                    Association, an ingenious adaptation of the “demy” scale paper, and one
                    following the ordinary binder’s scale, may be found in <hi rend="italic">Trans.,
                    d∙c., of Manchester Meeting,</hi> 1880 (p. 11), of the Library Association. A
                    committee of the same body subsequently devised a plan which endeavoured to
                    embrace the different merits of all three schemes, but it has not yet been geι.
                    rally adopted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>Printed catalogues are doubtless costly, and they soon become out of date, but
                    they are much easier to consult than manuscript volumes, and possess the great
                    advantage that they admit of being used away from the library. On the whole the
                    balance of convenience is strongly in their favour, and few libraries of any
                    importance fail to print as soon as they can. For free public libraries printed
                    catalogues are absolutely necessary, and they are extremely useful in those of a
                    more learned or special character.</p>
                <p>As regards the form of catalogue most suitable for library reference,
                    card-catalogues are used comparatively little in England, but are found to act
                    satisfactorily in many American libraries. They possess many peculiar
                    advantages, among others being the facility with which titles may be added,
                    withdrawn, or rearranged. Readers do not object to turning over the cards, as
                    the labour is shortened by indexes standing above the rows; and there are many
                    contrivances to prevent the unauthorized removal of the titles.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ι° The Bonnange and other
                    systems of card-catalogues are described in <hi rend="italic">Report on Public

                <p>It is obvious that, if a universal catalogue of printed literature existed, it
                    would be only necessary for each library to mark in a copy the particular works
                    it chanced to possess. Such a plan on a small scale has been adopted in many
                    cathedral and college libraries, where a copy of the Bodleian printed catalogue
                    is used for the purpose. A satisfactory step in the direction of co-operative
                    cataloguing has been made by Mr Henry Stevens in his proposals for a
                    bibliographical clearing-house,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Transactions of Conference of
                    Librarians,</hi> London, 1878, p. 70.</p></note> which shall supply exact copies
                    of the title pages of rare (and eventually of more common) books by means of
                    photography. Mr Stevens has now many thousands of these “photograms” of titles,
                    which are all reduced to a uniform scale, with the full titles and collations
                    added in ordinary type. They are very convenient for card-catalogues.</p>
                <p>Thus far the wants of readers have been principally considered; but librarians
                    ought to possess two other kinds of very important catalogues, which they must
                    keep up in their own interests. The first is the accessions-catalogue, or record
                    of every book, part of book, pamphlet, or periodical as it comes in; and the
                    second the shelf-catalogue, or stock-book of the library, a register of the
                    contents<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n559/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0559-0540"/> of every press and every shelf. These tell the
                    source and date of every addition, and enable all the books to be checked at any
                    time. A novel form of accessions-catalogue is that of the Liverpool Free Public
                    Library, which is a sort of large photographic album to show printed titles of
                    accessions in alphabetical order; loose sheets are laced into the body of the
                    catalogue to provide for any number of additions as quickly as possible. In the
                    same library the titles of new books are also pasted upon blocks arranged in a
                    frame for the information of readers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> In any library which manages its own
                    financial matters, however small, all accounts should be as carefully kept as
                    those of a trading establishment. In the same way a periodical stock-taking
                    should be made by means of the shelf-catalogue. It is a great convenience to
                    display recent accessions for a short time in some place put apart for the
                    purpose. A recommendation and complaint-book are both useful. The rapid and
                    efficient supply of books is greatly promoted by requiring that all demands
                    should be made in writing and not verbally. The books should be carefully dusted
                    from time to time by experienced persons; and the leaves of all new books,
                    &amp;c., should be cut by the library staff.</p>
                <p>In issuing and taking note of books lent, either the ledger or the slip-system
                    may be used, or a combination of the two, something like a shelf-catalogue.
                    Accounts are kept either against the borrower, against the book, or against
                    time; the first, with the ledger system, may be well for small libraries, but in
                    larger institutions the slip-system must be resorted to, and it is better to
                    keep the accounts against the books, with perhaps a ledger-index of borrowers.
                    Where more than one volume is lent at a time a small card is sometimes placed in
                    a pocket in each book; the card, whether marked with borrower’s name, &amp;c.,
                    or not, being retained as a voucher, as in the ‘ ‘ card-ledger” spoken of on p.
                    537, which is on the slip-system with the account against the borrower. The
                    special feature of the “card-ledger” is that no writing whatever is required. It
                    is necessary to introduce some device for overdrawn or reserved books.</p>
                <p>Besides furnishing the materials for reading, it is now recognized that a popular
                    library has also the function of indicating ⅛e method of reading and study. A
                    collection of well-chosen books suitable for girls and boys is now a good
                    feature in many English free libraries. At the Providence Public Library, Rhode
                    Island, Mr W. E. Foster issues daily notes on current topics and events, with
                    detailed references by which the subject maybe illustrated by the resources of
                    the library; more complete special lists, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> on
                    Herbert Spencer, Irish landlord and tenant, &amp;c., are also issued from time
                    to time. Library lectures are now given at several free libraries in Engand,
                    but, to make these efforts distinctly useful in adding to the good work of the
                    institution, they should be restricted to lectures on books and courses of
                    reading, so that, by illustrating certain works or departments of the library,
                    these lectures may gradually lead readers to a more careful consideration of
                    literature. Aimless and purposeless reading is the bane of a free public
                    library, and it should be the desire of its authorities to do what can be done
                    to induce people to use with due circumspection books of a higher class and of a
                    more useful and informing character. The admirable catalogue of history,
                    biography, and travel of the Boston Public Library, with its suggestive notes
                    and illustrations, had the effect of lowering the reading of fiction from 74 per
                    cent, to 69 per cent. In the same library even the reading of novels has been
                    elevated by the catalogue of English prose fiction arranged on the same
                    plan.</p>
                <p>Experience shows that in all that relates to such questions as preliminary forms,
                    age of readers, days and hours of admission, Sunday-opening, access to
                    catalogues, shelves, and librarians, fines, loans of books, guarantees, number
                    of volumes allowed, time of reading, &amp;c., a liberal tendency is always
                    beneficial both to the library and the public.</p>
                <p>In view of an outbreak of fire, some well considered plan should be fixed upon.
                    Extincteurs and hand-pumps should be kept ready for use in central positions.
                    The means for extinguishing fire should be familiar to the members of the staff,
                    who should all be practised in fire-drill, in order that each may know his
                    proper place and duty in case of emergency. Full directions should be suspended
                    in conspicuous places. In the case of fire breaking out after library hours, it
                    should be thoroughly understood where the keys are to be found, what officials
                    should be sent for, and what apparatus is ready for use within the building.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Librarians.—</hi> Without insisting upon quite so wide a range
                    of subjects as did F. A. Ebert in his <hi rend="italic">Bildung des
                    Bibliothekars</hi> (Leipsic, 1820), one may expect the librarian of a great
                    library to be a man of liberal education, and specially endowed with sympathy
                    with books and reading; a practical acquaintance with bibliography, including
                    palaeography, and bibliology, is also necessary, as well as with the theory and
                    practice of library management. To be thoroughly qualified, a librarian should
                    have had the practical experience of library-work which it is impossible to
                    obtain from any amount of book reading. Besides this, he ought to be a man of
                    business habits and a good administrator.</p>
                <p>These acquirements imply qualifications of a somewhat higher character than may
                    perhaps be necessary in all public libraries; but some knowledge of languages
                    and literatures, bibliography, bibliology, and generallibrary management should
                    be possessed by any person holding the chief position in the administration of
                    any library, however small. As regards the qualifications of the librarian of a
                    popular institution or of library-assistants, it may be useful to give the
                    outline of a plan recently proposed by a committee of the Library Association
                    for their examination (see <hi rend="italic">Monthly Notes,</hi> vol. ii. ).
                    There should be a preliminary examination, chiefly in the subjects of a sound
                    English education, special attention being paid to English literature;
                    proficiency in the elements of one or more classical or modern languages would
                    be specially indorsed upon the certificate, one language to be necessary. The
                    suggested subjects for the preliminary examination are—arithmetic, English
                    grammar and composition, English history, geography, and English literature.
                    After having been engaged in library work for not less than one year, a
                    second-class certificate might be awarded to any librarian or assistant who
                    should pass a satisfactory examination in English literature, especially of the
                    last hundred years, some one other European literature, principles of the
                    classification of the sciences, elements of bibliography, including cataloguing
                    and library management,— a cataloguing knowledge of at least two languages
                    besides English to be necessary. A first-class certificate would be given, after
                    a satisfactory examination, to a librarian or assistant of at least two years’
                    experience, for an advanced knowledge of the subjects last mentioned, with the
                    addition of general literary history. A cataloguing knowledge of at least three
                    languages would be necessary for the higher certificate,—an acquaintance with
                    any others, as well as proficiency in any subjects (not more than two in number)
                    offered by the candidate, being specially indorsed.</p>
                <p>Women are gradually making their way in libraries. At Manchester and elsewhere
                    they are successfully employed as assistants; and in several other places in
                    England the chief charge of the library is maintained in a very efficient manner
                    by a lady. In the United States the majority of the librarians are ladies (at
                    the Boston Public Library no less than two-thirds of the staff), and many of the
                    most accomplished cataloguers are of the same sex.</p>
                <p>The first general meeting of librarians took place at New York, September 15 to
                    17,1853, upon an invitation signed by Professor C. C. Jewett, Mr W. F. Poole,
                    and others ‘ ‘ for the purpose of conferring together upon the means of
                    advancing the prosperity and usefulness of public libraries, and for the
                    suggestion and discussion of topics of importance to book collectors and
                    readers.” About eighty persons attended, many questions were debated, and the
                    suggestion to form a permanent association met with considerable favour. Nothing
                    came of it, however, and twenty-three years had elapsed when, having in view the
                    Centennial Exhibition of 1876, a second meeting was convened on October 4 to 6,
                    at Philadelphia, which was attended by one hundred and two Americans and one
                    English representative. At the Philadelphia conference of 1876, the American
                    Library Association, which has since done so much good work in practical
                    librarianship, was founded. In October 1877 a conference of librarians was held
                    in London, under the presidency of the late Mr J. Winter Jones, and attended by
                    two hundred and sixteen librarians and others, including representatives of the
                    French, German, and Greek Governments, all the chief libraries of the United
                    Kingdom, as well as certain of those of the United States, Belgium, Denmark,
                    France, Italy, and Australia. Altogether one hundred and forty different
                    libraries sent representatives, and nearly the whole field of library-science
                    was reviewed at the different sittings. <hi rend="italic">The Transactions and
                    Proceedings of the Conference of Librarians</hi> (London, 1878) is the title of
                    the official report of the meeting. The chief result of the conference was
                    perhaps the foundation of the Library Association of the United Kingdom, of
                    which the “main object shall be to unite all persons engaged or interested in
                    library work, for the purpose of promoting the best possible administration of
                    libraries; it shall also aim at the encouragement of bibliographical research.”
                    Monthly meetings of the association take place at the London Institution, and
                    the members hold an annual conference in some one or other locality, where the
                    different libraries are inspected, various questions of library economy are
                    discussed, and new library appliances are exhibited. Full reports of these
                    meetings have been published; <hi rend="italic">Monthly Notes</hi> are also
                    issued. Every important British library is now represented in the association,
                    which numbers over 360 members.</p>

                <p>So necessary is bibliography in library selection that Dr Cogswell, as a
                    preliminary step to collecting books for the Astor Library, formed a
                    bibliographical apparatus of five thousand volumes to help him in his arduous
                    task. To assist librarians and collectors in their choice, among earlier works
                    may be mentioned that of G. Peignot, <hi rend="italic">Manuel du
                    Bibliophile,</hi><hi rend="italic">ou traité du choix des livres,</hi> Dijon,
                    1823, still interesting on account of the descriptions of the favourite reading
                    of eminent men. <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of my English Library</hi> (London,
                    1853) is the title of a little volume prepared by Mr Henry Stevens to assist in
                    getting together the best editions of the standard English authors. The idea was
                    followed on a larger scale by Μ. Hector Bossange in <hi rend="italic">Ma
                    Bibliothèque Française</hi> (Paris, 1855). The best guide for ordinary purposes,
                    but far from perfect, is <hi rend="italic">The best Reading: hints on the

                    F. B. Perkins (4th ed., New York, 1877). The list is restricted to books now in
                    the market; prices are appended. The titles are very brief, and are arranged in
                    an alphabet of subjects; and a selection is appended of the chief French,
                    German, Italian, and Spanish authors. A new edition of Porter’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Books and Reading</hi> appeared in 1881. Current German literature

                    trade journals, will guide in the acquisition of the books of the day. The

                    are glad to have before them. An examination of the authorities quoted by
                    authors of repute will frequently help in deciding upon the merits of rival
                    treatises, and the printed catalogues of well-chosen libraries are also useful.
                    To his practical little treatise, <hi rend="italic">Free Libraries and
                    Newsrooms,</hi> Mr J. D. Mullins appends a list of books he considers desirable
                    for free public libraries, and to form the basis of a collection of high-class
                    fiction, Mr F. B. Perkins has drawn up a list of the best hundred novels
                    procurable in English <hi rend="italic">{Library Journal,</hi> i. 166). The <hi
                    rend="italic">Coming Catalogue,</hi> about which we hear now and then from
                    America, will contain selected lists of books, with short notes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acquisition of Books.—</hi> Public libraries must look to
                    purchases as their chief means of getting the books they want. The best system
                    is to draw up lists of the desired works and editions, and circulate the lists
                    among the leading booksellers, who will notify the prices and conditions of the
                    copies they may be able to supply; announcements of books wanted can also be
                    inserted in the booksellers’ trade organs. Second-hand booksellers will
                    willingly furnish their catalogues, which, if they are not required to purchase
                    from, are always useful for reference. It is usually more convenient to give
                    commissions for books at sales than for the librarian to attend in person; but
                    an occasional visit to the auction rooms will give much information as to
                    current prices of books, a matter which, coupled with frequent visits to the
                    shops of second-hand booksellers and the diligent study of their catalogues,
                    will be carefully attended to by the capable librarian. The works of Bnrnet,
                    Lowndes, and Graesse may also be consulted for the prices of old books. It is
                    perhaps needless to add that the state of condition and binding makes a great
                    difference in the market value of copies of the same book. Libraries will
                    frequently dispose of their duplicates or surplus copies to other institutions
                    at a low price. For new books, periodicals, newspapers, &amp;c., special terms
                    may always be arranged with local tradesmen.</p>
                <p>From time to time the’Governments of Great Britain, France, and the United States
                    have had under consideration various schemes for the international exchange of
                    books upon a systematic basis, but the proposals were never carried into effect,
                    and it was left to the public spirit of a French gentleman, Μ. Alexandre
                    Vattemare, to devise and carry out for some years a large scheme for the
                    interchange of books among the chief public institutions of Europe and America.
                    In 1853 Μ. Vattemare was able to state that one hundred and thirty such
                    establishments had participated in the benefits of the system, but unfortunately
                    it gradually fell ofl ’. Earlier than 1851, however, a similar agency was in
                    full working order at the Smithsonian Institution, and it has been kept up with
                    efficiency to the present time. The institution acts as a medium for the
                    exchange of their publications among the chief learned bodies and other public
                    institutions of Europe and America, and undertakes the cost of receiving and
                    sorting the parcels, and the renumeration of the agents in the chief centres of
                    the Old World to whom they are sent, and by whom they are distributed free of
                    charge. The corresponding societies are only required to deliver their parcels
                    without expense at Washington.</p>
                <p>On several occasions the United States Congress has passed special Acts directing
                    the exchange of Government publications with those of other countries, and in
                    1848 the joint committee on the library was authorized to appoint agents for the
                    exchange of books and public documents. As the scheme did not appear to work
                    satisfactorily, the Act was repealed four years later. But since 1867 it has
                    been ordered that fifty copies of all documents printed by either House of
                    Congress or by any Government department be placed with the joint committee on
                    the library, to be exchanged for foreign works. It is most unfortunate that this
                    enlightened policy is not followed by the English authorities. t</p>
                <p>Many learned bodies which issue their proceedings willingly present them to
                    libraries, and authors find this a useful means of spreading a knowledge of
                    their works, when they are not of sufficient public interest to ensure a large
                    or rapid sale. Library committees may often secure valuable additions by a
                    discreet application; indeed, privately printed works and local publications
                    (unless given spontaneously) are almost only to be had in this manner.</p>
                <p>Many valuable works are issued at the expense of Governments. It might be
                    naturally expected that these should be sent, free of charge, to all public
                    libraries of any importance. In England, however, this is not done. In countries
                    where the public libraries are subject to the minister of public instruction, as
                    in France and Italy, more is done in this direction, especially as regards
                    expensive volumes. In 1853 a select committee of the House of Commons
                    recommended that parliamentary paper's should be sent free of charge to free
                    public libraries, but the recommendation has never been carried out.</p>
                <p>In America official publications can be obtained without charge by public
                    institutions from the secretary of the interior upon the order of a senator or
                    representative, but the system is said not to be in a satisfactory
                    condition.</p>
                <p>Many valuable English Government publications, notably the state papers and
                    chronicles, and the fine art handbooks of the South Kensington Museum, are
                    easily to be had at less than the cost of production, and parliamentary papers
                    are neither inaccessible nor highly priced. Although there is no fixed rule as
                    to distribution, some of the departments may now and then be induced to present
                    copies of their publications on being applied to in a proper manner.</p>
                <p>The privilege of demanding copies of all books, periodicals, news- <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> papers, musical publications, maps, and prints, when
                    published,: under the provisions of the various Copyright Acts, is enjoyed by .
                    only a very few, generally only by one, of the chief national libraries in each
                    country. This system has grown up under the different enactments of the
                    censorship of the press. The first Act of Parliament passed in England to enjoin
                    printers to present their publications was that of 14 Charles II. c. 33, which
                    directed that <hi rend="italic">three</hi> copies should be sent, one to his
                    Majesty’s library, and one to each of the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
                    By 8 Queen Anne c. 20 the number was increased to <hi rend="italic">nine,</hi>
                    and by the 41 George III. c. 107 to <hi rend="italic">eleven,</hi> viz., to (1)
                    the Royal Library; (2) University Library of Cambridge; (3) Bodleian Library;
                    (4) Edinburgh University Library; (5) Glasgow University Library; (6) King’s
                    College Library, Aberdeen; (7) University Library, St Andrews; (8) Sion College
                    Library, London; (9) Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh; (10) Trinity College
                    Library, Dublin; (11) King’s Inns Library, Dublin. This was in force till 1835,
                    when by the 6 &amp; 7 William IV. c. 110 the privilege was abolished as regards
                    six of the eleven libraries mentioned, and a yearly grant, estimated at £3028,
                    allowed in compensation. The Act under which five libraries, viz., the British
                    Museum, the Bodleian, the Cambridge University, the Advocates’, Edinburgh, and
                    Trinity College, Dublin, now receive the copyright books is 5 &amp; 6 Vict. c.

                <p>As instances of the variety in practice in different countries, it may be
                    mentioned that in France the Bibliothèque Nationale is entitled to a copy of
                    every book, &amp;c., printed within the dominion of the republic; in Belgium and
                    the Netherlands one copy must be sent to the respective national libraries in
                    order to secure the advantages of copyright; in Spain the Biblioteca Nacional of
                    Madrid enjoys the privilege of one copy; in Portugal two copies are claimed, one
                    by the Bibliotheca Nacional at Lisbon, and one by the Bibliotheca Publica of
                    Oporto; in the United States a copy of every work must be sent to the library of
                    Congress; the Imperial Library at St Petersburg receives two copies of every
                    book printed in Russia; by the Brazilian law the Biblioteca Nacional of Rio de
                    Janeiro is entitled to a copy of everything published within the municipality;
                    and in Mexico two copies have to be delivered to the National Library.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Authoritics.—</hi> There have been many books written about
                    library-management; a complete list of those published down to about 1865, with

                    rend="italic">Bibliographien</hi> (Leipsic, 1866). Among recent treatises the

                <p>TABLES OF THE PRINCIPAL LIBRARIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.</p>
                <p>In compiling the following tables officials of each of the libraries have been
                    personally applied to, and in most instances the information has been supplied
                    by them. An attempt has been made to give particulars of all libraries of
                    general or special interest in the United Kingdom. As regards those of other
                    countries the list has been usually limited to those of 30,000 vols, and
                    upwards, with a few exceptions. In India and the British Colonies there are few
                    collections of that extent.</p>
                <p>The abbreviation L. A. in the United Kingdom signifies that the library is under
                    the Public Libraries’ Act; o. b. 1. means open bv leave.</p>
