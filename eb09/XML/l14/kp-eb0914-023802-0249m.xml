                <p><label type="entry">LAMECH</label>, η??, is a name which appears in each of the
                    antediluvian genealogies, Gen. iv. 16-24 and Gen. v. In the first he is a
                    descendant of Cain, and through his three sons father of the several avocations
                    of early civilization; in the latter he is father of Noah. In each case, though
                    in different senses, he marks the close of the first epoch of the world’s
                    history. Since the publication of Buttmann’s <hi rend="italic">Mythologus</hi>
                    it has come to be generally recognized that the two genealogies terminating in
                    Lamech are divergent forms of a single list. The parallelism of the two is not
                    confined to the identical names, Lamech and Enoch. Methuselah (Mα0oυσαλα) not
                    Methusael is the true reading of the LXX. in Gen. iv. 18, and there are some
                    textual grounds for thinking that in the same verse Mehujael has displaced an
                    older reading Mahalaleel. Kainan again is closely akin to Cain, and there is
                    also a less close resemblance between Jared and Irad, while Enos (Enosh) and
                    Adam both mean <hi rend="italic">man.</hi> Thus the two series beginning with
                    Enosh and Adam and ending in Lamech do not vary more than is often the case with
                    different recensions of ancient name lists. See especially Lagarde, <hi
                    rend="italic">Orientalia,</hi> ii. 33 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> Again it has
                    been pointed out, especially by Wellhausen, <hi rend="italic">Jahrb. f D.
                    Theol.,</hi> 1876, p. 400 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> that Gen. iv. 16-24 is in
                    its original conception quite distinct from the history of the curse of Cain
                    (Gen. iv. 1-15), and offers the history of the beginnings of existing
                    civilization (verse 20 s&lt;2∙), not of a civilization extinguished by the
                    flood; and the continuation of this narrative is plausibly sought in the history
                    of the tower of Babel, according to which the human race entered Babylonia from
                    the east (comp. iv. 16 with xi. 2), whereas the movements of the sons of Noah
                    start from Ararat. On this view we are to suppose that the oldest literary
                    source of the Hebrew history of the origins of our race ignored the flood, and
                    traced the beginnings of city life to a land east of Eden (Nod), which has no
                    place in later geography, and of which Cain was the first settler. Lamech is a
                    descendant of Cain, under whose sons the different special avocations of a very
                    primitive civilization differentiate themselves. The mass of the people are tent
                    dwellers and shepherds, their “father” or the patron of their occupation being
                    Jabal; but the arts are also developed in two branches, the “father” of
                    minstrelsy being Jubal, while the art of metallurgy is traced back to Tubal Cain
                    (LXX. simply Θo∕3eλ). The etymologies of the proper names throw little light on
                    this interesting conception; that of Lamech is quite obscure,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The conjectures and supposed
                    parallels offered by Ewald (Geschichte, i. 382, 391; Jαhrb. vi. 2) and Movers
                    (i. 476 sy) offer no safe basis for speculation. G. Smith (Chaldaean Genesis,
                    ch. xvii.) proposes to identify the name with the Accadian Dumugu and Lamga,
                    “moon.”</p></note> and the names of the sons, if they are Semitic, may be all
                    derived from the root ⅛', expressing the notion of “offspring.” It is indeed
                    conceivable that some of the names are of non-Semitic origin; <hi rend="italic"
                    >tûpal</hi> in Persian and Turkish means bronze, and the nation of Tubal was
                    known to the Hebrews for bronzework (Ezek. xxvii. 13), which would go well
                    enough with the fact that Kayn in Arabic means a smith. But on the other hand
                    the wives and daughters of Lamech, as well as the other two sons, have names
                    that point naturally to Hebrew roots, so that it is very doubtful how far one is
                    entitled to press these foreign analogies in explaining what is certainly one of
                    the oldest Hebrew traditions.</p>
                <p>What we read in Genesis of Lamech and his race seems to be a mere fragment of an
                    older and more copious tradition. He has two wives—Adah (∏7V&gt; “ornament” ?),
                    a name which reappears in Gen. xxxvi. in the genealogy of the Edomites, and
                    Zillah (∙"⅛V, “shadow ”). Ewald gives to these names a mythological colour by
                    making Adah meau “aurora” (Arabic <hi rend="italic">ghadaf)</hi> in contrast to
                    Zillah, “shadow” but in that case we should.expect the LXX. to transcribe the
                    word by Γαδα not Aδa, as Irad is rendered Γαιδαδ. At the same time the
                    unquestionable occurrence of names of gods in the Edomite genealogy where Adah
                    recurs favours the view that something of the same sort may be found in Gen. iv.
                    16 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> On the other hand it is certainly important that
                    the sons of Lamech form two brotherhoods (verse 21) divided by their maternal
                    descent. The fathers of pastoral life and minstrelsy stand apart from the father
                    of metallurgy and his sister Naamah. Handicraft especially in metals is
                    generally practised by foreigners among the Semitic nomads, so that Tubal Cain
                    may very well represent another race, such as the non-Semitic people which
                    introduced metallurgy in Chaldaea according to Assyriologists. The name Naamah
                    (“gracious”) is so plainly akin to the divine name Naaman (No'mân, Adonis) that
                    we can scarcely refuse to compare what is said of her brother with the
                    Phoenician legend in Philo Byblius (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">Pr. Hv.,</hi> I.
                    x. 9) of two brothers, inventors of iron and iron-working, of whom one named
                    Chrysor was skilled in sayings, incantations, and divination, and was worshipped
                    as a sort of Phoenician Hephaestus. The details of Phoenician legend, however,
                    in this as in other cases, are widely divergent from the Bible story.</p>
                <p>The savage “sword song” of Lamech is unique in the Bible, and breathes the true
                    spirit of the desert :—</p>
                <p>Adah and Zillah, hear my voice;</p>
                <p>Ye wives of Lamech, give ear unto my speech.</p>
                <p>I slay a man for a wound, A young man for a stroke; For Cain’s vengeance is
                    sevenfold, But Lamech’s seventyfold and seven.</p>
                <p>In the other form of the genealogy the line of Lamech is dissociated from the
                    guilty Cain and leads up to Noah. This form of the tradition is much more
                    recent, belonging to the Levitical or priestly narrator. Its chief importance is
                    that it shows how inseparably Lamech and his genealogy were connected with the
                    ancestry of the Hebrew race.</p>
