                    (1528-1591), usually known as Fray Luis de Leon, Spanish religious writer, was
                    born about 1528, most probably at Granada, entered the university of Salamanca,
                    where Melchior Cano was a few years his senior, at the age of fourteen, and in
                    1544 became a member of the Augustinian community there. His academical
                    promotion was comparatively rapid; in 1561 he obtained by public competition a
                    theological chair at Salamanca, to which in 1571 was added that of sacred
                    literature. His views in exegesis and Biblical criticism were so far in advance
                    of those of the majority of his immediate contemporaries that he was denounced
                    to the Inquisition for having written a too secular translation of the book of
                    Canticles, and for maintaining the possibility of correcting the text of the
                    Vulgate. In March 1572 he was consequently thrown into prison at Valladolid,
                    where his confinement lasted until December 1576; the charges against him were
                    then abandoned, and he was released with an exhortation to circumspection,
                    moderation, and prudence. He at once resumed his former posts at Salamanca, and
                    the remainder of his days were passed in comparative peace. In 1580 a Latin
                    commentary on Canticles was published, and in 1583-85 he gave to the world three
                    books of a treatise on the names of Christ, which he had written in prison. In
                    1583 also appeared the most popular of his prose works, a treatise entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Perfecta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Casada</hi> (“The Perfect Wife”) for the use of a lady newly married. Shortly
                    before his death, which occurred at Madrigal on August 23, 1591, his appointment
                    to be vicar-general of the Augustinian order was sanctioned by the pope.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly as a poet that Fray Luis de Leon is now remembered and admitted to
                    a high place among the classic authors of Spain. His poetical works include
                    historical translations of all the <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi> and two of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Georgies</hi> of Virgil, some thirty odes of Horace, forty
                    psalms, and passages from the Greek and Italian, all characterized by much
                    spirit and grace of style. The original pieces, which are chiefly religious, not
                    merely possess the technical merits of idiom and versification which perhaps
                    only Castilian ears can appreciate, but in many cases give beautiful expression
                    to feelings which are shared by the whole of the Christian world. Of one in
                    particular, the ode “De la Vida del Cielo,” Hallam has justly remarked that it
                    is “an exquisite piece of lyric poetry, which in its peculiar line of devout
                    aspiration has perhaps never been excelled.” The works of Luis de Leon include a
                    Spanish commentary on Canticles, which was not published until 1798; a
                    translation, in Spanish octaves, of the same book, first printed in 1806; and an
                    exposition of Job, which first appeared in 1779.</p>

                    >proprias y</hi><hi rend="italic">traducciones</hi> was published by Quevedo at
                    Madrid in 1631; another, fuller and more carefully edited, appeared at Valencia
                    in 1761; the latest and best is that of Merino <hi rend="italic">(Obras

                    Storck, appeared at Münster in 1853. There are two recent German monographs on
                    Luis de Leon (Wilkens, <hi rend="italic">Fray Luis de Leon,</hi> Halle, 1866;
