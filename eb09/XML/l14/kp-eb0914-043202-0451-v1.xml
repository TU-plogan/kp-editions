                <p><label type="entry">LEITRIM</label>, a maritime county of Ireland in the province
                    of Connaught, is bounded on the N. W. by Donegal Bay, N.E. by Fermanagh, E. by
                    Cavan, S.E. by Longford, and S.W. by Roscommon and Sligo. Its shape resembles
                    that of an hour-glass. From about 20 miles at the extremities it narrows in the
                    centre to a breadth of only 7 miles, and its greatest length from south-east to
                    north-west is 52 miles. The total area is 376,212 acres, or about 588 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The northern portion of the county consists of an elevated table-land, of which
                    the highest summits are Lugnaquila 1485 feet; Benbo, 1365; and Lacka, 1315. In
                    the southern part the country is comparatively level, and is generally richly
                    wooded. The extent of coast-line is only about 3 miles. The principal river is
                    the Shannon, which, issuing from Lough Allen, forms the south-western boundary
                    of the county with Roscommon. The Bonnet rises in the north-west and flows to
                    Lough Gill, and the streams of Bundrows and Bunduff separate Leitrim from
                    Donegal and Sligo. Besides Lough Allen, which has an area of 8900 acres, the
                    other principal lakes in the county are Lough Macnean, Lough Scur, Lough Gill,
                    and Lough Melvin. A canal from Carrick-on-Shannon passes through the county to
                    Lough Erne.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> The central part of the county
                    round Lough Allen is included in the Connaught coal-field, which both north and
                    south is bounded by carboniferous limestone interspersed with millstone grit and
                    Yoredale beds. In the southern districts there is a considerable extent of bog
                    resting on marl or blue clay. The coal-fields consist of a series of eminences
                    ranging from 1000 to 1377 feet, the most important beds being those to the west
                    of Lough Allen near the Arigna. Only the lower measures remain, and they contain
                    marine fossils. The coal is bituminous, and is well suited for manufacturing
                    purposes; but it is not extensively wrought. In the Yoredale shales of the
                    Coal-measures clay ironstone of a very rich quality is found, and was formerly
                    smelted at the Arigna ironworks on Lough Allen. Lead has been found near
                    Lurganboy, and copper in Benbo mountain. Manganese is obtained in considerable
                    quantities, and also yellow ochre and various kinds of clays and chalks. The
                    most important sulphureous spring is that of Drumsna; and the chalybeate springs
                    of Cavan on the borders of the county, and of Oakfield adjoining the sea-coast,
                    are also much visited.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is very moist and
                    unsuitable for grain crops. On the higher districts the soil is stiff and cold,
                    and, though abounding in stones, very retentive of moisture, but in the valleys
                    there are some very fertile districts resting upon limestone. In the higher
                    regions the chief implement of culture is the spade. Lime, marl, and similar
                    manures are abundant, and on the coast seaweed is plentiful. The total number of
                    holdings in 1880 was 1 4,812, of which only 624 were less than one acre. More
                    than two-thirds of the holdings are included <pb break="no"

                <p>The acreage under crops is thus less than one-fourth of the whole area. In 1880
                    there were 212,374 acres under pasture, and 78,330 waste. The number of horses
                    in 1881 was 3983, of which 2627 were used for agricultural purposes. Between
                    1855 and 1881 cattle diminished from 91,061 to 84,914. The number of milch cows
                    in the latter year was 35,732, the production of butter being one of the
                    principal industries of the small farmer. Sheep diminished from 20,578 in 1855
                    to 11,347 in 1881, and pigs from 20,790 to 19,302. Poultry in 1881 numbered
                    311,920.</p>
                <p>According to the corrected return of 1878 the land was divided among 451 owners
                    possessing 371,371 acres, with a total annual valuation of £135,946. Of the
                    owners about 70 per cent, possessed more than one acre, and the average value
                    per acre was 7s. 3d. The average size of the estates is 823 acres; and the
                    largest owners are Lord Massy, 24,751; Earl of Leitrim, 22,038; George Lane Fox,
                    18,850; Owen Wynne, 15,436; and Arthur L. Tottenham, 14,561.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> These are confined chiefly to coarse linens
                    for domestic purposes, but coarse pottery is also made. In 1880 there were three
                    scutching mills in the county, all driven by water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The Longford and Sligo branch of the Midland
                    Great Western Railway passes through the southern part of the county, and in the
                    northern part there is a branch between Sligo and Bundoran.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county is divided into
                    5 baronies, and contains 17 parishes, with 1489 townlands. It is within the
                    Connaught circuit, and assizes are held at Carrick-on-Shannon, and quarter
                    sessions at Ballinamore, Carrick-on-Shannon, and Manorhamilton. There are two
                    poor-law unions in the county and portions of other three. The county is within
                    the Dublin military district, and there are barracks at Carrick-on-Shaunon. It
                    is in the dioceses of Kilmore and Ardagh. In the Irish House of Commons two
                    members were returned for the county and two for the boroughs of
                    Carrick-on-Shannon and Jamestown, but at the union the boroughs were
                    disfranchised. In 1760 the population was 26,142, which in 1821 had increased to
                    124,785 and in 1841 to 155,309, but in 1861 had diminished to 104,744, in 1871
                    to 95,562, and in 1881 to 89,795, of whom 44,777 were males and 45,018 were
                    females. The total number of emigrants from the county between 1st May 1851 and
                    31st December 1880 was 43,186, a percentage of 41 *2 to the population in 1861.
                    In 1880 the rate of marriages per 1000 of estimated population was 2∙6, of
                    births 22 ’ 4, and of deaths 15 ’ 9. The population is almost entirely rural,
                    the only town being Carrick-on-Shannon, with a population in 1871 of 1442.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Anciently the entire country
                    bordering on Lough Erne, including Fermanagh and Cavan, was, according to
                    Ptolemy, occupied by the Erdini. Afterwards, along with Cavan” Leitrim formed
                    part of the territory of Breffny or Brenny, which was divided into two
                    principalities, of which Leitrim under the name of Hy Bnιin-BretΓny or Brenny
                    formed the western. From the fact that for a long time it was possessed by the
                    O’Rourks descendants of Roderick, king of Ireland, it was also called Breffny
                    O’Rourk. In the 12th century Tiernan O’Rourk was expelled from the government by
                    the princes of Leinster and Connaught, but he was afterwards reinstated by
                    Turlough, king of Ireland, and, although after the arrival of the English it was
                    united to Roscommon, the O’Rourks remained practically independent till the
                    reign of Elizabeth. Large confiscations took place in the reigns of Elizabeth
                    and J âmes I., in the Cromwellian period, and after the Revolution of
                    1688-S9.</p>
                <p>There are “druidical” remains near Fenagh and at Letterfyan, and important
                    monastic ruins at Creevelea near the Bonnet, with several antique monuments, and
                    at Firnagh in the parish of l·enagh. There was an important Franciscan friary at
                    Jamestown. The abbeys of Mohill, Annaduff, and Drumlease have been converted
                    into parish churches. Among the more notable old castles are O’Rourk’s Hall at
                    Dromahaire, now in ruins, Manorhamilton Castle, originally very extensive, but
                    now also in ruins, and Castle John on an island in Lough Scur.</p>
