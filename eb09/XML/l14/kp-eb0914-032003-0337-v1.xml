                    (1825-1864), the originator of the social-democratic movement in Germany, was
                    born at Breslau in 1825. Like Karl Marx, the chief of international socialism,
                    he was of J ewish extraction. His father, a prosperous merchant in Breslau,
                    intended Ferdinand for a business career, and with this view sent him to the
                    commercial school at Leipsic; but the boy, having no liking for that kind of
                    life, got himself transferred to the university, first at Breslau, and afterward
                    at Berlin. His favourite studies were philology and philosophy; he became an
                    ardent Hegelian, and in politics was one of the most advanced. Having completed
                    his university studies in 1845, he began to write a work on Heraclitus from the
                    Hegelian point of view; but it was soon interrupted by more stirring interests,
                    and did not see the light for many years. From the Rhine country, where he
                    settled for a time, he went to Paris, and made the acquaintance of his great
                    compatriot Heine, who conceived for him the deepest sympathy and admiration. In
                    the letter of introduction to Varnhagen von Ense, which the poet gave Lassalle
                    when he returned to Berlin, there is a striking portrait of the young man. Heine
                    speaks of his friend Lassalle as a young man of the most remarkable endowments,
                    in whom the widest knowledge, the greatest acuteness, and the richest gifts of
                    expression are combined with an energy and practical ability which excite his
                    astonishment, but adds, in his half-mocking way, that he is a genuine son of the
                    new era, without even the pretence of modesty or self-denial, who will assert
                    and enjoy himself in the world of realities. At Berlin Lassalle became a
                    favourite in some of the most distinguished circles; even the veteran Humboldt
                    was fascinated by him, and used to call him the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Wunderkind.</hi> Here it was, also, towards the end of 1845, that he met
                    the lady with whom his life was to be associated in so remarkable a way, the
                    Countess Hatzfeldt. She had been separated from her husband for many years, and
                    was at feud with him on questions of property and the custody of their children.
                    With characteristic energy Lassalle attached himself to the cause of the
                    countess, whom he believed to have been outrageously wronged, made a special
                    study of law, and, after bringing the case before thirty-six tribunals, reduced
                    the powerful count to a compromise on terms most favourable to his client. The
                    process, which lasted ten years, gave rise to not a little scandal, especially
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n338/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0338-0321"/> that of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cassettengeschichte,</hi> which pursued Lassalle all the rest of his life.
                    This “affair of the casket” arose out of an attempt by the countess’s friends to
                    get possession of a bond for a large life annuity settled by the count on his
                    mistress, a Baroness Meyendorf, to the prejudice of the countess and her
                    children. Two of Lassalle’s comrades succeeded in carrying off the casket, which
                    contained the lady’s jewels, from the baroness’s room at a hotel in Cologne.
                    They were prosecuted for theft, one of them being condemned to six months’
                    imprisonment; Lassalle, accused of moral complicity, was acquitted on appeal. He
                    was not so fortunate in 1849, when he underwent a year’s durance for resistance
                    to the authorities at Düsseldorf during the troubles of that stormy period. But
                    going to prison was quite a familiar experience in Lassalle’s life. Till 1859
                    Lassalle resided mostly in the Rhine country, prosecuting the suit of his friend
                    the countess, finishing the work on Heraclitus, which was not published till
                    1858, and taking little part in political agitation, but ever a helpful friend
                    of the working men. He was not allowed to live in Berlin because of his
                    connexion with the disturbances of ’48. In 1859, however, he entered the city
                    disguised as a carter, and finally, through the influence of Humboldt with the
                    king, got permission to stay there. The same year he published a remarkable
                    pamphlet on the <hi rend="italic">Italian IVar and the Mission of Prussia,</hi>
                    in which he came forward to warn his countrymen against going to the rescue of
                    Austria in her war with France. He pointed out that if France drove Austria out
                    of Italy she might annex Savoy, but could not prevent the restoration of Italian
                    unity under Victor Emmanuel. France was doing the work of Germany by weakening
                    Austria, the great cause of German disunion and weakness; Prussia should form an
                    alliance with France in order to drive out Austria, and make herself supreme in
                    Germany. After their realization by Bismarck these ideas have become
                    sufficiently commonplace; but they were nowise obvious when thus published by
                    Lassalle. In 1861 he published a great work in two volumes, the <hi
                        rend="italic">System of Acquired Hights.</hi></p>
                <p>Hitherto Lassalle had been known only as the author of two learned works, as
                    connected with an extraordinary lawsuit which had become a wide-spread scandal,
                    and as a young man of whom even the most distinguished veterans expected great
                    things. Now began the short-lived activity which was to give him an historical
                    significance. It was early in 1862, when the struggle of Bismarck with the
                    Prussian liberals was already begun. Lassalle, who had always been a democrat of
                    the most advanced type, saw that an opportunity had come for asserting a third
                    great cause—that of the working men—which would outflank the liberalism of the
                    middle classes, and might even command the sympathy of the Government. His
                    political programme was, however, entirely subordinate to the social, that of
                    bettering the condition of the working-classes, for which he believed the
                    schemes of Schulze-Delitzsch were utterly inadequate. Lassalle flung himself
                    into the career of agitator with his accustomed vigour. His worst difficulties
                    were with the working men themselves, among whom he met the most discouraging
                    apathy. For a war to the knife with the liberal press he was quite prepared, and
                    he accepted it manfully. His mission as organizer and emancipator of the working
                    class lasted only two years and a half. In that period he issued about twenty
                    separate publications, most of them speeches and pamphlets, but one of them,
                    that against Schulze-Delitzsch, a considerable treatise, and all full of keen
                    and vigorous thought. He founded the “Allgemeiner Deutscher Arbeiterverein,” was
                    its president and almost single handed champion, conducted its affairs, and
                    carried on a vast correspondence, not to mention about a dozen state
                    prosecutions in which he was during that period involved. Berlin, Leipsic,
                    Frankfurt, and the industrial centres on the Rhine, were the chief scenes of his
                    activity. His greatest success was on the Rhine, where in the summers of 1863
                    and 1864 his travels as missionary of the new gospel resembled a triumphal
                    procession. The agitation was growing rapidly, but he had achieved little
                    substantial success when a most unworthy death closed his career.</p>
                <p>While posing as the Messiah of the poor, Lassalle was a man of decidedly
                    fashionable and luxurious habits. His suppers were well known as among the most
                    exquisite in Berlin. It was the most piquant feature of his life that he, one of
                    the gilded youth, a connoisseur in wines, and a learned man to boot, had become
                    agitator and the champion of the working man. In one of the literary and
                    fashionable circles of Berlin he had met a young lady, a Fräulein von Dünniges,
                    for whom he at once felt a passion, which was ardently reciprocated. In the
                    summer of 1864 he met her again on the Rigi, when they resolved to marry. She
                    was a young lady of twenty, decidedly unconventional and original in character,
                    but the daughter of a Bavarian diplomatist then resident at Geneva, who was
                    angry beyond all bounds when he heard of the proposed match, and would have
                    absolutely nothing to do with Lassalle. The lady was imprisoned in her own room,
                    and soon, apparently under the influence of very questionable pressure,
                    renounced Lassalle in favour of another admirer, a Wallachian, Count von
                    Racowitza. Lassalle, who had resorted to every available means to gain his end,
                    was now mad with rage, and sent a challenge both to the lady’s father and her
                    betrothed, which was accepted by the latter. At the Carouge, a suburb of Geneva,
                    the meeting took place on the morning of August 28, 1864, when Lassalle was
                    mortally wounded. In spite of such a foolish ending, his funeral was that of a
                    martyr, and by many of his adherents he has been regarded since with feelings
                    almost of religious devotion.</p>
                <p>Lassalle did not lay claim to any special originality as a socialistic thinker,
                    nor did he publish any systematic statement of his views. His aim was not
                    scientific or theoretic completeness, but the practical one of organizing and
                    emancipating the working classes; and his plans were promulgated in occasional
                    speeches and pamphlets, as the crises of his agitation seemed to demand. Yet his
                    leading ideas are sufficiently clear and simple. Like a true Hegelian he saw
                    three stages in the development of labour: the ancient and feudal period, which,
                    through the subjection of the labourer, sought solidarity without freedom; the
                    reign of capital and the middle classes, established in 1789, which sought
                    freedom by destroying solidarity; and the new era, beginning in 1848, which
                    would reconcile solidarity with freedom by introducing the principle of
                    association. It was the basis and starting-point of his opinions that, under the
                    empire of capital and so long as the working man was merely a receiver of wages,
                    no improvement in his condition could be expected. This position he founded on
                    the well-known law of wages formulated by Ricardo, and accepted by all the
                    leading economists, that wages are controlled by the ordinary relations of
                    supply and demand, that a rise in wages leads to an increase in the labouring
                    population, which, by increasing the supply of labour, is followed by a
                    corresponding fall of wages. Thus population increases or decreases in fixed
                    relation to the rise or fall of wages. The condition of the working man will
                    never permanently rise above the mere standard of living required for his
                    subsistence, and the continued supply of his kind. Lassalle held that the
                    co-operative schemes of Schulze-Delitzsch on the principle of “self-help” were
                    utterly inadequate, for the obvious reason that the working classes were
                    destitute of capital. The struggle of the working man helping himself <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n339/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0339-0322"/> with his empty pockets against the
                    capitalists he compared to a battle with teeth and nails against modern
                    artillery. In short, Lassalle accepted the orthodox political economy to show
                    that the inevitable operation of its laws left no hope for the working classes,
                    and that no remedy could be found but by abolishing the conditions in which
                    these laws had their validity—in other words, by abolishing the present
                    relations of labour and capital altogether. And this could only be done by the
                    productive association of the working men with money provided by the state. The
                    states of Europe had spent hundreds of millions in silly dynastic squabbles, or
                    to appease the wounded vanity of royal mistresses; why refuse to advance a few
                    millions to solve the greatest problem of modern civilization? Lassalle’s
                    estimate was that a loan of a hundred million thalers would be more than enough
                    to bring the principle of productive association into full movement throughout
                    the kingdom of Prussia. And he held that such association should be the
                    voluntary act of the working men themselves, the Government merely reserving to
                    itself the right to examine the books of the various societies. All the
                    arrangements should be carried out according to the rules of business usually
                    followed in such transactions. But how move the Government to grant such a loan?
                    Simply by introducing (direct) universal suffrage. The working men were an
                    overwhelming majority; they were the state, and should control the Government.
                    The aim of Lassalle, then, was to organize the working classes into a great
                    political power, which in the way thus indicated, by peaceful resolute
                    agitation, without violence or insurrection, might attain the goal of productive
                    association. In this way the fourth estate would be emancipated from the
                    despotism of the capitalist, and a great step taken in the solution of the great
                    “social question.”</p>
                <p>It will be seen that the net result of Lassalle’s life was to produce a European
                    scandal, and to originate a socialistic movement in Germany, which, in spite of
                    repressive laws, at last election (1881) was able to return thirteen members to
                    the reichstag. This result was hardly commensurate with his ambition, which was
                    boundless. In the heyday of his passion for Fräulein von Dönniges, his dream was
                    to be enthroned as the president of the German republic with her seated at his
                    side. With his energy, ability, and gift of dominating and organizing, he might
                    indeed have done a great deal. Bismarck coquetted with him as the representative
                    of a force that might help him to combat the Prussian liberals; so late as 1878,
                    in a speech before the reichstag, he spoke of him with deep respect, as a man of
                    the greatest amiability and ability from whom much could be learned. Even Bishop
                    Ketteler of Mainz had declared his sympathy for the cause he advocated.</p>
                <p>Lassalle’s two learned works were Die Philosophie Herakleitos des Dunklen von
                    Eρhesos (Berlin, 1858), and the System der erworbenen Rechte (Leipsic, 1861),
                    both marked by great learning and intellectual power. But of far more historical
                    interest are the speeches and pamphlets connected with his socialistic
                    agitation, of which the most important are—Ueber Verfassungswesen;
                    Arbeiterprogramm; Offenes Antwortschreiben; Zur Arbeiterfrage;
                    Arbeiter-lesebuch; Herr Bastiat-Schulze von Delitzsch, oder Kapital und Arbeit.
                    His drama, Franz von Sickingen, published in 1859, is a work of no poetic
                    value.</p>
                <p>The best authority on Lassalle’s life and writings is George Brandes’s Danish
                    work, Ferdinand Lassalle (German translation, Berlin, 1877). See also Laveleye,
