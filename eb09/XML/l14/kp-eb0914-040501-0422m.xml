                    His mother was descended from the family of the famous Richard Bentley. It was
                    from his father that Leech inherited his skill with the pencil, which he began
                    to use at a very early age. When he was only three, he was discovered by
                    Flaxman, who had called on his parents, seated on his mother’s knee, drawing
                    with much gravity. The sculptor pronounced his sketch to be wonderful, adding,
                    “Do not let him be cramped with lessons in drawing; let his genius follow its
                    own bent; he will astonish the world,”—an advice which was strictly followed.
                    One of his early productions, a mail-coach, done when he was six years old, is
                    already full of surprising vigour and variety in its galloping horses. Leech was
                    educated at Charterhouse, where Thackeray, his lifelong friend, was his
                    schoolfellow, and at the age of sixteen he began to study for the medical
                    profession under Mr Stanley at St Bartholomew’s Hospital, where he won praise
                    for the accuracy and beauty of his anatomical drawings. He was then placed under
                    a Mr Whittle, an eccentric practitioner, the original of “Rawkins” in Albert
                    Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Adventures of Mr Ledbury,</hi> and afterwards under Dr
                    John Cockle; but gradually the true bent of the youth’s mind asserted itself,
                    and he drifted into the artistic profession. He was eighteen when his first
                    designs were published, a quarto of four pages, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Etchings and Sketchings by A. Pen, Esq.,</hi> comic character studies from the
                    London streets. Then he drew some political lithographs, did rough sketches for
                    <hi rend="italic">Bell's Life,</hi> produced an exceedingly popular parody on
                    Mulready’s postal envelope, and, on the death of Seymour, applied unsuccessfully
                    to illustrate the <hi rend="italic">Pickwick Papers.</hi> In 1840 Leech began
                    his contributions to the magazines with a series of etchings in <hi
                    rend="italic">Bentley's Miscellany,</hi> where Cruikshank had published his
                    splendid plates to <hi rend="italic">Jack Sheppard</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oliver Twist,</hi> and was illustrating <hi rend="italic">Guy Fawkes</hi> in
                    sadly feebler fashion. In company with the elder master Leech designed for the
                    <hi rend="italic">Iηgoldsby Legends</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Stanley
                    Thorn,</hi> and till 1847 produced many independent series of etchings. These,
                    however, cannot be ranked with his best work; their technique is exceedingly
                    imperfect; they are rudely bitten, with the light and shade out of relation; and
                    we never feel that they express the artist’s individuality, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bichard Savage,</hi> plates, for instance, being strongly
                    reminiscent of Cruikshank, and “The Dance at Stamford Hall” of Hablot Browne. In
                    1845 Leech illustrated <hi rend="italic">St Giles and St James</hi> in Douglas
                    Jerrold’s newly started <hi rend="italic">Shilling Magazine,</hi> with plates
                    more vigorous <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n423/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0423-0406"/> and accomplished than those in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bentley,</hi> but it is in subjects of a somewhat later date, and especially in
                    those lightly etched and meant to be printed with colour, that we see the
                    artist’s best powers with the needle and the acid. Among such of his designs are
                    four charming plates to Dickens’s <hi rend="italic">Christmas Carol,</hi> 1844,
                    the broadly humorous etchings in the <hi rend="italic">Comic History of
                    England,</hi> 1847-48, and the still finer illustrations to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Comic History of Pome,</hi> 1852,—which last, particularly in its
                    minor woodcuts, shows some exquisitely graceful touches, as witness the fair
                    faces that rise from the surging water in “Cloelia and her Companions Escaping
                    from the Etruscan Camp.” Among the other etchings which deserve very special
                    reference are those in <hi rend="italic">Young Master Troublesome or Master
                    Jacky’s Holidays,</hi> and the frontispiece to <hi rend="italic">Hints on Life,
                    or How to Rise in Society,</hi> 1845,—a series of minute subjects linked
                    gracefully together by coils of smoke, illustrating the various ranks and
                    conditions of men, one of them—the doctor by his patient’s bedside—almost
                    equalling in vivacity and precision the best of Cruikshank’s similar scenes.
                    Then in the fifties we have the numerous etchings of sporting scenes,
                    contributed, along with woodcuts, to the <hi rend="italic">Handley Cross</hi>
                    novels.</p>
                <p>Turning to Leech’s lithographic work, which succeeded the early political
                    caricatures already mentioned, we have, in 1841, the <hi rend="italic">Portraits
                    of the Children of the Mobility,</hi> an important series dealing with the
                    humorous and pathetic aspects of London street Arabs, which were afterwards so
                    often and so effectively to employ the artist’s pencil. Amid all the squalor
                    which they depict, they are full of individual beauties in the delicate or
                    touching expression of a face, in the graceful turn of a limb. The book is
                    scarce in its original form, but in 1875 two reproductions of the outline
                    sketches for the designs were published,—a lithographic issue of the whole
                    series, and a finer photographic transcript of six of the subjects, which is
                    more valuable than even the finished illustrations of 1841, in which the added
                    light and shade is frequently spotty and ineffective, and the lining itself has
                    not the freedom which we find in some of Leech’s other lithographs, notably in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Fly Leaves,</hi> published at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Punch</hi> office, and in the inimitable subject of the nuptial couch of the
                    Caudles, which also appeared, in woodcut form, as a political cartoon, with Mrs
                    Caudle, personated by Brougham, disturbing by untimely loquacity the slumbers of
                    the lord chancellor, whose haggard cheek rests on the woolsack for pillow.</p>
                <p>But it was in work for the wood-engravers that Leech was most prolific and
                    individual. Among the earlier of such designs are the illustrations to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Comic English</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Latin Grammars,</hi>
                    1840, to <hi rend="italic">Written Caricatures,</hi> 1841, to Hood’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Comic Annual,</hi> 1842, and to Albert Smith’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wassail Bowl,</hi> 1843, subjects mainly of a small vignette size, transcribed
                    with the best skill of such woodcutters as Orrin Smith, and not, like the larger
                    and later <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> illustrations, cut at speed by several
                    engravers working at once on the subdivided block. It was in 1841 that Leech’s
                    connexion with <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> began, a connexion which subsisted
                    till his death on the 29th of October 1864, and resulted in the production of
                    the best known and most admirable of his designs. His first contribution
                    appeared in the issue of 7th August, a full-page illustration—entitled “Foreign
                    Affairs ”—of character studies from the neighbourhood of Leicester Square. His
                    cartoons deal at first mainly with social subjects, and are rough and imperfect
                    in execution, but gradually their method gains in power and their subjects
                    become more distinctly political, and by 1849 the artist is strong enough to
                    produce the splendidly humorous national personification which appears in
                    “Disraeli Measuring the British Lion.” About 1845 we have the first of that long
                    series of half-page and quarter-page pictures of life and manners, executed with
                    a hand as gentle as it was skilful, containing, as Mr Ruskin has said,
                    “admittedly the finest definition and natural history of the classes of our
                    society, the kindest and subtlest analysis of its foibles, the tenderest
                    flattery of its pretty and well-bred ways,” which has yet appeared,—a series far
                    too popular and too voluminous to require or admit of particular description
                    here. In addition to his work for the weekly issue of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Punch,</hi> Leech contributed largely to the <hi rend="italic">Ptιηch</hi>
                    almanacks and pocket-books, to <hi rend="italic">Once a Week</hi> from 1859 till
                    1862, to the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated London News,</hi> where some of his
                    largest and best sporting scenes appeared, and to innumerable novels and
                    miscellaneous volumes besides, of which it is only necessary to specify <hi
                    rend="italic">A Little Tour in Ireland,</hi> 1859, which is noticeable as
                    showing the artist’s treatment of pure landscape, though it also contains some
                    of his daintiest figure-pieces, like that of the wind-blown girl, standing on
                    the summit of a pedestal, with the swifts darting around her, and the breadth of
                    sea beyond.</p>
                <p>In 1862 Leech appealed to the public with a very successful exhibition of some of
                    the most remarkable of his <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi> drawings. These were
                    enlarged by a mechanical process, and coloured in oils by the artist himself,
                    with the assistance and under the direction of his friend Mr J. E. Millais.</p>
                <p>After even such a necessarily incomplete enumeration as we have made of Leech’s
                    main designs, it goes without saying that he was a singularly rapid and
                    indefatigable worker. Canon Hole tells us, when he was his guest, “I have known
                    him send off from my house three finished drawings on the wood, designed,
                    traced, and rectified, without much effort as it seemed, between breakfast and
                    dinner.” The best technical qualities of Leech’s art, his unerring precision,
                    his unfailing vivacity in the use of the line, are seen most clearly in the
                    first sketches for his woodcuts, and in the more finished drawings made on
                    tracing-paper from these first outlines, before the chiaroscuro was added and
                    the designs were transcribed by the engraver. Turning to the mental qualities of
                    his art, it would be a mistaken criticism which ranked him as a comic draftsman.
                    Like Hogarth he was a true humorist, a student of human life, though he observed
                    humanity mainly in its whimsical aspects,</p>
                <p>“Hitting all he saw with shafts with gentle satire, kin to charity, That harmed
                    not.”</p>
                <p>The earnestness and gravity of moral purpose which is so constant a note in the
                    work of the last century master is indeed far less characteristic of Leech, but
                    there are touches of pathos and of tragedy in such of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Punch</hi> designs as the “Poor Man’s Friend,” 1845, and “General Février
                    turned Traitor,” 1855, andin “The Queen of the Arena” in the first volume of <hi
                    rend="italic">Once α Week,</hi> which are sufficient to prove that more solemn
                    powers, for which his daily work afforded no scope, lay dormant in their artist.
                    The purity and manliness of Leech’s own character are impressed on his art. We
                    find in it little of the exaggeration and grotesqueness, and none of the fierce
                    political enthusiasm, of which the designs of Gillray are so full. Compared with
                    that of his great contemporary George Cruikshank, his work is restricted both in
                    compass of subject and in artistic dexterity.</p>

                    regarding his life and works will be found in the following articles:—“John
