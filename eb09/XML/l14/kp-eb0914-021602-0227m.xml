                    however, a vacancy having occurred in the librarianship of the Signet Library,
                    Laing was elected to that office in 1837, and continued to hold it till the time
                    of his death. In addition to, it is believed, an almost unexampled knowledge of
                    the titles and value of books, Laing possessed an intimate acquaintance with the
                    early literary history of Scotland. His knowledge of Scottish art was also very
                    extensive; and the ecclesiastical history of his native country, particularly
                    during the 16th and 17th centuries, had long been the subject of his profound
                    investigation. It is perhaps to be regretted that with all this knowledge he
                    never produced any large independent work, but confined himself to the editing
                    of the works of others. Of these, the chief are— <hi rend="italic">Dunbar's
                    Works,</hi> 2 vols., 1834, with a supplement added in 1865; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Robert Baillids Letters and Journals,</hi> 3 vols., 1841-42; <hi rend="italic"
                    >John Knox's Works,</hi> 6 vols., 1846-64; <hi rend="italic">Poems and Fables of
                    Robert Heηryson,</hi> 1865; <hi rend="italic">Andrew of Wyntoun's Orygynale
                    Cronykil of Scotland,</hi> 3 vols., 1872-79; <hi rend="italic">Sir David
                    Lyndsafs Poetical Works,</hi> 3 vols., 1879. Laing was for more than fifty years
                    an active member of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, and during that
                    period he contributed upwards of a hundred separate papers to their <hi
                    rend="italic">Proceedings.</hi> He was also for more than forty years secretary
                    to the Bannatyne Club, many of the publications of which were carefully edited
                    by him, and few of them we believe failed to benefit by his assistance. A
                    complete list of his productions would occupy many pages. His literary activity
                    ended only with his life. He was struck with paralysis when attending to his
                    duties in the Signet Library, and it is touchingly recorded of him that, on
                    awakening out of the fit, he looked about him and asked if a proof of Wyntoun
                    had been sent up from the printers. He died a few days afterwards, on October
                    18, 1878, at the age of eighty-six years. Perhaps few men who ever lived
                    possessed so much recondite knowledge on subjects connected with Scottish
                    history and literature, and no one could be more ready to communicate whatever
                    he knew to those who were engaged in investigations similar to his own. In 1864
                    the university of Edinburgh conferred on him the degree of LL.D. In the course
                    of his long life Laing had collected an immense library, a large portion of the
                    books being illustrative of the literature or history of Scotland, and many of
                    them being of extraordinary rarity. It was dispersed by auction in London soon
                    after his death, and the enormous prices obtained for many of the books were
                    such as had hardly ever been known even in the most celebrated of previous book
                    sales. A valuable collection of MSS., chiefly relating to Scotland, was
                    bequeathed by him to the library of Edinburgh university.</p>
