                <p><label type="entry">LOLLARDS, <hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi></label>, were the
                    English followers of John Wickliffe, and were the adherents of a religious
                    movement which was widespread in the end of the 14th and begin ning of the 15th
                    centuries, and which to some extent maintained itself on to the Reformation. The
                    name is of uncertain origin: it has been traced to a certain Walter Lollard, but
                    he was probably a mythical personage; some derive it from <hi rend="italic"
                    >lolium,</hi> tares, quoting Chaucer (C. <hi rend="italic">T.,</hi> Shipman’s
                    Prologue)—</p>
                <p>“This Lollere here wol prechen us somwhat . . . He wolde sowen some
                    difficulté</p>
                <p>Or sprengen cokkle in oure clene corn;”</p>
                <p>but the most generally received explanation derives the words from <hi
                    rend="italic">lollen</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lullen,</hi> to sing softly. The
                    word is much older than its English use; there were Lollards in the Netherlands
                    as early as the beginning of the 14th century, who were akin to the Fratricelli,
                    Beghards, and other sectaries of the recusant Franciscan type. The earliest
                    official use of the name in England occurs in 1387 in a mandate of the bishop of
                    Worcester against five “poor preachers,” <hi rend="italic">nomine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seu</hi><hi rend="italic">ritu Lollardorum confcederatos.</hi> It
                    is probable that the name was given to the followers of Wickliffe because they
                    resembled those offshoots from the great Franciscan movement which had disowned
                    the pope’s authority and separated themselves from the mediaeval church. The
                    14th century, so full of varied religious life, made it manifest that the two
                    different ideas of a life of separation from the world which in earlier times
                    had lived on side by side within the mediaeval church were irreconcilable. The
                    church chose to abide by the idea of Hildebrand and to reject that of Francis of
                    Assisi; and the revolt of Ockham and the Franciscans, of the Beghards and other
                    spiritual fraternities, of Wickliffe and the Lollards, were all protests against
                    that decision. Hildebrand’s object was to make church government or polity in
                    all respects distinct from civil government—no civil ruler to touch churchman or
                    church possession for trial or punishment, taxation or confiscation; and, in the
                    hands of his successors who followed out his principles, the church became
                    transformed into an empire in rivalry with the kingdoms, and of somewhat the
                    same kind, only that its territories were scattered over the face of Europe in
                    diocesan domains, convent lands, or priests’ glebes, its taxes were the tithes,
                    its nobles the prelates. Francis of Assisi had another ideal. Christians, he
                    thought, could separate themselves from the world, in imitation of Christ, by
                    giving up property, and home, and country, and going about doing good and living
                    on the alms of the people. For a time these two ways of separation from the
                    world lived on side by side in the church, but they were really irreconcilable;
                    Hildebrand’s church required power to enforce her claims, and money, land,
                    position, were all sources of power. Church rulers favoured the friars when they
                    found means of evading their vows of absolute poverty, and gradually there came
                    to be facing each other in the 14th century a great political Christendom, whose
                    rulers were statesmen, with aims and policy of a worldly ambitious type, and a
                    religious Christendom, full of the ideas of separation from the world by
                    self-sacrifice and of participation in the benefits of Christ’s work by an
                    ascetic imitation, which separated itself from political Christianity and called
                    it anti-Christ. Wickliffe’s whole life was spent in the struggle, and he
                    bequeathed his work to his followers the Lollards. The main practical thought
                    with Wickliffe was that the church, if true to her divine mission, must aid men
                    to live that life of evangelical poverty by which they could be separate from
                    the world and imitate Christ, and if the church ceased to be true to her mission
                    she ceased to be a church. Wickliffe was a metaphysician and a theologian, and
                    had to invent a metaphysical theory —the theory of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dominium—</hi> to enable him to transfer, in a way satisfactory to himself, the
                    powers and privileges of the church to his company of poor Christians; but his
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n834/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0834-0811"/> followers, who were not troubled with need of
                    theories, were content to allege that a church which held large landed
                    possessions, collected tithes greedily, and took money from starving peasants
                    for baptizing, burying, and praying, could not be the church of Christ and his
                    apostles, who in poverty went about doing good.</p>
                <p>Lollardy was most flourishing and most dangerous to the ecclesiastical
                    organization of England during the ten years after Wickliffe’s death. It had
                    spread so rapidly and grown so popular that a hostile chronicler could say that
                    almost every second man was a Lollard. Wickliffe left three intimate disciples
                    :—Nicolas Hereford, a doctor of theology of Oxford, who had helped his master to
                    translate the Bible into English; John Ashton, also a fellow of an Oxford
                    college; and John Purvey, Wickliffe’s colleague at Lutterworth, and a
                    co-translator of the Bible. With these were associated more or less intimately,
                    in the first age of Lollardy, John Parker, the strange ascetic William Smith,
                    the restless fanatic Swynderly, Richard Waytstract, and Crompe; and there must
                    have been a large number of preachers who itinerated through England preaching
                    the doctrines of their master. Wickliffe had organized in Lutterworth an
                    association for sending the gospel through all England, a company of poor
                    preachers somewhat after the Wesleyan method of modern times. “To be poor
                    without mendicancy, to unite the flexible unity, the swift obedience of an
                    order, with free and constant mingling among the poor, such was the ideal of
                    Wickliffe’s ‘ poor priests ’” <hi rend="italic">{cf.</hi> Shirley, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ease. Ziz.,</hi> p. xl.), and, although proscribed, these “poor
                    preachers,” with portions of their master’s translation of the Bible in their
                    hand to guide them, preached all over England wherever they could be heard
                    without detection. The Oxford university and many nobles supported them. Lord
                    Montacute, Lord Salisbury, Sir Thomas Latimer of Braybrooke, and several others
                    had chaplains who were Lollardist preachers; whilst many merchants and burgesses
                    assisted the work with money. The organization must have been strong in numbers,
                    but only the names of those have come down to us who were seized for heresy, and
                    it is only from the indictments of their accusers that their opinions can be
                    gathered. The preachers were picturesque figures in long russet dress down to
                    the heels, who, staff' in hand, preached in the mother tongue to the people in
                    churches and graveyards, in squares, streets, and houses, in gardens and
                    pleasure grounds, and then talked privately with those who had been impressed.
                    The Lollard literature was very widely circulated,—books by Wickliffe and
                    Hereford and tracts and broadsides,—in spite of many edicts proscribing it In
                    1395 the Lollards grew so strong that they petitioned parliament through Sir
                    Thomas Latimer and Sir R. Stury to reform the church on Lollardist methods. It
                    is said that the Lollard Conclusions printed by Canon Shirley (p. 360) contain
                    the substance of this petition. If so, parliament was told that temporal
                    possessions ruin the church and drive out the Christian graces of faith, hope,
                    and charity; that the priesthood of the church in communion with Rome was not
                    the priesthood Christ gave to his apostles; that the monk’s vow of celibacy had
                    for its consequence unnatural lust, and should not be imposed; that
                    transubstantiation was a feigned miracle, and led people to idolatry; that
                    prayers made over wine, bread, water, oil, salt, wax, incense, altars of stone,
                    church walls, vestments, mitres, crosses, staves, were magical and should not be
                    allowed; that kings should possess the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">episcopale,</hi> and bring good government into the church; that
                    no special prayers should be made for the dead; that auricular confession made
                    to the clergy, and declared to be necessary for salvation, was the root of
                    clerical arrogance and the cause of indulgences and other abuses in pardoning
                    sin; that all wars were against the principles of the New Testament, and were
                    but murdering and plundering the poor to win glory for kings; that the vows of
                    chastity laid upon nuns led to child murder; that many of the trades practised
                    in the commonwealth, such as those of goldsmiths and armourers, were unnecessary
                    and led to luxury and waste. These Conclusions really contain the sum of
                    Wickliffite teaching; and, if we add that the principal duty of priests is to
                    preach, and that the worship of images and going on pilgrimages are sinful, they
                    include almost all the heresies charged in the indictments against individual
                    Lollards down to the middle of the 15th century. The king, who had hitherto
                    seemed anxious to repress the action of the clergy against the Lollards, spoke
                    strongly against the petition and its promoters, and Lollardy never again had
                    the power in England which it wielded up to this year.</p>
                <p>If the formal statements of Lollard creed are to be got from these Conclusions,
                    the popular view of their controversy with the church may be gathered from the
                    ballads preserved in the collection of <hi rend="italic">Political Poems and
                    Songs relating to English History,</hi> published in 1859 by Mr Thomas Wright
                    for the Master of the Rolls series, and in the Piers Ploughman poems. <hi
                    rend="italic">Piers Ploughman's Creed</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Langland)</hi> was probably written about 1394, when Lollardy was at its
                    greatest strength; the ploughman of the <hi rend="italic">Creed</hi> is a man
                    gifted with sense enough to see through the tricks of the friars, and with such
                    religious knowledge as can be got from the creed, and from Wickliffe’s version
                    of the Gospels. The poet gives us a “portrait of the fat friar with his double
                    chin shaking about as big as a goose’s egg, and the ploughman with his hood full
                    of holes, his mittens made of patches, and his poor wife going barefoot on the
                    ice so that her blood followed” <hi rend="italic">{Early English Text
                    Society,</hi> vol xxx., pref., p. 16); and one can easily see why farmers and
                    peasants turned from the friars to the poor preachers. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ploughman's Complaint</hi> tells the same tale. It paints popes, cardinals,
                    prelates, rectors, monks, and friars, who call themselves followers of Peter and
                    keepers of the gates of heaven and hell, and pale poverty-stricken people,
                    cotless and landless, who have to pay the fat clergy for spiritual assistance,
                    and asks if these are Peter’s priests after all. “I trowe Peter took no money,
                    for no sinners that he sold. . . . Peter was never so great a foie, to leave his
                    key with such a losell.”</p>
                <p>In 1399 the Lancastrian Henry IV. overthrew the Plantagenet Richard II., and one
                    of the most active partisans of the new monarch was Arundel, archbishop of
                    Canterbury and the most determined opponent of Lollardy. It has been alleged
                    that Henry won his help by promising to do his utmost to suppress the followers
                    of Wyclif, and this much is certain, that when the house of Lancaster was firmly
                    established upon the throne the infamous Act <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">comburendo</hi><hi rend="italic">hereticos</hi> was passed in
                    1400, and church and state combined to crush the Lollards. John Purvey was
                    seized; William Sautrey (Chartris) was tried, condemned, and burned. The
                    Lollards, far from daunted, abated no effort to make good their ground, and
                    united a struggle for social and political liberty to the hatred felt by the
                    peasants towards the Romish clergy. Jak Upland (John Countryman) took the place
                    of Piers Ploughman, and upbraided the clergy, and especially the friars, for
                    their wealth and luxury. Wickliffe had published the rule of St Francis, and had
                    pointed out in a commentary upon the rule how far friars had departed from the
                    maxims of their founder, and had persecuted the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spirituales</hi> (the Fratricelli, Beghards, Lollards of the Netherlands) for
                    keeping them to the letter <hi rend="italic">{cf.</hi> Matthews, <hi

                    Soc., voh lxxiv., 1880). Jak Upland put all this into rude nervous English verse
                    :—</p>

                <p>The archbishop, having the power of the state behind him, attacked that
                    stronghold of Lollardy the university of Oxford. In 1406 a document appeared
                    bearing to be the testimony of the university in favour of Wickliffe; its
                    genuineness was disputed at the time, and when quoted by Huss at the council of
                    Constance it was repudiated by the English delegates. The archbishop treated
                    Oxford as if it had issued the document, and procured the issue of severe
                    regulations in order to purge the university of heresy. In 1408 Arundel in
                    convocation proposed and carried the famous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constitutiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomae Arundel</hi> intended to put down
                    Wickliffite preachers and teaching. They provided amongst other things that no
                    one was to be allowed to preach without a bishop’s licence, that preachers
                    preaching to the laity were not to rebuke the sins of the clergy, and that
                    Lollard books and the translation of the Bible were to be searched for and
                    destroyed. He next attempted to purge the nobility of Lollardy. The earlier
                    leaders had died, but there was still one distinguished Lollard, Sir John
                    Oldcastle, in right of his wife Lord Cobham, “the good Lord Cobham” of the
                    common people, who had been won to pious living by the poor preachers, and who
                    openly professed the common Lollard doctrines. His chaplain, one of the
                    itinerating preachers, was seized, then his books and papers were taken and
                    burnt in the king’s presence, and later he was indicted for heresy. It is said
                    that at first he recanted, but the abjuration, said to be his, may not be
                    authentic. In the end he was burnt for an obstinate heretic. These persecutions
                    were not greatly protested against; the wars of Henry V. with France had
                    awakened the martial spirit of the nation, and little sympathy was felt for men
                    who had declared that all war was but the murder and plundering of poor people
                    for the sake of kings. Mocking ballads were composed upon the martyr Oldcastle,
                    and this dislike to warfare was one of the chief accusations made against him
                    (comp. Wright’s <hi rend="italic">Political Poems,</hi> vol. ii. p. 244). But
                    Arundel could not prevent the writing and distribution of Lollard books and
                    pamphlets. Two appeared just about the time of the martyrdom of Oldcastle— <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ploughman's Prayer</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lanthorηe of
                    Light.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Ploughman's Prayer</hi> declared that true
                    worship consists in three things—in loving God, and dreading God, and trusting
                    in God above all other things; and it showed how Lollards, pressed by
                    persecution, became further separated from the religious life of the church.
                    “Men maketh now great stonen houses full of glasen windows, and clepeth thilke
                    thine houses and churches. And they setten in these houses mawmets of stocks and
                    stones, to fore them they knelen privilich and apert, and maken their prayers,
                    and all this they say is thy worship For Lorde our belief is that thine house is
                    man’s soul.”</p>
                <p>The council of Constance (1414-1418) put an end to the papal schism, and also
                    showed its determination to put down heresy by burning John Huss. When news of
                    this reached England the clergy were incited to still more vigorous proceedings
                    against Lollard preachers and books. From this time Lollardy appears banished
                    from the fields and streets, and takes refuge in houses and places of
                    concealment. There was no more wayside preaching, but instead there were <hi
                    rend="italic">conventicula</hi><hi rend="italic">occulta</hi> in houses, in
                    peasants’ huts, in sawpits, and in field ditches, where the Bible was read and
                    exhortations were given, and so Lollardy continued. In 1428 Archbishop Chichele
                    confessed that the Lollards seemed as numerous as ever, and that their literary
                    and preaching work went on as vigorously as before. It was found out also that
                    many of the poorer rectors and parish priests, and a great many chaplains and
                    curates, were in secret association with the Lollards, so much so that in many
                    places processions were never made and worship on saints’ days was abandoned.
                    For the Lollards if not stamped out were hardened by persecution, and became
                    fanatical in the statement of their doctrines. Thomas Bagley was accused of
                    declaring that if in the sacrament a priest made bread into God, he made a God
                    that can be eaten by rats and mice; that the pharisees of the day, the monks,
                    and the nuns, and the friars, and all other privileged persons recognized by the
                    church were limbs of Satan; and that auricular confession to the priest was the
                    will not of God but of the devil. And others held that any priest who took
                    salary was excommunicate; and that boys could bless the bread as well as
                    priests.</p>
                <p>From England Lollardy passed into Scotland. Oxford infected St Andrews, and we
                    find traces of more than one vigorous search made for Lollards among the
                    teaching staff of the Scottish university, while the Lollards of Kyle in
                    Ayrshire were claimed by Knox as the forerunners of the Scotch Reformation.</p>
                <p>The opinions of the later Lollards can best be gathered from the learned and
                    unfortunate Pecock, who wrote his elaborate <hi rend="italic">Repressor</hi>
                    against the “Bible-men,” as he calls them. He summed up their doctrines under
                    eleven heads: they condemn the having and using images in the churches, the
                    going on pilgrimages to the memorial or ‘ ‘ mynde places” of the saints, the
                    holding of landed possessions by the clergy, the various ranks of the hierarchy,
                    the framing of ecclesiastical laws and ordinances by papal and episcopal
                    authority, the institution of religious orders, the costliness of ecclesiastical
                    decorations, the ceremonies of the mass and the sacraments, the taking of oaths,
                    and the maintaining that war and capital punishment are lawful. When these
                    points are compared with the Lollard Conclusions of 1395, it is plain that
                    Lollardy had not greatly altered its opinions after fifty-five years of
                    persecution. All the articles of Pecock’s list, save that on capital punishment,
                    are to be found in the Conclusions; and, although many writers, have held that
                    Wickliffe’s own views differed greatly from what have been called the
                    “exaggerations of the later and more violent Lollards,” all these views may be
                    traced back to Wickliffe himself. Pecock’s idea was that all the statements
                    which he was prepared to impugn came from three false opinions or ‘ ‘growings,
                    viz., that no governance or ordinance is to be esteemed a law of God which is
                    not founded on Scripture, that every humble minded Christian man or woman is
                    able without “fail and defaut” to find out the true sense of Scripture, and that
                    having done so he ought to listen to no arguments to the contrary; he elsewhere
                    adds a fourth (vol. i. p. 102), that if a man be not only meek but also keep
                    God’s law he shall have a true understanding of Scripture, even though “no man
                    ellis teche him saue God.” These statements, especially the last, show us the
                    connexion between the Lollards and those mystics· of the 14th century, such as
                    Tauler and Ruysbroeck, who accepted the teachings of Nicholas of Basel, and
                    formed themselves into the association of the Friends of God.</p>
                <p>The question remains—What was the connexion between the· Lollard movement and the
                    Beformation in England? Many writers make Lollardy the· forerunner of
                    Beformation teaching; others, like Mr Oairdner, relying on the facts that the
                    persecution of the Lollards did not rouse the English nation in the way that the
                    martyrdom of Huss excited the Bohemians and that Lollardy had almost faded out
                    of sight in the beginning of the 16th century, admit only a casual connexion
                    between the two awakenings. The problem is scarcely one which can be settled by
                    counting the numbers of Lollards convicted at different periods from the
                    beginning to the end of the 15th century, or by pointing to the enthusiasm or
                    indifference of the mass of the English nation to Lollard doctrines. The English
                    Reformation down to the middle of Elizabeth’s reign was much more a political
                    than a religious movement with the great proportion of English people. Lollardy
                    in its most essential and invariable characteristics had much more in common
                    with mediaeval religious revivals than with Reformation piety, and Lollard
                    preaching must have had much more resemblance to that of Ockham and his recusant
                    Franciscans than that of Luther, Calvin, or Peter Martyr. But Lollardy did one
                    thing for England which other mediaeval revivals did not do for the lands in
                    which they <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0836-0813"/> arose; it made the Bible familiar to the people
                    in their mother tongue, and this must have been a positive preparation for the
                    English Reformation of no ordinary power. May not the great peculiarity of the
                    English Reformation on its religious side, the repeated attempts to give a good
                    version of the Bible from the original tongues into English, by Tyndale,
                    Coverdale, Taverner, Cranmer, the Genevan refugees, and Parker, with the
                    revisions and combinations of these various translations, on to our present
                    authorized version, have come from the fact that Lollard Biblemen, as Pecock
                    calls them, had made a good English Bible a necessity for an English reformation
                    of religion?</p>
