                <p><label type="entry">LĀMĀISM</label> is partly religious, partly political.
                    Religiously it is the corrupt form of Buddhism prevalent in Tibet and Mongolia.
                    It stands in a relationship to primitive Buddhism similar to that in which Roman
                    Catholicism, so long as the temporal power of the pope was still in existence,
                    stood to primitive Christianity. The ethical and metaphysical ideas most
                    conspicuous in the doctrines of Lamaism are not confined to the highlands of
                    Central Asia, they are accepted in great measure also in Japan and China. It is
                    the union of these ideas with a hierarchical system, and with the temporal
                    sovereignty of the head of that system in Tibet, which constitutes what is
                    distinctively understood by the term Lämäism. Lämäism is hardly calculated to
                    attract much attention for its own sake. Tibetan superstitions and Tibetan
                    politics are alike repugnant to Western minds. But, as so many unfounded beliefs
                    and curious customs have a special value of their own to the student of
                    folklore, so Lämäism has acquired a special interest to the student of
                    comparative history through the instructive parallel which its history presents
                    to that of the Church of Rome.</p>
                <p>The central point of primitive Buddhism was the doctrine of
                    “Arahatship,”—asystemof ethical and mental self-culture, in which deliverance
                    was found from all the mysteries and sorrows of life in a change of heart to be
                    reached here on earth. This doctrine seems to have been held very nearly in its
                    original points from the time when it was propounded by Gotama in the 5th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> down to the period in which northern
                    India was invaded andconquered by the Huns at about the commencement of the
                    Christian era. At that time there had arisen a school of Buddhist teachers who
                    called their doctrine the “Great Vehicle.” It was not in any contradiction to
                    the older doctrine, which they contemptuously called the “Little Vehicle,” but
                    included it all, and was based upon it. The distinguishing characteristic of the
                    newer school was the importance which it attached to “Bodisatship.” The older
                    school had taught that Gotama, who had propounded the doctrine of Arahatship,
                    was a Buddha, that only a Buddha is capable of discovering that doctrine, and
                    that a Buddha is a man who by selfdenying efforts, continued through many
                    hundreds of different births, has acquired the so-called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ten</hi><hi rend="italic">Päramitäs</hi> or cardinal virtues in such perfection
                    that he is able, when sin and ignorance have gained the upper hand throughout
                    the world, to save the human race from impending ruin.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, for instance, the BuMldst Birth Stories,
                    pp. 19-27 and 53-58.</p></note> But until the process of perfection has been
                    completed, until the moment when at last the sage, sitting under the Bo tree,
                    acquires that particular insight or wisdom which is called Enlightenment or
                    Buddhahood, he is still only a Bodisat. And the link of connexion between the
                    various Bodisats in the future Buddha’s successive births is not a soul which is
                    transferred from body to body, but the <hi rend="italic">karma,</hi> or
                    character, which each successive Bodisat inherits from his predecessors in the
                    long chain of existences. Now the older school also held, in the first place,
                    that, when a man had, in this life, attained to Arahatship, his karma would not
                    pass on to any other individual in another life,—or in other words, that after
                    Arahatship there would be no rebirth; and, secondly, that four thousand years
                    after the Buddha had proclaimed the <hi rend="italic">Dhamma</hi> or doctrine of
                    Arahatship, his teaching would have died away, wickedness and ignorance would
                    have increased in the world, and another Buddha would be required to bring
                    mankind once more to a knowledge of the truth. The leaders of the Great Vehicle
                    urged their followers to seek to attain, not so much to Arahatship, which would
                    involve only their own salvation, but to Bodisatship, by the attainment of which
                    they would be conferring the blessings of the Dhamma upon countless multitudes
                    in the long ages of the future. By thus laying stress upon Bodisatship, rather
                    than upon Arahatship, the new school, though they doubtless merely thought
                    themselves to be carrying the older orthodox doctrines to their logical
                    conclusion, were really changing the central point of Buddhism, and were
                    altering the direction of their mental vision. It was of no avail that they
                    adhered in other respects in the main to the older teaching, that they professed
                    to hold to the same ethical system, that they adhered, except in a few
                    unimportant details, to the old regulations of the order of the Buddist
                    mendicant recluses. The ancient books, still preserved to us in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pali Pitakas,</hi> being mainly occupied with the details of
                    Arahatship, lost their exclusive value in the eyes of those whose attention was
                    being directed to the details of Bodisatship. And the opinion that every leader
                    in their religious circles, every teacher distinguished among them for his
                    sanctity of life, or for his extensive learning, was a Bodisat, who might have
                    and who probably had inherited the karma of some great teacher of old, opened
                    the door to a flood of superstitious fancies.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of note that the new school found its earliest professors and its
                    greatest expounders in a part of India which lay outside the districts to which
                    the personal influence of Gotama himself and of his immediate followers had been
                    confined. The home of early Buddhism was round about Kosala and Magadha; in the
                    district, that is to say, north and south of the Ganges between where Allahabad
                    now lies on the west, and Rajgir on the east. The home of the Great Vehicle was,
                    at first, in the countries farther to the north and west. Buddhism arose in
                    countries, subjeot indeed to Brahman influence, but where the sacred language of
                    the Brahmans was never more than a learned tongue, and where the exclusive <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n238/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0238-0227"/> claims of the Brahmans had never been universally
                    admitted. The Great Vehicle arose in the very stronghold of Brahmanism, and
                    among a people to whom Sanskrit was a familiar tongue. The new literature
                    therefore, which the new movement called forth, was written, and has been
                    preserved, in Sanskrit,—its principal books of <hi rend="italic">Dharma,</hi> or
                    doctrine, being the following nine :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Prajnä-päramitä</hi>;
                    (2) <hi rend="italic">Ganda-vyuha</hi>; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dasa-bhümes-</hi><hi rend="italic">νara</hi>; (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samädhi-raja</hi>; (5) <hi rend="italic">Lankävatära</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> (6) <hi rend="italic">Saddharma-pιιndamka ∙,</hi> (7) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tathägata-guhyaka</hi>; (8) <hi rend="italic">Lalita-νistara</hi>; (9) <hi
                    rend="italic">Suvarna-prabhäsa.</hi> The date of none of these works is known
                    with any certainty, but it is highly improbable that any one of them is older
                    than the 6th century after the death of Gotama. Copies of all of them were
                    brought to Europe by Mr B. H. Hodgson, and other copies have been received since
                    then; but none of them have as yet been published in Europe (the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lalita Vistara</hi> has been published by Rajendra Lâl Mitra in
                    Calcutta), and only two have been translated into any European language. These
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Lalita Vistara,</hi> translated into French, through
                    the Tibetan, by M. Foucaux, and the <hi rend="italic">Saddharma Pu</hi><hi
                    rend="italic"> nd</hi><hi rend="italic">amka,</hi> translated into French by M.
                    Eugène Burnouf. The former of these two is a legendary work, partly in verse, on
                    the life of Gotama, the historical Buddha; and the latter, also partly in verse,
                    is devoted to proving the essential identity of the Great and the Little Vehicle
                    and the equal authenticity of both as doctrines enunciated by the master
                    himself.</p>
                <p>Of the authors of these nine works, as indeed of all the older Buddhist works
                    with one or two exceptions, nothing has as yet been ascertained. The founder of
                    the system of the Great Vehicle is, however, often referred to under the name of
                    Nagarjuna or Nägasena, a personage celebrated even in the countries to which the
                    Greater Vehicle has never penetrated as the contemporary and religious
                    instructor of the Yavanaking Milinda, and as the answerer of the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Questions of</hi><hi rend="italic">Milinda,</hi> a work still
                    preserved in its Pâli form.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Edited by Dr V. Trenckner, London, 1880.</p></note> As Milinda may with all
                    probability be identified with the Greek king Menander, who was one of the
                    followers of Alexander the Great in Bactria, this tradition would imply that the
                    origin of the Great Vehicle must be assigned to as early a date as the 2d
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> But the work itself was probably composed
                    at least some centuries afterwards; and it would be hazardous to attach too much
                    importance to any chronological data drawn from it. We must be content at
                    present to settle a certain historical sequence in the principal doctrines of
                    the system which developed into Lâmàism, without pretending to fix any actual
                    dates.</p>
                <p>Together with Nägasena, other early teachers of the Great Vehicle whose names are
                    known to us are Vasumitra or Vasubandhu, Äryadeva, Dharmapâla, and Gunamati—all
                    of whom were looked upon as Bodisats. As the newer school did not venture so far
                    as to claim as Bodisats the disciples stated in the older books to have been the
                    contemporaries of Gotama (they being precisely the persons known as Arahats),
                    they attempted to give the appearance of age to the Bodisat theory by
                    representing the Buddha as being surrounded, not only by his human companions
                    the Arahats, but also by fabulous beings, whom they represented as the Bodisats
                    existing at that time. In the opening words of each Mahayana treatise a list is
                    given of such Bodisats, who were beginning, together with the historical
                    Bodisats, to occupy a position in the Buddhist church of those times similar to
                    that occupied by the saints in the corresponding period of the history of
                    Christianity in the Church of Rome. And these lists of fabulous Bodisats have
                    now a distinct historical importance. For they grow in length in the later
                    works; and it is often possible by comparing them one with another to fix, not
                    the date, but the comparative age of the books in which they occur. Thus it is a
                    fair inference to draw from the shortness of the list in the opening words of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lalita Vistara,</hi> as compared with that in the first
                    sections of the <hi rend="italic">Saddharma Pundamka,</hi> that the latter work
                    is much the younger of the two, a conclusion supported also by other
                    considerations.</p>
                <p>Among the Bodisats mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Saddharma PundarJca,</hi>
                    and not mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Lalita Vistara,</hi> as attendant on
                    the Buddha are Manju-sri and Avalokitesvara. That these saints were already
                    acknowledged by the followers of the Great Vehicle at the beginning of the 5th
                    century is clear from the fact that Fa Hian, who visited India about that time,
                    says that “men of the Great Vehicle” were then worshipping them at Mathura, not
                    far from Delhi (F. H., chap, xvi.). These were supposed to be celestial beings
                    who, inspired by love of the human race, had taken the so-called Great Resolve
                    to become future Buddhas, and who therefore, very naturally, descended from
                    heaven when the actual Buddha was on earth, to pay reverence to him, and to
                    learn of him. The belief in them probably arose out of the doctrine of the older
                    school, which did not deny the existence of the various creations of Brahmanical
                    mythology and speculation, but allowed of their actual existence as spiritual
                    beings, and only deprived them of all power over the lives of men, and declared
                    them to be temporary beings liable like men to sin and ignorance, and requiring
                    like men the salvation of Arahatship. Among them the later Buddhists seem to
                    have placed their numerous Bodisats; and to have paid especial reverence to
                    Manju-sri as the personification of wisdom, and to Avalokiteswara as the
                    personification of overruling love. The latter indeed occupies in the Mahäyäna
                    very much the position which the old Brahmanical god Brahma, the First Cause of
                    the Brahmanical speculation, had been allowed to retain in primitive Buddhism.
                    The former was afterwards identified with the mythical first Buddhist
                    missionary, who is supposed in the legend to have introduced civilization into
                    Tibet about two hundred and fifty years after the death of the Buddha.</p>
                <p>The way was now open to a rapid fall from the simplicity of early Buddhism, in
                    which men’s attention was directed to the various parts of the system of
                    self-culture which men could themselves practise, to a belief in a whole
                    pantheon of saints or angels, which appealed more strongly to the halfcivilized
                    races among whom the Great Vehicle was now professed. A theory sprang up which
                    was supposed to explain the marvellous powers of the Buddhas by representing
                    them as only the outward appearance, the reflexion, as it were, or emanation, of
                    ethereal Buddhas dwelling in the skies. These were called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dhyani Buddhas,</hi> and their number was supposed to be, like that of the
                    Buddhas, innumerable. Only five of them, however, occupied any space in the
                    speculative world in which the ideas of the later Buddhists had now begun to
                    move. But, being Buddhas, they were supposed of course to have their Bodisats;
                    and thus out of the five last Buddhas of the earlier teaching there grew up five
                    mystic trinities, each group consisting of one of these five Buddhas, his
                    prototype in heaven the Dhyâni Buddha, and his celestial Bodisat. Among these
                    hypothetical beings, the creations of a sickly scholasticism, hollow
                    abstractions without life or reality, the particular trinity in which the
                    historical Gotama was assigned a subordinate place naturally occupied the most
                    exalted rank. Amitâbha, the Dhyäni-Buddha of this trinity, soon began to fill
                    the largest place in the minds of the new school; and Avalokiteswara, his
                    Bodisat, was looked upon with a reverence somewhat less than his former glory.
                    It is needless to add that, under the overpowering <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n239/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0239-0228"/> influence of these vain imaginations, the earnest
                    moral teachings of Gotama became more and more hid from view. The imaginary
                    saints grew and flourished. Each new creation, each new step in the theory,
                    demanded another, until the whole sky was filled with forgeries of the brain,
                    and the nobler and simpler lessons of the founder of the religion were hidden
                    beneath the glittering stream of metaphysical subtleties.</p>
                <p>Still worse results followed on the change of the earlier point of view. The
                    acute minds of the Buddhist pandits, no longer occupied with the practical
                    lessons of Arahatship, turned their attention, as far as it was not engaged upon
                    their hierarchy of mythological beings, to questions of philosophical
                    speculation, which, in the earliest Buddhism, are not only discouraged but
                    forbidden. We find long treatises on the nature of being, idealistic dreams
                    which have as little to do with the Bodisatship that is concerned with the
                    salvation of the world as with the Arahatship that is concerned with the perfect
                    life. Only one lower step was possible, and that was not long in being taken.
                    The animism common alike to the untaught Huns and to their Hindu conquerors, but
                    condemned in early Buddhism, was allowed to revive. As the stronger side of
                    Gotama’s teaching was neglected, the debasing belief in rites and ceremonies,
                    and charms and incantations, which had been the especial object of his scorn,
                    began to live again, and to grow vigorously, and to spread like the Bιrana weed
                    warmed by a tropical sun in marsh and muddy soil. As in India, after the
                    expulsion of Buddhism, the degrading worship of Siva and his dusky bride had
                    been incorporated into Brahmanism from the wild and savage devil worship of
                    Aryan and of non-Aryan tribes, so, as pure Buddhism died away in the north, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tantra</hi> system, a mixture of magic and witchcraft and
                    sorcery, was incorporated into the corrupted Buddhism.</p>
                <p>The founder of this system seems to have been Asanga, an influential monk of
                    Peshawar, in the Punjab, who lived and wrote the first text-book of the creed,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Yogächchära Bhümi Sästra,</hi> about the 6th century of
                    our era. Hwen Tsang, who travelled in the first half of the 7th, found the
                    monastery where Asanga had lived in ruins, and says that he had lived one
                    thousand years after the Buddha.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    managed with great dexterity to reconcile the two opposing systems by placing a
                    number of Saivite gods or devils, both male and female, in the inferior heavens
                    of the then prevalent Buddhism, and by representing them as worshippers and
                    supporters of the Buddha and of Avalokitesvara. He thus made it possible for the
                    halfconverted and rude tribes to remain Buddhists while they brought offerings,
                    and even bloody offerings, to these more congenial shrines, and while their
                    practical belief had no relation at all to the Truths or the Noble Eightfold
                    Path, but busied itself almost wholly with obtaining magic powers <hi

                    >{Dharani),</hi> and magic circles (<hi rend="italic">Mandala).</hi> Asanga’s
                    happy idea bore but too ample fruit. In his own country and Nepal the new wine,
                    sweet and luscious to the taste of savages, completely disqualified them from
                    enjoying any purer drink; and now in both countries Saivism is supreme, and
                    Buddhism is even nominally extinct, except in some outlying districts of Nepal.
                    But this full effect has only been worked out in the lapse of ages; the Tantra
                    literature has also had its growth and its development, and some unhappy scholar
                    of a future age may have to trace its loathsome history. The nauseous taste
                    repelled even the self-sacrificing industry of Burnouf, when he found the later
                    Tantra books to be as immoral as they are absurd.</p>
                <p>“The pen,” he says, “refuses to transcribe doctrines as miserable in respect of
                    form as they are odious and degrading in respect of meaning.”<note

                <p>Such had been the decline and fall of Buddhism considered as an ethical system
                    before its introduction into Tibet. The manner in which its order of mendicant

                    carry out that system in practical life, developed at last into a hierarchical
                    monarchy will best be understood by a sketch of the history of Tibet.</p>
                <p>In Tibet as elsewhere the beginnings of the accounts found in the old historians
                    are merely a recapitulation of legends in which popular tradition has explained
                    by miraculous and mythological fancies the origins of its civilization. Its real
                    history commences with Srong Tsan Gampo, who was born a little after 600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and who is said in the Chinese chronicles to have
                    entered, in 634 after Christ, into diplomatic relationship with Thai Tsung, one
                    &lt; f the emperors of the Thung dynasty. He was the founder of the present
                    capital of Tibet, now known as Lhasa; and in the year 622 (the same year as that
                    in which Mohammed fled from Mecca) he began the formal introduction of Buddhism
                    into Tibet. For this purpose he sent the minister Thumi Sambhota, afterwards
                    looked upon as an incarnation of Manju-sri, to India, there to collect the
                    sacred books, and to learn and translate them. Thumi Sambhota accordingly
                    invented an alphabet for the Tibetan language on the model of the Indian
                    alphabets then in use. And, aided by the king himself, who is represented to
                    have been an industrious student and translator, he wrote the first books by
                    which Buddhism became known in his native land. The most famous of all the works
                    ascribed to him is the <hi rend="italic">Mani Kambum,</hi> “the Myriad of
                    Precious Words,”—a treatise chiefly on religion, but which also contains au
                    account of the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet, and of the closing part of
                    the life of king Srong Tsan Gampo. He is also very probably the author of
                    another very ancient standard work of Tibetan Buddhism, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samatog,</hi> a short digest of Buddhist morality, on which the civil laws of
                    Tibet have been founded. It is said in the <hi rend="italic">Mani Hambum</hi> to
                    have fallen down from heaven in a casket (Tibetan, <hi rend="italic"
                    >samatog),</hi> and, like the last-mentioned work, is unfortunately only known
                    to us in meagre abstract.</p>
                <p>King Srong Tsan Gampo’s zeal for Buddhism was shared and supported by his two
                    queens, the one named Bribsun, a princess from Nepäl, the other named Wen Ching,
                    a princess from China. They are related in the chronicles to have brought with
                    them sacred relics, books, and pictures, for whose better preservation and
                    honour two large monasteries were erected, and opened and dedicated with much
                    ceremony. These are the cloisters of La Brang and Ra Mochay, still, though much
                    changed and enlarged, the most famous and sacred abbeys in Tibet, and the glory
                    of Lhasa. In after times the two queens have become semidivine personages, and
                    are worshipped under the name of the two <hi rend="italic">Därä-Ehe,</hi> the
                    “glorious mothers,” being regarded as incarnations of the wife of Siva,
                    representing respectively two of the qualities which she personifies, divine
                    vengeance and divine love. The former of the two is worshipped by the Mongolians
                    as <hi rend="italic">OPkvn Tengri, “</hi> the Virgin Goddess;” but in Tibet and
                    China the rôle of the divine virgin is filled by <hi rend="italic">Kwan

                    represented with a child in her arms, Srong Tsan Gampo has also become a saint,
                    being looked upon as an incarnation of Avalokitesvara; and the description in
                    the ecclesiastical historians of the measures he took for the welfare of his
                    subjects do great credit to their ideal of the perfect Buddhist king. He is <pb

                    of reservoirs, bridges, and canals; in the promotion of agriculture,
                    horticulture, and manufactures: in the establishment of schools and colleges;
                    and in the maintenance of justice, and the encouragement of virtue. But the
                    degree of his success must have been slight. For after the death of himself and
                    of his wives Buddhism gradually decayed, and was subjected by succeeding kings
                    to cruel persecutions; and it was not <hi rend="subscript"> z</hi> till more
                    than half a century afterwards, under King Kir Song de Tsan, who reigned
                    740-786, that true religion is acknowledged by the ecclesiastical historians to
                    have become firmly established in the land.</p>
                <p>This monarch again sent to India to replace the sacred books that had been lost,
                    and to invite Buddhist pandits to translate them. The most distinguished of
                    those who came were Santa Rakshita, Padma Sambhava, and Kamala Sila, for whom,
                    and for their companions, the king built a splendid monastery still existing, at
                    Samje, about three days’ journey south-east of Lhasa. It was to them that the
                    Tibetans owed the great collection of what are still regarded as their sacred
                    books—the <hi rend="italic">Kandjur.</hi> It consists of 100 volumes containing
                    no less than 689 works, of which there are two or three complete sets in Europe,
                    one of them in the India Office Library. A detailed analysis of these Scriptures
                    has been published by the celebrated Hungarian scholar Csoma de Körös, whose
                    authoritative work has lately been republished in French with complete indices
                    and very useful notes by Μ. Léon Feer. These volumes contain about a dozen works
                    of the oldest school of Buddhism, the Hinayäna, and about 300 works, mostly very
                    slιort, belonging to the Tantra school. But the great bulk of the collection
                    consists of Mahayana books, belonging to all the previously existing varieties
                    of that widely extended Buddhist sect; and, as the Sanskrit originals of many of
                    these writings are now lost without hope of recovery, the Tibetan translations
                    will be of great value, not only for the history of Lämäism, but also for the
                    history of the 1 iter forms of Indian Buddhism.</p>
                <p>The last king’s second son, Lang Darma, concluded in May 822 a treaty with the
                    then emperor of China (the twelfth of the Thang dynasty), a record of which was
                    engraved on a stone put up in the above mentioned great convent of La Brang, and
                    is still to be seen there.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    church chronicles as an incarnation of the evil spirit, and is said to have
                    tried his best to overthrow religion, and to have succeeded in suppressing
                    Buddhism throughout the greater part of the land. The period from Srong Tsan
                    Gampo down to the death of Lang Darma, who was eventually murdered about 850 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in a civil war, is called in the Buddhist books “the
                    first introduction of religion.” It was followed by more than a century of civil
                    disorder and wars, during which the exiled Buddhist monks attempted
                    unsuccessfully again and again to return. Many are the stories of martyrs and
                    confessors who are believed to have lived in these troublous times, and their
                    efforts were at last crowned with success, for in the century commencing with
                    the reign of Bilamgur in 971 there took place “the second introduction of
                    religion” into Tibet, more especially under the guidance of the Pandita Atisha,
                    who came to Tibet in 1041, and of his famous native pupil and follower Brom
                    Ston. The long period of depression seems not to have been without a beneficial
                    influence on the persecuted Buddhist Church, for these teachers are reported to
                    have placed the Tantra system more in the background, and to have adhered more
                    strongly to the purer forms of the Mahayana development of the ancient
                    faith.</p>
                <p>For about three hundred years the Buddhist Church of Tibet was then left in
                    peace, subjecting the country more and more completely to its control, and
                    growing in power and in wealth. During this time it achieved its greatest
                    victory, and underwent the most important change in its character and
                    organization. After the réintroduction of Buddhism into the “kingdom of snow,”
                    the ancient dynasty never recovered its power. Its representatives continued for
                    some time to claim the sovereignty; but the country was practically very much in
                    the condition of Germany at about the same time—chieftains of almost independent
                    power ruled from their castles on the hill tops over the adjacent valleys,
                    engaged in petty wars, and conducted plundering expeditions against the
                    neighbouring tenants, whilst the great abbeys were places of refuge for the
                    studious or religious, and their heads were the only rivals to the barons in
                    social state, and in many respects the only protectors and friends of the
                    people. Meanwhile Jenghiz Khan had founded the Mongol empire, and his grandson
                    Kublai Khân, who ruled over the greatest empire which has ever owned the sway of
                    a single man, became a convert to the Buddhism of the Tibetan Lamas. He granted
                    to the abbot of the Sakya monastery in southern Tibet the title of tributary
                    sovereign of the country, head of the Buddhist Church, and overlord over the
                    numerous barons and abbots, and in return was officially crowned by the abbot as
                    ruler over the extensive domain of the Mongol empire. Thus was the foundation
                    laid at one and the same time of the temporal sovereignty of the Lamas of Tibet,
                    and of the suzerainty over Tibet of the emperors of China. One of the first acts
                    of the “head of the church” was the printing of a carefully revised edition of
                    the Tibetan Scriptures,—an undertaking which occupied altogether nearly thirty
                    years, and was not completed till 1306.</p>
                <p>Under Kublai’s successors in China the Buddhist cause flourished greatly, and the
                    Säkya Lamas extended their power both at home and abroad. The dignity of abbot
                    at Sakya became hereditary, the abbots breaking so far the Buddhist rule of
                    celibacy that they remained married until they had begotten a son and heir. But
                    rather more than half a century afterwards their power was threatened by a
                    formidable rival at home, a Buddhist reformer.</p>
                <p>Tsongkapa, the Luther of Tibet, was born about 1357 on the spot where the famous
                    monastery of Kunbum now stands. He very early entered the order, and studied at
                    Säkya, Brigung, and other monasteries. He then spent eight years as a hermit in
                    Takpo in southern Tibet, where the comparatively purer teaching of Atisha
                    (referred to above) was still prevalent. About 1390 he appeared as a public
                    teacher and reformer in Lhasa itself, and before his death in 1419 there were
                    three huge monasteries there containing 30,000 of his disciples, besides others
                    in other parts of the country. His voluminous works, of which the most famous
                    are the <hi rend="italic">Sumbun</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Lam Nim
                    Tshenpo,</hi> exist in printed Tibetan copies in Europe, but have not as yet
                    been translated or analysed. But the principal lines on which his reformation
                    proceeded are sufficiently well attested. He insisted in the first place on the
                    complete carrying out of the ancient rules of the order as to the celibacy of
                    its members, and as to simplicity in dress. One result of the second of these
                    two reforms was to make it necessary for every monk openly to declare himself
                    either in favour of or against the new views. For Tsongkapa and his followers
                    wore the yellow or orange-coloured garments which had been the distinguishing
                    mark of the order in the lifetime of its founder, and in support of the ancient
                    rules Tsongkapa reinstated the fortnightly rehearsal of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Patimokkha</hi> or “disburdenment” in regular assemblies of the order at
                    Lhasa—a practice which had fallen into desuetude. He also restored the custom of
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n241/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0241-0230"/> first disciples to hold the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">Vassa</hi> or yearly retirement, and the public meeting of the
                    order at its close. In all these respects he was simply following the directions
                    of the Vinaya, or regulations of the order, as established probably in the time
                    of Gotama himself, and as certainly handed down from the earliest times in the
                    pitakas or sacred books. Further, he set his face against the Tantra system, and
                    against the whole crowd of animistic superstitions which had been allowed to
                    creep into life again among the more ignorant of the monks and the people. He
                    laid stress on the self-culture involved in the practice of the päramitäs or
                    cardinal virtues, and established an annual national fast or week of prayer to
                    be held during the first, days of each year. This last institution indeed is not
                    found in the ancient Vinaya, but was almost certainly modelled on the
                    traditional account of the similar assemblies convoked by Asoka and other
                    Buddhist sovereigns in India every fifth year. Laymen as well as monks take part
                    in the proceedings, the details of which are entirely unknown to us except from
                    the accounts of the Catholic missionaries, —Fathers Hue and Gabet,—who describe
                    the principal ceremonial as, in outward appearance, wonderfully like the high
                    mass. In doctrine the great Tibetan teacher, who had no access to the Pâli
                    Pitakas, adhered in the main to the purer forms of the Mahayana school; in
                    questions of church government he took little part, and did not dispute the
                    titular supremacy of the Sâkya Lamas, though in other matters he had raised the
                    standard of revolt. But the effects of his teaching weakened their power. The
                    “orange-hoods,” as his followers were called, rapidly gained in numbers and
                    influence, until they so overshadowed the “red-hoods,” as the followers of the
                    older sect were called, that in the middle of the 15th century the emperor of
                    China acknowledged the two leaders of the new sect at that time as the titular
                    overlords of the church and tributary rulers over the realm of Tibet. These two
                    leaders were then known as the <hi rend="italic">Dalai Lama</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pantshen Lama,</hi> and were the abbots of the great monasteries
                    at Gedun Dubpa, near Lhasa, and at Krashis Lunpo, in Further Tibet,
                    respectively. Since that time the abbots of these monasteries have continued to
                    exercise the sovereignty over Tibet,—their pretensions being supported, in the
                    few cases in which an attempt has been made to dispute it, by the power of
                    Mongolia and China.</p>
                <p>As there has been no further change in the doctrine, and no further reformation
                    in discipline, we may leave the ecclesiastical history of Lämäism since that
                    date unnoticed, and devote our little remaining space to the consideration of
                    some principal points in the constitution of the Lâmâism of to-day. And first as
                    to the mode of electing successors to the two Great Lamas. It will have been
                    noticed above that it was an old idea of the northern Buddhists to look upon
                    distinguished members of the order as incarnations of Avalokitesvara, of
                    Manju-srT, or of Amitâbha. These beings were supposed to possess the power,
                    whilst they themselves continued to live in heaven, of appearing also on earth
                    in a <hi rend="italic">Nirmäna-lcäya,</hi> or apparitional body. In the same way
                    the Pantshen Lama is looked upon as an incarnation, the Nirrnäna-käya, of
                    Amitâbha, who had previously appeared in that way under the outward form of
                    Tshonkapa himself; and the Dalai Lâma is looked upon as an incarnation of
                    Avalokitesvara. Theoretically, therefore, the former, as the spiritual successor
                    of the great teacher and also of Amitâbha, who occupies the higher place in the
                    mythology of the Great Vehicle, would be superior to the latter, as the
                    spiritual representative of Avalokitesvara. But practically the Dalai Lâma,
                    owing to his position in the capital, has the political supremacy, and is
                    actually called the <hi rend="italic">Gyalpo Rinpotshe,</hi> “the glorious
                    king,”—his companion being content with the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pantshen</hi><hi rend="italic">Rinpotshe,</hi> “the glorious teacher.” When
                    either of them dies it is necessary for the other to ascertain in whose body the
                    celestial being whose outward form has been dissolved has been pleased again to
                    incarnate himself. For that purpose the names of all male children born just
                    after the death of the deceased Great Lama are laid before his survivor. He
                    chooses three out of the whole number; their names are thrown into a golden
                    casket provided for that purpose by a former emperor of China. The Chutuktus, or
                    abbots of the great monasteries, then assemble, and after a week of prayer, the
                    lots are drawn in their presence and in presence of the surviving Great Lama and
                    of the Chinese political resident. The child whose name is first drawn is the
                    future Great Lâma; the other two receive each of them 500 pieces of silver. The
                    Chutuktus just mentioned correspond in many respects to the Roman cardinals.
                    Like the Great Lâmas, they bear the title of Rinpotshe or Glorious, and are
                    looked upon as incarnations of one or other of the celestial Bodisats of the
                    Great Vehicle mythology. Their number varies from ten to a hundred; and it is
                    uncertain whether the honour is inherent in the abbacy of certain of the
                    greatest cloisters, or whether the Dalai Lâma exercises the right of choosing
                    them. Under these high officials of the Tibetan hierarchy there come the Chubil
                    Khâns, who fill the post of abbot to the lesser monasteries, and are also
                    incarnations. Their number is very large; and there are but few monasteries in
                    Tibet or in Mongolia who do not claim to possess one of these living Buddhas.
                    Besides these mystical persons there are in the Tibetan Church a number of other
                    ranks and degrees, corresponding to the deacon, full priest, dean, and doctor of
                    divinity in the West. At the great yearly festival at Lhasa they make in the
                    cathedral an imposing array, not much less magnificent than that of the clergy
                    in Rome; for the ancient simplicity of dress has quite disappeared in the
                    growing differences of rank, and each division of the spiritual army is
                    distinguished in Tibet, as in the West, by a special uniform. The political
                    authority of the Dalai Lâma is confined to Tibet itself, but he is the
                    acknowledged head also of the Buddhist Church throughout Mongolia and China. He
                    has no supremacy over his co-religionists in Japan, and even in China there are
                    many Buddhists who are not practically under his control or influence.</p>
