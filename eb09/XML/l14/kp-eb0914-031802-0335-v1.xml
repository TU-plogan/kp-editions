                        de</hi></label> (1643-1687), a French explorer in North America, was born at
                    Rouen in November 1643. He became a settler in Canada, and about 1669, leaving
                    his trading post at La Chine, above Montreal, he sought to reach China by way of
                    the Ohio, supposing, from the reports of Indians, this river to flow into the
                    Pacific. He made explorations of the country between the Ohio and the lakes,
                    but, when Joliet and Marquette made it evident that the main river Mississippi
                    emptied in the Gulf of Mexico, he conceived a vast project for extending the
                    French power in the lower Mississippi valley, and thence attacking Mexico. He
                    obtained extensive grants from the French Government, rebuilt Fort Frontenac,
                    established a post above Niagara Falls, and built a small vessel, in which he
                    sailed up the lakes to Green Bay. Thence, despatching his vessel freighted with
                    furs, he proceeded with the rest of the party, in boats and on foot, to the
                    Illinois river, near the head of which he began a post called Fort Crève Coeur,
                    and a vessel in which to descend the Mississippi. Not hearing of his vessel on
                    the lakes, he detached Hennepin, with one companion, to ascend the Mississippi
                    from the mouth of the ∏linois, and, leaving Tonty, with five men, at Fort Crève
                    Coeur, he returned by land to Canada. Towards the close of 1681 La Salle, with a
                    party in canoes, again reached the head of Lake Michigan, at the present site of
                    Chicago, and, making <pb break="no"

                    it to the Mississippi, which he followed to its mouth, where he set up a cross
                    and the arms of France, April 9, 1682. La Salle fell sick on his voyage up the
                    river, and sent on intelligence of his success, which was carried to France by
                    Father Membré, and was published in Hennepin’s work in 1683. When La Salle
                    reached France, projects were taken up by the Government for an expedition
                    against the rich mining country of northern Mexico. Plans were submitted by La
                    Salle and by Penalosa, a renegade Spaniard, who, while governor of New Mexico in
                    1662, had penetrated apparently to the Mississippi. La Salle was accordingly
                    sent out in July 1684, with four vessels and a small body of soldiers,
                    ostensibly to found an establishment at the mouth of the Mississippi, but really
                    to push on and secure a favourable base of operations, and gain the aid of the
                    Indians against the Spaniards, while awaiting a more powerful force under
                    Penalosa. The design was so well masked, and subsequently misrepresented, that
                    he is generally said to have been carried beyond the Mississippi by the
                    treachery of Beaujeu, a naval officer commanding one of the vessels. After
                    running along the coast, La Salle returned to Espiritu Santo Bay, Texas. There
                    he landed his soldiers, but lost one vessel with valuable stores. He refused
                    Beaujeu’s offer to obtain aid for him from the West Indies, and when that
                    officer, according to his orders, sailed back, La Salle put up a rude fort. Then
                    for two years, from January 1685 to January 1687, he wasted the time in aimless
                    excursions by land, never getting beyond the present limits of Texas, and making
                    no attempt to explore the coast or reach the Mississippi with his remaining
                    vessel. His colonists and soldiery dwindled away; no reinforcements or
                    expedition under Penalosa arrived; and in January 1687, leaving part of his
                    force at Fort St Louis, he set out with the rest to reach Canada by way of the
                    Mississippi to obtain relief. His harshness and arbitrary manner had provoked a
                    bitter feeling among his followers, and he was assassinated on the 19th of
                    March, near the Trinity river. Some of the survivors reached Tonty ’ s post on
                    the Arkansas, and returned to France by way of Canada. The party left at the
                    fort were nearly all cut off by the Indians, a few survivors having been rescued
                    by a Spanish force sent to root out the French.</p>
                <p>For the various operations of La Salle, the chief works are Hennepin’s
                    Description of Louisiana, 1683; Le Clercq’s Establishment of the Faith, 1691;
                    Tonty’s Narrative (1697), and JouteΓs (1713); and the immense collection of
                    documents published by Margry (3 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1875-78). Hennepin and Le
                    Clercq’s accounts were published partially in Shea’s Discovery of the
                    Mississippi, 1852, and recently entire. La Salle’s early explorations have been
                    discussed by Tailhan, Verreau, and Shea, historical scholars generally rejecting
                    the claims set up by Margry. Parkman gives La Salle’s whole career in his
                    Discovery of the Great West, modified, however, greatly in his La Salle, Boston,
                    1879. (J. G. S.)</p>
