                    name Islas de los Ladrones, or “Islands of the Thieves,” was given them by the
                    ship’s crew of Magellan on account of the thieving propensity of the
                    inhabitants. Magellan himself styled them Islas de las Velas Latinas, or
                    “Islands of the Lateen Sails.” San Lazarus archipelago, Jardines, and Prazeres
                    are among the names applied to them by later navigators. They received their
                    present recognized official appellation “Las Marianas” in 1668 in honour of
                    Maria Anna of Austria, widow of king Philip IV. of Spain, and they still form a
                    Spanish colony under the general government of the Philippines. A broad channel
                    divides the Ladrones into two groups, containing a total area of about 417
                    square miles. The northern group (Gani) consists of ten islands, now
                    uninhabited; five islands, of which four are inhabited, form the southern group,
                    viz., Guahan (Guam, Spanish Guajan, the San Juan of old Spanish charts), Rota,
                    Aguigan, Tinian, and Saypan. On Guahan, the largest and southernmost of the
                    group, is the only town in the colony, San Ignacio de Agana, and the fortified
                    harbour of Umata.</p>
                <p>The general surface of the southern islands is far inferior in elevation to that
                    of the northern group, which is mountainous, though the altitudes do not exceed
                    2600 to 2700 feet The predominant rock in the southern group is madreporic
                    limestone, but in some instances, and especially at Guahan, volcanic formations
                    occur. The northern <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n211/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0211-0200"/> islands are entirely of igneous origin, and on
                    Pagan and Uraccas are smoking craters. The coasts of the southern islιnds are in
                    many instances surrounded by reefs. All the islands except Farallon de Medinilla
                    and Mangs (in the northern group) are more or less densely wooded, and the
                    vegetation is luxuriant, much resembling that of the Philippines, whence many
                    species of plants have been introduced. Owing to the humidity of the soil
                    cryptogams are very numerous, as also most kinds of grasses. Among the useful
                    vegetable products may be mentioned areca and cocoa-nut palms, rice, maize,
                    sugar, tobacco, cotton, indigo, breadfruit, bananas, and castor oil. In
                    consequence of the laziness of the native population, agriculture is almost
                    entirely neglected, in spite of the exceptional advantages offered by the
                    climate and soil. On most of the islands there is a plentiful supply of water;
                    at Guahan, however, the partial clearing away of the woods has caused several
                    full streams to dwindle to mere brooks.</p>
                <p>The fauna of the Ladrones, though inferior in number and variety, is similar in
                    character to that of the Carolines, and certain species are indigenous to both
                    colonies. Swine and oxen are allowed to run wild, and are hunted when required:
                    the former were known to the earlier inhabitants; the latter with most other
                    domestic animals were introduced by the Spaniards. The roe was imported from the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <p>The climate of the Ladrones, though humid, is salubrious, whilst the heat, being
                    tempered by the trade winds, is milder than that of the Philippines. The yearly
                    mean temperature at Guahan is about 81° Fahr. August and September are the
                    warmest months, but the variations of temperature are not great. The year may be
                    divided into a wet and dry season, though even in the hitter rain often falls.
                    From October to May the general winds are north-easterly; during the other four
                    months they are often north-westerly and south-westerly, the latter being
                    accompanied by much rain.</p>
                <p>The present population of the Ladrones consists of descendants from the original
                    inhabitants, called by the Spaniards Chamorros, of Tagal settlers from the
                    Philippines, and of a mixed race formed by the union of Spaniards and Chamorros.
                    On the island of Saypan there is a colony from the Carolines. With the exception
                    of the last-mentioned settlers, who are very active, and have founded the
                    village of Garapan, the inhabitants are generally wanting in energy, of
                    indifferent moral character, and miserably poor. Little has yet been done for
                    the improvement of their intellectual and social condition, with the exception
                    of the establishment of a few schools, now mostly fallen into decay. The number
                    of the original inhabitants previous to the subjection of the islands by the
                    Spaniards in 1668 has been variously estimated at from 40,000 to 60,000. The
                    Spanish conquest and the forcible suppression of the protracted opposition of
                    the natives reduced their numbers to such an extent that in 1741 the population
                    was only 1816. From that date, however, owing to the introduction of new
                    colonists from the Philippines, the population began to increase, and in 1856
                    was 9500. In the last year a severe epidemic carried off more than a third of
                    the inhabitants. Since 1871 the total population of the Ladrones has been
                    roughly estimated at 8000. All the inhabitants understand and are able to speak
                    Spanish, which is gradually supplanting the native language, a Micronesian
                    dialect nearly allied to that used by the Tagals of the Philippines. The
                    residence of the governor is at Agana in Guahan. Spain gains no revenue by the
                    possession of these islands.</p>
                <p>The honour of the discovery of this archipelago, the first found by Europeans in
                    the Pacific, is due to Magellan, who upon the 6th of March 1521 observed the two
                    southernmost islands, and sailed between them (O. Peschei, Geschichte des
                    Zeitalters der Entdeckungen, Stuttgart, 1877, p. 500). Modern research in the
                    archipelago began with the visit of Commodore Anson, who in August 1742 landed
                    upon the island of Tinian, where he found extensive ruins (Anson’s Voyage, bk.
                    iii.). The Ladrones were visited by Byron in 1765, Wallis in 1767, and Crozet in
                    1772. Great additions to our knowledge of the islands were made in the present
                    century by Freycinet, in 1829 (Voyage autour du monde, part histor. ii.), and
                    the Spanish captain Sanchez y Zayas, in 1865.</p>
