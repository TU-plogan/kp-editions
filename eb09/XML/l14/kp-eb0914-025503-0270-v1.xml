                <p><label type="entry">LANCASTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">House of</hi></label>. The
                    name House of Lancaster is commonly used to designate the line of kings
                    immediately descended from John of Gaunt, fourth son of Edward III. But the
                    history of the family and of the title goes back a whole century further to the
                    reign of Henry III., who created his second son, Edmund, earl of Lancaster, in
                    1267. This Edmund received in his own day the surname of Crouchback, not, as was
                    afterwards supposed, from a personal deformity, but from having worn a cross
                    upon his back in token of a crusading vow. He is not a person of much importance
                    in history except in relation to a strange theory raised in a later age about
                    his birth, which we shall notice presently. His son Thomas who inherited the
                    title, took the lead among the nobles of Edward H.’s time in opposition to Piers
                    Gaveston and the Spensers, and was beheaded for treason at Pontefract. At the
                    commencement of the following reign his attainder was reversed and his brother
                    Henry restored to the earldom, who, being appointed guardian to the young king
                    Edward III., assisted him to throw off the yoke of Mortimer. On this Henry’s
                    death in 1345 he was succeeded by a son of the same name, sometimes known as
                    Henry Tort-Col or W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> ryneck, a very valiant
                    commander in the French wars, whom the king, for his greater honour, advanced to
                    the dignity of a duke. The title was new in those days, for only one duke had
                    ever been created in England before, and that was fourteen years previously,
                    when the king’s son Edward, so well known in history as the Black Prince, was
                    made duke of Cornwall. This Henry Wryneck died in 1361 without heir male. Of his
                    two daughters, Maud, the elder, was twice married, but died childless little
                    more than a year after her father. The second, Blanche, became the wife of John
                    of Gaunt, who thus succeeded to the duke’s inheritance in her right; and on the
                    13th November 1362, when King Edward attained the age of fifty, he was created
                    duke of Lancaster, his elder brother, Lionel, being at the same time created
                    duke of Clarence. It was from these two dukes that the rival houses of Lancaster
                    and York derived their respective claims to the crown. As Clarence was King
                    Edward’s third son, while John of Gaunt was only his fourth, it ought to have
                    followed in ordinary course that on the failure of the elder line the issue of
                    Clarence should have taken precedence of that of Lancaster in the succession.
                    But the rights of Clarence were conveyed in the first instance to an only
                    daughter, and the ambition and policy of the house of Lancaster, profiting by
                    advantageous circumstances, enabled them not only to gain possession of the
                    throne but to maintain themselves in it for three generations before they were
                    dispossessed by the representatives of the elder brother.</p>
                <p>As for John of Gaunt himself, it can hardly be said that this sort of politic
                    wisdom is very conspicuous in him. His ambition was generally more manifest than
                    his discretion; but fortune favoured his ambition, even as to himself somewhat
                    beyond expectation, and still more in his posterity. Before the death of his
                    father he had become the greatest subject in England, his three elder brothers
                    having all died before him. He had even added to his other dignities the title
                    of king of Castile, having married, after his first wife’s death, the daughter
                    of Peter the Cruel. The title, however, was an empty one, the throne of Castile
                    being actually in the possession of Henry of Trastamara, whom <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n271/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0271-0256"/> the English had vainly endeavoured to set
                    aside. His military and naval enterprises were for the most part disastrous
                    failures, and in England he was exceedingly unpopular. Nevertheless during the
                    later years of his father’s reign the weakness of the king and the declining
                    health of the Black Prince naturally threw the government very much into his
                    hands. He even aimed, or was suspected of aiming, at the succession to the
                    crown; but in this hope he was disappointed by the action of the Good Parliament
                    a year before Edward’s death, in which it was settled that Richard the son of
                    the Black Prince should be king after his grandfather. Nevertheless the
                    suspicion with which he was regarded was not altogether quieted when Richard
                    came to the throne, a boy in the eleventh year of his age. The duke himself
                    complained in parliament of the way he was spoken of out of doors, and at the
                    outbreak of Wat Tyler’s insurrection the peasants stopped pilgrims on the road
                    to Canterbury and made them swear never to accept a king of the name of John. On
                    gaining possession of London they gave still more emphatic proof of their
                    dislike to him by burning his magnificent palace of the Savoy. The young king
                    himself shared the general feeling, and after a few years John of Gaunt ceased
                    for a time to have much influence. Richard found a convenient way to get rid of
                    him by sending him to Castile ta make good his barren title, and on this
                    expedition he was away three years. He succeeded, however, so far as to make a
                    treaty with his rival, King John, son of Henry of Trastamara, for the
                    succession, by virtue of which his daughter Catherine became queen of Castile
                    some years later. After his return the king seems to have segarded him with
                    greater favour, created him duke of Aquitaine, and employed him in repeated
                    embassies to France, which at length resulted in a treaty of peace, and
                    Richard’s marriage to the French king’s daughter.</p>
                <p>Another marked incident of his public life was the support which he gave on one
                    occasion to the Reformer Wycliffe. How far this was due to religious and how far
                    to mere political considerations may be a question; but it is certain that, in
                    one way or another, not only John of Gaunt but his immediate descendants, the
                    three kings of the house of Lancaster, all took deep interest in the religious
                    movements of the times. A reaction against Lollardy, however, had already begun
                    in the days of Henry IV., and both he and his son were obliged to discountenance
                    opinions which were believed to be politically and theologically dangerous.</p>
                <p>Accusations had been made against John of Gaunt more than once during the earlier
                    part of Richard II.’s reign of entertaining designs to supplant his nephew on
                    the throne. But these Richard never seems to have wholly credited, and during
                    his three years’ absence his younger brother, Thomas of Woodstock, duke of
                    Gloucester, showed himself a far more dangerous intriguer. Five confederate
                    lords with Gloucester at their head took up arms against the king’s favourite
                    ministers, and the Wonderful Parliament put to death without remorse almost
                    every agent of his former administration that had not fled the country.
                    Gloucester even contemplated the dethronement of the king, but found that in
                    this matter he could not rely on the support of his associates, one of whom was
                    Henry, earl of Derby, the duke of Lancaster’s son. Richard soon afterwards, by
                    declaring himself of age, shook off his uncle’s control, and within ten years
                    the acts of the Wonderful Parliament were reversed by a parliament no less
                    arbitrary. Gloucester and his allies were then brought to severe account; but
                    the earl of Derby and Thomas Mowbray, earl of Nottingham, were taken into favour
                    as having opposed the more violent proceedings of their associates. As if to
                    show his entire confidence in both these noblemen, the king created the former
                    duke of Hereford and the latter duke of Norfolk. But within three months after
                    the one duke accused the other of treason, and the truth of the charge, after
                    much consideration, was referred to trial by battle according to the laws of
                    chivalry. But when the combat was about to commence it was interrupted by the
                    king, who, to preserve the peace of the kingdom, decreed by his own mere
                    authority that the duke of Hereford should be banished for ten years—a term
                    which was immediately after reduced to five—and the duke of Norfolk for
                    life.</p>
                <p>This arbitrary sentence was obeyed in the first instance by both parties, and
                    Norfolk never returned. But Henry, duke of Hereford, whose milder sentence was
                    doubtless owing to the fact that he was the popular favourite, came back within
                    a year, having been furnished with a very fair pretext for doing so by a new act
                    of injustice on the part of Richard. His father, John of Gaunt, had died in the
                    interval, and the king, troubled with a rebellion in Ireland, and sorely in want
                    of money, had seized the duchy of Lancaster as forfeited property. Henry at once
                    sailed for England, and landing in Yorkshire while King Richard was in Ireland,
                    gave out that he came only to recover his inheritance. He at once received the
                    support of the northern lords, and as he marched southwards his followers became
                    more numerous at every turn. The whole kingdom was soon practically at his
                    command, and Richard, by the time he had recrossed the channel to Wales,
                    discovered that his cause was altogether lost. He was conveyed from Chester to
                    London, and forced to execute a deed by which he resigned his crown. This was
                    recited in parliament, and he was formally deposed. The duke of Lancaster then
                    stepped forward and claimed the kingdom as due to himself by virtue of his
                    descent from Henry III.</p>
                <p>The claim which he put forward involved, to all appearance, a strange
                    falsification of history, for it seemed to rest upon the supposition that Edmund
                    of Lancaster, and not Edward I., was the eldest son of Henry III. A story had
                    gone about, even in the days of John of Gaunt, who, if we may trust the rhymer
                    Hardyng <hi rend="italic">(Chronicle,</hi> pp. 290, 291), had artfully got it
                    inserted in chronicles deposited in various monasteries, that this Edmund,
                    surnamed Crouchback, was really hump-backed, and that he was set aside in favour
                    of his younger brother Edward on account of his deformity. No chronicle,
                    however, is known to exist which actually states that Edmund Crouchback was thus
                    set aside; and in point of fact he had no deformity at all, while Edward was six
                    years his senior. Hardyng’s testimony is, moreover, suspicious as reflecting the
                    prejudices of the Percys after they had turned against Henry IV., for Hardyng
                    himself expressly says that the earl of Northumberland was the source of his
                    information (see note, p. 353 of his <hi rend="italic">chronicle).</hi> But a
                    statement in the continuation of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> called the
                        <hi rend="italic">Eulogium</hi> (vol. iii. pp. 369, 370) corroborates
                    Hardyng to some extent; for we are told that John of Gaunt had once desired in
                    parliament that his son should be recognized on this flimsy plea as heir to the
                    crown; and, when the earl of March denied the story and insisted on his own
                    claim as descended from Lionel, duke of Clarence, Richard put an end to the
                    discussion and imposed silence on both parties. However this may be, it is
                    certain that this story, though not directly asserted to be true, was indirectly
                    pointed at by Henry when he put forward his claim, and no one was then bold
                    enough to challenge it.</p>
                <p>This was partly due, no doubt, to the fact that the true lineal heir after
                    Richard was then a child, who had just succeeded his father as earl of March.
                    Another circumstance was unfavourable to the house of Mortimer—that it derived
                    its title through a woman. No case precisely similar had as yet arisen, and,
                    notwithstanding the precedent<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n272/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0272-0257"/> of Henry II., it might be doubted whether
                    succession through a female was favoured by the constitution. If not, Henry
                    could say with truth that he was the direct heir of his grandfather, Edward III.
                    If, on the other hand, succession through females was valid, he could trace his
                    descent through his mother from Henry III. by a very illustrious line of
                    ancestors. And, in the words by which he formally made his claim, he ventured to
                    say no more than that he was descended from the king just mentioned “by right
                    line of the blood.” In what particular way that “right line” was to be traced he
                    did not venture to indicate.</p>
                <p>It is unnecessary in this article to relate the history of the three successive
                    kings belonging to the house of Lancaster (Henry 1V., V., and VI.), as a brief
                    epitome of their reigns will be found elsewhere (see vol. xi. pp. 659- 662).
                    With the death of the last-named sovereign the direct male line of John of Gaunt
                    became extinct. But by his daughters he became the ancestor of more than one
                    line of foreign kings, while his descendants by his third wife, Catherine
                    Swynford, conveyed the crown of England to the house of Tudor. It is true that
                    his children by this lady were born before he married her; but they were made
                    legitimate by act of parliament, and, though Henry IV. in confirming the
                    privilege thus granted to them endeavoured to debar them from the succession to
                    the crown, it is now ascertained that there was no such reservation in the
                    original Act, and the title claimed by Henry VII. was probably better than he
                    himself supposed.</p>
