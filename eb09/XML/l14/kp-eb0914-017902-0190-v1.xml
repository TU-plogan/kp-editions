                <p><label type="entry">LABYRINTH</label>. I. The legendary labyrinth is one of the
                    clearest examples of the close relation between mythology and the early stages
                    of the industrial arts. The word <hi rend="italic">λαβύρινθοί</hi> is derived
                    from the λαύραι or passages of a mine; the digamma before the <hi rend="italic"
                        >p</hi> has become in the latter a vowel, while in the former it retains its
                    consonantal value. The mines of Greece, like those of Thrace and the Aegean
                    Islands, were probably first worked by the Phoenician traders; and the
                    simple-minded natives regarded the strange holes in the ground with wonder and
                    awe. To the natural fear of darkness was added the invariable tendency of the
                    uneducated to regard as supernatural the power conferred by superior knowledge;
                    moreover, the god of the riches of the lower world was also the god of death and
                    the dead. Their fear expressed itself in tales of the extraordinary
                    ramifications of the dark passages and of the danger to which any heedless
                    intruder into them was exposed. The maze of passages was called a labyrinth; the
                    word became a proper name and gained a life and meaning of its own in legend,
                    quite unconnected with its original application. It retained a more antique
                    form, as proper names frequently do, whereas the mining term λαύρα lost the
                    older character of the digamma. It must have been comparatively late before the
                    word labyrinth acquired this new independence and connotation. The best-known
                    instance of its mythic character is found in the legends of Crete. It was
                    interwoven with the tales, partly founded on historical events and partly
                    derived from ancient religion, which clustered round the name of Minos. The
                    skilful workman, Daedalus, who sums up all the legendary conceptions of skill in
                    handicraft, made for King Minos a labyrinth, in the centre of which the Minotaur
                    was placed. No one who entered this labyrinth could find his way out again; he
                    became the prey of the monster. The seven youths and seven maidens sent
                    regularly by the Athenians as tribute were thus devoured, until Theseus slew the
                    Minotaur, and escaped out of the labyrinth by the help of the clue which Ariadne
                    had given him.</p>
                <p>Pliny says that there had been in Crete a building called the labyrinth, of which
                    no remains existed in his time; but Hoek has proved quite certainly from the
                    discrepancies and contradictions in accounts and in representations on coins
                    that it had never a real existence. The rocks of Crete are full of winding
                    caves, and these gave the first hint of the legendary labyrinth. This labyrinth
                    is, by the <pb break="no"

                    figured on coins of that city. Late writers, such as Claudian, represent it as
                    being beside Gortyna, and there is a wonderful set of winding passages and
                    chambers in the rocks near that place, which is still pointed out as the
                    labyrinth. When the name had once acquired this meaning, it was applied to
                    several real buildings, of which the following are the most famous. 1. The
                    Egyptian labyrinth, beside the town of Arsinoe or Crocodilopolis, was in two
                    stories, one of them underground, and contained three thousand rooms. Strabo
                    thinks it was built as a common place of meeting for the people of the various
                    nomes; Herodotus and Diodorus say that it was the burial place of the twelve
                    kings who ruled Egypt about 700 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Müller <hi
                        rend="italic">(Hist. Greek Art,</hi> § 50-2) also thinks the object of such
                    buildings must have been sepulchral. 2. The Samian labyrinth was built by
                    Theodorus, one of the Samian school of sculptors, for the tyrant Polycrates. It
                    had a hundred and fifty columns, and Pliny says that some scanty remains of it
                    existed in his time. 3. The Lemnian labyrinth, mentioned by Pliny, seems to be a
                    confusion with the Samian <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Pliny, xxxvi. 19, 3 with
                    83). 4. The Italian labyrinth was a series of chambers in the lower part of the
                    grave of Porsenna at Cluûum. Some maintain that this tomb has been found in the
                    mound named Poggio Gajella near Chiusi.</p>
                <p>See Herod, ii. 148; Str. p. 811; Plin. xxxvi. 13 and 19; Müller, Etrusker;
                    Dennis, Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria; Hoek, Kreta. Cockerell {Travels'), and
                    Prokesch {Denkwürdigkeiten) describe the so-called labyrinth of Gortyna.</p>
                <p>II. In gardening, a labyrinth or maze means an intricate network of pathways
                    enclosed by hedges or plantations, so that those who enter become bewildered in
                    their efforts to find the centre or make their exit. It is a remnant of the old
                    geometrical style of gardening, but is yet occasionally introduced into pleasure
                    grounds. There are two methods of forming it. That which is perhaps the more
                    common consists of walks, or alleys as they were formerly called, laid out and
                    kept to an equal width or nearly so by parallel hedges, which should be kept so
                    close and thick that the eye cannot readily penetrate through them. The task is
                    to get to the centre, which is often raised, and generally contains a covered
                    seat, a fountain, a statue, or even a small group of trees. After reaching this
                    point the next thing is to return to the entrance, when it is found that egress
                    is as difficult as ingress. To every design of this sort there should be a key,
                    but even those who know the key are apt to be perplexed. Sometimes the design
                    consists of alleys only, as in fig. 1, published in 1706 by</p>
                <p>London and Wise. In such a case, when the further end is reached, there only
                    remains to travel back again. Of a more pretentious character was a design
                    published by Switzer in 1742. This is of octagonal form, with very numerous
                    parallel hedges and paths, and “six different entrances, whereof there is but
                    one that leads to the centre, and that is attended with some difficulties and a
                    great many stops.” Some of the older designs for labyrinths, on the other hand,
                    avoid this close parallelism of the alleys, which, though equally involved and
                    intricate in their windings, are carried through blocks of thick planting, as
                    shown in fig. 2, from a design published in 1728 by Batty Langley. These blocks
                    of shrubbery have been called wildernesses. To this latter class belongs the
                    celebrated labyrinth at Versailles (fig. 3), of which Switzer observes, that it
                    “is allowed by all to be the noblest of its kind in the world.” <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0192-0181"/> Whatever style be adopted, it is essential
                    that there should be a thick healthy growth of the hedges or shrubberies that
                    confine the wanderer. The trees used should be impenetrable to the eye, and so
                    tall that no one can look over them; and the paths should be of gravel and well
                    kept. The trees chiefly used for the hedges, and the best for the purpose, are
                    the hornbeam among deciduous trees, or the yew among evergreens. The beech might
                    be used instead of the hornbeam on suitable soil. The green holly might be
                    planted as an evergreen with very good results, and so might the American arbor
                    vitae if the natural soil presented no obstacle. The ground must be well
                    prepared, so as to give the trees a good start, and a mulching of manure during
                    the early years of their growth would be of much advantage to them. They must be
                    kept trimmed in or clipped, especially in their earlier stages; trimming with
                    the knife is much to be preferred to clipping with shears. It is not advisable
                    to allow the hedge to run up too quickly or irregularly, so that any plants
                    getting much in advance of the rest should be topped, and the whole kept to some
                    4 feet or 5 feet in height until the lower parts are well thickened, when it may
                    be allowed to acquire the allotted height by moderate annual increments. In
                    cutting, the hedge (as indeed all hedges) should be kept broadest at the base
                    and narrowed upwards, which prevents it from getting thin and bare below by the
                    stronger growth being drawn to the tops.</p>
                <p>The maze in the gardens at Hampton Court Palace (fig. 4) is considered to be one
                    of the finest examples in England. It was planted in the early part of the reign
                    of William III., though it has been supposed that a maze had existed there since
                    the time of Henry VIII. It is constructed on the hedge and alley system, and
                    was, we believe, originally planted with hornbeam, but many of the plants have
                    died out, and been replaced by hollies, yews, &amp;c., so that the vegetation is
                    mixed. The walks are about half a mile in length, and the extent of ground
                    occupied is a little over a quarter of an acre. The centre contains two large
                    trees, with a seat beneath each. The key to reach this resting place is to keep
                    the right hand continuously in contact with the hedge from first to last, going
                    round all the stops.</p>
                <p>The maze in the gardens at Somerleyton Hall, near Lowestoft (fig. 5), was
                    designed by Mr John Thomas. The hedges are of English yew, and are in very fine
                    condition, without a break or flaw. They are about 6⅜ feet high, and have been
                    planted a little over thirty years. In the centre is a grass mound, which is
                    raised to the height of the hedges, and on this mound is erected a pagoda, which
                    is approached by a curved grass path. At the two corners on the western side are
                    banks of laurels some 15 or 16 feet high, which are kept trimmed with the knife.
                    On each side of the hedges throughout the labyrinth is a small strip of
                    grass.</p>
                <p>There was also a labyrinth at Theobald’s Park, near Cheshunt, when this place
                    passed from the earl of Salisbury into the possession of James I Another is said
                    to have existed at Wimbledon House, the seat of Earl Spencer, which was probably
                    laid out by Brown in the last century. There is an interesting labyrinth,
                    somewhat after η P⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="subscript">

                <p>When the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at South Kensington were
                    being planned, the Prince Consort, the president of the society, especially
                    desired that there should be a maze formed in the ante-garden, which was made in
                    the form shown in fig. 6. This labyrinth, which was designed by the late Lieut.
                    W. A. Nesfield, was for many years the chief point of attraction to the younger
                    class of visitors to the gardens; but at last it was allowed to go to ruin, and
                    had to be destroyed. (T. MO.)</p>
