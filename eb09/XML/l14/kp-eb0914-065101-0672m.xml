                    France, and the ancient capital of Limousin, lies in the form of an amphitheatre
                    on the right bank of the Vienne, 248 miles by rail south-south-west from Paris,
                    on the Paris and Toulouse Railway, at its junction with the Charente line. It
                    has also direct railway communication by Bellac with Poitiers. The population in
                    1876 was 59,011. In spite of many modern improvements and clearances, commencing
                    with the administration of Turgot in 1762, the city still contains old quarters,
                    which are dark, wretched, and unhealthy.</p>
                <p>The cathedral, the most remarkable building, not only in the town but in the
                    entire province, is in the Parisian Ogival style, and occupies the site of an
                    old heathen basilica, which, according to tradition, was transformed into a
                    Christian church by St Martial. The present edifice was built between 1273 and
                    1327, and has been quite recently restored, the north front of the transept,
                    distinguished by the richness and perfection of its details, having been finally
                    completed in 1851.∙ The campanile is an elegant slightly leaning tower, 204 feet
                    high. The interior of the church is remarkable for the boldness and elegance of
                    its construction. It has a magnificent rood-loft, attributed to Bishop Jean de
                    Langeac (1533); close by the choir screen is the mausoleum of the same prelate.
                    The glass was repaired in the 16th century, but is still undergoing restoration.
                    Under the choir is the crypt of the old Roman church, containing frescos of the
                    11th century. Some of the houses still standing in Limoges date from the
                    Middle</p>
                <p>Ages; and commemorative tablets mark the birthplace of the chancellor D’Aguesseau
                    and of Marshals Jourdan and Bugeaud. There is a museum of painting and
                    sculpture, and, in connexion with the local industry, a very valuable ceramic
                    museum. Limoges is the headquarters of the 12th army corps, and is also the seat
                    of several learned societies, and of a court of appeal.</p>
                <p>The principal industry is the manufacture of porcelain. The kaolin of St Yrieix
                    is of such superior quality that it is exported even to America; the pegmatite
                    used for enamel is obtained at Chanteloube, about 25 miles from Limoges, on the
                    Paris railway. Thirty-five factories with eighty furnaces and fifty-four
                    painting rooms (800 artists) employ 5800 workers of both sexes, and produce
                    goods to the annual value of 12 millions of francs. There are many others in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of the town. Limoges has also wool and cotton
                    spinning-mills, and cloth factories, paper-works, foundries, &lt;fcc. Shoemaking
                    gives employment to 600 persons, and the manufacture of clogs to 250. There is
                    an extensive trade in wine and spirits, cattle, cereals, and wood. The Vienne is
                    navigable for rafts above Limoges, and the logs brought down by the current are
                    stopped at the entrance of the town by the inhabitants of the Naveix quarter,
                    who form a special guild for this industry.</p>
                <p>Limoges was a place of importance even at the time of the Roman conquest, and
                    sent ten thousand soldiers to the defence of Alesia. In 11 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> it took the name of Augustus <hi rend="italic">(ΛugustοrRum)</hi>;
                    but in the 4th century it was anew called by the name of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcmοviοcs,</hi> whose capital it was. It then contained palaces and baths, had
                    its own senate and the right of coinage. (Till 1837 it had a mint.) Christianity
                    was introduced by St Martial. In the 5th century Limoges was devastated by the
                    Vandals and the Visigoths. Viscounts were set over it by Clovis. It suffered
                    again in the wars between the Franks and the people of Aquitaine, from Norman
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n673/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0673-0652"/> invasion, and from a struggle which arose between
                    two parties into which the city was divided, led by the abbot of St Martial and
                    by the bishop respectively. During the Hundred Years’ War it was taken again and
                    again by the French and English. Confiscated under John Lackland, it was again
                    ceded by Louis IX. In 1370 the Black Prince took it by assault, and gave it up
                    to fire and sword,— a disaster from which it was slow to recover. The religious
                    wars, pestilence, and famine desolated it in turn, but the ravages of all these
                    were surpassed by the plague of 1630-31, which carried off more than twenty
                    thousand persons. The wise administrations of Henri d’Aguesseau, father of the
                    chancellor, and of Turgot enabled Limoges to recover its former prosperity.
                    There have been several noteworthy conflagrations, destroying whole quarters of
                    the city, built, as it then was, of wood. That of 1790 lasted for two months,
                    and destroyed one hundred and ninety-nine houses; that of 1864 laid under ashes
                    an area of 10,000 square metres. Limoges celebrates every seven years a curious
                    religious festival (Fête d’Ostension), during which the relics of St Martial are
                    exposed for seven weeks, attracting large numbers of visitors. It dates from the
                    10th century, and commemorates a pestilence (mal des ardents) which, after
                    destroying forty thousand persons, is believed to have been stayed by the
                    intercession of the saint.</p>
