                <p><label type="entry">LAKE</label>. When a stream in its course meets with a
                    depression in the land it flows into it and tends to fill it up to the lip of
                    its lowest exit. Whether it succeeds in doing this or not depends on the
                    climate. In the British Islands, and in most temperate and equatorial regions,
                    the stream would fill the depression and run over, and the surplus water would
                    flow on towards the sea. Such a depression, with its contents of practically
                    stagnant water, constitutes a lake, and its water would be fresh. In warm dry
                    regions, however, such as are frequently met with in tropical latitudes, it
                    might easily happen that the evaporation from the surface of the depression,
                    supposed filled with water, might be greater than the supply from the feeding
                    stream and from rain falling on its surface. The level of the waters in the
                    depression would then stand at such a height that the evaporation from its
                    surface would exactly balance the supply from streams and rain. We should have
                    as the result a lake whose waters would be salt. Lakes of the first kind may be
                    considered as enlargements of rivers, those of the second kind as isolated
                    portions of the ocean; indeed, salt lakes are very frequently called seas, as
                    the Caspian Sea and the Dead Sea. The occurrence of freshwater lakes and salt
                    lakes in the same drainage system is not uncommon. In this case the salt lake
                    forms the termination. Well known examples of this <pb break="no"

                    America, and Lake Tiberias and the Dead Sea on the Jordan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distribution of Lakes.—</hi> Although there are few countries
                    where lakes are entirely absent, still it requires little study to see that they
                    are much more thickly grouped in some places than in others. Of the larger
                    lakes, for instance, we have the remarkable group in North America, which
                    together form the greatest extent of fresh water in the world. A similar group
                    of immense lakes is found in Central Africa :—Lakes Victoria Nyanza and Albert
                    Nyanza, whose overflow waters go to form the Nile; Lake Tanganyika, at the
                    source of the Congo; and LakeNyassa, on a tributary to the Zambesi. In Asia the
                    largest freshwater lake is Lake Baikal, on the upper waters of the Lena. All
                    these freshwater lakes of great size are at the sources of large and important
                    rivers; the salt lakes in which Asia also abounds are at the mouths of large
                    rivers, as the Caspian at the rnouth of the Volga, and Aral Sea at the mouth of
                    the Oxus.</p>
                <p>Passing from the consideration of these larger lakes, which from their size may
                    be considered inland oceans, and which therefore necessarily occur in small
                    number, we find large numbers of lakes of comparatively small dimensions, and
                    when we consider them attentively we find that they are reducible to a small
                    number of species, and, as in the case of plants and animals, the distribution
                    of these species is regulated chiefly by climate, but also by geological
                    conditions. Perhaps the most important and remarkable species of lakes is that
                    to which the Scottish lakes belong. They are generally characterized by
                    occupying long narrow depressions in the valleys of a mountainous country in the
                    neighbourhood of the sea, and in a temperate climate. On the sea-coast, lakes of
                    this character are found in Norway, Scotland, Newfoundland, Canada, the southern
                    extremity of South America, and the south end of the middle island of New
                    Zealand; somewhat removed from the sea we have the Alpine lakes of Switzerland
                    and Tyrol, and the great Italian lakes, all of which display the same features
                    as those of Scotland or of Norway. In many flat countries lakes are
                    extraordinarily abundant, as for instance in the north part of Russia and
                    Finland, in the southern part of Sweden, in the northern parts of Canada, and on
                    a small scale in the Hebrides.</p>
                <p>Lagoons, found on all low sandy coasts, owe their origin to the shifting of the
                    sand under the influence of the wind and tide. They are found at the mouths of
                    large rivers, as on the Baltic and at the mouth of the Garonne.</p>
                <p>In volcanic regions lakes are not uncommon, generally of a more or less circular
                    form, and either occupying the site of extinct craters or due to subsidences
                    consequent on volcanic eruptions; such are the Maare of the Eifel in Germany,
                    and many lakes in Italy and in the Azores.</p>
                <p>Lakes are not only widely distributed in latitude and longitude, they also occur
                    at all elevations. Indeed, as a certain elevation above the sea produces an
                    effect as regards climate equivalent to a certain increase of latitude, we find
                    lakes existing in the centre of continents, and on high plateaus and mountain
                    ranges, in latitudes where they would be speedily dried up if at the level of
                    the sea. Many of the lakes in Scotland (as Lochs Lomond, Morar, Coruisk), of
                    Norway, of British Columbia, and of southern Chili are raised only by a few feet
                    above the level of the sea, and are separated from it often by only a few
                    hundred yards of land, while in the Cordilleras of South America we have Lake
                    Titicaca 12,500 feet, and in Asia Lake Kokonor 10,500 feet above the sea. Many
                    lakes whose surface is raised high above the level of the sea are so deep that
                    their bottom reaches considerably below that level.</p>

                    with a number of lakes in different parts of the world, presented in the

                </table>
                <p>From this table it will be seen that by far the largest continuous sheet of fresh
                    water is the group of North American lakes, and of these Lake Superior is more
                    than double the size of any of the others; this is principally due to its great
                    breadth, as it is very little longer than Lake Michigan. Lake Superior
                    communicates with Lakes Michigan and Huron, which are really branches of one and
                    the same lake, by the St Mary’s river, the fall being 49 feet from Superior to
                    Huron. Huron empties itself into Erie by the St Clair river, Lake St Clair, and
                    finally the Detroit river. Lake Erie overflows by the Niagara river and falls
                    into Lake Ontario, whence the water finally is conveyed to the sea by the St
                    Lawrence. The area of the lakes together is in round numbers 100,000 square
                    miles, and, if that of the St Lawrence and its estuary be added, the water area
                    will be about 150,000 square miles, while the whole drainage area is only
                    537,000 square miles. Hence of the water conveyed by the St Lawrence to the sea,
                    rather more than one-fourth falls on the surface of the water itself. Looking to
                    their great extent, we should have suspected them to be much deeper than is
                    found to be the case. The deepest, Lake Superior, is no deeper than Loch Morar
                    in Inverness-shire. Comparatively shallow, however, as they are, the bottoms of
                    them all, with the exception of Erie, are several hundred feet below the level
                    of the sea. It has been supposed that in former times this chain of lakes formed
                    an arm of the sea similar to the Baltic in Europe, and in support of this view
                    we have the fact of the discovery of marine forms in Lake Michigan.</p>
                <p>In Asia Lake Baikal is in every way comparable to the great Canadian lakes as
                    regards size. Its area of over 9000 square miles makes it about equal to Erie in
                    superficial extent, while its enormous depth of over 4000 feet makes the volume
                    of its waters almost equal to that of Lake Superior. Although its surface is
                    1360 feet above, the sea-level, its bottom is 2720 feet below it. A former
                    connexion with the ocean has been claimed for this lake, owing to the fact that
                    seals inhabit its waters. Other large lakes in Asia are mostly salt, and some
                    lie wholly below the level of the sea. Thus the Caspian lies 85 feet below the
                    Black Sea, and the bottom at its greatest depth is 3600 feet deeper. The Dead
                    Sea is over 1300 feet deep, and its surface is 1272 feet below the
                    Mediterranean, so that its bottom is 2580 feet below the level of the sea. In
                    the Caspian seals are found. A former connexion with the Red Sea has been
                    claimed for the Dead Sea, but this <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n229/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0229-0218"/> is disallowed by Peschel and others. The Jordan
                    valley, with the Sea of Tiberias and the Dead Sea, lie on the line of an
                    extensive fault, and it is claimed that this depression in the surface occurred
                    with the production of the fault. Further evidence in support of the statement
                    that the Dead Sea was never connected with the sea is of a negative character,
                    and consists chiefly in the fact that marine forms have not been found in the
                    waters of the Jordan or of Lake Tiberias, and that silver is absent from the
                    waters of the Dead Sea.</p>
                <p>A former connexion with the ocean is claimed for a number of the Swiss and
                    Italian lakes by Dr Forel and Professor Pavesi, and the Norwegian lakes by Loven
                    and Sars, on the ground of the occurrence of marine forms of the crustaceans and

                <p><hi rend="italic">Temperature of Lakes.—</hi> The earliest reliable temperature
                    observations in lakes or seas are those of Saussure, and they are to be found in
                    his charming <hi rend="italic">Voyage dans les</hi><hi rend="italic">Alpes.</hi>
                    He was the first to obtain thoroughly trustworthy observations in the deeper
                    waters of the lakes. He used for this purpose an ordinary thermometer whose bulb
                    was covered over with several thicknesses of cloth and wax, so as to render it
                    very slowly conducting. He was in the habit of leaving it down fourteen hours,
                    and then bringing it up as quickly as possible and immediately reading the
                    temperature. He did not, however, trust to his thermometer not changing its
                    reading while being brought up, but by an elaborate series of experiments he
                    obtained corrections, to be applied when the thermometer had to be drawn through
                    more or less water of higher temperature. His observations are collected in the
                    following table along with those of Jardine in some of the Scottish lakes, at
                    the beginning of the century :—</p>

                <p>An exceedingly important and valuable series of observations was made by Fischer
                    and Brunner<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mem. Sοc.
                    Phys. Genève, xii. p. 255.</p></note> in the Lake of Thun throughout the course
                    of a whole year (March 1848 to February 1849). They used, after Saussure’s
                    method, thermometers protected by non-conducting envelopes, which were pulled up
                    as quickly as possible. The depth of the water where they observed was 540 feet,
                    and they made a series of observations of the temperature at that depth, at the
                    surface, and at eleven intermediate depths, and repeated the series of
                    observations at eight different dates over the year. From these series, which
                    afford the first information of the yearly march of temperature at different
                    depths, we learn that the lake as a whole gains heat till the end of September,
                    then loses it until the month of February, when it begins to warm again, though
                    slowly. The maximum temperature occurs in October at depths from the surface to
                    70 feet, in November at depths from 70 to 120 feet, in December from 120 to 200
                    feet, and in February at 500 feet. As the whole yearly variation of the
                    temperature at 200 feet is less than a degree, the epoch at which the greater
                    depths attain their maximum and minimum temperatures cannot be certainly deduced
                    from one year’s observations. The minimum temperature of depths from the surface
                    to 80 feet is attained in the month of February, at greater depths in the month
                    of March. During the course of the whole year the temperature at the bottom
                    varied between 40 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 7 and 40 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 9 Fahr., and in the month of February the whole of
                    the water from the surface to the bottom was between 40° ∙7 and 41° Fahr.</p>
                <p>These and other observations showed that, from depths of 400 feet, the variation
                    of temperature with increasing depth is quite insignificant, so that even though
                    the lake might be 1000 feet deep the temperature at 400 feet is only one or two
                    tenths of a degree different from that of the bottom; further, on many of the
                    thermometers recently used, it is impossible to distinguish with certainty
                    temperatures differing by less than half a degree, consequently it was not
                    difficult to believe that in all deep lakes there is a considerable stratum of
                    water which remains constantly at the same temperature, all the year and every
                    year, and that in winter this stratum thickens so as often to fill the lake, and
                    gets thinner again in summer. By the improvement of the instruments both of
                    these suppositions have been shown to be erroneous. In summer and in temperate
                    latitudes, however deep the lake may be, its temperature falls as the depth
                    increases, first rapidly and then very slowly, and the bottom temperature
                    observed in any summer depends on the nature of the winter which preceded it,
                    and may vary from year to year by one to two degrees. It was also believed that
                    the deep water of a lake preserved constantly the mean winter temperature or the
                    mean temperature of the six coldest months of the year in the locality. This was
                    deduced from some observations by Sir Robert Christison in Loch Lomond, who
                    found the bottom temperature at Tarbet to be 41 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi>
                    4 Fahr., agreeing with the mean of the six winter months as observed at Balloch
                    Castle, which, however, is about 15 miles distant. Although the theorem may be
                    accidentally true for Loch Lomond, it has been proved not to hold for other
                    lakes. Thus Simony <hi rend="italic">(Wien.</hi><hi rend="italic">Sitz.

                <p>It will be seen that, with the exception of the end of 1872, the mean winter
                    temperature is below that of the bottom water, and generally very markedly
                    so.</p>
                <p>During 1877-81 observations have been made by the present writer on the
                    distribution of temperature in lakes forming part of the Caledonian Canal. The
                    monthly mean temperatures at Culloden and at Corran Ferry lighthouse, which
                    cannot differ much in climate from Loch Ness and Loch Lochy respectively, have
                    been supplied by Mr Buchan of the Scottish Meteorological Society. The bottom
                    temperatures are those observed in the deepest part of the lakes, namely, 120
                    fathoms in Loch Ness, and 80 fathoms in Loch Lochy. The connexion between bottom

                </table>
                <p>From this table it is apparent that the bottom temperature, even of lakes as deep
                    as Loch Ness, is subject to considerable variation from year to year, that it
                    depends on the temperature of the previous winter, and that it is usually higher
                    than that temperature. The difference between the bottom temperature and the
                    mean winter temperature is greater the lower the winter temperature is. It is
                    further interesting to notice that the mean winter temperature of 1878-79 was
                    about one degree higher than that of 1880-81, yet the bottom temperatures were
                    0° '25 lower in 1879 than in 1881, and this is no doubt due to the fact that the
                    cold of 1878-79 was more continuous than that of 1880-81, when the actual
                    temperatures observed were much lower. The temperature of the bottom water
                    depends not only on the temperature of the previous winter, and on the depth of
                    the lake; it also depends on the nature of the country where it lies, and
                    especially on its exposure to winds. Winds drive the surface water before them,
                    and if there were no return current it would be heaped up at the further end.
                    The effect is to accumulate surface water at one end, and to draw on deeper
                    water to make up the deficiency at the other end. Hence the prevailing direction
                    of the wind impresses itself on the distribution of temperature in the water;
                    and this is well shown in the distribution of temperature as determined from
                    observations at five stations on the same day in Loch Ness in a summer after a
                    warm winter, and in one after a cold winter. In Scotland, warm weather is
                    associated with southerly and westerly winds, and cold weather with northerly
                    and easterly winds. In the warm years we have accumulation of surface water at
                    the north-eastern end, and of bottom water at the south-western end, producing
                    in summer a higher mean temperature of water at the north-east, and a lower mean
                    temperature of water at the south-west end. In cold years the reverse is
                    observed. Thus in 1879, after a cold winter, the mean temperature of the first
                    300 feet of water at the south-west end of Loch Ness was 48° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 8, and at the north-east end 44° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 96, a difference of nearly four degrees. In 1880,
                    after a comparatively mild winter, it was 48° ’ 13 at the south-west end, and 47
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 95 at the north-east end, or nearly identical
                    temperatures. Even at stations a few hundred yards from each other, great
                    differences are often observed in the temperatures observed at the same depth,
                    and it is evident that the difference of density so produced must cause a
                    certain amount of circulation. There can be but little doubt that, under the
                    influence of the varying temperature of the seasons, and of the winds, the water
                    of a lake is thoroughly mixed once a year. In lakes which do not consist of a
                    single long trough like Loch Ness, but of several basins as Loch Lomond, the
                    bottom temperature is different in the different basins, even when the depth is
                    the same. Loch Lomond consists of three principal basins of very unequal depth
                    :—the large expanse of water studded with islands at the lower end, the Balloch
                    basin; the middle or Luss basin; and the upper and deepest or Tarbet basin. In
                    the last we have 600 feet of water, in the Luss basin 200 feet, and in the
                    Balloch basin a maximum of 72 feet of water. On 23d September 1876 the bottom
                    temperature in the Tarbet basin was 41°∙4, and in the Luss basin 46 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o-</hi> 4. Loch Tummel, a much smaller lake, consists of
                    three basins, each of them being from 100 to 120 feet deep, and in them we have
                    bottom temperatures of 46° ’ 3, 46° ’ 9, and 45 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi>
                    2, the lowest temperature being nearest the outlet</p>
                <p>It might have been expected that the bottom temperature in lakes similar as
                    regards size and depth would be lower at greater elevations and higher nearer
                    the sea-level. This does not, however, hold universally; thus Lochs Tummel and
                    Garry are very similar in size and depth; they are only 12 miles from each
                    other, but Loch Tummel is 450 feet and Loch Garry 1330 feet above the sea; yet
                    at 102 feet in Loch Garry the temperature on the 18th August 1876 was 53°∙9, and
                    in Loch Tummel at the same depth on the 16th August 1876 it was 45°∙4. The
                    difference of elevation is nearly 900 feet, and, instead of the higher lake
                    holding the colder water, its water is 8° ’ 5 warmer than that of the lower one.
                    Similarly in Loch Ericht, 1153 feet above the sea, the bottom temperature at 324
                    feet was 44°∙7, and in Loch Rannoch, 668 feet above sea, at the same depth it
                    was 44° Ό. These examples will suffice to show that many circumstances concur in
                    determining the temperatures of the waters of lakes. There is one factor which
                    is often neglected, namely, the amount of change of water. This depends on the
                    drainage area of its tributary streams, and necessarily varies greatly.</p>
                <p>In comparing the bottom temperature in lakes with the mean temperatures of the
                    coldest half of the year, we find that the two approach each other more nearly
                    the higher these temperatures are. When the temperature of the air falls for a
                    lengthened period below the temperature of maximum density of water (39° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 Fahr.), then the mechanical effect produced is much
                    the same as if the temperature had been raised. For, in virtue of the cooling
                    above, the water will have no tendency to sink; it will rather tend to float as
                    a cold layer on the surface of the warmer and denser water below. Were a lake
                    comparable with a glass of water, that is, were its depth equal to or greater
                    than its length or breadth, it would be possible to realize this ideal condition
                    of things, which, until recently, was supposed to represent what really takes
                    place when a lake is covered with ice, namely, that after the water has all been
                    cooled to a uniform temperature of 39° <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 Fahr,
                    further cooling affects only a small surface layer, which consequently rapidly
                    freezes. If this were the case, we should expect to find the temperature of the
                    water below the ice of a frozen lake increasing rapidly from 32° where it is in
                    contact with the ice to 39° ’ 2 at a short distance from it, and we should
                    expect to find the remainder of the water down to the bottom at the same
                    temperature. In fact, however, the depth of even the deepest lakes bears an
                    insignificant proportion to their superficial dimensions, and temperature
                    observations in summer show that the effective climate, that is, the climate in
                    so far as it is effective for the purpose under consideration, varies much over
                    the surface of even very small lakes. The variations in distribution of
                    temperature produce variations in density which of themselves are sufficient to
                    produce convection currents. Then, as a factor of climate, there are the winds,
                    which are the main mixing agents, and also the movement in the waters caused by
                    the inflow of water at different points and the removal of the excess at one
                    point. The effect of these mechanical agents, winds and currents, is to
                    propagate the air temperature at the surface to a greater depth than would
                    otherwise be the case. At the same time it must be remembered that in seasons of
                    great cold there is rarely much wind. If we reflect, however, on what must take
                    place when there is a large expanse of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n231/mode/1up"

                    with snow, and exposed to the rigours of a winter night, we see that the air in
                    contact with the surface of the water must get warmed and form an ascending
                    current, its place being taken by fresh air drafted from the cold land surface,
                    which not only cools the water but forces it out towards the middle, thus
                    establishing a circulation consisting in broad lines of a surface movement from
                    the sides to the middle of the lake, and a movement in the opposite direction
                    below the surface. Even if the current of air were not sufficient of itself to
                    produce a surface current in the water, it would do it indirectly. For, as it
                    first strikes the water at the edges, the water there would get cooled most
                    rapidly, and under suitable circumstances would form a fringe of ice; the water
                    so cooled would be lighter than the warmer water farther out, and would have a
                    tendency to flow off towards the middle, or with the current of air. Now,
                    although, when compared with other seasons, there is in a hard frosty winter not
                    much wind, still, even in the calmest weather there is almost always sufficient
                    motion in the atmosphere to enable the meteorologist to state that the wind is
                    from a particular quarter; this will assist the circulation which has just been
                    described as taking place in a calm lake, though it will somewhat distort its
                    effects. It will produce excessive cooling at the side nearest the wind, and,
                    when the lake freezes, it will have a tendency to begin at the windward
                    side.</p>
                <p>The extent to which this circulation affects the deeper waters of a lake depends
                    on local circumstances, and generally we may say that the more confined a lake
                    is the more easily will it freeze, and the higher will be the mean temperature
                    of its waters. In the very cold winter 1878-79 the writer was able to make
                    observations on the temperature of the water under the ice in Linlithgow Loch
                    and in Loch Lomond. In the following winter, which, though mild in Scotland, was
                    excessively severe in Switzerland, Dr Forel made observations in the Lakes of
                    Morat and Zürich, confirming the writer’s observations of the unexpectedly low
                    temperature of the water. The freezing of so deep a lake as that of Zürich was a
                    fortunate circumstance, because in it the bottom is actually at the temperature
                    of maximum density. The majority of the lakes which freeze are so shallow as to
                    admit of the whole of their water being cooled considerably below the
                    temperature of in iximum density.</p>
                <p>The distribution of temperature in frozen lakes will be apparent from the table
                    given below. Of the Lakes of Zurich and Morat and Loch Lomond the mean
                    temperatures are in the order of their depth. Linlithgow is altogether peculiar.
                    Its high temperature, which increased steadily all the time it was covered with
                    ice, was due to chemical action amongst the filth which has been allowed to
                    accumulate at its bottom. When the ice broke up the dead fish were taken away in
                    carts.</p>
                <p>Dr Forel gives the following particulars about the frozen Swiss lakes. “The Lake
                    of Morat has a surface of 27'4 square kilometres and a maximum depth of 45
                    metres (147 feet); it is 1425 feet above the sea; and its mean latitude is 49°
                    56' N. The ice overspread its whole surface suddenly in the night of the 17th to
                    the 18th December, and it remained frozen till the 8th March. The Lake of Zürich
                    has a superficies of 87’8 square kilometres, a maximum depth of 468 feet and
                    altitude of 1338 feet, and a mean latitude of 47° 16' N. Its congelation was
                    gradual, and not sudden like that of the Lake of Morat. First the upper part of
                    the lake was covered with ice between Männedorf and Wädensweil. At the end of
                    December, the 28th, the ice covered it entirely, but only for a single day. On
                    the 29th it thawed, and the lake remained partially free of ice until the middle
                    of January. It froze over completely on the 22d January, and on the 25th the ice
                    was 4 inches thick in the centre of the lake.” Of the larger Swiss lakes, Morat,
                    Zürich, Zug, Neuchâtel, Constance, and Annecy were frozen in 1880; Thun is known
                    to have been frozen four times, namely, in 1363, 1435, 1685, and 1695; Brienz
                    has only once been frozen, in 1363; Lucerne freezes partially in very severe
                    winters, and Geneva in its western and shallower part, whilst Wallenstadt and
                    Bourget are not known to have ever been frozen.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Changes of Level.—</hi> As the water supply of lakes depends on
                    the rainfall, and as this varies much with the season, and from year to year, we
                    should expect, and indeed we find, fluctuation of level in all lakes. There are,
                    however, other changes of level which are independent of the water supply, and
                    which resemble tides in their rhythmic periods. They have long been known and
                    observed in Switzerland, and especially on the Lake of Geneva, where they are
                    known by the name of “seiches.” The level of the lake is observed to rise slowly
                    during twenty or thirty minutes to a height which varies from a few centimetres
                    to as many decimetres; it then falls again slowly to a corresponding depth, and
                    rises again slowly, and so on. These movements were observed and much studied at
                    the end of last century by Jallabert, Bertrand, and Saussure, and at the
                    beginning of this century they formed the subject of an instructive memoir by
                    Vaucher, who enunciated the following law connecting the seiches with the
                    movements of the barometer. “The amplitude of seiches is small when the
                    atmosphere is at rest; the seiches are greater the more variable is the
                    atmosphere’s pressure; they are the greatest when the barometer is falling.”
                    Vaucher recognized the existence of seiches in the Lakes of Geneva, Neuchâtel,
                    Zürich, Constance, Annecy, and Lugano, and Dr Forel of Morges, from whose
                    papers, published principally in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">Revue Suisse</hi> during the last five years, the facts
                    regarding the seiches have been taken, has observed them in every lake where he
                    had looked for them. It is in every way likely that they are to be found in all
                    lakes of notable extent and depth. They have been studied principally on the
                    Lake of Geneva, where Dr Forel, at Morges, about the middle of the lake on the
                    north shore, and M. Plantamour, at Sécheron, about a mile from Geneva on the
                    north shore, have had self-registering tide gauges in operation for a number of
                    years. In the writings of the Swiss observers the seiche is the complete
                    movement of rise above and fall below the mean level, the amplitude is the
                    extreme difference of level so produced, and the duration of the seiche is the
                    time in seconds measured from the moment when the water is at the mean level
                    until it is again at the mean level, after having risen to the crest and sunk to
                    the trough of the wave. The amplitude of the seiches is very variable. At the
                    same station and on the same day successive seiches are similar. When the
                    seiches are small they are all small, when they are large they are all large. At
                    the same station and on different days the amplitudes of the seiches may vary
                    enormously. For instance, at Geneva, where the highest seiches have been
                    observed, they are usually of such a size as to be imperceptible without special
                    instruments; yet on the 3d August 1763 Saussure measured seiches of 1 ’ 48
                    metres, and on the 2d and 3d October 1841 the seiches observed by Vénié were as
                    much as 2 ’ 15 metres.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n232/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0232-0221"/>
                <p>They are greater at the extremities than at the middle of lakes, at the head of
                    long gulfs whose sides converge gently than at stations in the middle of a long
                    straight coast, and in shallow as compared with deep lakes or parts of a lake.
                    They also appear to increase with the size of the lake. The duration of the
                    seiches is found to vary considerably, but the mean deduced from a sufficient
                    number of observations is fairly constant at the same locality. Thus, for
                    Morges, Dr Forel ha# found it to be for the half seiche 315 ±9 seconds. At
                    different stations, however, on the same lake and on different lakes it varies
                    considerably. Thus on the Lake of Geneva it is, for the complete seiche, 630
                    seconds at Morges, and 1783 seconds at Veytaux; on Lake Neuchâtel it is 2840
                    seconds at Yverdon, and 264 at Saint Aubin.</p>
                <p>The curves traced by the gauge at Geneva have been subjected to a preliminary
                    harmonic analysis by Professor Soret, and he has decomposed them into two
                    undulations, the one with a period, from crest to crest, of seventy-two minutes,
                    and the other with a period of thirty-five minutes, or a little less than half
                    the larger period. As the amplitudes of the composing curves vary much, there is
                    great variety in the resultant curves. Besides these two principal components,
                    there are others which have not yet been investigated.</p>
                <p>With regard to the cause of the phenomenon, Dr Forel attributes the ordinary
                    seiches to local variations of atmospheric pressure, giving an impulse the
                    effect of which would be apparent for a long time as a series of oscillations.
                    The greater seiches, such as those of 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5 metres,
                    he attributed to earthquake shocks; but, as a very sensible earthquake passed
                    over Switzerland quite recently without leaving the slightest trace on the
                    gauge, he has abandoned this explanation, and is inclined to attribute them to
                    pulsation set agoing by violent downward gusts of wind, especially at the upper
                    end of the lake. M. Plantamour, who has devoted much attention to the same
                    subject, assured the writer, in the summer of 1881, that he was completely at a
                    loss for a satisfactory explanation of them.</p>
                <p>Seiches have not been observed on the Scottish lakes, though there is little
                    doubt that they would be found if sought for. There are, however, records of
                    disturbances of some of the lakes, especially in Perthshire, of which the
                    following may be cited as an instance.</p>
                <p>A violent disturbance of the level of Loch Tay is reported in the Statistical
                    Account of Scotland (1796), xvii. p. 458, to have occurred at Kenmore on 12th
                    September 1784, continuing in a modified degree for four days, and again on 13th
                    July 1794. Kenmore lies at the north-eastern end of the lake, where the river
                    Tay issues from it. It lies at the end of a shallow bay. “At the extremity of
                    this bay the water was observed to retire about 5 yards within its ordinary
                    boundary, and in four or five minutes to flow out again. In this manner it ebbed
                    and flowed successively three or four times during the space of a quarter of an
                    hour, when all at once the water rushed from the east and west in opposite
                    currents, .... rose in the form of a great wave, to the height of 5 feet above
                    the ordinary level, leaving the bottom of the bay dry to the distance of between
                    90 and 100 yards from its natural boundary. When the opposite currents met they
                    made a clashing noise and foamed; and, the stronger impulse being from the east,
                    the wave after rising to its greatest height, rolled westward, but slowly
                    diminishing as it went, for the space of five minutes, when it wholly
                    disappeared. As the wave subsided it flowed back with some force, and exceeded
                    its original boundary 4 or 5 yards; then it ebbed again about 10 yards, and
                    again returned, and continued to ebb and flow in this manner for the space of
                    two hours, the ebbings succeeding each other, at the distance of about seven
                    minutes, and gradually lessening, till the water settled into its ordinary
                    level. During the whole time that this phenomenon was observed the weather was
                    calm. On the next and four succeeding days an ebbing and flowing was observed
                    nearly about the same time and for the same length of time, but not at all in
                    the same degree as on the first day.”</p>
                <p>The above is the account given by the Rev. Thomas Fleming, at the time minister
                    of Kenmore, who was an eye witness. It resembles in all essential particulars
                    the descriptions of waves which accompany actual earthquakes, yet in his account
                    he goes on to say—“I have not heard (although I have made particular inquiry)
                    that any motion of the earth was felt in this neighbourhood, or that the
                    agitation of the wave was observed anywhere but about the village of Kenmore.”
                    It is well known that there were great seismic movements observed in Perthshire
                    at the time of the Lisbon earthquake, and there is a tradition in the
                    neighbourhood that Loch Lubnaig near Callander was largely increased in extent
                    by the dislocations which took place.</p>
                <p>In all lakes there are changes of level corresponding with periods of rain and of
                    drought. They are the more considerable the greater the extent of country
                    draining into them, and the more constrained the outflow. In the great American
                    lakes, which occupy nearly one-third of their drainage area, the fluctuations of
                    level are quite insignificant; in Lake Michigan the U.S. surveyors give as the
                    maximum and minimum yearly range 1 ’ G4 and 0 ’ 65 feet. In the Lake of Geneva
                    the mean annual oscillation is 5 feet, and the difference between the highest
                    and the lowest waters of this century is 9 ’ 3 feet. The most rapid rise has
                    been 3 ’ 23 inches (82 mm.) in twenty-four hours. A very remarkable exception to
                    the rule that large freshwater lakes are subject to small variations of level is
                    furnished by Lake Tanganyika in Central Africa. Since its discovery travellers
                    have been much perplexed by the evidence and reports of considerable
                    oscillations of level of uncertain period, and also by the apparent absence of
                    visible outlet, while the freshness of its waters was of itself convincing
                    evidence of the existence of an outlet. By the careful observations of
                    successive explorers the nature of this phenomenon has been fully explained, and
                    is very instructive. It has recently been visited by Captain Hore of the London
                    Missionary Society, and it appears from his reports that the peculiar phenomena
                    observed depend on the fact that the area of country draining into the lake is
                    very limited, so that in the dry seasons the streams running into it dry up
                    altogether, and its outlet gets choked by the rapid growth of vegetation in an
                    equatorial climate. A dam or dyke is thus formed which is not broken down until
                    the waters of the lake have risen to a considerable height. A catastrophe of
                    this kind happened whilst Captain Hore was in the neighbourhood, and he noted
                    the height of the water at different times near his station at Ujiji, and
                    observed it fall 2 feet in two months It continued to fall until in seventeen
                    months it had fallen over 10 feet. Taking the length of the lake at 330 miles,
                    and the mean breadth at 30 miles, its surface is 9900 square nautical miles. If
                    this surface be reduced 2 feet in sixty days, the water will have to escape at
                    the rate of 137,500 cubic feet per second. The mean rate of discharge of the
                    Danube is 207,000 cubic feet per second. Hence, without taking into account
                    water which would be brought into the lake by tributaries during the two months,
                    we require for outlet a river at least two-thirds of the size of the Danube, and
                    in the Lukuga such a river is found. When Stanley visited it the Lukuga was
                    quite stopped up with dense growth, and no water was issuing; the lake was then
                    rising; when Captain Hore visited it the lake was falling rapidly, and the
                    Lukuga was a rapid river of great volume. One of the chief affluents to the lake
                    was found to be discharging at the rate of 18,750 cubic feet of water per
                    second; a few months later it was dry and the mouth closed with vegetation.
                    During the dry season too the lake, with its 10,000 square miles of surface, is
                    exposed to the evaporating action of the south-east trade wind, and when the
                    supply is so insignificant this must be sufficient of itself to sensibly lower
                    the level. Ordinarily then we might expect the lake to be subject to a yearly
                    ebb and flow corresponding to the periods of drought and rains; and, from what
                    we learn of the great fluctuations of rainfall one year with another, we should
                    expect that during a series of dry years the obstructions to the outflow would
                    gain such a head <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n233/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0233-0222"/> that the rains of several wet seasons would have
                    to accumulate before forcing a passage. The result would be a tide of a period
                    corresponding to the recurrence of series of wet or dry years. Were the lake
                    situated at or near the level of the ocean, its equatorial position would give
                    it such a preponderance of rain over the whole year as to keep its outlet
                    constantly open; but its actual position, 2700 feet above the sea, produces an
                    alteration in climate, equivalent to an increase of latitude, which would place
                    it in the trade wind region rather than in that of equatorial calms and rains.
                    That such is actually the effect is shown by the range of temperature, which is
                    moderate (59° to 83° Fahr.),and the rainfall(27 to 30 inches), which is almost
                    exactly that of London. The Central African lakes, from their immense size and
                    from their equatorial position, possess a peculiar interest for the physical
                    geographer, and it is to be hoped that before long we shall have sufficient
                    soundings to give a general idea of the size of their basins, and also
                    temperature observations to show the effect of a vertical sun on large bodies of
                    water at a moderate elevation, and removed from the disturbing influence of
                    oceanic circulation.</p>
                <p>As might be expected, in salt lakes which have no overflow, the yearly rise and
                    fall is often considerable. In the Great Salt Lake in Utah, the greatest depth
                    of which is 56 feet, changes of level are accompanied by great changes in water
                    surface, and also in saltness of water. In the rainy season the Dead Sea stands
                    10 or 12 feet higher than in the dry season. The following table shows the
                    chemical composition of the waters of various salt lakes, that of the sea-water
                    in the Suez Canal being added for comparison :—</p>

                </table>
                <p>This table embraces examples of several types of salt lake. In the Kokonor, Aral,
                    and open Caspian seas we have examples of the moderately salt, non-saturated
                    waters. In the Karabugas, a branch gulf of the Caspian, the Urumieh, and the
                    Dead Sea we have examples of saturated waters containing principally chlorides.
                    The Van Sea is an example of the alkaline seas which also occur in Egypt,
                    Hungary, and other countries. Their peculiarity consists in the quantity of
                    carbonate of soda dissolved in their waters, which is collected by the
                    inhabitants for domestic and for commercial purposes. The chemical reader will
                    be struck by the quantity of magnesia salt dissolved in water which contains so
                    much carbonate of soda. The analysis in the table is by Abich, quoted by Schmidt
                    in Ids interesting “Etudes Hydrologiques,” published in the Bulletin de
                    VAcadémie de St Petersbourg. Another analysis by De Chancourt, quoted by
                    Bischof, omits all mention of sulphate of magnesia, but inserts the
                    carbonate.</p>
                <p>The limits of this article do not admit of the discussion of the many interesting
                    phenomena connected with salt lakes. With regard, however, to a former connexion
                    of the Caspian with the Black Sea, which has been so often suggested, it seems
                    improbable, both on chemical and on physical grounds, that they were ever
                    connected as seas, that is, in the same way as the Black Sea is connected with
                    the Mediterranean; but, if we consider the topography of the Caucasus district,
                    we see that the lowest summit level of the land between the two seas is in the
                    Manytsch valley, 86 feet above the Black Sea. Were the climate of the Caspian to
                    change only very slightly for the moister, its waters might easily rise the 196
                    feet which would enable it to overflow towards the Mediterranean, while a
                    relapse towards dryness would be followed by the retreat of the waters, which
                    would be then confined as they are now to the basin of the sea. It is important,
                    therefore, to bear in mind that no terrestrial dislocations are required to
                    produce enormous changes in the level of salt lakes; we require only changes of
                    climate, and these very slight. There can be little doubt that, if the climate
                    of the Black Sea extended across the isthmus to the Caspian, the latter would
                    now stand 200 feet higher, would be fresh, and would overflow into the Sea of
                    Azoff.</p>
