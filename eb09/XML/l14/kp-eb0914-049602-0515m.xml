                    for many centuries the chief city of Tibet. Though the place is of great
                    celebrity, the accounts of it are scanty, and information has to be sifted from
                    authorities differing considerably in age. Till recently the latitude even of
                    Lhasa has been stated with variations extending over 1j degrees, whilst the
                    longitude has naturally been still more uncertain. The Jesuit Grueber, who was
                    at Lhasa in 1661-62, made the latitude 29° 6'. In the maps of Tibet sent from
                    China by the Jesuits, and engraved on five separate sheets in Du Halde, it is
                    about 29° 40'. D’Anville, in his <hi rend="italic">Carte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Generale</hi><hi rend="italic">du Thibet,</hi> chiefly based on these last, but
                    modified to suit other data, reverted nearly to Grueber’s figure; Giorgi in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Alphabetum</hi><hi rend="italic">Tibetanum</hi> states it at
                    about 30° 30'. Klaproth, stretching every datum to cracking point, to suit his
                    fantasies about the course of the great river of Tibet, made it 30° 45' lat.

                    a mean of twenty observations) 29° 39' 17", a result which closely confirms the
                    Jesuit record. The longitude according to the protraction of the same explorer’s
                    route is 90 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 57' 13".<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is corrected to the latest value of
                    Madras longitude, viz . 80° 14'51".</p></note> The height above the sea, by
                    repeated observation of the boiling point, is stated at 11,700 feet (but the
                    report of Nain Singh, on his second visit, gives 11,910). The city stands near
                    the middle of a tolerably level plain, which is surrounded on all sides by
                    hills, and extends about 13 miles from east to west and about 7 miles from north
                    to south. It lies half a mile to the north of a considerable river called the
                    Kichu Tsanpu, or Tsang-chu, flowing here from east-north-east (called by the
                    Mongols, according to Klaproth, <hi rend="italic">Galjao-Mιιren,</hi> or
                    “Turbulent River”), and joining the great Tsanpu (or upper course of the
                    Brahmaputra) some 35 miles to the south-west.</p>
                <p>The hills round the city are absolutely barren, and without growth of any kind
                    except an occasional bush of so-called “Tartar furze.” There are, however,
                    gardens scattered over the plain round the city, and these are planted with
                    trees of some size (it would seem cedar, willow, and cypress). Four defiles in
                    the encompassing hills, by which the approaches to the city pass, are defended
                    by as many forts. We may quote the description of Hue, which, though a little
                    vague, is vivid, and is the only passage affording anything like a picture of
                    this city, so difficult of access :—</p>
                <p>“The sun was about to set as we completed our descent of the innumerable zigzags
                    of the mountain path. Issuing into a wide valley, we beheld on our right Lhasa,
                    the famous metropolis of the Buddhist world. The multitude of aged trees which
                    encircle the city as with a girdle of foliage, the lofty white houses,
                    terminating in flat roofs surrounded by turrets, the numerous temples with their
                    gilt canopies, the Buddhala <hi rend="italic">[Pοlαlα],</hi> crowned by the
                    palace of the Dalai Lama,—all unite to give Lhasa a majestic and imposing
                    appearance.”</p>
                <p>The meaning of the name <hi rend="italic">Lha-Sa</hi> is “God’s ground.” Formerly
                    it used to be known to the Mongols as <hi rend="italic">Baron-tala,</hi> the
                    “right side” or western region; now, according to Hue they call it <hi
                    rend="italic">Honhe Dhot</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dehot,</hi> “Eternal
                    Sanctuary.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first
                    word of this phrase is certainly the Mongol <hi rend="italic">muηgke,</hi>
                    “eternal.” The second is probably a clerical error for <hi rend="italic"
                    >dchοt,</hi> which may represent the <hi rend="italic">Jο</hi> of the next
                    sentence, which is literally (Tib. ) “master, lord,” and is applied to very
                    sacred images.</p></note> In eastern Turkestan it seems to be best known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Jo,</hi> a name which properly refers to the great central temple
                    of which we shall speak.</p>
                <p>The city is nearly circular in form, and according to Nain Singh less than a mile
                    in diameter. It was walled in the latter part of the 17th century, but the walls
                    were destroyed during the Chinese occupation in 1722. The population has been
                    estimated at 40,000 to 80,000; the last estimate perhaps including the great
                    population of monks and students in the convents near the city.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nain Singh says that a census
                    in 1854 gave “9000 women and 6000 men, exclusive of the military and the
                    priests.” But these words are subject to too many doubts for precise
                    interpretation.</p></note></p>
                <p>The chief streets of the city are wide and straight, and in dry weather tolerably
                    clean, but the inferior quarters are unspeakably filthy, and are rife with evil
                    smells and large mangy dogs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The Chinese have a proverb as to the three products of Lhasa
                    being dogs, drabs, and lamas.</p></note> Γart (much the greater part, according
                    to Nain Singh) of the houses are of clay and sun-dried brick, but those of the
                    richer people of stone and brick. All, however, are frequently white-washed, the
                    doors and windows being framed in bands of red and yellow. In the suburbs there
                    are houses entirely built of the horns of sheep and oxen set in clay mortar.
                    This construction, according to Hue, is very solid and highly picturesque.</p>
                <p>The houses generally are large, and of three stories at least. The owner of the
                    house, with his family, occupies the upper story, whilst the two lower floors
                    swarm with tenants. Externally the lower part of Tibetan houses generally
                    presents lofty dead walls pierced by a few airholes only; above these rise tiers
                    of windows with projecting balconies, and over all flat broad-eaved roofs at
                    varying levels. According to Desideri, in the better houses there are often
                    spacious and well-finished apartments, the principal halls, the verandas, and
                    terraces being often paved with a composition of coloured fragments of stone set
                    in a cement of resin, &amp;c., which with much beating and rubbing becomes like
                    a surface of polished porphyry. In every house there is a kind of chapel or
                    shrine, carved and gilt, on which are set images and sacred books, and before
                    them lamps and incense, with the usual offerings of barley, fruits, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>Lhasa is not only the nucleus of a cluster of vast monastic establishments, which
                    attract students and aspirants to the (so-called) religious life from all parts
                    of Tibet and Mongolia, and the seat of a quasi papacy, but is also a great place
                    of pilgrimage, so that the streets and public spaces swarm with visitors from
                    every part of the Himalayan plateau, and from all the steppes of Asia between
                    Manchuria and the Balkash Lake, who come to adore the living Buddha, to seek the
                    purgation of their sins and the promise of a happy transmigration, and to carry
                    away with them holy relics, blessed rosaries, and all the miscellaneous trumpery
                    which is set forth to catch the money of idle people in Asia and Europe, whether
                    they are pilgrims or frequenters of mineral waters,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among articles sold in the Lhasa bazaars are
                    numerous fossil bones, called by the people “lightning bones,” and believed to
                    have healing virtues.</p></note> whilst as usual a great traffic arises quite
                    apart from the pilgrimage. The city thus swarms with crowds attracted by
                    devotion and the love of gain, and presents an astonishing diversity of
                    language, costume, and physiognomy; though, in regard to the last point,
                    varieties of the broad face and narrow eye greatly predominate. Much of the
                    retail trade of the place is in the hands of the women. Hue’s account of the
                    curious practice of the Lhasa women in plastering their faces with a
                    dark-coloured unguent is well known, but it does not rest on his authority
                    alone.</p>
                <p>During the month of December especially traders arrive from western China by way
                    of Tatsienlu (Tachindo of the Tibetans), bringing every variety of silk-stuffs,
                    carpets, china-ware, and tea; from Siningfu (commonly in Tibet and Turkestan
                    called <hi rend="italic">Siting,</hi> Ziling, or Zling, a circumstance that has
                    caused sundry misapprehensions) come silk, gold lace, Russian goods, carpets of
                    a superior kind, semiprecious stones, horse furniture, horses, and a very large
                    breed of fat-tailed sheep; from eastern Tibet musk in large quantities, which
                    eventually finds its way to Europe through Nepal; from Bhutan and Sikkim, rice;
                    from the latter also tobacco; besides a variety of Indian and European goods
                    from Nepal and Darjiling, and <hi rend="italic">charas</hi> (resinous exudation
                    of hemp) and saffron from Ladak and Kashmir. The merchants, who arrive in
                    December, leave Lhasa in March, before the setting in of the rains renders the
                    rivers impassable.</p>
                <p>The tea importation from China is a large matter, on which an interesting paper
                    has been written by Mr E. Baber. The tea is of the coarsest quality, derived
                    from straggling and uncared-for trees, allowed to grow to a height of 10 feet or
                    more, and the coarsest produce of these. This is pressed into bricks or cakes,
                    and carried by porters. The quantity that pays duty at Tatsienlu is about
                    10,000,000 ft&gt;, besides some amount smuggled. No doubt a large part of this
                    comes to Lhasa. Tea is an <pb break="no"

                    miserable without it.</p>
                <p>The chief industries of Lhasa are the weaving of a great variety of stuffs from
                    the fine Tibetan wool; the making of earthenware (said to be of very good
                    quality), and of the wooden porringers (varying immensely in elaboration and
                    price) of which every Tibetan carries one about with him; also the making of
                    certain fragrant sticks of pastille much valued in China and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>It is curious that Tibet, though using coined money, seems never, strictly
                    speaking, to have had a coinage of its own. Till nearly the end of last century
                    the coinage had for a long time been derived from Nepal. That valley prior to
                    the Gorkha domination (1768) was under three native dynasties (at Bhatgaon,
                    Patan, and Khatmandu), and these struck silver mohurs, as they were called, of
                    the nominal value of half a rupee. The coins were at first not struck specially
                    for Tibetan use, but were so afterwards. These latter bore (obverse) a Nepalese
                    emblem surrounded by eight fleurons containing the eight sacred Buddhist jewels,
                    and (reverse) an eight-petalled flower surrounded by eight fleurons containing
                    the names of the eight jewels in Tibetan characters. Ingots of Chinese silver
                    were sent from Lhasa with a small proportion of gold dust, and an equal weight
                    in mohurs was returned, leaving to the Nepal rajahs, between gold-dust and
                    alloy, a good profit. The quality of these coins (weighing about 81 grains Troy)
                    was low, and at last deteriorated so much that the Tibetans deserted the Nepal
                    mints. The Gorkhas, after becoming masters of Nepal, were anxious to renew the
                    profitable traffic in coin, and in this view sent a deputation to Lhasa, with a
                    quantity of coin to be put in circulation. But the Gorkhas were mistrusted, and
                    their coin refused. A coinage was then issued (it would appear once only) in
                    Tibet for domestic use, modelled on an old Khatmandu pattern, and struck by
                    Nepalese artists (see fig. 1). The Gorkhas, however, in 1788 and following years
                    continued to strike coins of progressively debased quality, which were rude
                    imitations of the old Nepalese mintage (see fig. 2), and to endeavour to force
                    this currency on the Tibetans, eventually making the departure of the latter
                    from old usage a pretext for war and invasion. This brought the intervention of
                    the</p>
                <p>Chinese, who drove the Gorkhas out of Tibet (1792), and then began to strike
                    silver coins for Lhasa use, bearing Chinese and Tibetan characters (see fig. 3).
                    For practical use these Tibeto-Chinese coins (of which 2j = 1 rupee, and which
                    are known as <hi rend="italic">naktang, i.e., nagskyaηg,</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> li</hi> cash ”), are cut into aliquot parts by the guidance
                    of the figures on them. Large lumps of Chinese silver, stamped with the imperial
                    seal, are also used. But of late years there has been an enormous influx of
                    Anglo-Indian rupees, so that these have become practically the currency of the
                    country, even to the frontier of China, and are now counted, instead of being
                    valued as bullion. They are called <hi rend="italic">Peilung</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ch'raηlca,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chanka</hi> (probably Hind,
                    <hi rend="italic">tanka),</hi> “English (Firinghi?) coins.” Those that bear a
                    crowned head of the queen are called <hi rend="italic">Lama</hi> heads, the
                    crown being taken for a wandering lama’s head-gear. This great influx of rupees
                    indicates a very considerable amount of trade with India. And, in spite of the
                    extraordinary difficulties of the road eastward from Lhasa, quantities of
                    trifling European articles find their way even to Tatsienlu on the Chinese
                    frontier. Mr Baber found quarter-rupees very popular as buttons, British army
                    buttons very common, corkscrews offered for sale (though no one knew their use),
                    and tin-plates very common, stamped with the heads of Napoleon HL, Mr Gladstone,
                    and other celebrities.</p>
                <p>The permanent population embraces, besides Tibetans of the country, settled
                    families of Chinese and Kashmiris in considerable numbers, as well as people
                    from Bhotan and Nepal, from Ladak and even from Patna. The Kashmiris and many of
                    the other foreigners are Mohammedans, and much of the trade is in their hands.
                    Desideri, a century and a half ago, speaks also of Armenians and even
                    “Muscovites.” The Chinese have a crowded burial-ground at Lhasa, tended
                    carefully after their manner. The Kashmiris, who are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >KhacKhe,</hi> are an important body, and have their mosque, and a provost, at
                    once civil and religious, who is recognized by the Government. With their
                    turbans, their fine Caucasian features, and their beards, they strikingly
                    contrast with the mass of other nationalities. The Nepalese (called at Lhasa,
                    according to Hue, <hi rend="italic">Pe-buη')</hi> supply all the mechanics and
                    metal-workers. There are among them excellent gold and silversmiths; and they
                    make the elaborate gilded canopies crowning the temples, which form so notable a
                    feature of Lhasa. Hue describes a striking custom among the native population.
                    Every evening, as light begins to fail, they leave off business, and form groups
                    in the streets; all sit down and begin to chant prayer in a low voice. “The
                    combination of religious music arising from these numerous companies produces an
                    aggregate of vast and solemn harmony, which is exceedingly moving.”</p>
                <p>In the middle of the city is an open space or <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> in
                    which markets are held; this is densely thronged in the afternoon and evening.
                    On the north side, overlooking this <hi rend="italic">place,</hi> is a great
                    building which is the residence of the <hi rend="italic">Gyalbo,</hi> or
                    so-called king of Tibet. It was built at great cost by the dissolute Lama who
                    was set up by the crafty regent Sangje Gyampo, and put to death by the Calmuck
                    prince Latsan or Jenghiz Khan in 1706-7 (see <hi rend="italic">infra);</hi> and,
                    as the Lama used to divert himself there with the dances of the ladies of Lhasa,

                <p>Immediately west of the <hi rend="italic">place</hi> stands the great temple and
                    convent of Labrang <hi rend="italic">(fLa-braηg,</hi> “Lama-house ”), regarded
                    as the <hi rend="italic">umιbilicus</hi> and centre of all Tibet, and from which
                    all the main roads are considered to radiate. This is not merely the great
                    metropolitan convent, sanctuary, and church-centre of Tibet, the St Peter’s or
                    Lateran of Lamaism, but contains the palace of the government and seat of civil
                    administration. It is believed to have been founded by the Tibetan Constantine,
                    Srong-dsan-gampo, in the 7th century, as the shrine of one of those two very
                    sacred Buddha images which were associated with his conversion, and with the
                    foundation of the civilized monarchy in Tibet. From this image, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Jo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">JÛ,</hi> it is known to the Mongols
                    as the <hi rend="italic">Jo Er deni (“</hi> the precious Lord ”) or <hi

                    394).</p></note> The Potala as a sacred centre is modern, whilst the Labrang
                    attaches itself to the whole thread of Tibetan history and religion. On one of
                    the walls of this temple is a picture of the famous “Master of the Law,” Hwen
                    T’sang, the travelling doctor of Buddhism (see vol. xii. p. 418), whose journeys
                    have in the revolution of the ages become so familiar to European students, as a
                    mine of information on the geography and history of India during a period so
                    clouded as the 7th century. He is represented with three of his disciples. And
                    before the gate of the Labrang stand several monuments of antiquity, especially
                    that famous obelisk spoken of below, which bears the inscribed record of the
                    treaty of peace concluded in 822 between Thi-de-srong-tsan, king of Tibet, and
                    the emperor Mo-tsung of China. Before this obelisk the apostate from Lamaism,
                    Langdharma, brother and successor of the last-named king, was standing in proud
                    contemplation, when a fanatic recluse, who had been stirred by a vision to
                    avenge his persecuted faith, shot him with an arrow in the forehead.</p>
                <p>The main building of the Labrang is three stories high. The entrance, facing
                    eastward, forms a portico supported on six great timber columns, richly carved
                    and gilt, whilst the walls are painted with the history of Sakya. Great
                    folding-doors, covered with reliefs in bronze and iron, lead to the ante-hall,
                    and from this a second gate to the <hi rend="italic">cellα</hi> (so to call it)
                    of the temple. On each side of the gate, two and two, stand colossi of the
                    spirit-kings of the four points of heaven. Within is a great basilica, divided
                    into naves and aisles by many pillars, whilst along each wall, north and south,
                    are chapels or sanctuaries, fourteen to a side.</p>
                <p>At the west end steps ascend to a quadrangular choir or chancel, on each side of
                    which also are three chapels, and at the extremity a rectangular apse (if it may
                    be called so), and in it is the altar or graded throne, on which stands the
                    great image of Sakya, seen through a lattice of silver gilt,—the higher shelves
                    or offsets of the altar being beset with small figures in precious metals of <hi
                    rend="italic">dcοtas</hi> and saints, and the lower ones with lamps burning
                    josticks, platters holding offerings of butter and meal, flowers modelled from
                    butter, &amp;c. In the choir to the right (f.e., looking from the altar) is the
                    elevated and stepped throne of the Grand Lama, laid with splendid cushions,
                    succeeded by the nearly equal throne of the Teshu Lama of Shigatze, and then by
                    the seats of other ecclesiastical potentates, reborn and elected, in order; on
                    the left of the Buddha throne, opposite the Grand Lama’s, and of equal height,
                    there is said now to be a throne for the emperor of China, then, at a lower
                    level, that of the so-called king of Tibet, whilst the ministers of state follow
                    opposite the inferior lamas.</p>
                <p>In a space shut in with silver lattice, on the south side of the chancel-steps,
                    are seen fourteen or fifteen great disks of silver, set with precious stones, on
                    which are embossed fundamental Buddhist symbols, such as their system of
                    cosmogony, the circle of transmigration, the births of Sakya, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The great nave or central aisle of the basilica is truly hypaethral, but on the
                    second and third apparent floors it is encompassed with colonnades or verandas,
                    from which the women and the laity look down upon the lamas engaged in chanting
                    the services or in other functions. The sanctuary or chancel itself towers above
                    the rest of the building, and is crowned with a rectangular canopy or pavilion
                    of gilt metal, which rises to a ridge serrated with fantastic figures. This
                    canopy rests on columns which are also gilt, and from its eaves and angles hang
                    bells that tinkle with every breeze, whilst the pillars beneath the eaves are
                    crowned with a great frieze of basreliefs embossed in gilt metal.</p>
                <p>This ancient temple contains a vast accumulation from the ages of gold and silver
                    vessels, lamps, reliquaries, and precious bric-abrac of every kind, which is
                    annually exposed to view in the spring festivities. The daily offices in the
                    Labrang are attended by crowds of worshippers, and a sacred way which leads
                    round it is constantly traversed by devotees who perform the circuit as a work
                    of merit, always in a particular direction.</p>
                <p>Besides the convent-cells, halls of study, and magazines of precious lumber,
                    buildings grouped about the Labrang are occupied, as we have said, by the civil
                    administration, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as treasuries, customs office,
                    courts of justice, &amp;c.; and there are also private apartments for the Grand
                    Lama and other high functionaries. No woman is permitted to pass the night
                    within the precinct.</p>
                <p>Another great and famous temple is the <hi rend="italic">Bamo-chhé</hi> (“large
                    pen or fold ”), at the north end of the city. This is also regarded as a
                    foundation of Srong-dsan-gampo, and is said to contain the body of his Chinese
                    wife, and the second of the primeval palladia, the image that she brought with
                    her to the Snow-land; whence the Mongols and Chinese call it the temple of the
                    little <hi rend="italic">JÛ.</hi> The lamas of this convent, as well as of that
                    next to be mentioned, are noted for their pretensions to and practice of magical
                    arts, one of the degrading characteristics of the lama forms of Buddhism. The
                    orthodox “yellow” sect indeed profess to distinguish between lawful and unlawful
                    magical formulae, and to give degrees only in the former. The lamas of Ramo-chhé
                    have also the ill repute of cultivating that species of doctrine which is
                    connected, like their magic, with Tantric mysticism, and which professes to
                    destroy sensual passion by the contemplation of its representations. The walls
                    of the convent are defiled with a series of sculptures of gross obscenity.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It was in this convent that
                    P. Desideri studied the religion of the lamas. “From March to July,” he says, “I
                    set myself, I will not say to read, but rather to <hi rend="italic">devour</hi>
                    the chief books of the <hi rend="italic">Kaa·n-ghiur,</hi> and to take in a
                    complete knowledge of all that pertains to that false religion.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Another convent within the city is that of <hi rend="italic">Moru,</hi> also near
                    the north end, remarkable for its external order and cleanliness, and, though
                    famous like the last as a school of orthodox magic, noted also for the
                    printing-house in the convent garden. Lastly we notice the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Garmakhia,</hi> the inmates of which are sorcerers of the ruder kind, who seem
                    really to represent the rude medicine-men of the superstitions which preceded
                    Buddhism in Tibet. As the vulgar will not dispense with their marvels
                    (knife-swallowing, firebreathing, cutting off their own heads, and the like),
                    every great orthodox monastery in Tibet keeps one of these conjurors, who does
                    not belong to the fraternity of the house, but lives in a particular part of it,
                    bearing the name of <hi rend="italic">Choi-chong (Ch</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">hos-skyoηf)</hi> or “protector of
                    religion,” and is allowed to marry. These practitioners of the black art possess
                    no literature, but hand down their mysteries from father to son. Their fantastic
                    equipment, their frantic bearing, and their cries and howls seem to identify
                    them with the grossest Shamanist devil-dancers,—strongly remote in externals
                    from the gentle and cultivated persons in the higher ranks of the Lama Church,
                    of whom we read in Turner or Huc. Other monasteries in or near the city are the
                    <hi rend="italic">Chumuling</hi> at the north-west corner; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tankyaling</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n519/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0519-0500"/> at the west of the city; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kontyaling,</hi> about a mile west of the city, at the foot of a low isolated
                    hill called Chapochi. Three miles south, beyond the river, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Chochuling.</hi> These four convents are known as “The Four
                    Ling.”</p>
                <p>Leaving the city by the side of the Ramoch’hé, we see on our left the famous
                    Potala with its many edifices crowning and seeming to grow out of a rocky hill,
                    which rises like an island from the plain. It forms altogether a majestic
                    mountain of building. At the south base of the rock is a large space inclosed by
                    walls and gates, with great porticoes on the inner side. This swarms with lamas,
                    its nooks with beggars basking in the sun. A series of tolerably easy
                    staircases, broken by intervals of gentle ascent, leads to the summit of the
                    rock. The whole width of this is occupied by the palace. The central part of
                    this group of buildings rises in a vast quadrangular mass, in four stories, to a
                    great height, terminating in a gilt canopy similar, it would seem, to that on
                    the Labrang. Here on the lofty terrace is the Grand Lama’s hall of audience, and
                    from this great height he looks down upon the crowds of his votaries far below,
                    thronging the plain, and streaming to kneel before the sacred hill. The monastic
                    buildings attached to the palace temple are said to contain cells for ten
                    thousand monks. Other palatial buildings, towers, chapels, <hi rend="italic"
                    >chodtens</hi> (chaityas), pavilions, gleaming with gold and silver, Buddhas and
                    other idols, cluster round and crown the three peaks of Potala. The palace
                    itself is said to be painted externally with red and white stripes. The walls
                    and ceilings of all the chief apartments and temples are covered with rich
                    silks. We give an engraving of it (fig. 4), extracted from a Chinese view of
                    Lhasa, published by Klaproth in the work quoted at the end. The Potala has every
                    appearance of having been drawn from the reality. Two avenues bordered with
                    trees of considerable size lead from the city to the foot of Potala. “You see
                    there constantly,” says Hue, “a great number of foreign pilgrims, passing
                    between their fingers the beads of their long Buddhist rosaries, with lamas of
                    the court splendidly attired, and mounted on richly caparisoned horses. There
                    reigns in the neighbourhood of the Potala great and incessant movement; but for
                    the most part everybody is grave and silent; religious thoughts appear to occupy
                    the minds of all.” It would seem that between the palace and the city runs a
                    stream which is crossed by a bridge called “The Bridge of Glazed Tiles.”</p>
                <p>On the north side of the rock a wide and easy road descends winding. By this,
                    which has a parapet along the edge, it is lawful to ride. Not far from the base
                    is a garden-palace in the middle of a lake which is surrounded by trees and
                    shrubberies. This palace, called <hi rend="italic">Lu-hhang,</hi> is described
                    by Desideri as of attractive style, and circular in form, with a <hi
                    rend="italic">loggia</hi> or portico running all round, and adorned with
                    paintings. Here the dissolute Lama who built it, at the end of the 17th century,
                    used to give himself up to dissipation with the women of Lhasa. »Several other
                    villas or gardens of the Tibetan pope are mentioned; in one of them the
                    Panch’hen-Rinpoch’he (or Teshu Lama) is received when he visits Lhasa, and the
                    two living Buddhas drink tea together there. It is in the numerous gardens round
                    the town that those large trees grow of which Hue speaks as giving Lhasa such a
                    green girdle of foliage. There is no natural wood.</p>
                <p>No country in the world—not even Spain or Italy in the last century—has so
                    abounded in convents and monks as Tibet. The district of Lhasa alone is said to
                    contain thirty great convents, besides many smaller establishments, and a notice
                    of Lhasa would be incomplete without some mention at least of the great monastic
                    establishments which stand within a few miles of the city, and constitute an
                    essential element in its existence. These are not single masses of building like
                    the great convents of Europe. The temple <hi rend="italic">[Lha-khαnf)</hi> is
                    the focus of the whole. Round this are gathered numerous houses detached from
                    one another, though not far apart, and generally three stories in height. In
                    each of these are various apartments, each assigned to a monk of some authority
                    and dignity, with several younger members or novices under his immediate
                    direction. Each house has a little garden, and a quantity of vases in which
                    plants are grown. Library, storehouse, hostel, occupy other buildings, and a
                    varying multitude of the peculiar Buddhist objects of adoration which we know as

                    masts with sacred flags and streamers. The whole is usually enclosed in a lofty
                    and solid wall. These establishments have undoubtedly a vast population, though
                    we can hardly accept specific figures, in which indeed authorities do not agree.

                    3300 respectively; the former numbers seem excessive, the latter artificial; but
                    no doubt the real numbers are large. In the Labrang they show a copper kettle
                    holding more than one hundred buckets, which was used to make tea for the lamas
                    who took part in the daily temple service.</p>
                <p>The three great convents in the vicinity, all claiming to be foundations of
                    Tsongkhapa, the mediaeval reformer and organizer of the modern orthodox Lama
                    Church, are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Bre-bung</hi> (written <hi rend="italic">Bras·sPungs, “</hi>
                    the Rice-Heap,” so called from the shape of the hill on which it stands), called
                    by Nain Singh <hi rend="italic">Bcbang,</hi> is 5 or 6 miles from Lhasa, west of
                    the city, at the entrance to the plain from the side of Shigatzé and Nepal. In
                    the middle of the convent buildings rises a kind of pavilion, brilliant with
                    colour and gilding, which is reserved for the Dalai Lama, when he visits Brebung
                    once a year, and expounds to the inmates. The plaie is greatly frequented bythe
                    Mongol students who come to Lhasa to graduate, and is known in the country as
                    the Mongol convent.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sera</hi> (“The Golden ”) is 2 or 3 miles from the city on
                    the acclivity of the hills which border the valley on the north, and close to
                    the road by which pilgrims enter from Mongolia. The hill is planted with holly
                    and cypress, and from a distance the crowd of buildings and temples, rising in
                    amphitheatre against a background of trees, forms a pleasing picture. In the
                    recesses of the hill, high above the convent, are scattered cells of lamas
                    adopting the solitary life. There are three great temples rising in many
                    stories, the walls of which are entirely covered with gilding, whence the
                    convent’s name. In the chief of these temples is preserved the famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Dorjé</hi> of Buddha, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vajra</hi> or Thunderbolt (of Indra properly), or Adamant, the
                    symbol of the strong and indestructible, which the priest grasps and manipulates
                    in various ways during prayer. From this <hi rend="italic">dorjé,</hi> according
                    to one etymology at least, comes the name of the Himalayan sanatarium <hi
                    rend="italic">Darjiling</hi> or Darjeeling. The emblem is a bronze instrument,
                    shaped much like a dumb-bell with pointed ends, and it is said by Koeppen to
                    have been one of the later lama borrowings from Sivaism. The original is carried
                    solemnly in procession to Labrang during the New Year’s festival. In Sera P.
                    Desideri found shelter during the capture of the city by the Dzungar Khan in
                    1717, spoken of below.</p>
                <p>The hill adjoining Sera is believed to be rich in silver ore, but it is not
                    allowed to be worked. On the summit is a spring, and a holy place of the Lhasa
                    Mohammedans, who resort thither. Near the convent there is said to be gold,
                    which is worked by the monks. “Should they . . . discover a nugget of large
                    size, it is immediately replaced in the earth, under the impression that the
                    large nuggets . . . germinate in time, producing the small lumps which they are
                    privileged to search for” (Nain Singh).</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Galdan.—</hi> This great convent is 10 or 12 miles east of
                    Lhasa, on the other side of the Kichu Tsangpo river. It is the oldest monastery
                    of the “Yellow” sect, having been founded by Tsongkhapa, and having had him for
                    its first superior. Here his body is said to be preserved with miraculous
                    circumstances, and here are other relics of him, such as the impression of his
                    hands and feet in hard butter.</p>

                    >ιyi (bSτm-yτs)</hi> is another famous convent intimately connected with Lhasa,
                    but it lies some 36 miles south-east on the left bank of the great Tsangpo. It
                    was founded by Padma Sambhava <hi rend="italic">{Ur-ghien</hi> of the Tibetans),
                    the apostle who came from Udayâna in the 8th century as the great reviver of
                    Buddhism, and was at the lιead of the old Red sect. It is visited by the Dalai
                    Lama once a year. It is surrounded by a very high circular stone wall, 1⅛ miles
                    in circumference, with gates facing the four points of the compass. On this wall
                    Nain Singh, who was here on his last journey (1874), counted 1030 <hi
                    rend="italic">chaityas</hi> of brick. One very large temple <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Llιa-khang)</hi> occupies the centre, and round it are four smaller but still
                    very large temples. Many of the idols are of pure gold, and the wealth is very
                    great. The interiors of the temples are covered with beautiful writing in
                    enormous Nagari characters, which the vulgar believe to be the writing of Sakya
                    himself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lhasa Festivities.—</hi> The greatest of these is at the new
                    year. This lasts fifteen days, and is a kind of lama carnival, in which masks
                    and mummings, wherein the Tibetans take especial delight, play a great part. The
                    celebration commences at midnight, with shouts and clangour of bells, gongs,
                    chank-shells, drums, and all the noisy repertory of Tibetan music; whilst
                    friends exchange early visits and administer coarse sweetmeats and buttered tea.
                    On the 2d day the Dalai Lama gives a grand banquet, at which the Chinese and
                    native authorities are present, whilst in the public spaces, and in front of the
                    great convents, all sorts of shows and jugglers’ performances go on. Next day a
                    regular Tibetan exhibition takes place. A long cable, twisted of leather thongs,
                    is stretched from a high point in the battlements of Potala slanting down to the
                    plain, where it is strongly moored. Two men slide from top to bottom of this
                    huge hypothenuse, sometimes lying on the chest (which is protected by a
                    breast-plate of strong leather), spreading their arms as if to swim, and
                    descending with the rapidity of an arrow-flight. Occasionally fatal accidents
                    occur in this performance, which is called “the dance of the gods”; but the
                    survivors are rewarded by the court, and the Grand Lama himself is always a
                    witness of it. This practice occurs more or less over the Himalayan plateau, and
                    is known in the neighbourhood of the Ganges as <hi rend="italic">Barat.</hi> It
                    is employed as a kind of expiatory rite in cases of pestilence and the like. And
                    exactly the same performance is described as having been exhibited in St Paul’s
                    Churchyard before King Edward VI., and again before Philip of Spain, as well as,
                    about 1750, at Hertford and other places in England (see Strutt’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Sports,</hi> &lt;fcc., 2d ed., p. 198).</p>
                <p>The most remarkable celebration of the new year’s festivities is the great
                    jubilee of the <hi rend="italic">Monlam (sMon-larn,</hi> “prayer”), instituted
                    by Tsongkhapa himself in 1409. Lamas from all parts of Tibet, but chiefly from
                    the great convents in the neighbourhood, flock to Lhasa, and every road leading
                    thither is thronged with troops of monks on foot or horseback, on yaks or
                    donkeys, and carrying with them their breviaries and their cooking-pots. They
                    descend like swarms of bees upon the city, and those who cannot find lodging
                    bivouac in the streets and squares, or pitch their little black tents in the
                    plain. The festival lasts six days, during which there reigns a kind of
                    saturnalia, and the town is abandoned to these crowds of monks. Unspeakable
                    confusion and disorder reign, whilst gangs of lamas parade the streets,
                    shouting, singing, and coming to blows. The object of this great disorderly
                    gathering is, however, supposed to be devotional. Vast processions take place,
                    with mystic offerings and lama-music, to the Labrang and Moru convents; the
                    Grand Lama himself assists at the festival, and from an elevated throne beside
                    the Labrang receives the offerings of the multitude, and bestows his
                    benediction.</p>
                <p>On the 15th of the first month multitudes of torches are kept ablaze, which
                    lighten up the city to a great distance, whilst the interior of the Labrang is
                    illuminated throughout the night by innumerable lanterns shedding light on
                    coloured figures in bas-relief, framed in arabesques of animals, birds, and
                    flowers, and representing the history of Buddha, and other subjects, all
                    modelled in butter. The figures are executed on a large scale, and, as described
                    by Hue, who witnessed the festival at Kunbum on the frontier of China, with
                    extraordinary truth and skill. These singular works of art occupy some months in
                    preparation, and on the morrow are thrown away. On other days horse-races take
                    place from Sera to Potala, and foot-races from Γotala to the city. On the 27th
                    of the month the holy <hi rend="italic">Dorje</hi> is carried in solemn
                    procession from Sera to the Labrang, and to the presence of the Lama at
                    Potala,</p>
                <p>Of other great annual feasts, one, in the fourth month, is assigned to the
                    conception of Sakya, but appears to connect itself with the old nature-feast of
                    the entering of spring, and to be more or less identical with the ∕∕dZιof India.
                    A second, the consecration of the waters, in September-October, appears, on the
                    confines of India, to be associated with the Dasehra.</p>
                <p>On the 30th day of the second month there comes off a strange ceremony, akin to
                    that of the scapegoat (which is not unknown in India). It is called the driving
                    out of the demon. A man is hired to perform the part of demon (or victim
                    rather), a part which sometimes ends fatally. He is fantastically dressed, his
                    face mottled with white and black, and is then brought forth from the Labrang to
                    engage<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n521/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0521-0502"/> in quasi-theological controversy with one who
                    represents the Grand Lama. This ends in their throwing dice against each other
                    (as it were for the weal or woe of Lhasa). If the demon were to win the omen
                    would be appalling; so this is effectually barred by false dice. The victim is
                    then marched outside the city, followed by the troops, and by the whole
                    populace, hooting, shouting, and firing volleys after him. Once he is driven
                    off, the people return, and he is carried off to the Samayé convent. Should he
                    die shortly after, this is auspicious; if not, he is kept in ward at Samayé for
                    a twelvemonth.</p>
                <p>Nain Singh, whose habitual accuracy is attested by many facts, mentions a strange
                    practice of comparatively recent origin, according to which the civil power in
                    the city is put up to auction for the first twenty-three days of the new year.
                    The purchaser, who must be a member of the Brebung monastery, and is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">Jalno,</hi> is a kind of lord of misrule, who exercises
                    arbitrary authority during that time for his own benefit, levying taxes and
                    capricious fines upon the citizens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, &lt;l·c.—</hi> Pundit Nain Singh, who lived at Lhasa
                    continuously from 26th January to 21st April (1866), made indoor observations of
                    the thermometer from 9th to 23d February hourly, with the exception of eight
                    hours of sleep (11 <hi rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> to 7 A.M.); and the extreme
                    variation in the record is from 26° (February 2d, 11 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.μ.)</hi> to 45 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 75 (February 22d, 2 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.).</hi> He also mentions that the river (Kichu Tsangpo)
                    which flows by Lhasa was frozen in December,—the great river (Brahmaputra) being
                    open and passed by boats. Water kept in the warmest part of a house froze, and
                    burst the vessels holding it. · It is not easy to draw very precise conclusions
                    from these facts, but they perhaps indicate a somewhat less severe winter than
                    that of Ladak, where the true air temperature is reckoned by Captain H. Strachey
                    to range between zero and 30° Fahr. In other respects the Pundit’s account of
                    the climate does not differ materially from those we possess of western Tibet.
                    He says, besides, that strong and high winds are very prevalent, especially
                    during March and April; but snow fell only twice in the three months of his
                    stay, and not deeper than 3 inches. The fall on the surrounding hills was
                    somewhat heavier, but apparently it did not lie, for in general hardly any snow
                    was to be seen from the city. Should the snowfall in Lhasa ever exceed a foot,
                    it is regarded as an evil omen. What little Desideri says is to like effect. The
                    cold, he says, was never hurtful to health, and he had often spent the night (in
                    winter apparently) under the open sky, without suffering. Lightning, which
                    occurs only in connexion with the summer rains, is never known to strike houses
                    or to kill.</p>
                <p>It begins to be warm in May, and the sun’s power rapidly grows most oppressive.
                    There is a distinct rainy season at Shigatze (July to September), and this
                    appears to extend to Lhasa, though the information is not very precise. Nain
                    Singh was told that earthquakes are unknown in the Lhasa province. Cholera is
                    said to be unknown; but dysentery is often violent, and rapidly fatal. Cough and
                    chest diseases are not prevalent, nor are skin diseases common, in spite of the
                    filthy habits of the people. The most dreaded of all diseases is smallpox.
                    Inoculation is habitually used. Ophthalmia is very prevalent and severe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The seat of the princes whose family raised
                    Tibet to a position among the powers of Asia was originally on the Yarlung
                    river, in the extreme east of the region now occupied by Tibetan tribes. It was
                    transplanted to Lhasa in the 7th century by the king Srong-dsan-gampo,
                    conqueror, civilizer, and proselytizer, the founder of Buddhism in Tibet, the
                    introducer of the Indian alphabet. On the three-peaked crag now occupied by the
                    palacemonastery of the Great Lama this king is said to have established his
                    fortress, whilst he founded in the plain below temples to receive the sacred
                    images, brought respectively from Nepal and from China, by the brides to whom
                    his own conversion is attributed.</p>
                <p>Tibet endured as a conquering power some two centuries, and the more famous among
                    the descendants of the founder added to the city. This-rong-de-tsan (who reigned
                    740-786) is said to have erected a great temple-palace of which the basement
                    followed the Tibetan style, the middle story the Chinese, and the upper story
                    the Indian—a combination which would aptly symbolize the elements that have
                    moulded the culture of Lhasa, such as it is. His son, the last of the great
                    orthodox kings, in the next century, is said to have summoned artists from Nepal
                    and India, and among many splendid foundations to have erected a sanctuary (at
                    Samayé) of vast height, which had nine stories, the three lower of stone, the
                    three middle of brick, the three uppermost of timber. With this king the glory
                    of Tibet and of ancient Lhasa reached its zenith, and in 822 an obelisk
                    recording his treaty on equal terms with the Great T’ang emperor of China was
                    erected in the city. There followed dark days for Lhasa and the Buddhist Church
                    in the accession of this king’s brother Langdharma, who has been called the
                    Julian of the Lamas. This king rejected the doctrine, persecuted and scattered
                    its ministers, and threw down its temples, convents, and images. It was more
                    than a century before Buddhism recovered its hold, and its conventswere
                    rehabilitated over Tibet. The country was then split into an infinity of petty
                    states, many of them ruled from the convents by warlike ecclesiastics; but,
                    though the old monarchy never recovered, Lhasa seems to have maintained some
                    supremacy <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, and probably never lost its claim to
                    be the chief city of that congeries of principalities, with a common faith and a
                    common language, which was called Tibet.</p>
                <p>The Arab geographers of the 10th century speak of Tibet, but it is without real
                    knowledge, and none speak of any city that we can identify with Lhasa. The first
                    passage in any Western author in which such identification can be probably
                    traced occurs in the narrative of Friar Odorico of Pordenone (c. 1330). This
                    remarkable traveller’s route from Europe to India, and thence by sea to China,
                    can be traced satisfactorily, but of his journey homeward through Asia the
                    indications are very fragmentary. He speaks, however, on this return journey of
                    the realm of Tibet, which lay on the confines of India proper:—“The folk of that
                    country dwell in tents made of black felt. But the chief and royal city is all
                    built with walls of black and white, and all its streets are very well paved. In
                    this city no one shall dare to shed the blood of any, whether man or beast, for
                    the reverence they bear a certain idol that is there worshipped. In that city
                    dwelleth the <hi rend="italic">Λbαssi, i.e.,</hi> in their tongue the pope,
                    whois the head of all the idolaters, and who has the disposal of all their
                    benefices such as they are after their manner.”</p>
                <p>We know that Kublai Khan had constituted a young prince of the Lama Church, Mati
                    Dhwaja, as head of that body’, and tributary ruler of Tibet, but besides this
                    all is obscure for a century. This passage of Odoric shows that such authority
                    continued under Kublai’s descendants, and that some foreshadow of the position
                    since occupied by the Dalai Lama already existed. But it was not till a century
                    after Odoric that the strange heredity of the dynasty of the Dalai Lamas of
                    Lhasa actually began. And in the first two centuries of its existence the
                    residence of these pontiffs was rather at Brebung or Sera than at Lhasa itself,
                    though the latter was the centre of devout resort. A great event for Lhasa was
                    the conversion, or reconversion, of the Mongols to Lamaism (c. 1577), which made
                    the city the focus of sanctity and pilgrimage to so vast a tract of Asia. It was
                    in the middle of the 17th century that Lhasa became the residence of the Dalai
                    Lama. A native prince, known as the Tsanpo, with his seat at Shigatze, had made
                    himself master of southern Tibet, and threatened to absorb the whole. The fifth
                    Dalai Lama, Navang Lobsaug, called in the aid of a Calmuck prince, Gushi Khan,
                    from the neighbourhood of the Koko-nur, who defeated and slew the Tsanpo and
                    made over full dominion in Tibet to the Lama (1643). The latter now first
                    established his court, and built his palace, on the rock-site of the fortress of
                    the ancient monarchy, which apparently had fallen into ruin, and to this he gave
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Potala.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to be used untranslated in Tibet, one may discern from Hue’s own book that <hi

                    seems to be really taken from the classical traditions of the Buddhists. <hi

                <p>In the time of this Dalai Lama, Lhasa was visited for the first time by European
                    travellers. In 1624 Antonio d’Andrada, a Portuguese Jesuit, had penetrated to
                    Tibet through the Gangetic Himalaya, and returned the following year with a
                    coadjutor. But the place which he reached was <hi rend="italic">Caparaηgue</hi>

                    and he never got nearer Lhasa. In June 1661 the Jesuit <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0522-0503"/> fathers, Albert D’Orville and John Grueber,
                    started from Peking, and, by the way of Siningfu and the Koko-nur, reached
                    Lhasa, where they stayed a month, and then went on through Nepal to India. The
                    extracts from Grueber’s narrative, given by Athanasius Kircher in his <hi
                    rend="italic">China</hi><hi rend="italic">Illustrata</hi> (Amst., 1667), are
                    accompanied by a drawing of Potala which, though meagre, appears to be genuine,
                    and is the only European representation in existence of that Tibetan
                    Vatican.</p>
                <p>The founder of Potala died in 1682, and his death was followed by events which
                    brought on a time of trouble. He had appointed as “regent” or civil
                    administrator <hi rend="italic">CΓisri,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Debd),</hi>
                    one supposed to be his own natural son. This remarkable personage, Sangje
                    Gyamtso, of great ambition and accomplishment, still renowned in Tibet as the
                    author of some of the most valued works of the native literature, concealed the
                    death of his master, asserting that the latter had retired, in mystic meditation
                    or trance, to the upper chambers of the palace. The government continued to be
                    carried on in the Lama’s name by the regent, who leagued with Galdan Khan of
                    Dzungaria against the Chinese (Manchu) power. It was not till the great emperor
                    Kang-hi was marching on Tibet that the death of the Lama, sixteen years before,
                    was admitted. A solemn funeral was then performed, at which 108,000 lamas
                    assisted, and a new incarnation was set up in the person of a youth of fifteen.
                    This young man was the scandal of the Lamaite Church in every kind of evil
                    living and debauchery. But it was under him and the regent Sangje Gyamtso that
                    the Potala palace attained its present scale of grandeur, and that most of the
                    other great buildings of Lhasa were extended and embellished. In 1705-6 a
                    Calmuck prince, Latsau Khan, great grandson of Gushi Khan, taking the renowned
                    name of Jenglιiz Khan, made himself master of Tibet, and put to death both the
                    crafty regent and the dissolute lama whom he had set up. The Dzungarians crossed
                    the northern desert in 1717, and stormed Lhasa, but were in turn driven out by
                    the army of Kang-hi in 1720, and from that time the Chinese power, though, as
                    elsewhere, it has been at times severely shaken, has never quite lost its hold
                    of Tibet.</p>
                <p>It was in the midst of these troubled times (1708) that a Capuchin mission
                    entered Lhasa. It was unfortunate in the death of its successive heads, and from
                    about 1712 it was abandoned for several years, but after an interval the
                    Capuchins reappeared, twelve in number, reaching Lhasa by Nepal in 1720. Nothing
                    almost was heard of them till the head of the mission, P. Orazio della Penna,
                    appeared at Rome in 1735 to report that nine were dead, and to ask
                    reinforcement. He returned with nine more, carrying presents to the Grand Lama
                    and the so-called “king of Tibet.” In 1742 he reported his safe arrival, and
                    that the presents were well received. Called to Nepal, where there was a branch
                    of the mission, he died there in 1747. We possess some of the results collected
                    by this mission in an excellent short treatise on Tibet by P. Orazio himself, as
                    well as in the extraordinary hodge-podge of crude philology, rubbish, and
                    valuable facts (like fossils imbedded in a bank of mud), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alphabetum</hi><hi rend="italic">Tibetaηum</hi> of the Augustine monk Ant.
                    Giorgi <hi rend="italic">(Rome,</hi> 1762). The mission seems to have been
                    expelled from Tibet in 1754, and found refuge for a time in Nepal. Some fifty
                    volumes, the relics of the mission library, were in 1847 recovered from Lhasa by
                    Mr Bryan Hodgson, through the courtesy of the Grand Lama himself, and were
                    transmitted as an offering to Pope Pius IX., then in the first bloom of
                    reputation.</p>
                <p>In 1716, moreover, two Jesuits, P. Inolito Desideri of Pistoia, and P. Freyre, a
                    Portuguese, reached Lhasa by way of Kashmir, Ladak, and the enormous journey
                    from Ladak by the holy lakes and the valley of the Tsanpu. Desideri remained at
                    Lhasa till April 1721, witnessing the capture of Lhasa successively by Dzungar
                    and Chinese. Of the moderation of the latter, and their abstinence from all
                    outrage or plunder, he speaks highly. His departure was due to controversies
                    between the Jesuits and Capuchins at Rome, which caused an order to be issued
                    for his retirement from Tibet. An interesting letter from him, dated April 10,
                    1716, is printed in the <hi rend="italic">Lettres Édifiantes,</hi> Rec. XV., but
                    a large MS. volume of his observations during his residence in Tibet is still
                    unpublished. The next European visitor was Samuel Van de Putte of Flushing, an
                    LL.D, of Leyden, whose thirst for travel carried him through India to Lhasa,
                    where he is said to have resided a long time, to have acquired the language, and
                    to have become intimate with some of the lamas. After travelling from Lhasa to
                    Peking with a lama mission he returned, again by Lhasa, to India, and was an
                    eye-witness of the sack of Delhi by Nadir Shah in 1737. Unhappily he ordered his
                    papers to be burnt after his death, and the knowledge that such a traveller must
                    have accumulated died with him. We pass on to 1811-12 when the first (and last)
                    English visit to Lhasa occurred. The traveller was Thomas Manning, a Cambridge
                    man of Cains College, who had been long devoted to Chinese studies, the “friend
                    Μ.” of Charles Lamb, from whom “Elia” professes to have got that translation of
                    a Chinese MS. which furnished the immortal dissertation on roast pig. After
                    residing some years at Canton, Manning went to Calcutta, bent on reaching the
                    interior of China through Tibet, since from the seaboard it was sealed. He
                    actually did reach Lhasa, stayed there about five months, and had several
                    interviews with the Dalai Lama, but was compelled to return to India. He never
                    published anything regarding his journey, and the very fact of its occurrence
                    was known to few, when his narrative was printed, through the praiseworthy zeal
                    of'Mr C. Markham, in 1876. The man had given the reins to his own eccentricities
                    till he seemed to have lost all power of seriousness, and the account, though
                    containing some passages of great interest, is most disappointing.</p>
                <p>The next travellers to reach Lhasa were Hue and Gabet, French Lazarist priests,
                    who travelled from China the route followed by Grueber and by Van de Putte, <hi
                    rend="italic">via</hi> Siningfu, and reached Lhasa 29th January 1846. On the
                    15th of March they were sent off under escort by the rugged road to Sz’-chuen.
                    Hue’s book, <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs</hi><hi rend="italic">d’un Voyage,</hi>
                    &amp;c., is probably still well known, and deserves to be so, for it is one of
                    the most delightful among books of travel. Hue was indeed, not only without
                    science, perhaps without accurate knowledge of any kind, but also without that
                    geographical sense which sometimes enables a traveller to bring back valuable
                    contributions to geographical knowledge though unable to make instrumental
                    observations. He was, however, amazingly clever as a narrator and sketcher of
                    character; and, in this his first work, his ambition to shine had not gained the
                    upper hand as it did fatally in later works. It was Ke-shen, a well-known
                    Chinese statesman, disgraced for making peace with the English at Canton in
                    1841, and who was then on a special deputation to Lhasa, who ostensibly expelled
                    them. The Tibetan regent, with his enlightened and kindly spirit, is painted by
                    Hue in most attractive colours, and Mr Markham expresses strongly the opinion
                    that the native authorities were most willing to receive strangers, whilst the
                    jealousy that excluded them was Chinese only. Recent experiences of attempts to
                    enter Tibet contradict this view. The lamas, whose rule seems to have become
                    more and more grasping and oppressive, appear to be sensible that their system
                    would easily fall to pieces, and are violently opposed to the passage of
                    Europeans across the Tibetan frontier.</p>
                <p>Our latest narrative of a visit to Lhasa is that of the late Pundit Nain Singh,
                    trained as an explorer in the Indian survey department. He reached the city in
                    the course of two most remarkable journeys. In the first, after an ineffectual
                    attempt by Nepal, he travelled by the Manasarowar Lake, and the road thence
                    eastward, parallel to the course of the Tsanpu, reaching Lhasa 10th January
                    1866, and leaving it 21st April 1867. On the second journey (1874) he started
                    from Ladak, crossing the vast and elevated plateau by the Tengri-nor and other
                    great lakes, and again reaching Lhasa 18th November. Between these two journeys
                    Lhasa had also been visited by another native explorer in 1872.<note

                    rend="italic">Report</hi> for 1873-74.</p></note> Nain Singh, by his
                    extraordinary surveys, and by repeated observations of latitude on his first
                    visit, has fixed for us the position of Lhasa. But he also has given an account
                    of his journeys, and of his residence there, which, though brief, is full of
                    intelligence and interest, and appears to be thoroughly trustworthy. This
                    enterprising and deserving man was, on the completion of his journey in 1875,
                    rewarded by the Indian Government with a pension and grant of land, and
                    afterwards received the gold medal of the Roy. Geog. Soc. and the Companionship
                    of the Star of India. He died early in 1882.</p>
