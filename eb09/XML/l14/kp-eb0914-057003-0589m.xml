                <p><label type="entry">LIFEBOAT</label>. It will be convenient to consider here, not
                    the lifeboat simply, but also other means of saving life at sea. When it is
                    borne in mind that the vast commerce of such a country as Great Britain extends
                    to every part of the world, that the arrivals and departures from the ports of
                    the country in one year average six hundred thousand vessels, that these are
                    manned by more than two hundred thousand men and boys, and carry goods to the
                    estimated value of six hundred millions sterling, with unknown thousands of
                    passengers, that its seaboard is nearly 5000 miles in extent, many parts of it
                    being exceedingly dangerous to shipping, that about two thousand wrecks occur
                    every year on its shores, and above seven hundred lives are lost, the necessity
                    that exists for a well-organized system of life-saving apparatus becomes very
                    apparent. It is satisfactory to be able to add that this well-organized system
                    is most efficiently provided by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, with
                    its splendid fleet of two hundred and seventy-one lifeboats, and by the Rocket
                    Service. The number of lives saved annually, either by the lifeboats or by
                    special exertions for which the institution has granted rewards, averages in
                    round numbers nine hundred, and by far the greater proportion of these
                    (four-fifths) are saved by lifeboats. These lifeboats, too, are the means of
                    saving every year from twenty to thirty vessels which, owing to stress of
                    weather, exhausted men, &lt;fcc., would almost certainly have been lost but for
                    the aid afforded by the fresh and experienced lifeboat crews.</p>
                <p>The qualities of the lifeboat first deserve our attention. These are such that
                    this boat is able to live in seas, and go into positions of danger, that would
                    overwhelm ordinary boats or insure their destruction. Eight important qualities
                    are possessed by it in a very high degree :—(1) buoyancy; (2) great lateral
                    stability, or resistance to upsetting; (3) the power to right itself if upset;
                    (4) the power of immediate self-discharge when filled with water; (5) strength;
                    (6) stowage room for a large number of passengers; (7) speed against a heavy
                    sea; (8) facility in launching and taking the shore.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">buoyancy</hi> of the institution’s lifeboat, or its
                    inability to sink, be it ever so deeply laden, is secured chiefly by means of a
                    watertight deck or floor, air-cases round the sides inboard, and two large
                    air-chambers, one in the bow, the other in the stern. The “extra buoyancy” thus
                    obtained cannot be too great so long as it does not interfere with the space
                    necessary for working the boat and stowing shipwrecked persons. The air-cases
                    round the sides serve also to confine any water shipped to the centre of the
                    boat, a point of great importance. There is an airtight space between the boat’s
                    floor and its bottom, filled partly with air partly with cork-ballast, which
                    gives it additional buoyancy, but the air-chambers above the floor would float
                    the boat even if she were stove in and this space filled with water. In a
                    33-feet boat the buoyancy obtained by all its chambers is equal to 11∣ tons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stability</hi> is obtained chiefly by means of ballast. Immense
                    difficulty was experienced in arriving at the present form of the institution’s
                    splendid boat, because qualities of differing value had to be sacrificed to each
                    other in due proportion. Thus, while breadth of beam secured stability, it
                    seriously interfered with the self-righting quality. Ballast, therefore, in the
                    form of a heavy iron keel, instead of breadth, became necessary to give the
                    requisite stability.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 represents, let us say, the 33-feet, double-banked, ten-oared,
                    self-righting, and self-emptying lifeboat of the institution on its transporting
                    carriage, ready for launching; figs. 2 and 3, respectively, a section and a
                    bird’s-eye view of the same. The breadth is 8 feet, with stowage room for
                    forty-three persons—thirty passengers and thirteen of a crew. The festooned
                    lines (fig. 1) enable people in the water to clamber inboard even without
                    assistance. The shaded parts of figs. 2 and 3 show the position of the
                    air-cases. The white oblong space in fig. 3 shows the free space available for
                    crew and passengers. In fig. 2 are seen the depth to which the air-cases
                    descend, and the height to which the bow and stern air-chambers ascend above the
                    gunwale, also the ballast space between the floor and the keel.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">self-righting</hi> power is due to the large elevated
                    air-chambers in bow and stern, coupled with great sheer, or rise fore and aft,
                    of gunwale, to the iron keel, which weighs <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n590/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0590-0571"/> about 9 cwts. in a 33-feet boat, and to the
                    air-cases and ballast, which latter weighs from 7 to 8 cwts. When the boat is
                    upset it cannot rest on its two elevated air-chambers; it necessarily rolls on
                    one side, then the heavy iron keel and ballast come into play and drag it back
                    to its right position in a few seconds. This principle of self-righting was
                    discovered—at all events first exhibited—at the end of last century, by the Rev.
                    James Bremner of Orkney, but was not finally adopted till the middle of the
                    present century.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">self-emptying</hi> quality depends chiefly on the
                    well-known physical fact that water must find its level. The floor of the
                    lifeboat (fig. 2, the dotted double line extending from stem to stern), on which
                    the men’s feet rest when seated on the thwarts, is placed so as to be very
                    slightly—2 or 3 inches—above the level of the sea when the boat is fully manned
                    and loaded. In this floor there are six holes of 6 inches diameter, into which
                    are fitted six metal tubes. These pass through the boat’s bottom into the sea.
                    The water of course enters them, but cannot rise above them into the boat,
                    because it cannot rise above its own level. Valves at the upper ends of the
                    tubes, opening downwards, prevent the annoyance of water spurting in, but allow
                    it freely to run out. When, then, a billow overwhelms the boat, and fills it,
                    the water rushes violently down the discharging tubes until it reaches the
                    sea-level; by that time it has descended below the level of the floor and left
                    the boat empty. So complete and swift is the process that a filled boat frees
                    herself in about half a minute. This principle was first applied by the
                    institution in 1851. Lifeboats devoid of the selfdischarging quality become
                    temporarily useless when filled by a sea, as they can be emptied only by the
                    slow and laborious process of baling.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Strength,</hi> that will enable the lifeboat to suffer
                    treatment which no ordinary boat could stand, is dependent on peculiarity of
                    construction and material. The best Honduras mahogany is used, and the diagonal
                    plan of construction adopted,—that is, the boat has two distinct “skins” of
                    planking, both sets of planks being laid on in a position diagonal to the boat’s
                    keel and contrary to each other, besides passing round from gunwale to gunwale
                    under the boat instead of from stem to stern as in ordinary boats. The skins
                    have a layer of prepared canvas between them, and thus great strength and
                    elasticity are combined.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carriage</hi> of the lifeboat is an essential adjunct for
                    the purpose of conveying it over any kind of road or beach to the place where it
                    may be required. It can be run deep into a raging surf, and the boat, with its
                    crew seated and oars ready out, can be launched at once, by blocks and tackle,
                    so as to enable the men to dash forward and meet the incoming rollers with
                    sufficient force to propel it through or over the seas, and thus avoid the risk
                    of being hurled back on the beach. Each lifeboat is furnished with a set of
                    spare oars, as these are frequently broken.</p>
                <p>The institution’s lifeboats are of various sizes—six, eight, ten, and twelve
                    oared,—and they are placed at various points of the coast according to the
                    necessities of each station. Some are called out at long intervals; others, such
                    as those near the Goodwin Sands, are constantly on duty in rough weather—that of
                    Ramsgate having a steamer to attend on it, which lies in harbour, with its fires
                    banked up, ready for instant action night and day. The average cost of a
                    lifeboat station is £1000,—the boat and equipments, including belts and
                    carriage, costing £650, and the boat-house £350. The average annual expense of
                    maintaining a station is £70, which is expended in paying the crew for going off
                    and saving or attempting to save life from shipwreck, for exercising the
                    lifeboat once a quarter, paying coxswain’s salary, replacing gear, and
                    repairs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">lifebelt</hi> of the institution is a part of the equipment
                    of the lifeboat which merits special attention, because it is a very efficient
                    contrivance, and has been the means of saving many lives in time past. Fig. 4
                    shows its appearance and the manner in which it is worn. It was designed in 1854
                    by Admiral J. R. Ward, the institution’s chief inspector of lifeboats. It is
                    made of cork fastened on canvas, and combines great buoyancy with strength and
                    flexibility. It not only floats a heavily-clothed man head and shoulders above
                    water, but enables him to support a comrade easily —the extra buoyancy being 25
                    lb. One of its distinctive features is its division at the waist, by which means
                    great freedom of action is allowed. It serves also as a species of armour to
                    protect the wearer’s most vital parts from blows against rock or wreck, while it
                    affords some degree of warmth. No man may serve in the lifeboats of the
                    institution without it, and it would be well if every British ship were obliged
                    to carry lifebelts of this kind.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The first lifeboat was conceived and designed by
                    Lionel Lukin, a London coachbuilder, in 1785. Encouraged in his philanthropic
                    plans by the prince of Wales (George IV. ), Lukin fitted up a Norway yawl as a
                    lifeboat, took out a patent for it, and wrote a pamphlet descriptive of his
                    “Insubmergible Boat.” Buoyancy he obtained by means of a projecting gunwale of
                    cork and air-chambers inside—one of these being at the bow, another at the
                    stern. Stability he secured by a false iron keel. The self-righting and
                    self-emptying principles he seems not to have thought of; at all events he did
                    not compass them. Despite the patronage of the prince, Lukin went to his grave a
                    neglected and disappointed man. But he was not altogether unsuccessful, for, at
                    the request of the Rev. Dr Shairp, Lukin fitted up a coble as an “unimmergible”
                    lifeboat, which was launched at Bamborough, saved several lives the first year,
                    and afterwards saved many lives and much property.</p>
                <p>Public apathy in regard to shipwreck was at length swept away by the wreck of the
                    “Adventure” of Newcastle in 1789. This vessel was stranded only 300 yards from
                    the shore, and her crew dropped, one by one, into the raging breakers in
                    presence of thousands of spectators, none of whom dared to put off in an
                    ordinary boat to the rescue. An excited meeting among the people of South
                    Shields followed; a committee was formed, and premiums were offered for the best
                    models of a lifeboat. This called forth many plans, of which those of William
                    Wouldhave, a j&gt;ainter, and Henry Greathead, a boatbuilder, of South Shields,
                    were selected. The committee awarded the prize to the latter, and, adopting the
                    good points of both models, gave the order for the construction of their boat to
                    Greathead. This boat λvas rendered buoyant by nearly 7 cwts. of cork, and had
                    very raking stem and stern-posts, with great curvature of keel. It did good
                    service in after years, and Greathead was well rewarded; nevertheless no other
                    lifeboat was launched till 1798, when the duke of Northumberland ordered
                    Greathead to build him a lifeboat which he endowed. This boat also did good
                    service, and its noble owner ordered another in 1800 for Oporto. In the same
                    year Mr Cathcaι∙t Dempster ordered one for St Andrews, where, two years later,
                    it saved twelve lives. Thus the value of lifeboats began to be recognized, and
                    before the end of 1803 Greathead had built no fewer than thirty-one
                    boats—eighteen for England, five for Scotland, and eight for foreign lands. That
                    these boats were lamentably insufficient to meet the necessities of England was
                    shown year after year by the ever enlarging record of wreck and loss of life on
                    her shores; nevertheless, public interest in lifeboats was not thoroughly
                    aroused till 1823.</p>
                <p>In that year Sir William Hillary, Bart., stood forth to champion the lifeboat
                    cause. Sir William dwelt in the Isle of Man, had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n591/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0591-0572"/> assisted with his own hand in the saving of three
                    hundred and five lives, and felt the horrors of shipwreck so keenly that he
                    resolved to stir up public men and the nation generally to a sense of their duty
                    in regard to this matter. Eventually, in conjunction with two members of
                    parliament—Mr Thomas Wilson and Mr George Hibbert—he .founded the “Royal
                    National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck.” This, perhaps
                    the grandest of England’s charitable societies, and now named the “Royal
                    National Lifeboat Institution,” was founded on the 4th of March 1824. The king
                    and many of the nobility and gentry patronized it. The archbishop of Canterbury
                    presided at its birth; the most eloquent men in the land—among them
                    Wilberforce—pleaded the cause; the institution was launched under the most
                    favourable auspices, and began its noble career with a sum of only £9826. In the
                    first year twelve new lifeboats were built and placed at different stations,
                    besides which thirty-nine lifeboats had been stationed on the British shores by
                    benevolent individuals and by independent associations over which the
                    institution exercised no control though it often assisted them. In its early
                    years the institution placed the mortar apparatus of Captain Manby at many
                    stations, and provided for the wants of sailors and others saved from shipwreck.
                    The latter duty is now efficiently discharged by the ‘ ‘ Shipwrecked Fishermen
                    and Mariners’ Royal Benevolent Society.” At the date of the institution’s second
                    report it had contributed to the saving of three hundred and forty-two lives,
                    either by its own life-saving apparatus or by other means for which it had
                    granted rewards. With fluctuating success, both as regards means and results,
                    the institution continued its good work from year to year—saving many lives, and
                    occasionally losing a few brave men in its tremendous battles with the sea.
                    District or branch societies were established in mostof the coast towns.
                    Ultimately it began to be recognized that inland towns owed something to the
                    lifeboat cause, as well as towns on the coast, and now such cities as
                    Manchester, Liverpool, Glasgow, Edinburgh, &amp;c., have presented lifeboats to
                    the institution and become annual contributors. Since the adoption of the
                    self-righting boats, loss of life in the service has been comparatively small
                    and infrequent.</p>
                <p>Towards the middle of this century the lifeboat cause appeared to lose interest
                    with the public, though the life-saving work was prosecuted with unremitting
                    zeal, but the increasing loss of life by shipwreck, and a few unusually severe
                    disasters to lifeboats, brought about the reorganization of the society in 1850.
                    The late Prince Albert became vice-patron of the institution in conjunction with
                    the late king of the Belgians, and afterwards Her Majesty the Queen, who had
                    been its patron since her accession, became an annual contributor to its funds.
                    About the same time its present secretary, Mr Richard Lewis, barrister-at-law,
                    was appointed. The following year (1851) the duke of Northumberland became its
                    president, and from that time forward a tide of prosperity set in which is
                    literally unprecedented in the history of benevolent institutions, both in
                    regard to the great work accomplished and the pecuniary aid received. Its flow
                    of prosperity has never since been checked. In 1850 its committee undertook the
                    immediate superintendence of all the lifeboat work on the coasts, with the aid
                    of local committees. Periodical inspections, quarterly exercise of crews, fixed
                    rates of payments to coxswains and men, and quarterly reports were instituted,
                    at the time when the self-righting self-emptying boat came into being. This boat
                    was the result of a hundred-guinea prize, offered by the president, for the best
                    model of a lifeboat, with another hundred to defray the cost of a boat built on
                    the model chosen. In reply to the offer no fewer than two hundred and eighty
                    models were sent in, not only from all parts of the United Kingdom, but from
                    France, Germany, Holland, and the United States of America. The prize was gained
                    by Mr James Beeching of Great Yarmouth, whose model, slightly modified by Mr
                    Peake, one of the committee of inspection, became the foundation of the present
                    boat, which, having been still further improved as time and experience have
                    suggested, is now probably as near to perfection as can be attained.</p>
                <p>The shortest way, perhaps, to exhibit the progressive work of the institution is
                    to contrast the report of 1850 with that of 1880. In the former year the
                    receipts had dwindled down to £84 of subscriptions and donations, which, with
                    £270 of dividends (on a capital of £9000) and a balance of £476 on hand, gave an
                    available income of £830. The expenditure was £590, and the lives saved were
                    about one hundred. In 1880 donations and annual subscriptions amounted to
                    £29,240; dividends and interest (on a capital of £231,000) amounted to £9266.
                    The total income was £38,506, besides legacies in the same year to the amount of
                    £40,782. The expenditure, including liabilities, was £40,586, and the number of
                    lives saved was about seven hundred. In the past unusually disastrous year
                    (1881), the institution has saved 966 lives by its boats, and granted rewards
                    for the saving of 155 more, besides rescuing 33 vessels from destruction. The
                    total number of lives saved either by the lifeboats, or by special exertions for
                    which the institution has granted rewards, since its formation, is 28,724, for
                    which services 95 gold medals, 939 silver medals, and £69,000 in cash have been
                    granted as rewards. So highly are the services of the institution appreciated
                    that donations of boats, gifts of money, acknowledgments, and legacies come in
                    from nearly all quarters of the globe, in sums varying from a shilling to
                    £10,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rocket Apparatus.—</hi> This, next to the lifeboat, is the most
                    important and successful means by which shipwrecked persons are rescued on the
                    British shores. Many vessels are cast every year on the rocky parts of the
                    coasts, under cliffs, where no lifeboat could be of service. In such places the
                    rocket alone is available. It is worked by the men of the coastguard, with the
                    aid, in a few places, of volunteer rocket brigades. The courage and skill
                    displayed in its use are evinced by the saving of many lives every year, and by
                    the fact that a large proportion of the medals given by the lifeboat institution
                    for heroic conduct are awarded to the men of the coastguard, who, besides
                    managing the rockets, frequently man the lifeboats and also effect rescues in
                    their own boats. The number of lives saved by means of the rocket apparatus in
                    the year ending 30th June 1881 was 657. This, however, is the greatest number
                    saved in any one year since 1856, at which date the life-saving rocket apparatus
                    was placed under the entire control and management of the Board of Trade. The
                    rocket stations on the coast at the 30th June 1881 numbered 288. The Board of
                    Trade now gives a sum of money for each life saved, besides awarding silver and
                    bronze medals for acts of special gallantry.</p>
                <p>The apparatus consists of five principal parts, viz., the rocket, the
                    rocket-line, the whip, the hawser, and the sling lifebuoy. The mode of working
                    it is as follows. A rocket, having a light line attached to it, is fired over
                    the wreck. By means of this line the wrecked crew haul out the whip, which is a
                    double or endless line, rove through a block with a tail attached to it. The
                    tail-block, having been detached from the rocket-line, is fastened to a mast, or
                    other portion of the wreck, high above the water. By means of the whip the
                    rescuers haul off the hawser, to which is hung the travelling or sling lifebuoy.
                    When one end of the hawser has been made fast to the mast, about 18 inches <hi
                    rend="italic">above</hi> the whip, and its other end to tackle fixed to an
                    anchor on shore, the lifebuoy is run out by the rescuers, and the shipwrecked
                    persons, getting into it one at a time, are hauled ashore. Sometimes, in cases
                    of urgency, the lifebuoy is worked by means of the whip alone, without the
                    hawser. A tallyboard with instructions to wrecked crews, printed in English and
                    French, is sent off with the whip, as ignorance in regard to the mode of working
                    the apparatus has been the cause of much loss of life. Such ignorance is
                    culpable, because the Board of Trade issues enamelled plates with instructions,
                    which are supplied gratuitously to shipowners and masters to be placed on
                    conspicuous parts of their vessels, and are fixed in public places along the
                    British coast, while every certificated officer in the mercantile marine is
                    required to understand the working of the rocket apparatus.</p>
                <p>The late Captain G. W. Manby, F.R.S., in 1807 invented, or at least introduced,
                    the mortar apparatus, on which the system of the rocket apparatus is founded.
                    Previously, however, in 1791, the idea of throwing a rope from a wreck to the
                    shore by means of a shell from a mortar had occurred to Serjeant Bell of the
                    Royal Artillery, and about the same time, to a Frenchman named La Fère, both of
                    whom made successful experiments with their apparatus. In the same year (1807) a
                    rocket was proposed by Mr Trengrouse of Helston in Cornwall, also a hand and
                    lead line as means of communicating with vessels in distress. The <hi
                    rend="italic">heavingcane,</hi> a fruit of the latter suggestion, is now used at
                    every station in the kingdom. In 1814 forty-five mortar stations were
                    established, and Manby received £2000, in addition to previous grants, in
                    acknowledgment of the good service rendered by his invention. Mr John Dennett of
                    Newport, Isle of Wight, introduced the rocket, which was afterwards extensively
                    used. In 1826 four places in the Isle of Wight were supplied with Dennett’s
                    rockets, but it was not till after Government had taken the apparatus under its
                    own control, in 1855, that the rocket now in use was adopted. It was invented by
                    Colonel Boxer, and its peculiar characteristic lies in the combination of two
                    rockets in one case, one being a continuation of the other, so that, after the
                    first compartment has carried the machine to its full elevation, the second
                    gives it an additional impetus, whereby a great increase of range is obtained.
                    The rocket has now entirely superseded the mortar in England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The United States Life-Saving Service</hi> is chief among the
                    lifeboat societies of other nations, both as regards the extent of coast
                    embraced and the amount of work done. There are several points of difference
                    between this service and that of England which are noteworthy. In the first

                    from Congress. Secondly, besides protecting its vast extent of seaboard, it has
                    to provide for the shores of its great lakes, or fresh-water seas. Then, the
                    coasts of America, unlike those of England, are destitute of human habitations
                    in many places, which renders necessary the constant employment of surfmen for
                    the express purpose of looking out for vessels in distress and manning the
                    surf-boats. It also necessitates the erection of houses of refuge, provisioned
                    so as to afford shelter and food to shipwrecked crews for a considerable time,
                    at places where, without such provision, those who escape the sea would probably
                    perish from hunger and exposure.</p>
                <p>The shores of the United States—lakes and sea—are over 10,000 miles in extent,
                    embracing almost every variety of climate and formation of land. This vast
                    extent of coast-line is divided into 12 districts, with a total of 179 stations.
                    Of these 139 are on the Atlantic, 34 on the lakes, and 6 on the Pacific. Those
                    on the desolate coast of Florida are houses of refuge only, without boats or
                    apparatus. Many of the stations are closed during the fine months of the year,
                    their crews being disbanded till the winter gales again summon them to the
                    heroic and dangerous work of saving the shipwrecked. That they render noble
                    service in this way may be gathered from the annual reports. The report for 1850
                    shows that the disasters to shipping in that year amounted to 300, that on board
                    of the vessels thus endangered there were 1989 persons, of whom 1980 were saved
                    and only 9 lost. The property imperilled at the same time was estimated at, in
                    round numbers, £790,000, of which over £540,000 worth was saved, besides which,
                    in one hundred and twenty-e’ght instances, stranded vessels were hove off, and
                    piloted out of danger by the surfmen. The total number of lives saved by this
                    service, since the introduction of the present system in 1871, to the close of
                    the fiscal year in June 1881, was 11,864; the total number of persons sheltered
                    2610, and the number of days’ shelter afforded 7350; the total value of property
                    saved, $14,958,875.</p>
                <p>Owing to the flat shores of the Atlantic coast, and the sparseness of the
                    population, heavy boats are found unsuitable. Only a few boats on the English
                    model exist in the service. The boats chiefly in use are surf-boats, incapable
                    of self-righting, and liable to be swamped, but which nevertheless seem well
                    suited for the work, and are admirably managed. They are very light, and can, on
                    their transporting carnages, be easily dragged along the shore by their crews.
                    The cork life-belts worn by the men are of the plan first designed in 1854 by
                    Rear-Admiral Ward. For projecting a line over a stranded vessel, the Americans
                    prefer the mortar, or other piece of ordnance, to the rocket. In addition to the
                    travelling lifebuoy, they use a metallic car, or small covered boat, which can
                    hold three or four persons, who, entering it by a small manhole, are shut in and
                    drawn ashore, safely protected from injury, even though overturned by the surf.
                    This clever contrivance has been of great service in rescuing invalids,
                    children, and aged persons. The total cost of the service is somewhere about
                    £90,000 a year.</p>
                <p>The history of the United States Life-Saving Service may be said to have begun in
                    1848, though half a century before that the Humane Society of Massachusetts had
                    erected some huts of shelter and stationed some boats on the coast. In that year
                    the United States Government was led to consider the subject of loss on their
                    shores, chiefly through the energy of the Hon. W. A. Newell of New Jersey, a
                    member of the House of Representatives. Captain Douglass Ottinger (the inventor
                    of the life-car) was charged with the management and reconstruction of the
                    service. The impetus given to it at this rime was never quite lost. Again, in
                    1854, renewed efforts were made to improve the service, but no great progress
                    was made till the year 1871, when the present effective system was organized;
                    new stations were built; the patrol system between the stations was introduced;
                    the regular keeping of journals and sending in of reports was ordered; libraries
                    for the use of the men were sent to stations; uniformity in signals was
                    arranged, and a thorough reform in all departments accomplished.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The French Society for Saving Life from Shipwreck,</hi>
                    modelled on the basis of the English system, is a vigorous and healthy offshoot.
                    It continues steadily to extend its operations along the coasts of France,
                    besides introducing its life-saving apparatus into Algeria and other colonies.
                    It was founded in the year 1865, and from that year onward has continued to do
                    good and ever-increasing service in the saving of life and property. At the date
                    of its report ending 30 th June 1881, its lifeboat stations numbered 62, and its
                    mortal· or other projectile stations 391. During the year its lifeboats and gun
                    apparatus had saved 209 lives and 16 ships, to which may be added 31 lives, for
                    the saving of which the society had granted rewards. From the time of its
                    commencement in 1865 to the above date it has rendered the following noble

                    saving life in circumstances of unusual danger. It has also spent about £53,000
                    in the purchase and repair of its matériel. The receipts of the society show
                    that its work is appreciated. At 31st December 1880 the subscriptions and
                    donations together amounted to nearly £2600, and the legacies bequeathed toit
                    the same year were about £1000. The boats chiefly used are built on the model of
                    those of the English institution. The gun is preferred to the rocket in
                    connexion with the life-saving apparatus. In addition to its direct work of
                    saving life, the French society has accomplished much good indirectly by its
                    influence. It has been instrumental in bringing about this result that, among
                    the qualifications for a captain’s certificate in the French mercantile marine,
                    a thorough knowledge in detail of the means of saving life from shipwreck is
                    required. It has also laboured to extend the usefulness and reduce the cost of
                    the gun and rocket apparatus, besides securing that this apparatus, on Mr
                    Delvigne’s system, shall be supplied to every ship of the French navy.</p>

                    maintained by voluntary contributions, and has 21 local branches on the coast
                    and 27 in the interior, besides 149 agencies over the country. Previous to 1865
                    several private societies for saving life from shipwreck existed in the chief

                    association, the proceedings of which are reported in a paper entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">From Shore and Sea,</hi> published at Bremen once a quarter, and
                    largely modelled on the <hi rend="italic">Lifeboat Journal</hi> of the English
                    institution. The association provides the whole extent of the German coast with
                    life-saving apparatus. It has 74 lifeboat stations, 20 of which are provided
                    with the mortar or rocket apparatus. With these means it has, in the year
                    1880-81, saved 122 lives and 2 ships. The total number of human lives saved by
                    the association since its commencement is 1184. From May 1880 to May 1881 the
                    amount subscribed by its members was £57,000. As in America, the heavy
                    self-righting and self-emptying loats of England have been found unsuitable to
                    the thinly peopled and flat sandy beaches of Germany. Lighter and shallower
                    boats have therefore been adopted. These are iron-plated and not self-righting,
                    but almost impossible to capsize. The stations are visited at least once a year
                    by an inspector, and the whole system seems to be well regulated and thoroughly
                    efficient.</p>
                <p>In addition to the above, lifeboat societies or other lifeboat
                    organizations—formed more or less on the basis of the Nat'onal Lifeboat
                    Institution of Great Britain—are to be found in Ru <hi rend="superscript">
                    c</hi> sia, Italy, and Spain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Life-saving Hammocks,</hi> &amp;c.—Various forms of buoyant
                    mattresses, pillows, and india-rubber cloth life jackets and belts have been
                    contrived. Among these may be specially mentioned the air lifebelt of Admiral
                    Ward, which has four compartments, separately inflated, so that the puncture of
                    one does not quite destroy the belt. Admiral Ryder’s hammock also deserves
                    notice. Its virtue lies simply in a cork mattress, which, when rolled up in its
                    hammock, forms an efficient lifebuoy capable of supporting a man with his head
                    and shoulders well above water, and it enables three men to float in an upright
                    position. Cork mattresses are said to be cheaper and more comfortable than those
                    stuffed with hair. Two such hammocks lushed together, about 20 inches apart,
                    will enable two or three men to propel themselves easily through the water. The
                    advantage of having such mattresses in a ship is obvious, for every one on board
                    would be thus provided with a life-preserver.</p>
                <p>It has also been suggested that the cushions of deck and cabin seats should, in a
                    similar way, be made life-preservers, and that cabin furniture should be
                    constructed so as to form rafts in cases of emergency. It is well to know, on
                    the authority of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Magazine</hi> (vol. xx. p.
                    362), that even a hat tied in a pocket handkerchief and held with the crown
                    downwards may help to sustain a drowning man. It need scarcely be added that
                    empty water-casks, tightly bunged, with ropes arranged for clinging to, form
                    pretty good life-preservers. (R. Μ. B.)</p>
