                <p>I. LIGHTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION.</p>
                <p>THE primary and most important consideration relating to the design and
                    construction of a lighthouse tower which is to be built within the tide mark is
                    the force of the waves which may be expected to assail it, and the directions
                    and heights at which that force will act on the building. The great waves which
                    are found in the open ocean cannot be generated in smaller seas, and, with a due
                    regard to economy in construction, ought not therefore to be provided against.
                    What is wanted is to ascertain in such shorter seas the height of waves in
                    relation to the length of “fetch” in which they are generated, and next to
                    determine their energy when on reaching the shore or a sunken rock, and so
                    ceasing to be waves of oscillation, they enormously increase their destructive
                    force by becoming waves of translation. Full information as to these points and
                    as to the marine dynamometer—an instrument used for ascertaining the force of
                    the waves on an exposed surface—will be found in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Harbours,</hi> to which the reader is referred. It is enough
                    here to state that the law of increase in the height of waves was found by Mr T.
                    Stevenson to be proportional to the square root of the distance from the
                    windward shore, and that the greatest force recorded on rocks exposed to the
                    ocean was 31 tons per square foot. The relative forces of summer and winter
                    gales were found to be as 1 to 3, and the vertical force, after acting on a
                    curved sea wall, was eighty-four times greater than the horizontal force at a
                    height of 23 feet above high water.</p>
                <p>The history of the ancient lighthouses is of so scanty a nature that we may pass
                    at once to more modern works, commencing with Winstanley’s Eddystone light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Winstanley</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Eddystone Light.—</hi>
                    The Eddystone Rocks, which lie about 14 miles off Plymouth, are fully exposed to
                    the south-western seas. The lighthouse was completed by Winstanley in four
                    seasons. In 1698 it was finished nt a height of 80 feet and the light exhibited;
                    but in 1699, in consequence of damage by storms, the tower was increased by an
                    outer ring of masonry 4 feet thick, and made solid from the foundation to nearly
                    20 feet above the rock. The height was increased to nearly 120 feet, and
                    completed in 1700. During the well-known hurricane of 20th November 1703 the
                    tower was destroyed. In general design as well as in details this work must be
                    placed among the <hi rend="italic">vetanda</hi> of maritime engineering. For
                    example, in plan it was polygonal instead of circular. In his blind devotion to
                    ornamentation Winstanley violated throughout the principles of uniformity of
                    outer profile so as to present great obstructions to the action of the
                    waves.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0635-0616"/> in 1706 and completed in 1709, in the form of a
                    frustum of a cone 92 feet high. The work consisted principally of timber, the
                    lower part being oak carefully bolted together, and also to the rock. Above the
                    lower structure of oak courses of stone, cramped together and fixed to the
                    timber work and to the rock, were added in order to give weight to the
                    structure. This lighthouse stood for forty-six years, and was destroyed by fire
                    in 1755. In every respect the simplicity of the structure and the judicious
                    character of the details of the design may be regarded as models of engineering.
                    First, it rested upon a stepped level base, was circular in plan, did not wholly
                    depend upon fixtures but upon weight, preserved a uniform external surface
                    devoid of outside projections and ornamentation; and, above all, the engineer
                    did not by splaying out the base needlessly throw away the small diameter which
                    the rock afforded, but with much judgment adopted the conical form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Smeaton</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Eddystone Tower.—</hi> This
                    justly celebrated work, which consisted entirely of stone, was commenced in
                    1756, and the masonry was finished in 1759. Smeaton was the first engineer who
                    adopted a structure of masonry for a sea tower and dovetailed joints for the
                    stones, which averaged a ton in weight. This work cannot be regarded as a safe
                    model for general imitation in exposed situations, and Rudyetd’s earlier tower
                    was certainly as successful in resisting the forces to which it was exposed.
                    Rudyerd unquestionably selected for so small a rock as the Eddystone a
                    preferable form to that adopted by Smeaton. The sharply curved profile in
                    Smeaton’s design greatly reduced the diameter of the building at a small height
                    above the rock, and so reduced its strength.</p>
                <p>Smeaton’s reasoning about the similarity of a tower exposed to the surf and an
                    oak tree resisting the wind was very conclusively shown to be fallacious by the
                    late Mr Alan Stevenson. The arching of the floors, as shown in fig. 1, was also
                    a source of weakness which the introduction of the iron chains, shown black in
                    the diagram, was intended to counteract. Mr Douglass in 1878 stated that “for
                    several years the safety of the Eddystone had been a matter of anxiety and
                    watchful care to the corporation of the Trinity House, owing to the great tremor
                    of the building with each wave stroke.” He also stated that the projecting
                    cornice at the top had been lifted, and that the rock itself had been
                    considerably undermined. A new tower has now (1882) been erected in place of
                    Smeaton’s by Mr Douglass.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bell Rock Lighthouse Tower.—</hi> The Bell Rock, which lies 12
                    miles off the coast of Forfarshire, is fully exposed to the assaults of the
                    German Ocean. The rock is of considerable extent but of a low level, the tower
                    being covered about 16 feet at high water of spring tides. Mr R. Stevenson, of
                    Edinburgh, when he first landed on the rock, decided to adopt a stone tower as
                    Smeaton had done at the Eddystone, but he deviated largely from that design in
                    the thickness of the walls, in raising the tower to 100 feet instead of 68 feet,
                    and the level of the solid to 21 feet above high water instead of 11 feet.
                    Instead of employing arched floors as at the Eddystone, he adopted lintel stones
                    for the floors which formed part of the outward walls, and were feathered and
                    grooved as in carpentry, besides having dovetailed joggles across the joints
                    where they formed part of the walls. It will be seen on fig. 2 that the floors
                    instead of being sources of weakness, as in Smeaton’s tower, were converted into
                    effective bonds tying the walls together. He also used a temporary beacon or
                    barrack on the rock for the engineer and his workmen to live in while the tower
                    was in progress. The bill intro-dueed into parliament for this work in 1802 was
                    not passed in consequence of financial difficulties. As the Bell Rock was
                    scarcely dry at low water, while the Eddystone was scarcely covered at high
                    water, the commissioners, in order to fortify Mr Stevenson’s views, consulted Mr
                    Telford, and before going to parliament for the second time they also, on Mr
                    Stevenson’s suggestion, obtained for the scheme the support of Mr Rennie, with
                    whom he could afterwards advise in case of emergency during the progress of the
                    work. The second bill was passed in 1806, and the works, which were begun in
                    1807, were finished in 1810, and the light was exhibited in 1811. The total
                    weight of the tower is 2076 tons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Skerryvore Lighthouse.—</hi> The Skerry vore Rocks, 12 miles
                    off the island of Tyree in Argyllshire, which is the nearest land, are wholly
                    open to the Atlantic. The works, designed and carried out by the late Mr Alan
                    Stevenson, were commenced in 1838 and finished in 1843. The first temporary
                    barrack was destroyed in 1838, and another erected on a more sheltered part of
                    the rock. The tower, which is of a hyperbolic curve, is 138 feet high, 42
                    diameter at the base, and 16 at the top. Its weight is 4308 tons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bishop Rock.—</hi> The Bishop Rock, lying off the Scilly
                    Islands, is fully exposed to the Atlantic. It was designed by the late Mr James
                    Walker, and carried out by Afr J. N. Douglass. It is 100 feet above high water,
                    34 feet in diameter at the base, and 17 at top. The lowest part of the
                    foundation of tower is covered about 19 feet at high water springs; the solid is
                    20 feet above high water, where the walls are 9 feet thick, and decrease to 2
                    feet at the top. Owing to the great tremor in this building, it has lately been
                    found necessary to strengthen it by an internal structure of ironwork.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wolf Rock.—</hi> This much exposed rock is about midway between
                    Scilly and the Lizard Point, and is submerged to the depth of about 2 feet at
                    high water. The first design for a lighthouse was in 1823, by Mr R. Stevenson,
                    but it was not till 1862 that a lighthouse was commenced under the
                    superintendence of Mr Douglass, from a design by the late Mr Walker. It is 116∣
                    feet high, 41 feet 8 inches diameter at the base, decreasing to 17 at the top,
                    and the walls are 7 feet 9∣ inches thick, decreasing to 2 feet 3 inches. The
                    shaft is a concave elliptic frustum, and contains 3296 tons. The lower part of
                    the tower has projecting scarcements in order to break up the sea, but, as has
                    been already stated in the case of the Eddystone, such projections are not in
                    accordance with the principle of uniformity of external surface, and are,
                    therefore, more likely to produce disturbance of the masonry than to add to its
                    stability.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dhu Heartach Rock Lighthouse.—</hi> The Dhu Heartach Rock,
                    which is 35 feet above high water, is 14 miles from the island of Mull, which is
                    the nearest shore. The maximum diameter of the tower, which is of parabolic
                    outline, is 36 feet, decreasing to 16 feet; the shaft is solid for 32 feet above
                    the rock; the masonry weighs 3115 tons, of which 1810 are contained in the solid
                    part. The temporary barrack for the workmen was made of malleable iron bars with
                    an iron drum on the top in which the workmen lived. This tower was designed by
                    Messrs D. &amp; T. Stevenson, and occupied six years in erection, the length of
                    the working season being only about two and a half months in each year.</p>

                    height, weighing 2050 tons, the whole weight of the tower being 3557 tons. The
                    walls decrease from 9 feet 3 inches to 2 feet 3 inches in thickness. The work
                    was designed by Messrs D. &amp; T. Stevenson, and was begun in 1869 and
                    completed in 1874.</p>

                    The tower has a cylindrical base 32 feet in diameter, above which is a tower 67
                    feet 5 inches high and 23 feet in diameter. The walls vary in thickness from 5
                    feet to 2 feet. The tower, including the base, contains about 2768 tons, and the
                    work was finished in three years.</p>
                <p>There are several other lighthouses in Ireland, India, and America which merit
                    more attention than our space admits of, and we shall therefore conclude with
                    directing the attention of the engineer to the important influence of the
                    configuration of rocks in modifying the breaking of waves. It cannot but excite
                    surprise that some of the structures which were erected on the Eddystone should
                    have withstood the waves so long as they did. This fact seems to lead to the
                    conclusion that the Eddystone Rock, at one time at least, acted to some extent
                    as a shelter to the structures which were built on it During a summer gale when
                    Dhu Heartach lighthouse was being erected fourteen stones each of 2 tons weight,
                    which had been fixed on the tower by joggles and Portland cement at the level of
                    37 feet above high water, were torn out and swept off into deep water, as shown
                    on Plate VII. At the Bell Rock stones of 2 tons weight were several times swept
                    away during the construction of the tower, while it is a remarkable fact that no
                    stones were ever moved at the Eddystone. But what is more striking, the thin
                    glass panes of Winstanley’s first tower stood successfully through a whole
                    winter’s storms at the same level above the water as that at which the fourteen
                    heavy blocks were swept away at Dhu Heartach, where it was found necessary from
                    the experience acquired when constructing the lighthouse to raise the solid base
                    of the tower to nearly the same height above the water as the glass panes in
                    Smeaton’s tower, which have hardly ever been broken during the storms of more
                    than a hundred years.</p>
                <p>The conclusion then which seems fairly deducible from these facts is that the
                    level of the plane of dangerous impact of the waves above high water depends
                    upon the relation subsisting between their height and the configuration of the
                    rocks above and below high water, as well as perhaps on the configuration of the
                    bottom of the sea near the lighthouse. Thus, while the rock at Dhu Heartach,
                    from its height above high water, forms a great protection against the smaller
                    class of waves, it operates as a dangerous conductor to the largest waves,
                    enabling them to exert a powerful horizontal force at a much higher level than
                    they would had the rock been lower. The lighthouse engineer must therefore
                    beware of taking it for granted that Smeaton’s Eddystone tower is a model for
                    general imitation, and must carefully consider as best he can in what way the
                    configuration of the rock may affect the stability of the tower which he has to
                    design. Unfortunately in the present state of our information no specific
                    directions can be laid down for his guidance iu this matter, but the following
                    general rules of construction may be given :—</p>
                <p>(1) The tower should have a low centre of gravity, and sufficient mass to prevent
                    its being upset by the waves. (2) It should be throughout circular in the
                    horizontal plane, and either straight or continuously curved in the vertical
                    plane, so as to present no abrupt change of outline which would check the free
                    ascent of the rising waves, or the free descent of the falling waves, or the
                    free vent of those passing round the tower. All external scarcements in the
                    vertical plane, or polygonal outline in the horizontal plane, are therefore
                    objectionable. (3) Its height, <hi rend="italic">caetcris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paribus,</hi> should be determined by the distance at which the light requires
                    to be seen by the sailor. The rule for determining this height will be
                    afterwards given. (4) Where the rock is soft, or consists of ledges which are
                    easily torn up, the tower should spring from the foundation-course at a low
                    angle with the surface of the rock, so as to prevent its being broken up by
                    reaction of the waves from the building; or, in other words, the tower must have
                    a curved profile. But special care should be taken to sink the
                    foundation-courses below the surface of the rock, as the superincumbent weight
                    decreases with the sine of the angle of inclination of the wall. If the rock
                    overhangs, owing to the wearing action of the waves, the tower should, if
                    possible, be built at a distance from the place where this dangerous action is
                    in progress. (5) Where the rock is hard and of ample area, the tower may be of
                    such a curved form as will best suit the economic arrangement of the materials,
                    so as to avoid an unnecessary thickness of the upper walls. (6) When the rock is
                    hard, but of small dimensions, the diameter above the base should not be
                    suddenly reduced by adopting a curved profile, but a conical outline should be
                    adopted; and if the rock be hard, but of yet smaller dimensions, a cylindric
                    form of greater height should be adopted so as to thicken the walls, and to
                    increase the weight and therefore increase the friction, which is directly
                    proportional to the weight of the blocks of masonry. In all cases where the rock
                    is small the thickness of the walls should be decreased by steps or scarcements
                    <hi rend="italic">internally,</hi> but never <hi rend="italic">externally.</hi>
                    (7) The level of the top of the solid part of the tower, and the thickness of
                    the walls above it, should, in different towers having the same exposure, be
                    deteπnined in each case by the level and configuration of the rock and of the
                    bottom of the sea. (8) The best position for the tower is not necessarily the
                    highest part of the rock. It should, in each case, be selected so as to secure
                    the greatest protection in the direction of the maximum fetch and deepest water
                    near the reef. (9) The tower should not, if possible, be erected across any
                    chasm which divides the rock, or in the direction of any gully which projects
                    into it, especially if it be of converging form, which would concentrate wave
                    action. (10) No permanent fixture of the tower to the rock is required for
                    increasing the.stability of the structure. The foundation-course (unless where a
                    curved profile is adopted) becomes, indeed, in the end the most stable of all,
                    because it has the greatest weight above it, to keep it in its place. (11) The
                    stones should, however, be sufficiently connected together, and fixed to the
                    rock, in order to prevent their being washed away during the construction of the
                    work, when they have no superincumbent weight to keep them in their beds. (12)
                    The tower should rest on a truly level base, or on level steps cut in the rock.
                    (13) The pressure of all the materials within the tower should act vertically,
                    so as not to produce a resolved force acting laterally as an outward thrust.
                    (14) The tower should be of such height and diameter, with walls of such
                    thickness, as to prevent the masonry being disturbed by the impact of the waves.
                    (15) The entrance door should be placed on that side of the tower where the
                    length of fetch is shortest, or where from the configuration of the reef and the
                    depth of water the force of the waves is least. This was determined at the Bell
                    Rock by the distribution of the <hi rend="italic">fucus</hi> which grew on the
                    lower parts of the tower during the first winter, the vegetation being least
                    where the waves were heaviest. (16) The materials should be of the highest
                    specific gravity that can be readily obtained, and, in some special cases, lead,
                    or dove-tailed blocks of cast iron set in cement, might perhaps be employed.</p>

                <p>II. LIGHTHOUSE ILLUMINATION.</p>
                <p>What is required of every lighthouse apparatus is either the equal distribution
                    of the rays constantly or periodically over the whole horizon, or else their
                    unequal distribution over certain azimuths only.</p>
                <p>The first of these two cases, viz., the equal distribution of the light, will be
                    best understood by explaining the different manner in which the rays are
                    operated on by the apparatus for a fixed light and by that for a revolving
                    light. The characteristic of a <hi rend="italic">fixed</hi> light, which is that
                    of being seen constantly and always of the same power round the whole horizon,
                    might no doubt be perfectly produced by a naked flame without any apparatus, but
                    then all the rays which did not fall on the navigable track of shipping would be
                    lost to the sailor. In order then to intercept and utilize those rays which,
                    instead of falling on this navigable track, would either go upwards to the sky
                    or downwards on the shore close to the lighthouse tower, and on that part of the
                    sea which is very near the shore, we must have recourse to optical agents both
                    for bending down the rays which naturally point too high, and for bending up
                    those which point too low. It thus appears that the apparatus for a fixed light
                    should bend the rays in the vertical plane only, but should not interfere with
                    their natural horizontal divergence in azimuth.</p>
                <p>The demands which are made on a light that has to <hi rend="italic">revolve</hi>
                    are not nearly so great as on one that is fixed, for the revolving light does
                    not, like the fixed, require to illuminate the whole horizon simultaneously, but
                    only each point of it at successive intervals of time. When the dark intervals
                    occur, the rays from the flame which are then pointing in the direction of the
                    dark spaces should therefore have their directions so altered laterally as to
                    pass into the adjoining light spaces and thus to increase the power of the
                    luminous flashes. A revolving light, though supplied by a flame of the same
                    power as a fixed, will thus necessarily be far more intense, as it does not lose
                    its power by diffusing the rays constantly over the whole horizon, but gathers
                    them up into a number of separate bundles or beams of great intensity. The
                    apparatus of a revolving light has consequently more optical work to do than
                    that of a fixed, for the rays must be bent not only in the vertical plane but
                    laterally in the horizontal and in all intermediate planes as well.</p>
                <p>In the construction of lighthouse apparatus either metallic or glass agents may
                    be employed, but it has been found by experiments that a great saving of light
                    (about 25 per cent.) is effected when glass only is used. All kinds of apparatus
                    may conveniently be ranged either under the <hi rend="italic">catoptric
                    system,</hi> where metallic reflexion only is used, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dioptric</hi> where the material employed is wholly glass producing refraction
                    and total reflexion, or the <hi rend="italic">catadioptric,</hi> in which both
                    glass and metal are employed.</p>

                <p>Passing over the early and rude expedients of such night marks as open coal fires
                    or naked candles placed in glazed lanterns, we shall confine our attention to
                    the gradual development of those optical designs which are now or werelately
                    adopted for lighthouse apparatus.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parabolic Reflectors.—</hi> In 1763, or at latest before 1777,
                    parabolic reflectors were first used for lighthouse illumination by Mr
                    Hutchinson, dockmaster of Liverpool. In his work on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Practica»</hi><hi rend="italic">Seamanship,</hi> published in 1777, he states
                    that the Mersey lights were fitted with reflectors (figs. 5 and 6) formed of
                    small facets of silvered <pb break="no"

                    >“as</hi> nearly as they can be to the parabolic curve.” This is unquestionably
                    the earliest published notice of the use of parabolic reflectors for lighthouse
                    illumination. Up to 1782 the wicks of the lamps were of a flat form, but in that
                    year Argand introduced wicks and burners of a hollow cylindric form u¾ich
                    admitted a central current of air through the burner so as to ignite the cone of
                    gas issuing from the wick both within and without. Rumford afterwards split up
                    the cone of gas into several concentric shells.</p>
                <p>“It is remarkable,” says Mr J. T. Chance in his excellent memoir <hi
                    rend="italic">{Miιι. Ins. Civil Eng.,</hi> vol. xxvi.), “how many inventors have
                    contributed their respective parts to the multiple burner: — Argand, the double
                    current; Lange, the indispensable contraction of the glass chimney; Carcel, the
                    mechanism for an abundant supply of oil; and Count Rumford, the multiple burner,
                    an idea made feasible by these contrivances, and finally realized by Arago and
                    Augustin Fresnel.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Optical Properties of the Parabolic Reflector.—</hi> In the
                    parabolic reflector all rays diverging strictly from the focus and falling on
                    the paraboloid emerge in one beam of parallel rays. But as an oil light is not a
                    mathematical point, but an object of considerable magnitude, the rays from the
                    outside of the flame being exfocal will, after reflexion, emerge as a cone whose
                    divergence is directly proportional to the radius of the flame and inversely to
                    the focal distance of the reflector. Its intensity must consequently vary as the
                    squares of the distances from the lighthouse. Optical apparatus does not then
                    prevent that divergence which is due to the flame being of sensible
                    magnitude.</p>

                    that the parabolic mirror <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is at best but a very
                    imperfect instrument, for even if the radiant were strictly a mathematical
                    point, the cone of rays (shown undotted) escaping past the lips of the mirror
                    must be lost <hi rend="italic">Mode of Employing Reflectors for Fixed and
                    Revolving Lights.—</hi> In order to produce, on the catoptric system, a fixed
                    light showing all round the circle, a number of reflectors (o, <hi rend="italic"
                    >o, o,</hi> fig. 8) are fixed round the outside of a stationary chandelier <hi
                    rend="italic">n.</hi> As the ordinary paraboloid has about 14° of divergence,
                    twenty-five reflectors were needed to light up continuously (though not equally)
                    the whole horizon. If again the light was to revolve, then a revolving
                    chandelier (figs. 9 and 10) was employed having a certain number of flat faces,
                    on each of which was fixed a number of separate lamps and reflectors with their
                    axes parallel to each other. When the chandelier revolved, and one of the flat
                    sides was turned towards the sailor, he would, when at some, distance from the
                    shore, receive a flash at once from each of the mirrors which were on that face,
                    but when the face was turned away from him a dark period would intervene until
                    the next face came round again.</p>

                    whole horizon, which could not possibly be done with separate reflectors, Marcet
                    proposed this ingenious instrument, which is generated by the revolution of the
                    parabolic profile <hi rend="italic">pp'</hi> (fig. 11) round its parameter as a
                    vertical axis, instead of round a horizontal axis, as in all former reflectors.
                    The vertices of the parabola are cut off, so as to permit of a common focus for
                    thθ flame. The rays will therefore be reflected parallel to the horizontal axis
                    in the vertical plane, while the natural divergence of the light in azimuth will
                    not be interfered with. By this excellent contrivance the light was for the
                    first time spread equally round the horizon in one continuous zone. But even
                    though the radiants were reduced to a mathematical point, very many of the rays
                    (shown in hard lines in the elevation, fig. 11) are allowed to escape past the
                    lips of the reflector, and this loss takes place all round the circle.</p>
                <p>Beginning in 1822, Augustin Fresnel, the eminent physicist and mathematician,
                    entirely revolutionized the previously existing lighthouse system by means of
                    his annular lenses, cylindric refractors, and totally reflecting prisms. Before
                    describing these and their combinations it is necessary to state that the size
                    of the flame produces divergence with lenses as well as with reflectors. The
                    measure of this divergence for any point of the lens is the angle whose sine

                    suggested a new form of lens for burning purposes in order to save the loss of
                    heat by absorption of the sun’s rays in passing through a thick lens of large
                    size whose outer profile is continuously spherical. He proposed to grind out of
                    a solid piece of glass a lens in steps or concentric zones in order to reduce
                    the thickness to a minimum (figs. 12 and 13). Condorcet, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Éloge</hi><hi rend="italic">de Buffon,</hi> in 1773 (Paris
                    edition, 1804, p. 35) proposed the capital improvement of building up Buffon’s
                    stepped lens in separate rings, and pointed out that the cutting of the surface
                    into steps had the effect of correcting to a large extent the spherical
                    aberration, or divergence from the parallel, of the rays emitted by any
                    continuously spherical lens. Sir D. Brewster, in</p>
                <p>1811, also described the same plan. But both these writers designed their lenses
                    for burning purposes only, and not for operating on light, while all the
                    surfaces of their lenses were spherical. In 1822 Fresnel constructed a built-up
                    lens for lighthouse purposes, in which the centres of curvature of the different
                    rings receded from the axis according to their distance from the centre, so as
                    practically to eliminate spherical aberration, the only spherical surface left
                    being the small central part <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (fig. 13). These lenses
                    are used for revolving lights only.</p>

                    Fresnel for effecting dioptrically by refraction in front of the flame what had

                    the flame. It consisted of a zone or hoop of glass (figs.</p>
                <p>14 and 15) generated by the revolution round a vertical axis of the middle
                    section of the annular lens just described, which lens, on the other hand, being
                    generated by the same profile round a horizontal axis, parallelized the rays in
                    every plane, whereas the cylindric refractor does so in the vertical plane

                    admirable improvement of employing the principle of “total” or internal
                    reflexion by glass prisms. The ray Fi (fig. 16) falling on a prismoidal ring,
                    ABC, is refracted and bent in the direction ι'R, and falling on the side AC, at
                    an angle of incidence greater than the critical, is totally reflected in the
                    direction Re, and, impinging on the side BC at e, it undergoes a second
                    refraction, and emerges horizontally. The highest ray FA after refraction by AB

                    prism which refracts the rays that fall on it, but in one plane only, requires
                    no further explanation, as it is simply a straight prism of the same horizontal
                    cross section as one of the prisms of his cylindric refractor, so as when placed
                    in front of his fixed apparatus to produce a beam of parallel rays like a
                    lens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Great Central Lamp.—</hi> We will now go on to describe the
                    manner in which Fresnel utilized the four new optical agents which he
                    originated, by first referring to his central burner system. In all lighthouses
                    prior to 1822 the mode of getting up the required power was by employing a
                    sufficient number of separate reflectors, each of which (unless we except
                    Bordier Marcet’s mirror) required its own separate lamp. Instead of numerous
                    independent lamps and reflectors, Fresnel used a single lamp which had four
                    concentric wicks, and was fed with oil by a pump worked by clock work.
                    Surrounding this burner was a stationary cylindric refractor for a fixed light,
                    and annular lenses "evolving outside of it for a ’•evolving light.</p>

                    in which a central burner is used, consists of a dioptric cylindric refractor
                    with zones of silvered mirror above and below similar in profile to Bordier
                    Marcet’s reflector. By the adoption of the refractor the whole of the wasteful
                    divergence which occurs in Marcet’s reflector is prevented. We have here a
                    geometrically perfect combination, but it is not so physically, because metallic
                    reflexion is used. This physical defect Fresnel obviated in his next design.</p>

                    distributed the whole light equally over the horizon by means of dioptric agents
                    alone. This was the first application of total reflexion to lighthouse
                    apparatus, and this beautiful instrument continues till now in universal use.

                    mirrors Μ. The inclined lenses fit closely to each other and form a pyramidal
                    dome, and the light, intercepted by them, is sent upwards in inclined beams
                    until, falling upon the plane mirrors M, it is sent outwards in horizontal
                    parallelized beams. All these optical agents are made to revolve round the
                    central lamp, and the sailor receives a full flash when the axis of one of the
                    emerging beams passes his eye, and as soon as it passes him he is in darkness
                    until the next beam comes round. This design, unlike that of his fixed light, is
                    imperfect on account of the employment of metallic reflexion, and because two
                    agents are employedfor all except the central portion of the rays.</p>

                <p>Mr Stevenson was the first to introduce the dioptric system into Britain, and in
                    doing so he made the following improvements.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Refractor of a Truly Cylindrical Form.—</hi> Owing to
                    difficulties in construction, Fresnel adopted a polygonal instead of a cylindric
                    form for his refractor, but Mr Stevenson succeeded in getting Messrs Cookson of
                    Newcastle to construct a first order refractor of a truly cylindric form.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Helical Glass Joints for Fixed Lights.—</hi> Mr Stevenson
                    further improved the apparatus by constructing the refractor in rhomboidal
                    instead of rectangular pieces (figs. 24 and 25), thus producing helical joints
                    and preventing serious obscuration of the light in any azimuth.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Helical Metallic Framings.—</hi> The internal metallic frame
                    work for supporting the upper cupola of prisms was also, for the same reason,
                    made by him of a helical form.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Diagonal Framed Lantern.—</hi> The astragals or sash bars of
                    the lantern were likewise made diagonal and constructed of bronze instead of
                    iron in order to reduce their sectional area. A.small harbour light with
                    inclined astragals was made in 1836 by Mr E. Sang. Mr Stevenson also prepared a
                    design in 1846 for Start Point, Orkney, in which he extended the helical
                    arrangement to the astragals, but it was never carried out. Mr Douglass
                    independently designed and afterwards carried into practice this form of
                    lantern.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alan Stevenson's Improved Revolving Light for Skerryvore.—</hi>
                    In 1835 Mr Stevenson, in a report to the Northern Lighthouse Board, proposed to
                    add fixed reflecting prisms <hi rend="italic">p</hi> (fig. 26) below the lenses
                    of Fresnel s revolving light, and he communicated this proposal to Μ. I*.

                    combination added, however, but little to the power of the flash, and produced
                    both a periodically flashing and constantly fixed light; but it must be
                    remembered that the prism for fixed lights was the only kind of reflecting prism
                    then known. The combination of trapezoidal lenses and mirrors was also, for the
                    same reason, still used. The prisms for Skerryvore were the first that were made
                    of the large size (first order), and were constructed by Μ. Soleil at Paris
                    under the superintendence of Leonor Fresnel, the successor of his brother
                    Augustin, then deceased.</p>
                <p>Besides the designs which have been described for improving Fresnel’s revolving
                    light, there were many others, among which may be mentioned those of Leonor
                    Fresnel, Sir David Brewster,W. H. Barlow, F.R.S., A. Gordon, Lepaute,
                    Letourneau, Reyιιaud, and Tabouret; but in all these, as well as in those which
                    have been described, the rays were either not parallelized in every plane or
                    else unnecessary agents were resorted to for that purpose.</p>

                <p>It was not till 1849-50 that the problem was first solved of condensing the whole
                    sphere of rays diverging from a flame into a single beam of parallel rays
                    without any unnecessary reflexions or refractions.</p>

                    anterior hemisphere of rays is intercepted and at once υarallelized by the lens
                    L, whose principal focus (i.e., for parallel rays) is in the centre of the
                    flame, while the remainder is intercepted and made parallel by the paraboloid
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and thus the double agents in Fresnel’s design are
                    dispensed with. The rays of the posterior hemisphere are reflected by the

                    passing onwards one portion of them falls on the lens and the rest on the
                    paraboloid, so as finally to emerge in union with and parallel to the front
                    rays. This was the first instrument which intercepted and parallelized all the
                    rays proceeding from a focal point by the minimum number of agents. It is
                    therefore geometrically perfect, and was ca∏ed by Mr Stevenson a holophote, but
                    it is not physically so, for it employs metallic reflexion, and with an ordinary
                    oil flame and burner some of the rays reflected by the spherical mirror would
                    fall upon the burner and be lost. This instrument was first employed at the
                    North Harbour of Peterhead in 1849.</p>

                    reflexion into one beam of parallel rays. Next, if there be placed behind the

                    revolution of the cross section of the double reflecting prisms round a

                    for this dome is a perfect mirror, not only for the faint light that is
                    superficially reflected by the first concave surface, but also for the main
                    portion of the rays which enter the substance of the glass and are there totally
                    reflected. Thus the whole light is parallelized entirely by glass agents. This

                    flashes will be produced (fig. 33), which is therefore geometrically and
                    physically perfect, and the double agents used in Fresnel’s revolving light are
                    thus wholly dispensed with. Mr J. T. Chance says, “on the whole the modern plan
                    (holophotal) must give light five or six times more intense than that of the

                    is not a geometric one, and would be non-existent were the luminant a
                    mathematical point. In order to remedy this objection, Mr T. Stevenson and Mr
                    Brebner designed what they termed “back” prisms capable of deviating the rays
                    through an angle of 130 , so that the engineer becomes virtually independent of
                    the critical angle. Professor Swan of St Andrews also independently proposed the
                    same kind of prism, accompanied by general formulae for its construction. The

                    mirror which was made and was shown in the exhibition of 1862 by the
                    Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses, for whom it was constructed, in order to
                    further the realizing of what Mr T. Stevenson had ingeniously suggested about
                    twelve vears previously. During the progress of this instrument the idea
                    occurred to the author of separating the zones (fig. 37) and also dividing them
                    into segments like the ordinary reflecting zones of a dioptric light; by this
                    means it became practicable to increase considerably the radius of the mirror
                    and thereby to render it applicable to the largest sea light without
                    overstepping the limits of the angular breadths of the zones, and yet without
                    being compelled to resort to glass of high refractive power.”</p>
                <p>Mr Stevenson states (JZin. <hi rend="italic">Civ. Eng.,</hi> vol. xxvi.) that he
                    originally intended to generate the prisms round a vertical axis, but adopted
                    the horizontal as more practicable where flint glass which was taken out of the
                    melting pot on the end of a rod had to be employed for the most important and
                    smaller central parts of the apparatus, which at that date were the only ones
                    that could be constructed.</p>

                    for cones of light of 30° in front and of 65° at the back are lost through the

                <p>Previous to 1850 all apparatus was designed to emit light of equal power in every
                    azimuth either constantly or periodically, so that when applied to illuminate
                    seas extending farther in some directions than in others, such, for example, as
                    long narrow sounds, the power was either needlessly great in some azimuths or
                    not nearly strong enough in others. The only exception was where a tower was
                    placed on a long straight coast, when a spherical mirror was fixed behind the
                    flame to prevent the light passing landward. The light that would have been lost
                    on the land was, in this way, sent seawards, but no attempt was ever made to
                    condense the light over a given arc or to allocate this auxiliary light in
                    proportion to the varying lengths of the different ranges and the amplitudes of
                    the arcs over which it had to be seen, nor, where a light had to show all round
                    the horizon, to weaken its intensity in one arc and with the rays so abstracted
                    to strengthen some other arc which from its range being longer ought to be of
                    greater power. As the optical agents which we have described were insufficient
                    for this purpose, it became necessary to devise new agents possessing special
                    optical properties for distributing the rays not equally, but equitably. Some of
                    the more important of these agents and their combinations will be described, but
                    before doing so it is necessary to make some preliminary explanations.</p>
                <p>The form of the emergent light from condensing apparatus is neither a solid beam
                    of parallel rays like that from an annular lens nor yet a zone of rays diverging
                    naturally in azimuth all round like that from an ordinary fixed apparatus, but
                    is intermediate between these, being a solid angle or wedge of light
                    strengthened by those rays which would naturally diverge in other directions,
                    but which are diverted and spread over the given sector as shown perspectively

                    number of degrees and the squares of the distances from which the light has to
                    be seen in each arc; and the light thus diverted from one arc to strengthen
                    another must be spread uniformly over the one that has to be strengthened. By
                    this mode of abstraction and addition there is produced a constant equitable

                    when Mr R. Stevenson proposed for the navigation of the river Forth that red
                    buoys should be taken on the starboard and black on the port side in going up
                    the river. This system has since been adopted generally in the United Kingdom.
                    In 1857 Admiral E. J. Bedford suggested a uniform system for all the coasts of
                    the country, which was carried out in Scotland by Mr A. Cuningham. A different
                    uniform system has been adopted in England by the Trinity House. In 1859 Mr J.
                    F. Campbell suggested what is undoubtedly the best system, that a buoy shall
                    indicate by its shape and colour the compass direction in which a vessel should
                    sail after seeing the buoy.</p>

                    pressure of the flowing tide, when descending with the fall of the ebb tide and

                    principle of the double air current introduced two, three, andfour concentric
                    wick burners, Mr AlanStevenson the five, and Mr Douglass the six wick burner.
                    These burners are suitable for the consumption of animal and vegetable oils,
                    which were in use in the various lighthouse services of the world till within
                    the last few years. These oils are, however, supersede, I by hydrocarbons, which
                    at one half the cost give an increased luminous intensity for an equal
                    consumption, but they require a larger supply of air for their combustion, and
                    consequently an improved form of burner. Μ.</p>
                <p>Maris in 1856 devised a single-wick burner for this purpose which gave good
                    results, but many and all attempts to construct a multiple-wick mineral oil
                    burner failed till 1868, when Captain Doty’s form was devised. By a happy choice
                    of proportions in the various parts of his burner (fig. 64), and by the addition
                    of an exterior cylinder surrounding the outer wick, and a central disk, both
                    placed in such a manner as to throw a current of air into the flame at the right
                    place, Captain Doty succeeded in producing single and multiple-wick hydrocarbon
                    burners, which carry a flame of great luminous intensity and regularity. The

                <p>Single-wick burners are supplied with oil from the cistern by the capillary

                <p><hi rend="italic">Coal-Gas.—</hi> Coal-gas was first used as a lighthouse
                    illuminant at Salvore, near Trieste, in 1817. For many years it has been used in
                    the harbour lights of Great Britain when in the neighbourhood of gas-works. Mr
                    J. R. Wigham has designed a compound or crocus burner consisting of a group of
                    twenty-eight vertical tubes, each carrying an ordinary double fish-tail burner,
                    and the ignited gases issuing from all these jets unite into one large flame.
                    Additional groups of twenty jets each can readily be arranged around the first,
                    which forms a central nucleus, and in this way, depending on the state of the
                    atmosphere, the power of the burner can be made at will 28, 48, 68, 88, or 108
                    jets. Fig. 65 shows the arrangement for 28 jets, and fig. 66 one for 108 jets.
                    In his triform or quadriform systems Mr Wigham places two, three, or four of the
                    burners already described vertically one above the other (fig. 67), with lenses
                    opposite to each. The following table gives the candle powers, &amp;c., of Mr
                    Wigham’s burners.</p>

                    Professor Holmes made the first magneto-electric machine for lighthouses, which
                    was tried by the Trinity House in 1857, and the electric light was first shown
                    to the mariner in 1858. The Trinity House subsequently introduced it at
                    Dungeness in 1862 and at Souter Point in 1871. The optical apparatus for these
                    lights was designed by Mr J. T. Chance. In 1869 Holmes constructed for the
                    Trinity House a dynamo-electric machine (in which no permanent magnet is used),
                    giving a light of about 2800 candles. The magneto-electric light of Holmes as
                    exhibited from a third order dioptric apparatus at the South Foreland light has
                    been estimated at 152,000 candles, or twenty times that of the old first order
                    dioptric fixed white light. The following table shows the results which have
                    been obtained by Dr Tyndall and Mr Douglass by the magneto-electric and
                    dynamoelectric machines, tried at the South Foreland, 1876-77:</p>

                    during those periods of time at which it is advertised to the mariner as being
                    visible; (2) it shall be seen as far as possible in a thick and hazy atmosphere;
                    (3) it shall constantly maintain the distinctive character of the station where
                    it is employed so as not to be mistaken for another light; and (4), when
                    revolving, its flashes shall remain long enough in view to let the sailor take
                    the compass bearing of the light. The electric light practically fulfils all
                    these conditions, and, when we consider its transcendent intensity, and the
                    smallness of the luminous radiant which enables the engineer to adapt it to any
                    required conditions far more strictly than oil light, we may certainly conclude
                    that the electric is the best though the most costly of all illuminants.</p>
                <p>The only question which has not yet been decided is whether an electric light of
                    equal initial power will penetrate a hazy atmosphere as far as an oil light.
                    Experiments made at Edinburgh in 1866 seemed to show that the highly distinctive
                    flash of the electric light when acted on by optical apparatus is perhaps not so
                    much due to a greater amount of light as to the more complete parallelism of the
                    rays arising from the smallness of the radiant. The apparatus of a small size
                    which was first used both in England and France necessarily produced a wasteful
                    vertical divergence, and has therefore been now justly discarded.</p>

                <p>The most important characteristic distinctions of lights are the following—(1)
                    The∕aκd <hi rend="italic">light.</hi> Two of these are sometimes shown at
                    different heights from the same tower. (2) The <hi rend="italic">revolving
                    light,</hi> which at equal and comparatively long periods comes slowly and
                    gradually into full power, and then as gradually disappears. (3) The <hi
                    rend="italic">flashing light,</hi> which at short periods (such as a few
                    seconds) comes very quickly, though gradually, into full power, and as quickly
                    and gradually fades away, was first introduced by the late Mr Robert Stevenson
                    in 1825. (4) The <hi rend="italic">coloured light,</hi> which is obtained by
                    using coloured media, and was first employed by Mills of Bridlington. (5) The
                    <hi rend="italic">intermittent light,</hi> introduced by the late Mr R.
                    Stevenson in 1830, which bursts instantaneously into full power, and after
                    remaining as a fixed light for a certain length of time is as suddenly eclipsed
                    and succeeded by a dark period. When the periods are very short the intermittent
                    is now <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n649/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0649-0628"/> called an occulting light (6) The <hi
                    rend="italic">intermittent light of unequal periods,</hi> first proposed by Mr
                    R. L. Stevenson in 1871, showing from the same apparatus different durations of
                    the dark periods with equal periods of light, such as fixed for 2" eclipsed 5 ,
                    fixed 2" eclipsed for 2", and then, as at first, fixed for 2". (7) <hi
                    rend="italic">Group flashing light.</hi> This distinction consists in giving a
                    series of groups of two or more flashes separated by short eclipses, the groups
                    being separated from one another by a larger eclipse. Mr Wigham of Dublin first
                    proposed this distinction, and applied it to a dioptric revolving apparatus
                    illuminated by gas, the effect being produced by raising and lowering the gas as
                    Mr Wilson of Troon had done in 1827. Dr Hopkinson produced the same effect
                    optically and for any illuminant by altering the arrangement of the ordinary
                    revolving apparatus. (8) <hi rend="italic">Fixed lights illuminating the whole
                    horizon, but shoιcing revolving or intermittent characteristics over small
                    arcs.</hi> These can be produced by masks arranged like Venetian house blinds
                    placed opposite the arc where the characteristic is to be different from the
                    main light. This arrangement and No. 9 were lately proposed by Mr T. Stevenson.
                    (9) <hi rend="italic">Intermittent flashing light.</hi> This is produced by
                    condensing prisms revolving round a fixed light apparatus. The flashing light
                    continues giving its rapidly recurring flashes for a certain period, which is
                    succeeded by a dark period. The light which is not required during the dark
                    periods is condensed by the prisms so as to strengthen the light periods.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Uniform System of Characteristics.—</hi> Various modes of
                    distinguishing lights have been at different times proposed, such as Babbage’s,
                    which represented the stations by numbers, and Sir W. Thomson’s by the Morse
                    alphabet, or dots and dashes; but the following results seem to show that the
                    present system is satisfactory, while it is free from many objections to which
                    the other modes are liable. The Board of Trade records of shipwrecks show that
                    during the space of twenty years (1857 to 1876) 2716 vessels were wrecked by
                    stranding on the coasts and islands of Scotland and the Isle of Man, and that of
                    all these there were only twenty-six, and the great majority of them were small
                    vessels, in which it was even <hi rend="italic">alleged</hi> that the cause was
                    a failure in identifying the distinctive characteristic of some one of the
                    Northern lighthouses, and in one-third of these cases the sailors were
                    foreigners, and made such glaring mistakes as taking a fixed for a revolving
                    light. It is surely more probable that in many of these cases they did not
                    confound the characteristics at all, but really did not know what they were.
                    But, waiving all these considerations, there were after all only about 1 per
                    cent, of all the wrecks which were <hi rend="italic">alleged</hi> to have been
                    caused by mistaking one light for another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Power of Coloured Lights.—</hi> Experiments, and particularly
                    those of Μ. Reynaud, have shown that red of the same initial power as white
                    penetrates a fog to a greater distance than the white, owing to the red raysnot
                    being so much dispersed byrefraction. Experiments made at Edinburgh in 1868 show
                    that a light should, before passing through red glass, have four and a half
                    times the initial power of a white light. The same results have since been
                    obtained by Μ. Allard of Paris.</p>
                <p>An objection to all coloured lights is the fact that some persons are unable to
                    detect any difference between certain colours. According to the experiments of
                    Professor Holmgren on from sixty to seventy thousand persons in Europe and
                    America, about 4‘2 per cent, are congenitally colour-blind, and the commonest
                    form of this defect is inability to distinguish between red and green, which are
                    the only tints employed for lighthouse distinctions. This objection, however,
                    must gradually lose its weight, as the Board of Trade has now adapted the
                    “colours test” as part of their examinations for certificates in navigation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Distribution of Lights on a Coast.</hi> —Mr Alan Stevenson
                    gives the following as a few of the chief considerations which should guide us
                    in the selection of sites and characteristic appearance of the lighthouses to be
                    placed on a line of coast.</p>
                <p>“1. The most prominent points of a line of coast, or those first made on <hi
                    rend="italic">oversea</hi> voyages, should be first lighted; and the most
                    powerful lights should be adapted to them, so that they may be discovered by the
                    mariner as long as possible before his reaching land.</p>
                <p>“2. So far as is consistent with a due attention to distinction, revolving lights
                    of some description, which are necessarily more powerful than fixed lights,
                    should be employed at the outposts on a line of coast.</p>
                <p>“3. Lights of precisely identical character and appearance should not, if
                    possible, occur within a less distance than 100 miles of each other on the same
                    line of coast which is made by over-sea vessels.</p>
                <p>“4. In all cases the distinction of colour should never be adopted except from
                    absolute necessity.</p>
                <p>“5. Fixed lights and others of less power may be more readily adopted in narrow
                    seas, because the <hi rend="italic">range</hi> of the lights in such situations
                    is generally less than that of open sea-lights.</p>
                <p>“6. In narrow seas also the distance between lights of the same appearance may
                    often be safely reduced within much lower limits than is desirable for the
                    greater sea-lights. Thus there are many instances in which the distance
                    separating lights of the same character need not exceed 50 miles; and peculiar
                    cases occur in which even a much less separation between similar lights may be
                    sufficient.</p>
                <p>“7. Lights intended to guard vessels from reefs, shoals, or other dangers should,
                    in every case where it is practicable, be placed <hi rend="italic">seaward</hi>
                    of the danger itself, as it is desirable that seamen be enabled to <hi
                    rend="italic">make</hi> the lights with confidence.</p>
                <p>“8. Views of economy in the first cost of a lighthouse should never be permitted
                    to interfere with placing it in the best possible position; and, when funds are
                    deficient, it will generally be found that the wise course is to delay the work
                    until a sum shall have been obtained sufficient for the erection of the
                    lighthouse on the best site.</p>
                <p>“9. The elevation of the lantern above the sea should not, if possible, for
                    sea-lights, exceed 200 feet; and about 150 feet is sufficient, under almost any
                    circumstances, to give the range which is required. Lights placed on high
                    headlands are subject to be frequently wrapped in fog, and are often thereby
                    rendered useless, at times when lights on a lower level might be perfectly
                    efficient. But this rule must not, and indeed cannot, be strictly followed,
                    especially on the British coast, where there are so many projecting cliffs,
                    which, while they subject the lights placed on them to occasional obscuration by
                    fog, would also entirely and permanently hide from view lights placed on the
                    lower land adjoining them.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ 10. The best position for a sea-light ought rarely to be neglected for the
                    sake of the more immediate benefit of some neighbouring port, however important
                    or influential; and the interests of navigation, as well as the true welfare of
                    the port itself, will generally be much better served by placing the sea-light
                    <hi rend="italic">where it ought to be,</hi> and adding, on a smaller scale,
                    such subsidiary lights as the channel leading to the entrance of the port may
                    require.</p>
                <p>“11. It may be held as a general maxim that the fewer lights that can be employed
                    in the illumination of a coast the better, not only on the score of economy, but
                    also of real efficiency. Every light needlessly erected may, in certain
                    circumstances, become a source of confusion to the mariner; and in the event of
                    another light being required in the neighbourhood, it becomes a <hi
                    rend="italic">deduction</hi> from the means of distinguishing it from the lights
                    which existed previous to its establishment.</p>
                <p>“12. Distinctions of lights, founded upon the minute estimation of intervals of
                    time between flashes, and especially on the measurement of the duration of light
                    and dark periods, are less satisfactory to the great majority of coasting
                    seamen, and are more liable to derangement by atmospheric changes, than those
                    distinctions which are founded on what may more properly be called the <hi
                    rend="italic">characteristic appearance</hi> of the lights, in which the times
                    for the recurrence of certain appearances differ so widely from each other as
                    not to require for their detection any very minute observation in a stormy
                    night. Thus, for example, flashing lights of five seconds’ interval, and
                    revolving lights of half a minute, one minute, and two minutes, are much more
                    characteristic than those which are distinguished from each other by intervals
                    varying according to a slower series of 5", 10", 20", 40", &amp;c.</p>
                <p>“13. Harbour and local lights, which have a circumscribed range, should generally
                    be fixed instead of revolving; and may often, for the same reason, be safely
                    distinguished by coloured media. In many cases also, where they are to serve as
                    guides into a narrow channel, the leading lights which are used should, at the
                    same time, be so arranged as to serve for a distinction from any neighbouring
                    lights.”</p>

                <p>Prior to 1807 the only kind of floating light was a shin with small lanterns
                    suspended from the yard-arms or frames. The late Mr Robert Stevenson introduced
                    in that year a lantern which surrounded the mast of the vessel, and was capable
                    of being lowered down to the deck to be trimmed. By his plan a lantern of much
                    greater size could be used, and with this increase of size a larger and more
                    perfect apparatus could be employed which admitted of gearing for working a
                    revolving light, as adopted by the Trinity House. In fig. 68, <hi rend="italic"

                    England, and Μ. Letourneau, in 1851, proposed to employ a number of sets of
                    dioptric apparatus in one lantern; figs- 69 and 70 show elevation and plan of
                    one of the Hooghly floating lights on the dioptric principle, designed for the
                    Indian Government by Messrs Stevenson. It will be observed that not fewer than
                    four of the separate lights are always in view from every part of the compass at
                    once. The “Seven Stones’’lightship, which has all the recent Trinity House
                    improvements, is moored off the Lands End in 42 fathoms. Her moorings consist of
                    a 40 cwt. mushroom anchor, and 315 fathoms of lj inch studded chain cable. The
                    vessel is timber-built, copper-fastened throughout, sheathed with Muntz metal.
                    Her length is 103 feet between perpendiculars; extreme breadth, 21 feet 3
                    inches; depth of hold from the strake next the timbers to the upper side of the
                    upper deck beams, 10 feet 3 inches. In the event of the vessel breaking adrift,
                    she is provided with sails, the mizzen being frequently used for steadying the
                    vessel at her moorings. The cost of the vessel, fully equipped for sea, with
                    illuminating and fog signal apparatus complete, was about £9500.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lanterns</hi> are generally constructed of diagonally framed
                    astragals (fig. 71) to avoid the obscuration of light in any one azimuth as
                    would be the case with dioptric fixed light apparatus were vertical astragals
                    used. The astragals are made of gun-metal, having a tensile strain of 33,000 lb
                    to the square inch; the dome is made of copper plates rivetted together; and the
                    glass is the best plate ∣ inch thick. <hi rend="italic">Storm panes</hi> are
                    kept at hand which can be applied in a few minutes in the event of a pane being
                    broken, which sometimes occurs from large birds driving against the lantern and
                    by stones thrown up from the face of cliffs by sea and wind during storms. Mr
                    Douglass’s cylindric or helical lanterns (fig. 72) have steel astragals, and the
                    panes, which are also cylindrical, are ⅜ inch thick.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lightning Conductors.—</hi> Each lighthouse tower is furnished
                    with a copper lightning conductor consisting of a I inch copper rod or wire
                    rope. These conductors terminate about 18 inches above the top of dome of
                    lantern in a forked shape with two platinum points; the lower end bifurcated and
                    furnished with large copper earth-plates is sunk into moist earth or into the
                    sea. The conductor is put into metallic connexion with all large masses of metal
                    outside or inside the lightroom. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lightning
                    Conductors.</hi><hi rend="italic">Machinery.—</hi> Revolving lights are
                    propelled by clock-work machinery actuated by a falling weight. The machines are
                    provided with a maintaining power which keeps the apparatus moving while the
                    machine is being wound up, and a bell is attached which rings to warn the
                    keepers when the machine requires winding up. A clock face is also attached
                    which keeps time with the lightroom clock when the apparatus is revolving at the
                    proper speed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Masking Screens.—</hi> For the purpose of <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutting off</hi> sharply the light proceeding from any fixed light apparatus,
                    the late Mr J. Μ. Balfour devised what he called radial masking screens. These
                    screens, which are in use at several lighthouses where the fairway for ships is
                    narrow, consist of a senes of thin plates placed with their edges towards the
                    apparatus, and with such a distance between them, and of such a length as will
                    secure that only rays having the desired divergence can pass through between
                    them.</p>
                <p>With revolving lights it is not possible to effect a “cut off” as in the case of
                    fixed lights, on any particular bearing; for the direction of the axis of the
                    luminous beam projected by the lens or reflector is being continually changed in
                    the horizontal plane by the revolution of the frame on which it is fixed. Mr
                    Stevenson’s mode of overcoming this difficulty is by fixing a light metallic
                    screen or coloured glass shade outside of the revolving apparatus and on the
                    safety side of the danger arc. These screens are fitted with rollers for nιnning
                    on a slightly inclined plane or circular path. Small projecting rods or snugs
                    fixed to the sides of each lens are, in revolving, brought against the edge of
                    the screen, and gradually press the screen before it up the inclined plane. By
                    the time the lens reaches the edge of the danger arc the screen has been pushed
                    to the top of the inclined plane, and the full beam of light, coming from the
                    now entirely uncovered lens, points in the required line of cut off, which is
                    the border of the danger arc. But whenever the further revolution of the
                    apparatus causes the snugs to pass clear of the edges of the screen so as to
                    free it from their pressure it immediately runs back again to its original
                    position in front of the lens, so as to prevent any of the light being now sent
                    seawards. By this continued reciprocative movement of the screen, as lens after
                    lens comes round, the same effect will be successively produced and the light
                    will always be cut off on the lines of obscuration, so that the flashes can
                    never be seen within the danger arc.</p>
