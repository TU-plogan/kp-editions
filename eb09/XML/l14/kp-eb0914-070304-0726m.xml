                    heiress of Thomas de Littleton, lord of Frankley. She married one Thomas
                    Westcote. Thomas was the eldest of four sons of the marriage, and took the name
                    of Littleton, or, as it seems to have been more commonly spelt, Luttelton. The
                    date of his birth appears to be uncertain. He is said by Sir E. Coke to have
                    been a member of the Inner Temple, and to have lectured there on the Statute of
                    Westminster II., <hi rend="italic">De Donis Conditionalibus.</hi> His name
                    occurs in the Paston letters about 1445 as that of a well-known counsel. He
                    appears to have been recorder of Coventry in 1450, to have been made king’s
                    sergeant in 1455, and afterwards to have been a justice of assize on the
                    northern circuit In 1466 he was made a <pb break="no"

                    of the Bath. He died, according to the inscription on his tomb in Worcester
                    cathedral, on August 23, 1481. He married Joan, widow of Sir Philip Chetwind of
                    Ingestre in Staffordshire, and by her had three sons, through whom he became
                    ancestor of the families in which are the existing peerages of Lyttelton and
                    Hatherton.</p>
                <p>The work on tenures was probably written late in his life. It is addressed to his
                    second son Richard, who went to the bar, and whose name occurs in the year books
                    of the reign of Henry VII. The book, both historically and from its intrinsic
                    merit, may be characterized as the first textbook upon the English law of
                    property. The law of property in Littleton’s time was mainly concerned with
                    rights over land, and it was the law relating to this class of rights which
                    Littleton set himself to digest and classify. The time was ripe for the task.
                    Ever since the Conquest regular courts of justice had been at work administering
                    a law which had grown out of an admixture of Teutonic custom and of Norman
                    feudalism. Under Henry II. the courts had been organized, and the practice of
                    keeping regular records of the proceedings had been carefully observed. The
                    centralizing influence of the royal courts and of the justices of assize,
                    working steadily through three centuries, had made the rules governing the law
                    of property uniform throughout the land; local customs were confined within
                    certain prescribed limits, and were only recognized as giving rise to certain
                    well-defined classes of rights, such, for instance, as the security of tenure
                    acquired by villeins by virtue of the custom of the manor, and the. rights of
                    freeholders, in some towns, to dispose of their land by will. Thus, by the time
                    of Littleton (Henry VI. and Edward IV. ), an immense mass of material had been
                    acquired and preserved in the rolls of the various courts. Reports of important
                    cases were published in the “yearbooks.” A glance at Statham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abridgment,</hi> the earliest digest of decided cases, published nearly at the
                    same time as Littleton’s <hi rend="italic">Tenures,</hi> is sufficient to show
                    the enormous bulk which reported cases had already attained as materials for the
                    knowledge of English law.</p>
                <p>Littleton’s treatise was written in French, or rather in that peculiar dialect
                    compounded of Norman-French and English phrases called law French. Although it
                    had been provided by a statute of 36 Edward III. that <hi rend="italic">viva
                    voce</hi> proceedings in court should no longer be conducted in the French
                    tongue, “which was much unknown in the realm,” the practice of reporting
                    proceedings in that language, and of using it in legal treatises, lingered till
                    a much later period, and was at length prohibited by a statute passed in the
                    time of the Commonwealth in 1650. Unlike the preceding writers on English law,
                    Glanville, Bracton, and the authors of the treatises known by the names of
                    Britton and FIeta, Littleton borrows nothing from the sources of Roman law or
                    the commentators. He deals purely and exclusively with English law.</p>
                <p>The book is written on a definite system, and is the first attempt at something
                    like a scientific classification of rights over land. Littleton’s method is to
                    begin with a definition, usually clearly and briefly expressed, of the class of
                    rights with which he is dealing. He then proceeds to illustrate the various
                    characteristics and incidents of the class by stating particular instances, some
                    of which refer to decisions which had actually occurred, but more commonly they
                    are hypothetical cases put by way of illustration of his principles. He
                    occasionally but rarely refers to reported cases. His book is thus much more
                    than a mere digest of judicial decisions; to some extent he pursues the method
                    which gave to Roman law its breadth and consistency of principle. In Roman law
                    this result was attained through the practice of putting to jurisconsults
                    hypothetical cases to be solved by them. Littleton, in like manner, is
                    constantly stating and solving byreferencetoprinciplesof law cases which may or
                    may not have occurred in actual practice.</p>
                <p>In dealing with freehold estates Littleton adopts a classification which has been
                    followed by all writers who have attempted to systematize the English law of
                    land, especially Sir Μ. Hale and Sir William Blackstone. It is indeed the only
                    possible approach to a scientific arrangement of the intricate “estates in land”
                    known to English law. He classifies estates in land by reference to their
                    duration, or in other words by reference to the differences between the persons
                    who are entitled to succeed upon the death of the person in possession or
                    “tenant.” First of all, he describes the characteristics of tenancy in fee
                    simple,—an interest in lands which devolves on the death of the tenant to his
                    heir, whether such heir be of the same line or collateral. This is still as it
                    was in Littleton’s time the largest interest in land known to the law. Next in
                    order comes tenancy in fee tail, the outcome, as Littleton informs us, of the
                    Statute of Westminster II., 13 Edw. I. c. 1, “De Donis Conditionalibus,” which
                    enacted in the interest of the great lords that a gift to a man and ‘ ‘ the
                    heirs of his body” should no longer bear the construction which the courts had
                    put upon the words, holding the donee to be thereby invested with full power
                    over the land so soon as he had issue born, but should descend according to the
                    form of the gift to lineal descendants so long as lineal descendants should
                    exist. The various classes of estates tail are sketched by Littleton with
                    brevity and accuracy, but he is silent as to the important practice, which first
                    received judicial recognition shortly before his death, of “suffering a
                    recovery,” whereby through a series of judicial fictions a tenant in tail was
                    enabled to convert his estate tail into a fee simple, thus acquiring full power
                    of alienation. After discussing in their logical order other freehold interests
                    in land, he passes to interests in land called by later writers interests less
                    than freehold, namely, tenancies for terms of years and tenancies at will. With
                    the exception of tenancy from year to year, now so familiar to us, but which was
                    a judicial creation of a date later than the time of Littleton, the first book
                    is a complete statement of the principles of the common law, as they for the
                    most part still exist, governing and regulating interests in lands. The first
                    book concludes with a very interesting chapter on copyhold tenures, which marks
                    the exact point at which the tenant by copy of court roll, the successor of the
                    villein, who in his turn represented the freeman reduced to villenage by the
                    growth of the manorial system, acquired security of tenure by the judicial
                    recognition of the fact that the “will of the lord” was controlled by and could
                    only be exercised in accordance with the “custom of the manor.”</p>
                <p>The second book relates to the reciprocal rights and duties of lord and tenant,
                    and is mainly of historical interest to the modern lawyer. It contains a
                    complete statement of the law as it stood in Littleton’s time relating to
                    homage, fealty, and escuage, the money compensation to be paid to the lord in
                    lieu of military service to be rendered to the king, a peculiar characteristic
                    of English as distinguished from Continental feudalism.</p>
                <p>Littleton then proceeds to notice the important features of tenure by knight’s
                    service with its distinguishing incidents of the right of wardship of the lands
                    and person of the infant heir or heiress, and the right of disposing of the ward
                    in marriage. The non-military freehold tenures are next dealt with; we have an
                    account of “socage tenure,” into which all military tenures were subsequently
                    commuted by a now unrecognized Act of the Long Parliament in 1650, afterwards
                    re-enacted by the well-known statute of 12 Charles II. c. 24, and of
                    “frankalmoign,” or the spiritual tenure by which churchmen held, their duty
                    being “to make orisons, prayers, masses, and other divine services for the souls
                    of their grantor or feoffor, and being bound to no fealty to the lord because
                    that this divine service is better for them before God than any doing of
                    fealty.” In the description of burgage tenure and tenure in villenage, the life
                    of which consists in the validity of ancient customs recognized by law, we
                    recognize survivals of a time before the iron rule of feudalism had moulded the
                    law of land in the interests of the king and the great lords. Finally he deals
                    with the law of rents, discussing the various kinds of rents which may be
                    reserved to the grantor upon a grant of lands and the remedies for recovery of
                    rent, especially the remedy by distress.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>These two books are stated, in a note to the table at the
                    conclusion of the work, to have been made for the better understanding of
                    certain chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Antient Book of Tenures.</hi> This
                    refers to a tract called <hi rend="italic">The Old Tenures,</hi> said to have
                    been written in the reign of Edward III. By way of distinguishing it from this
                    work, Littleton’s book is called in all the early editions “Tenores
                    Novelli."</p></note></p>
                <p>The third and concluding book of Littleton’s treatise deals mainly with the
                    various ways in which rights over land can be acquired and terminated in the
                    case of a single possessor or several possessors. This leads him to discuss the
                    various modes in ιvhich several persons may simultaneously have rights over the
                    same land, as parceners :—daughters who are co-heiresses, or sons in gavelkind;
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n728/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0728-0705"/> joint tenants, where the interest does not pass
                    to the heir of the deceased joint tenant, but devolves upon the surviving joint
                    tenant; and tenants in common, where the interest is separate and descends to
                    the heir of each of the co-tenants, though the land over which the right exists
                    is undivided and held in common with one or more other persons. Next follows an
                    elaborate discussion upon what are called estates upon condition, —a class of
                    interests which occupied a large space in the early common law, giving rise on
                    one side to estates tail, on another to mortgages. In Littleton’s time a
                    mortgage, which he carefully describes, was merely a conveyance of land by°the
                    tenant to the mortgagee, with a condition that, if the tenant paid to the
                    mortgagee a certain sum on a certain day, he might reenter and have the land
                    again. If the condition was not fulfilled, the interest of the mortgagee became
                    absolute, and Littleton gives no indication of any modification of this strict
                    rule, such as was introduced by courts of equity, permitting the debtor to
                    redeem his land by payment of all that was due to the mortgagee although the day
                    of payment had passed, and his interest had become at law indefeasible. The
                    remainder of the work is occupied with an exposition of a miscellaneous class of
                    modes of acquiring rights of property, the analysis of which would occupy too
                    large a space.</p>
                <p>The work is thus a complete summary of the common law as it stood at the time. It
                    is nearly silent as to the remarkable class of rights which had already assumed
                    vast practical importance— equitable interests in lands. These are only noticed
                    incidentally in the chapter on “Releases.” But it was already clear in
                    Littleton’s time that this class of rights would become the most important of
                    all. Littleton’s own will, which has been preserved, may be adduced in proof of
                    this assertion. Although nothing was more opposed to the spirit of Norman
                    feudalism than that a tenant of lands should dispose of them by will, we find
                    Littleton directing by his will the feoffees of certain manors to make estates
                    to the persons named in his will. In other words, in order to acquire over lands
                    powers unknown to the common law, the lands had been conveyed to <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> ‘ feoffees” who had full right over them according to
                    the common law, but who were under a conscientious obligation to exercise those
                    rights at the direction and for the exclusive benefit of the person to whose
                    “use” the lands were held. This conscientious obligation was recognized and
                    enforced by the chancellor, and thus arose the class of equitable interests in
                    lands. Littleton is the first writer on English law after these rights had risen
                    into a prominent position, ana it is curious to find to what extent they are
                    ignored by him. Unlike their treatment of copy hold interests, the common
                    lawyers wholly refused to recognize the right of the real or beneficial owner,
                    when the legal interest was vested in another, though the latter had then but
                    the semblance without the reality of ownership. Hence it was that the most
                    important class of rights developed outside the common law. After an unhappy
                    attempt to reunite the classes of legal and equitable interests by the Statute
                    of Uses (27 Henry VIII. c. 10), the effect of which was to introduce still
                    greater technicality and complication into the law of real property, the two
                    classes have continued to exist side by side, until in our own time the
                    Judicature Act of 1873, by uniting in one court the tribunals the difference
                    between which originally gave rise to the distinction between legal and
                    equitable interests, has perhaps paved the way for a simpler and more rational
                    classification of rights over land.</p>
                <p>The work of Littleton occupies a place in the history of typography as well as of
                    law. The earliest printed edition seems to be that by John Lettou and william de
                    Machlinia, two printers who probably came from the Continent, and carried on
                    their business in partnership, as their note to the edition of Littleton states,
                    “in civitate L·ondoniarum, juxta ecclesiam omnium sanctorum.” The date of this
                    edition is uncertain, but the most probable conjecture, based on typographical
                    grounds, places it about the latter part of 1481. The next edition is one by
                    Machlinia alone, probably about two or three years later than the former.
                    Machlinia was then in business alone “juxta pontem quae vulgo dicitur Fleta
                    brigge.” Next came the Rohan or Rouen edition, erroneously stated by Sir E. Coke
                    to·be the earliest, and to have been printed about 1533. It was, however, of a
                    much earlier date. Tomlins, the latest editor of Littleton, gives reasons for
                    thinking that it cannot have been later than 1490. It is stated in a note to
                    have been printed at Rouen by William le Tailleur “ad instantiam Richard!
                    Pjnson." Copies of all these editions aie in the British Museum. In all these
                    editions the work is styled <hi rend="italic">Tenores Novelli,</hi> probably to
                    distinguish it from the</p>
                <p>Old Tenures."</p>
                <p>There are three early MSS. of Littleton in the University Library at Cambridge.
                    One of these formerly contained a note on its first page to the effect that it
                    was bought in St Paul’s Churchyard on July 20, 1480. It was therefore in
                    circulation in Littleton’s lifetime. The other two MSS. are of a somewhat later
                    date; but one of them contains what seems to be the earliest English translation
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Tenures,</hi> and is probably not later than 1500.</p>
                <p>In the 16th century editions of Littleton followed in rapid succession from the
                    presses of Pynson, Redmayne, Berthelet, Tottyl, and others. The practice of
                    annotating the text caused several additions to be introduced, which, however,
                    are easily detected by comparison of the earlier copies. In 1581 West divided
                    the text into seven hundred and forty-six sections, which have ever since been
                    preserved. Many of these editions were printed with large margins for purposes
                    of annotation, specimens of which may be seen in Lincoln’s Inn Library.</p>
                <p>The practice of annotating Littleton was very general, and was adopted by many
                    eminent lawyers besides Sir E. Coke, amongst others by Sir Μ. Hale. One
                    commentary of this kind, by an unknown hand of earlier date than Sir E. Coke’s,
                    was edited by Cary in 1829. Following the general practice of dealing with
                    Littleton as the great authority on the law of England, “the most perfect and
                    absolute work that ever was written in any human language,” Sir E. Coke makes it
                    the text of that portion of his work which he calls the first part of the
                    institutes of the law of England, in other words, the law of property.</p>
                <p>The first printed English translation of Littleton was by Rastell, who seems to
                    have combined the professions of author, printer, and sergeant-at-law, between
                    1514 and 1533. Many English editions by various editors”followed, the best of
                    which is Tottyl’s in 1556. Sir E. Coke adopted some translation earlier than
                    this, which has since gone by the name of Sir E. Coke's translation. He,
                    however, throughout comments not on the translation but on the French text; and
                    the reputation of the commentary has to some extent overlaid and obscured the
                    intrinsic merit of the original. (K. E. D.)</p>
