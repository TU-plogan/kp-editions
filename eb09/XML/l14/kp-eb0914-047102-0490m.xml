                    politics, commonly recognized as the chief of the (so-called) Humanitarian
                    school, was born at Paris in 1798. He was the son of an artisan. He received his
                    early education at the Lycée Charlemagne, and continued his studies at Rennes.
                    Having obtained an admission to the Polytechnic school, he renounced it in order
                    to support by the labour of his hands his mother and family, who had been left
                    destitute by the death of his father. He first worked as a mason, but soon
                    became a compositor in the printing establishment of his cousin, and afterwards
                    overseer in that of M. Panckoucke. In 1824 P. Dubois, a former schoolfellow,
                    associated him with himself in the foundation of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globe</hi> newspaper, in which he became a co-worker with De Broglie, Guizot,
                    Duvergier de Hauranne, Jouffroy, and other distinguished persons. For some time
                    he occupied the position of an advanced Liberal of the ordinary type; but in
                    January 1831 he gave his adhesion to the Saint-Simonian community, of which he
                    became a prominent member; and under his influence the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Globe</hi> became the organ of its doctrines. In November of the same year,
                    when Enfantin preached the enfranchisement of women and the functions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">couple-prêtre,</hi> Leroux took the part of Bazard, and,
                    protesting iu the name of morality, separated himself from the sect. In 1838, in
                    conjunction with J. Reynaud, who had seceded with him, he founded the <hi
                    rend="italic">Encyclopédie Nouvelle,</hi> in which he expounded his
                    philosophical and social views. Amongst the articles which he inserted in it
                    were one entitled <hi rend="italic">De V</hi><hi rend="italic">Égalité,</hi> and
                    a <hi rend="italic">Réfutation</hi><hi rend="italic">de V</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Éclectisme,</hi> which afterwards appeared as separate works. In 1840 he
                    published his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Humanité,</hi> which contains the fullest exposition of his
                    system, and was regarded as the philosophical manifesto of the Humanitarians. In
                    1841, disgusted with the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes</hi> on account
                    of its desertion of the democratic cause, he established, with the aid of M.
                    Viardot and Mme. George Saud, the <hi rend="italic">Revue Indépendante.</hi> By
                    his philosophic association with the latter eminent writer he obtained the
                    advantage of an eloquent interpreter, capable of charming and impressing the
                    masses. Mme. Sand’s <hi rend="italic">Spiridion,</hi> which was dedicated to
                    him, her <hi rend="italic">Sept Cordes de la Lyre,</hi> her <hi rend="italic"
                    >Consuelo,</hi> and its continuation <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Comtesse</hi><hi rend="italic">de Rudolstadt,</hi> were written under the
                    Humanitarian inspiration. From the year 1843 M. Leroux devoted himself tothe
                    practical applications of his doctrines. He established at Boussac (Creuse) a
                    printing association organized according to his systematic ideas, and founded
                    the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">Sociale,</hi> in which, as
                    well as in separate publications, he continued to explain and develop his
                    theoretic views and his suggestions for the renovation of society, professing,
                    amongst other things, to supply “a pacific solution of the problem of the
                    proletariat.” After the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 he was elected to the
                    constituent assembly as representative of the department of the Seine, obtaining
                    90,000 votes, and afterwards, in 1849, to the legislative assembly. He spoke
                    there on the organization of labour, on the colonization of Algeria, and other
                    questions. His discourses from the tribune were sometimes of so abstract and
                    mystical a character, and contained proposals so eccentric and impracticable
                    that they rather created ridicule than influenced opinion. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >coup (l’état</hi><hi rend="italic">οi</hi> 1851 made him an exile; he settled
                    with his family in Jersey, where he pursued agricultural experiments. The
                    general amnesty of 1860 permitted his return to France, but he lived at Lausanne
                    till after the definitive amnesty of 1869, when he again fixed his residence at
                    Paris. He died there in April 1871, during the reign of the Commune. That body
                    deputed two of its members to attend his funeral, as a homage, “not to the
                    partisan of the mystical idea, of which we now feel the evil, but to the
                    politician who, after the days of June, courageously undertook the defence of
                    the vanquished.”</p>
                <p>The writings of Leroux, though they won a transitory éclat and gave him a
                    position as head of a school, appear to have no permanent significance in the
                    history of thought. His social theories do not rest on any scientific basis; he
                    was rather the propagandist of sentiments and aspirations than the expounder of
                    well-defined and distinctly appreciable ideas. He seems to have had a natural
                    bent towards the mystic and the nebulous. He has, indeed, a system, but it is a
                    singular medley of doctrines borrowed, not only from Saint-Simonian, but from
                    Pythagorean and Buddhistic sources. In philosophy his fundamental principle is
                    that of what he calls the “triad,”—a triplicity which he finds to pervade all
                    things, which in God is “power, intelligence, and love” in man “sensation, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n491/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0491-0472"/> sentiment, and knowledge.” His religious doctrine
                    is Pantheistic; and, rejecting the belief in a future life as commonly
                    conceived, he substitutes for it a theory of metempsychosis. In social economy
                    his views are very vague; he preserves the family, country, and property, but
                    finds in all three, as they now are, a despotism which must be eliminated. He
                    imagines certain combinations by which this triple tyranny can be abolished, so
                    that the human being may be developed under the influence of those several
                    institutions without being oppressed by them. But his solution seems to require
                    the creation of families without heads, countries λvithout governments, and
                    property without rights of possession. In politics he advocates absolute
                    equality—a democracy pushed to anarchy. A full criticism of his system will be
                    found in L. Bey baud’s <hi rend="italic">Études sur les Réformateurs et
                    Socialistes</hi><hi rend="italic">Modernes.</hi></p>
