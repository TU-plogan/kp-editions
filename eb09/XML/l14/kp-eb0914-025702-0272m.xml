                    to the dissenting ministry; but soon after his religious views altered, and he
                    attached himself to the Society of Friends, with which he remained associated
                    for many years, until long afterwards he was disowned by that body. At the age
                    of twenty he began to gather a few poor children under his father’s roof and to
                    give them the rudiments of instruction, without a fee, except in cases in which
                    the parent was willing to pay a trifle. Soon a thousand children were assembled
                    in the Borough Road; and, the attention of the duke of Bedford, Mr Whitbread,
                    and others having been directed to his efforts, he was provided with means for
                    building a schoolroom, and supplying needful materials. The main features of his
                    plan were the employment of older scholars as monitors, and an elaborate system
                    of mechanical drill, by means of which these young teachers were made to impart
                    the rudiments of reading, writing, and arithmetic to large numbers at the same
                    time. The material appliances for teaching were very scanty—a few leaves torn
                    out of spelling-books and pasted on boards, some slates, and a desk spread with
                    sand, on which the children wrote with their fingers. The order and cheerfulness
                    of the school and the military precision of the children’s movements were very
                    striking, and began to attract much public observation at a time when the
                    education of the poor was almost entirely neglected. Lancaster had the skill
                    which gains the loyalty of subordinates, and he succeeded in inspiring his young
                    monitors with fondness for their work and with pride in the institution of which
                    they formed a part. As these youths bècame <pb break="no"

                    accept some of the numerous invitations which crowded upon him, and to expound
                    what he called “his system” by lectures in various towns. In this way many new
                    schools were established, and placed under the care of young men whom he had
                    trained. In a memorable interview with George HL, Lancaster was encouraged by
                    the expression of the king’s wish that every poor child in his dominions should
                    be taught to read the Bible. Royal patronage brought in its train resources,
                    fame, and public responsibility, which proved to be beyond Lancaster’s own
                    powers to sustain or control. He was vain, reckless, and improvident. In 1808 a
                    few noblemen and gentlemen came to his rescue, paid his debts, became his
                    trustees, and founded the society which was at first called the Royal
                    Lancasterian Institution, but was afterwards more widely known as the British
                    and Foreign School Society. With the strongest wish to retain his services and
                    to treat him with liberality, they soon found that he was impatient of control,
                    and that his wild impulses and heedless extravagance made it impossible to work
                    with him. He quarrelled with the committee, set up a private school at Tooting,
                    became bankrupt, and in 1818 emigrated to America. There he met at first with a
                    warm reception, gave several courses of lectures which were well attended, and
                    wrote to friends at home letters full of enthusiasm and of high hopes for future
                    usefulness, not unmingled with bitter denunciations of what he called the
                    ingratitude and treachery of those who had been associated with him in England.
                    But his fame was short-lived. The miseries of debt and disappointment were
                    aggravated by sickness, and he settled for a time in the warmer climate of
                    Caracas. He afterwards visited St Thomas and Santa Cruz, and at length returned
                    to New York, the corporation of which city made him a public grant of 500
                    dollars in pity for the misfortunes which had by this time reduced him to
                    lamentable poverty. He afterwards visited Canada, where for a time his prospects
                    brightened. He gave lectures at Montreal, and was encouraged to open a school
                    which enjoyed an ephemeral success, but was soon abandoned. A small annuity
                    provided by his friends in England was his only means of support. He formed a
                    plan, however, for returning home and giving a new impetus to his “system,” by
                    which he declared it would be possible “to teach ten thousand children in
                    different schools, not knowing their letters, all to read fluently in three
                    weeks to three months.” But these visions were never realized. He was run over
                    by a carriage in the streets of New York in October 1838, and was so much
                    injured that he died in a few hours.</p>
                <p>As one of the two rival inventors of what was called the “monitorial” or “mutual”
                    method of instruction, his name was prominent for many years in educational
                    controversy. Dr <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrew Bell</hi> {q. v.) had in 1797
                    published an account of his experiments in teaching; and Lancaster in his first
                    pamphlet, published in 1803, frankly acknowledges his debt to Bell for some
                    useful hints. The two worked independently, but Lancaster was the first to apply
                    the system of monitorial teaching on a large scale. As an economical experiment
                    his school at the Borough Road was a signal success. He had one thousand
                    scholars under discipline, and taught them to read, write, and work simple sums
                    at a yearly cost of less than 5s. a head. His tract Improvements in Education
                    described the gradation of ranks, the system of signals and orders, the
                    functions of the monitors, the method of counting and of spelling, and the
                    curious devices he adopted for punishing offenders. Bell’s educational aims were
                    humbler, as he feared to “elevate above their station those who were doomed to
                    the drudgery of daily labour,” and therefore did not desire to teach even
                    writing and ciphering to the lower classes. The main difference between them was
                    that the system of the one was adopted by ecclesiastics and Conservatives,—the
                    “National Society for the Education of the Poor in the principles of the
                    Established Church” having been founded in 1811 for its propagation; while
                    Lancaster’s method was patronized by the Edinburgh Review, by Whig statesmen, by
                    a few liberal Churchmen, and by Nonconformists generally. It was the design of
                    Lancaster and his friends to make national education Christian, but not
                    sectarian,—to cause the Scriptures to be read, explained, and reverenced in the
                    schools, without seeking by catechisms or otherwise to attract the children to
                    any particular church or sect. This principle, since almost universally adopted
                    by the school boards of England, was at first vehemently denounced as deistic
                    and mischievous, and as especially hostile to the Established Church. To do them
                    justice, it must be owned that the rival claims and merits of Bell and Lancaster
                    were urged with more passion and unfairness by their friends than by themselves.
                    Y et neither is entitled to hold a very high place among the world’s teachers.
                    Bell was cold, shrewd, and self-seeking. Lancaster had more enthusiasm, a
                    genuine and abounding love for children, and some ingenuity in devising plans
                    both for teaching and governing. But he was shiftless, wayward, and
                    unmethodical, and incapable of sustained and high-principled personal effort.
                    His writings were not numerous. They consist mainly of short pamphlets
                    descriptive of the successes he attained at the Borough Road. His last
                    publication, An Epitome of the Chief Events and Transactions of his Own Life,
                    appeared in America in 1833, and is characterized, even more strongly than his
                    former writings, by looseness and incoherency of style, by egotism, and by a
                    curious incapacity for judging fairly the motives either of his friends or his
                    foes.</p>
                <p>Subsequent experience has not justified the sanguine estimate of the Edinburgh
                    Reviewer, who so early as 1810 described Lancaster’s method as “a beautiful and
                    inestimable discovery, a plan now brought very near to perfection, by which
                    education could be placed within the reach of all classes.” We have since come
                    to believe that intelligent teaching requires skill and previous training, and
                    that even the humblest rudiments are not to be well taught by those who have
                    only just acquired them for themselves, or to be attained by mere mechanical
                    drill. But in the early stages of national education the monitorial method
                    served a valuable purpose. It brought large numbers of hitherto neglected
                    children under discipline, and gave them elementary instruction at a very cheap
                    rate. Moreover, the educational results attained were in no sense contemptible.
                    The little monitors were often found to make up in brightness, tractability, and
                    energy for their lack of experience, and to teach the arts of reading, writing,
                    and computing with surprising success. And one cardinal principle of Bell and
                    Lancaster is of prime importance. They regarded a school, not merely as a place
                    to which individual pupils should come for guidance from teachers, but as an
                    organized community whose members have much to leanι from each other. They
                    sought to place their scholars from the first in helpful mutual relations, and
                    to make them feel the need of common efforts towards the attainment of common
                    ends. (J. G. F.)</p>
