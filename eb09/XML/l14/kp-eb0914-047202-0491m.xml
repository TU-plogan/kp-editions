                    very young, and his property was wasted or embezzled by his guardians. Little is
                    known of his youth except that he went to school with the Jesuits at Vannes
                    until he was eighteen. Conjecture has it that he continued his studies at Paris,
                    and it is certain that he was called to the bar at the capital in 1G92. In
                    August 1G94 he married the daughter of a joiner, Marie Elizabeth Huyard. She was
                    beautiful but had no fortune, and Le Sage had little practice. About this time
                    he met his old schoolfellow the dramatist Danchet, and is said to have been
                    advised by him to betake himself to literature. He began modestly as a
                    translator, and published in 1G95 a French version of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistles</hi> of Aristaenetus, which was not successful. Shortly afterwards he
                    found a valuable patron and adviser in the Abbé de Lyonne, who bestowed on him
                    an annuity of GOO livres, and recommended him to exchange the classics for
                    Spanish literature, of which he was himself a student and collector. Le Sage
                    began by translating plays chiefly from Rojas and Lope de Vega. <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Traître Puni</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Point d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">IIonneur</hi> from the former,
                    <hi rend="italic">Don</hi><hi rend="italic">Félix</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Mendoee</hi> from the latter, were acted or published in the first two or three
                    years of the 18th century. In 1704 he translated the continuation of Don Quixote
                    by Avellaneda, and soon afterwards adapted a play from Calderon, <hi
                    rend="italic">Don Cesar Ursin,</hi> which had a divided fate, being successful
                    at court and damned in the city. He was, however, nearly forty before he
                    obtained anything like decided success. But in 1707 his admirable farce of <hi
                    rend="italic">Crispin Rival</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >son</hi><hi rend="italic">Maître</hi> was acted with great applause, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Diable</hi><hi rend="italic">Boiteux</hi>
                    was published. This latter went through several editions in the same year, and
                    was frequently reprinted till 1725, when Le Sage altered and improved it
                    considerably, giving it its present form. Notwithstanding the success of <hi
                    rend="italic">Crispin,</hi> the actors did not like Le Sage, and refused a small
                    piece of his called <hi rend="italic">Les Etrennes.</hi> He thereupon altered it
                    into <hi rend="italic">Turearet,</hi> his theatrical masterpiece, and one of the
                    best comedies in French literature. This appeared in 1709. Some years passed
                    before he again attempted romance writing, and then the first two parts of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> appeared in 1715. Strange to say, it was not so
                    popular as the <hi rend="italic">Diable Boiteux.</hi> Le Sage worked at it for a
                    long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till
                    1735. For this last he had been part paid to the extent of a hundred pistoles
                    some years before its appearance. This is the only positive statement we have
                    about his gains. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy.
                    Notwithstanding the great merit and success of <hi rend="italic">Turearet</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Crispin,</hi> the Théâtre Français did not welcome him,
                    and in the year of the publication of <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> he began
                    to write for the Théâtre de la Foire—the comic opera held in booths at festival
                    time. This, though not a very dignified occupation, was followed by many writers
                    of distinction at this time, and by none more assiduously than by Le Sage.
                    According to one computation he produced either alone or with others about a
                    hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to
                    comediettas only distinguished from regular plays by the introduction of music.
                    He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gil Blas</hi> he translated the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Inamorato,</hi>
                    rearranged <hi rend="italic">Guzman d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Alfarαche,</hi>
                    published two more or less original novels, <hi rend="italic">Le Bachelier de
                    Salamanque</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Estevanille Gonzales,</hi> and in 1733
                    produced the <hi rend="italic">Vie et Aventures de Μ. de Beauchene,</hi> which
                    is curiously like certain works of Defoe. Besides all this, Le Sage was also the
                    author of <hi rend="italic">La Valise</hi><hi rend="italic">Trouvée,</hi> a
                    collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">Une Journée des Parques</hi> is the most remarkable. This
                    laborious life he continued until 1740, when he was more than seventy years of
                    age. His eldest son had become an actor, and Le Sage had disowned him, but the
                    second was a canon at Boulogne in comfortable circumstances. In the year just
                    mentioned his father and mother went to live with him. At Boulogne Le Sage spent
                    the last seven years of his life, dying, as has been said, on the 17th of
                    November 1747, at the age of nearly eighty.</p>
                <p>Not much is known of LeSage’s life and personality, and the foregoing paragraph
                    contains not only the most important but almost the only facts available for it.
                    The few anecdotes which we have of him represent him as a man of very
                    independent temper, declining to accept the condescending patronage which in the
                    earlier part of the century was still the portion of men of letters. Thus it is
                    said that, on being remonstrated with, as he thought impolitely, for an
                    unavoidable delay in appearing at the duchess of Bouillon’s house to read <hi
                    rend="italic">Turearet,</hi> he at once put the play in his pocket and retired,
                    refusing absolutely to return. In his old age, when he was very deaf, he is also
                    said to have been decidedly arbitrary in his choice of the persons whom he
                    permitted to have access to his trumpet, but this is not unusual in such cases.
                    It may, however, be said that as in time so in position he occupies a place
                    apart from most of the great writers of the 17th and 18th centuries
                    respectively. He was not the object of royal patronage like the first, nor the
                    pet of <hi rend="italic">salons</hi> and coteries like the second. Indeed he
                    seems all his life to have been purely domestic in his habits, and purely
                    literary in his interests.</p>
                <p>The importance of Le Sage in French and in European literature is not entirely
                    the same, and he has the rare distinction of being more important in the latter
                    than in the former. His literary work may be divided into three parts. The first
                    contains his <hi rend="italic">Théâtre de la Foire</hi> and his few
                    miscellaneous writings, the second his two remarkable <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n492/mode/1up"

                    rend="italic">Turcaret,</hi> the third his prose fictions. In the first two he
                    swims within the general literary current in France; he can be and must be
                    compared with others of his own nation. But in the third he emerges altogether
                    from merely national comparison. It is not with Frenchmen that he is to be
                    measured. He formed no school in France; he followed no French models. His work,
                    admirable as it is from the mere point of view of style and form, is a
                    parenthesis in the general development of the French novel. That product works
                    its way from Madame de la Fayette through Marivaux and Prévost, not through Le
                    Sage. His literary ancestors are Spaniards, his literary contemporaries and
                    successors are Englishmen. The position is almost unique; it is certainly
                    interesting and remarkable in the highest degree.</p>
                <p>Of Le Sage’s miscellaneous work, including his numerous farce-operettas, there is
                    not much to be said except that they are the very best kind of literary hack
                    work. The pure and original style of the author, his abundant wit, his cool
                    humoristic attitude towards human life, which wanted only greater earnestness
                    and a wider conception of that life to turn it into true humour, are discernible
                    throughout. But this portion of his work is practically forgotten, and no
                    sensible critic who has taken the trouble to examine it will say that for the
                    world at large there is any reason why it should be resuscitated. Of such work
                    every generation produces its own quota, which is sufficient for the day. <hi
                    rend="italic">Crispin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Turcaret</hi> show a stronger
                    and more deeply marked genius, which but for the ill-will of the actors might
                    have gone far in this direction. But Le Sage’s peculiar unwillingness to attempt
                    anything absolutely new discovered itself here. Even when lie had devoted
                    himself to the Foire theatre, it seems that he was unwilling to attempt when
                    occasion called for it the absolute innovation of a piece with only one actor, a
                    crux which Piron, a lesser but a bolder genius, accepted and carried through.
                    <hi rend="italic">Crispin</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Turcaret</hi> are
                    unquestionably Molieresque, though they are perhaps more original in their
                    following of Molière than any other plays that can be named. For this also was
                    part of Le Sage’s idiosyncrasy that, while he was apparently unable or unwilling
                    to strike out an entirely novel line for himself, he had no sooner entered upon
                    the beaten path than he left it to follow his own devices. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crispin Rival</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">son</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Maître</hi> is a farce in one act and many scenes, after the
                    earlier manner of motion. Its plot is somewhat extravagant, inasmuch as it lies
                    in the effort of a knavish valet, not as usual to further his master’s
                    interests, but to supplant that master. But the charm of the piece consists
                    first in the lively bustling action of the short scenes which take each other up
                    so promptly and smartly that the spectator has not time to cavil at the
                    improbability of the action, and secondly in the abundant wit of the dialogue.
                    <hi rend="italic">Turcaret</hi> is a far more important piece of work. The only
                    thing which prevents it from holding the very highest place is a certain want of
                    unity in the plot. This unity, however, which was too often attained by Molière
                    through the exaggeration of the ruling-passion theory, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tartuffe</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Misanthrope,</hi> is compensated in <hi
                    rend="italic">Turcaret</hi> by the most masterly profusion of character-drawing
                    in the separate parts. Turcaret, the ruthless, dishonest, and dissolute
                    financier, his vulgar wife as dissolute as himself, the harebrained marquis, the
                    knavish chevalier, the baroness (a coquette with the finer edge taken off her
                    fine-ladyhood, yet by no means unlovable), are each and all finished portraits
                    of the best comic type, while almost as much may be said of the minor
                    characters. The style and dialogue are also worthy of the highest praise; the
                    wit never degenerates into mere “wit-combats.”</p>
                <p>It is, however, as a novelist that the world has agreed to remember Le Sage, and
                    the world as usual is right. A great deal of unnecessary labour has been spent
                    on the discussion of his claims to originality. What has been already said will
                    give a sufficient clue through this thorny ground. In mere form Le Sage is not
                    original. He does little more than adopt that of the Spanish picaroon romance of
                    the 16th and 17th century. Often, too, he prefers merely to rearrange and adapt
                    existing work, and still of tener to give himself a kind of start by adopting
                    the work of a preceding writer as a basis. But it may be laid down as a positive
                    truth that he never in any work that pretends to originality at all is guilty of
                    anything that can fairly be called plagiarism. Indeed we may go further, and say
                    that he is very fond of asserting or suggesting his indebtedness when he is
                    really dealing with his own funds. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Diable</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Boiteux</hi> borrows the title, and for a chapter too the plan and
                    almost the words, of the <hi rend="italic">Diablo Cojuelo</hi> of Luis Velez de
                    Guevara. But after a few pages Le Sage leaves his predecessor alone. Even the
                    plan of the Spanish original is entirely discarded, and the incidents, the
                    episodes, the style, are as independent as if such a book as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Diablo Cojuelo</hi> had never existed. The case of <hi
                    rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> is still more remarkable. It was at first alleged
                    that Le Sage had borrowed it from the <hi rend="italic">Marcos de Obregon</hi>
                    of Vincent Espinel, a curiously rash assertion, inasmuch as that work exists and
                    is easily accessible, and as the slightest consultation of it proves that,
                    though it furnished Le Sage with separate incidents and hints for more than one
                    of his books, <hi rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> as a whole is not in the least
                    indebted to it. Afterwards Father Isla asserted that <hi rend="italic">Gil
                    Blas</hi> was a mere translation from an actual Spanish book—an assertion at
                    once incapable of proof and disproof, inasmuch as there is no trace whatever of
                    any such book. A third hypothesis is that there was some manuscript original
                    which Le Sage may have worked up in his usual way, in the same way, for
                    instance, as he professes himself to have worked up the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bachelor of Salamanca.</hi> This also is in the nature of it incapable of
                    refutation, though the argument from the <hi rend="italic">Bachelor</hi> is
                    strong against it, for there could be no reason why Le Sage should be more
                    reticent of his obligations in the one case than in the other. Except, however,
                    for historical reasons, the controversy is one which may be safely neglected.
                    There is as little doubt (with the limitations already laid down) of the
                    originality of Le Sage as of that of any great writer in the world. <hi
                    rend="italic">Gil Blas</hi> then remains his property, and it is admittedly the
                    capital example of its own style. Fielding has been called the prose Homer of
                    human nature, but in the sense in which the expression was used it is doubtful
                    whether his master (as Le Sage certainly was) is not better entitled to the
                    term. For Le Sage has not only the characteristic which Homer and Shakespeare
                    have of absolute truth to human nature as distinguished from truth to this or
                    that national character, but he has what has been called the quality of
                    detachment, which they also have. He never takes sides with his characters as
                    Fielding does. Asmodeus and Don Cleofas, Gil Blas and the Archbishop and Doctor
                    Sangrado, are produced by him with exactly the same impartiality of attitude.
                    Except that he brought into novel writing tins highest quality of artistic
                    truth, it perhaps cannot be said that he did much to advance prose fiction in
                    itself. He invented, as had been said, no new <hi rend="italic">genre·,</hi> he
                    did not, as Marivaux and Prevost did, help on the novel as distinguished from
                    the romance. In form his books are undistinguishable, not merely from the
                    Spanish romances which are, as have been said, their direct originals, but from
                    the mediaeval <hi rend="italic">romans</hi><hi rend="italic">Tarent</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ures</hi> and the Greek prose romances. But in individual
                    excellence they have few rivals. Nor should it be forgotten, as it sometimes is,
                    that Le Sage was a great master of French style, the greatest unquestionably
                    between the classics of the 17th century and the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n493/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0493-0474"/> classics of the 18th. He is perhaps the last
                    great writer before the decadence (for since the time of Paul Louis Courier it
                    has not been denied that the τ⅛7osop7te period is in point of style a period of
                    decadence). His style is perfectly easy at the same time that it is often
                    admirably epigrammatic. It has plenty of colour, plenty of flexibility, and may
                    be said to be exceptionally well fitted for general literary work.</p>
                <p>The dates of the original editions of Le Sage’s most important works have already
                    been given. He published during his life a collection of his regular dramatic
                    works, and also one of his pieces for the Foire, but the latter is far from
                    exhaustive; nor is there any edition which can be called so, though the <hi
                    rend="italic">Oeuvres Choisies</hi> of 1782 and 1818 are useful. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Diable</hi><hi rend="italic">Boiteux</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gil Blas</hi> have been reprinted and translated numberless times. Both will be
                    found conveniently printed, together with <hi rend="italic">Estévanille</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gonzales</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guzman cl' Alfarache,</hi> the
                    best of the minor novels, in four volumes of Garnier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliothèque Amusante</hi> (Paris, 1865). <hi rend="italic">Turcaret</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Crispin</hi> are to be found in all collected editions of the
                    French drama. There is a useful edition of them, with ample specimens of Le
                    Sage’s work for the Foire, in two volumes (Paris, 1821 ). (G. SA. )</p>
