                <p><label type="entry">LEBANON</label>. The name of Mount Lebanon (Heb. P^2?), from
                    the Semitic root <hi rend="italic">laban,</hi> “to be white, or whitish,”
                    probably refers, not to the perpetual snow, but to the bare white walls of chalk
                    or limestone which form the characteristic feature of the whole range. Syria is
                    traversed by a branch thrown off almost at right angles from Mount Taurus in
                    Asia Minor, and Lebanon is the name of the central mountain mass of Syria,
                    extending for about 100 miles from north-north-east to south-south-west. It is
                    bounded W. by the sea, N. by the plain Jùn Akkâr, beyond which rise the
                    mountains of the Nusairieh, and E. by the inland plateau of Syria, mainly
                    steppe-land. To the south Lebanon ends about the point where the river Litâny
                    bends westward, and at Banias. A valley narrowing towards its southern end, and
                    now called El-Bukâ'a, divides the mountainous mass into two great parts. That
                    lying to the west is still called Jebel Libnân; the greater part of the eastern
                    mass now bears the name of the Eastern Mountain (Jebel el-Sharki). In Greek the
                    western range was called Libanos, the eastern Antilibanos.<note anchored="true"

                            The popular form Antilebanon is not legitimate.</p></note> The southern
                    extension of the latter, Mount <hi rend="smallcaps">Hermon</hi> (g ’.v.), may in
                    many respects be treated as a separate mountain.</p>
                <p>Lebanon and Antilibanus have many features in common; in both the southern
                    portion is less arid and barren than the northern, the western valleys better
                    wooded and more fertile than the eastern. In general the main elevations of the
                    two ranges form pairs lying opposite one another; the forms of both ranges are
                    monotonous, but the colouring splendid, especially when viewed from a distance;
                    when seen close at hand, indeed, only a few valleys with perennial streams offer
                    pictures of landscape beauty, their rich green contrasting pleasantly with the
                    bare brown and yellow mountain sides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> The Lebanon strati are generally inclined,
                    curved, and twisted, often vertical, seldom quite horizontal. Throughout the
                    whole of Syria the prevailing line of cleavage runs from north to south;
                    subordinate to this is another at right angles to it. The rocks belong to the
                    Middle Chalk system, and fall into four subdivisions. The first consists of an
                    under hippurite zone about 3000 feet thick. Sometimes light grey dolomites
                    boldly rise to a height of several hundred yards (as in Kesrawân); sometimes
                    masses of marble present equally grand mountain forms (Jezzin); sometimes again
                    friable marl and clay occur, producing rich pasture lands. The last member of
                    this lower zone is a brown oolite containing sponges, corals, and echinoderms,
                    amongst which the best known fossil is <hi rend="italic">Cidaris glandarius</hi>
                    (Salima). Here also belong the <hi rend="italic">Radiolaria</hi> of Hakel, above
                    which occurs the famous bed of fossil fishes. The second subdivision of the
                    Middle Chalk consists of a thick sandstone formation, distinguished by the
                    presence of <hi rend="italic">Trigonia scabra</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >syriaca,</hi> and by a fossil balsam poplar <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Nicolia).</hi> To the period of the formation of this member of the system
                    belong volcanic eruptions of melaphyre and basaltite, and also copious eruptions
                    of ashes, which are now met with as tufa in the neighbourhood of the igneous
                    rocks. These eruptive rocks, which every where have again been overlaid by the
                    thick sandstone, yield bitumen (mineral oils, asphalt, and dysodil), and have
                    also had a great influence upon the superficial aspect of the country, the
                    sandstone stratum (1300 to 1600 feet thick) having become the centre of its life
                    and fertility, inasmuch as here alone water can gather. In the third
                    subdivision, the Turon strictly so-called, oyster beds <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Ostrea</hi><hi rend="italic">africana')</hi> and a stratum of orbitulites
                    have the widest diffusion. Above the oysters come the ammonites <hi
                        rend="italic">(Ammonites syriacus,</hi> Von Buch). The fourth subdivision is
                    formed by a light grey chalk of the upper hippurite zone, which begins in the
                    Bukâ'a, and can be traced as far as to the Red Sea. The latest member is the
                    Eocene nummulite (especially in Antilibanus). Generally speaking the prevailing
                    colours are white in the first district, brown in the second, yellow in the
                    third, and grey in the fourth. Apart from the formations already named, there
                    only remain to be mentioned one or two more recent Tertiaries, which in some
                    cases may go back to the end of the Miocene period, but for the most part are
                    Pliocene. They are met with partly on the coast, being due to the action of the
                    sea (Tripoli), partly in the Bukâ'a (Zahleh), the result of the action of fresh
                    water. Finally, throughout the whole of the Lebanon district, there are
                    unmistakable traces of ice action in the shape of ground moraines and erratic
                    blocks. The glacier remains may practically be said to be associated with the
                    four chief streams (Nahr Kadisha, Jôz, Ibrâhîm, and Kelb).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The western versant has the common
                    characteristics of the flora of the Mediterranean coast, but the eastern portion
                    belongs to the poorer region of the steppes, and the Mediterranean species are
                    met with only sporadically along the water-courses. Forest and pasture land in
                    our sense of the word do not exist: the place of the first is for the most part
                    taken by a low brushwood; grass is not plentiful, and the higher ridges maintain
                    a growth of alpine plants only so long as patches of snow continue to lie. The
                    rock walls harbour some rock plants, but many absolutely barren wildernesses of
                    stone occur. (1) On the western versant, as we ascend, we have first, to a
                    height of 1600 feet, the coast region, similar to that of Syria in general and
                    of the south of Asia Minor. Characteristic trees are the locust tree and the
                    stone pine; in <hi rend="italic">Melia Azedarach</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ficus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sycomorus</hi> (Beyrout) we have an admixture
                    of foreign and partially subtropical elements. The great mass of the vegetation,
                    however, is of the low-growing type <hi rend="italic">(maquis</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">garrigue</hi> of the western Mediterranean), with small and
                    stiff leaves, and frequently thorny and aromatic, as for example the ilex <hi
                        rend="italic">(Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">coccifera),</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Smilax,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cistus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Lentiscus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Calycotome,</hi> &amp;c. (2) Next comes,
                    from 1600 to 6500 feet, the mountain region, which may also be called the forest
                    region, still exhibiting as it does sparse woods and isolated trees wherever
                    shelter, moisture, and the bad husbandry of the inhabitants have permitted their
                    growth. From 1600 to 3200 feet is a zone of dwarf hard-leaved oaks, amongst
                    which occur the Oriental forms <hi rend="italic">Fontanesia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">phillyraeoides,</hi><hi rend="italic">Acer syriacum,</hi> and
                    the beautiful red-stemmed <hi rend="italic">Arbutus Andrachne.</hi> Higher up,
                    between 3700 feet and 4200 feet, a tall pine, <hi rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Brutia,</hi> Ten., is characteristic. Between 4200 and 6200
                    feet is the region of the two most interesting forest trees of Lebanon, the
                    cypress and the cedar. The former still grows thickly, especially in the valley
                    of the Kadisha; the horizontal is the prevailing variety. In the upper Kadisha
                    valley there is a cedar grove of about three hundred trees, amongst which five
                    are of gigantic size; it is alleged that other specimens occur elsewhere in
                    Lebanon. The <hi rend="italic">Cedrus Libani</hi> is intermediate between the
                        <hi rend="italic">Cedrus</hi><hi rend="italic">Deodara</hi> and the <hi

                    oaks— <hi rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Hellul, Q.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">subalpina</hi> (Kotschy), <hi rend="italic">Q.</hi><hi

                        rend="italic">(Abies cilicica')</hi> may be noticed. Next come the junipers,
                    sometimes attaining the size of trees <hi rend="italic">(Juniperus
                        excelsa,</hi><hi rend="italic">J.</hi><hi rend="italic">rufescens,</hi> and,
                    with fruit as large as plums, <hi rend="italic">J. drupacea).</hi> But the chief
                    ornament of Lebanon is the <hi rend="italic">Rhododendron ponticum,</hi> with
                    its brilliant purple flower clusters; a peculiar evergreen, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vinca libanotica,</hi> also adds beauty to this zone. (3) Into the alpine
                    region (6200 to 10,400 feet) penetrate a few very stunted oaks <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Quercus subalpina,</hi> Kotschy), the junipers already mentioned, and a
                    barberry <hi rend="italic">(Berberis</hi><hi rend="italic">cretica),</hi> which
                    sometimes spreads into close thickets. Then follow the low, dense, prone,
                    pillow-like dwarf bushes, thorny and grey, common to the Oriental highlands— <hi
                        rend="italic">Astragalus</hi> and the peculiar <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acaηtholimon.</hi> They are found up to within 300 feet of the highest
                    summits. Upon the exposed mountain slopes rhubarb <hi rend="italic">(Rheum
                        Ribes)</hi> is noticeable, and also a vetch <hi rend="italic">(Vicia
                        canescens,</hi> Lab.) excellent for sheep. The spring vegetation, which
                    lasts until July, appears to be rich, especially as regards corollabearing
                    plants, such as <hi rend="italic">Corydalis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Gagea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Bidbillaria,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    &lt;kc. The flora of the highest ridges, along the edges of the snow patches,
                    exhibits no forms related to our northern alpine flora, but suggestions of it
                    are found in a <hi rend="italic">Draba,</hi> an <hi rend="italic"
                        >Androsace,</hi> an <hi rend="italic">Al sine,</hi> and a violet, occurring,
                    however, only in local species. Upon the highest summits are found <hi
                        rend="italic">Saponaria</hi><hi rend="italic">Pumilio</hi> (resembling our
                        <hi rend="italic">Silene</hi><hi rend="italic">acaulis)</hi> and varieties

                        rend="italic">demissus.</hi> The alpine flora of Lebanon thus connects
                    itself directly with the Oriental flora of lower altitudes, and is unrelated to
                    the glacial flora of Europe and northern Asia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Zoology.—</hi> There is nothing of special interest about the
                    fauna of Lebanon. Bears are no longer numerous; the panther and the ounce are
                    met with; the wild hog, hyaena, wolf, and fox are by no means rare; jackals and
                    gazelles are very common. The polecat and hedgehog also occur. As a rule there
                    are not many birds, but the eagle and the vulture may occasionally be seen; of
                    eatable kinds partridges and wild pigeons are the most abundant. In some places
                    the bat occasionally multiplies so as actually to become a plague.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geography.—</hi> The district to the west of Lebanon, averaging
                    about six hours in breadth, slopes in an intricate series of plateaus and
                    terraces to the Mediterranean. The coast is for the most part abrupt and rocky,
                    often leaving room for only a narrow path along the shore, and when viewed from
                    the sea it does not lead one to have the least suspicion of the extent of
                    country lying between its cliffs and the lofty summits behind. Most of the
                    mountain spurs run from east to west, but in northern Lebanon the prevailing
                    direction of the valleys is north-westerly, and in the south some ridges also
                    run parallel with the principal chain. The valleys have for the most part been
                    deeply excavated by the rapid mountain streams which traverse them; the
                    apparently inaccessible heights are crowned by numerous villages, castles, or
                    cloisters embosomed among trees. Of the streams which are perennial, the most
                    worthy of note, beginning from the north, are the Nahr Akkâr, N. Arkr, N.
                    el-Bârid, N. Kadisha, “the holy river” (the valley of which begins far up in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of the highest summits, and rapidly descends in a series
                    of great bends till the river reaches the sea at Tripoli), Wâdy el-Jôz (falling
                    into the sea at Batπin), Wâdy Fidâr, Nahr Ibrâhîm (the ancient Adonis, having
                    its source in a recess of the great mountain amphitheatre where the famous
                    sanctuary Apheca, the modern Afka, lay), Nahr el-Kelb (the ancient Lycus), Nahr
                    Beirüt (the ancient Magoras, entering the sea at Beyrout), Nahr Dâmûr (ancient
                    Tam-yras), Nahr el-'Auwaly (the ancient Bostrenus, which in the upper part of
                    its course is joined by the Nahr el-Bariιk). The 'Auwaly and the Nahr
                    el-Zaherâni, the only other streams that fall to be mentioned before we reach
                    the Litâny, flow north-east to south-west, in consequence of the interposition
                    of a ridge subordinate and parallel to the central chain. On the north, where
                    the mountain bears the special name of Jebel Akkâr, the main ridge of Lebanon
                    rises gradually from the plain. A number of valleys run to the north and
                    north-east, among which must be mentioned that of the Nahr el-Kebir, the
                    Eleutherus of the ancients, which takes its rise in the Jebel el-Abyad on the
                    eastern slope of Lebanon, and afterwards, skirting the district, flows westward
                    to the sea. To the south of Jebel el-Abyad, beneath the main ridge, which as a
                    rule falls away suddenly towards the east, occur several small elevated terraces
                    having a southward slope; among these the Wâdi en-Nusûr (“vale of eagles”), and
                    the basin of the lake Yammûna, with its intermittent spring Neb'a el-Arba'in,
                    deserve special mention. Of the streams which descend into the Bukâ'a, only the
                    Berdâni need be named; it rises in Jebel Sunnin, and enters the plain by a deep
                    and picturesque mountain cleft at Zahleh. With regard to height, the most
                    elevated summits occur in the north, but even these are of very gentle gradient,
                    and are ascended quite easily. The names and the elevations of the several
                    peaks, which even in summer are covered with snow, have been very variously
                    given by different explorers; according to the most accurate accounts the “Cedar
                    block” consists of a double line of four and three summits respectively, ranged
                    from north to south, with a deviation of about 35°. Those to the east are 'Uyùn
                    Urghush, Makmal, Muskiyya (or Naba' esh-Shemaila), and Râs Zahr el-Kazib;
                    fronting the sea are Karn Saudâ or Timârun, Fumm el-Mizâb, and Zahr el-Kandil.
                    The height of Zahr el-Kazib, by barometric measurement, is 10,018 feet; that of
                    the others is almost the same. South from them is the pass (8351 feet) which
                    leads from Baalbec to Tripoli; the great mountain amphitheatre on the west side
                    of its summit is remarkable. Further to the south is a second group of lofty
                    summits—the snow-capped Sunnin, visible from Beyrout; its height is 8554 feet,
                    or, according to other accounts, 8895 feet. Between this group and the more
                    southerly Jebel Kuneiseh (about 6700 feet) lies the pass (4700 feet) now
                    traversed by the French post road between Beyrout and Damascus. Among the other
                    bare summits still further south are the long ridge of Jebel el-Barιik (about
                    7000 feet), the Jebel Niha, with the Tau'amat Niha (about 6100 feet), near which
                    is a pass to Sidon, and the Jebel Rihân (about 5400 feet).</p>
                <p>The Bukâ'a, the broad valley which separates Lebanon from Antilibanus, is watered
                    by two rivers having their watershed near Baalbec, at an elevation of about 3600
                    feet, and separated only by a short mile at their sources. That flowing
                    northwards, El-*Asy, is the ancient Orontes; the other is the Litâny. In the
                    lower part of its course the latter has scooped out for itself a deep and narrow
                    rocky bed; at Burghuz it is spanned by a great natural bridge. Not far from the
                    point where it suddenly trends to the west lie, immediately above the romantic
                    valley, at an elevation of 1500 feet, the imposing ruins of the old castle KaΓat
                    esh-Shakif, near one of the passes to Sidon. In its lower part the Litâny bears
                    the name of Nahr el-Kasimiyeh. Neither the Orontes nor the Litâny has any
                    important affluent.</p>
                <p>The Bukâ'a used to be known as Coelesyria (Strabo, xvi. 2, 21), but that word as
                    cmployed by .the ancients had a <pb break="no"

                    its full name is BukA'a el-'Aziz (the dear BukA'a), and its northern portion is
                    known as Sahlet Ba <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> albek (the plain of Baalbec).
                    The valley is from 4 to 6 miles broad, with an undulating surface. It is said to
                    contain one hundred and thirty-seven hamlets or settlements, the larger of which
                    skirt the hills, while the smaller, consisting of mud hovels, stand upon dwarf
                    mounds, the debris of ages. The whole valley could be much more richly
                    cultivated than it is at present; but fever is frequent.</p>
                <p>The Antilibanus chain has in many respects been much less fully explored than
                    that of Lebanon. Apart from its southern offshoots it is 67 miles long, while
                    its width varies from 16 to 13⅛ miles. It rises from the plain of Hasya-Homs,
                    and in its northern portion is very arid and barren. The range has not so many
                    offshoots as occur on the west side of Lebanon; under its precipitous slopes
                    stretch table-lands and broad plateaus, which, especially on the east side
                    looking towards the steppe, steadily increase in width. Along the western side
                    of northern Antilibanus stretches the KhashA'a, a rough red region lined with
                    juniper trees, a succession of the hardest limestone crests and ridges,
                    bristling with bare rock and crag that shelter tufts of vegetation, and are
                    divided by a succession of grassy ravines. On the eastern side the parallel
                    valley of 'Asal el-Ward deserves special mention; the descent towards the plain
                    eastwards, as seen for example at Ma'lιila, is singular,— first a spacious
                    amphitheatre and then two deep very narrow gorges. The perennial streams that
                    take their rise in Antilibanus are not numerous; one of the finest and best
                    watered valleys is that of Helbùn, the ancient Chalybon, the Helbon of Ezek.
                    xxvii. 18. The highest points of the range, reckoning from the north, are
                    Halimat el-Kabu (8257 feet), which has a splendid view; the Fatly block,
                    including TaΓat Mûsa (8721 feet) and the adjoining Jebel Nebi BArιih (7900
                    feet); and a third group near BlιidAn, in which the most prominent names are
                    Shakif, AkhyAr, and Abu’l-Hin (8330 feet). Of the valleys descending westward
                    the first to claim mention is the Wady Yafιifa; a little further to the south,
                    lying north and south, is the rich upland valley of ZebedAni, where the BaradA
                    has its highest sources. Pursuing an easterly course of several hours, this
                    stream receives the waters of the romantic 'Ain Fije (which doubles its volume),
                    and bursts out by a rocky gateway upon the plain of Damascus, in the irrigation
                    of which it is the chief agent. It is the Amana of 2 Kings V. 12; the portion of
                    Antilibanus traversed by it was also called by the same name (Cant. iv. 8). The
                    French post road after leaving the BukA'a first enters a little valley running
                    north and south, where a projecting ridge of Antilibanus bears the ruins of the
                    ancient cities Chalcis and Gerrha. It next traverses the gorge of WAdy el-Harir,
                    the level upland Sahlet Judeideh, the ravine of WAdy el-Karn, the ridge of
                    'Akabat et-Tin, the descent Daurat el-BillAn, and finally the unpeopled plain of
                    DimAs, from which it enters the valley of BaradA. This route marks the southern
                    boundary of Antilibanus proper, where the Hermon group begins (vol. xi. p. 751).
                    From the point where this continuation of Antilibanus begins to take a more
                    westerly direction, a low ridge shoots out towards the south-west, trending
                    further and further away from the eastern chain and narrowing the BukA'a; upon
                    the eastern side of this ridge lies the elevated valley or hilly stretch known
                    as WAdy et-Teim. In the north, beside 'Ain FAlιij, it is connected by a low
                    watershed with the BukA'a; from the gorge of the LitAny it is separated by the
                    ridge of Jebel ed-Dahr. At its southern end it contracts and merges into the
                    plain of Banias, thus enclosing Mount Hermon on its north-west and west sides;
                    eastward from the HasbAny branch of the Jordan lies the meadow-land Merj 'lyùn,
                    the ancient Ijon (1 Kings xv. 20).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Political Divisions and Population. —</hi> The inhabitants of
                    Lebanon have at no time played a conspicuous part in history. There are remains
                    of prehistoric occupation, but we do not even know what races dwelt there in the
                    historical period of antiquity. Probably they belonged partly to Canaanite, but
                    chiefly to the Aramaean group of nationalities; the Bible mentions Hivites
                    (Judg. iii. 3) and Giblites (Josh, xiii. 5). A portion of the western coast land
                    was always, it may be assumed, in the hands of the Phoenician states, and it is
                    possible that once and again their sovereignty may have extended even into the
                    Buka a. Lebanon was also included within the ideal boundaries of the land of
                    Israel, and the whole region was well known to the Hebrews, by whose poets its
                    many excellences are often praised. In the Roman period the district of Phcenice
                    extended into Lebanon; in the 2d century it, along with the inland districts
                    pertaining to it, constituted a subdivision of the province of Syria, having
                    Emesa (Homs) for its capital; from the time of Diocletian there was a Phcenice
                    ad Libanum, with Emesa as capital, as well as a Phoenice Maritima of which Tyre
                    was the chief city. Remains of the Roman period occur throughout Lebanon, and
                    more especially in Hermon, in the shape of small temples in more or less perfect
                    preservation; for the more splendid ruins of Baalbec see that article (vol. iii.
                    p. 176). Although Christianity early obtained a footing in Lebanon, the pagan
                    worship, and even human sacrifice, nevertheless survived for a long time,
                    especially in remote valleys such as Afka. The present inhabitants are for the
                    most part of Syrian (Aramaean) descent; Islam and the Arabs have at no time
                    penetrated very deep into the mountain land. At present the eastern range
                    belongs to the vilayet of Damascus (Soria), of which Damascus itself constitutes
                    the first subdivision (mutasaτriflik); the subordinate divisions (kazas) of the
                    government are Damascus, Baalbec, Hasbaya, Rashaya, and Buka <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> a Gharbi or Western BukA'a. Included within the
                    vilayet of Soria, but with an independent administration, is the government of
                    Lebanon properly so called, a region some 87 miles long, which in virtue of an
                    ordinance published by the Porte in concert with the protecting powers in 1861
                    and revised in 1864 is ruled by a governor, who must be a Christian, indirect
                    dependence on Constantinople. The seat of the pasha is at present at Ba'abda, 6
                    miles south-east from Beyrout, his summer residence being at Bteddin. The
                    pashalik is subdivided into the lieutenancies of Jurd, Batπin, KasrawAn, Metn,
                    Zahle, Shuf, and Jezzin. A somewhat different account of the districts is given
                    in the statistical statement (1875) of the English consul at Beyrout:—</p>

                <p>The statistics accompanying the French map of 1862 give the population of Lebanon
                    proper as some 100,000 in excess of these figures, but there can be no doubt of
                    the inaccuracy of this estimate. The same authority gives the districts (taken
                    in order from north to south) as follow :—Akkar, ed-Dunniye, el-Kura (Upper and
                    Lower), ez-ZAwiye, Bsherre, Batnin, Jebeil, Muneitira, el-Fetùh, Kesrawan,

                <p>The Maronites, as the preceding statistics show, are the principal element of the
                    Lebanon population; for the <hi rend="smallcaps">Druses,</hi> see vol. vii. p.
                    483. The MetAwile, who enjoy no good reputation, are Shi'ite Mohammedans; their
                    sheikh resides at Jeba'a in South Lebanon. Of late years Protestantism, through
                    the agency of the American mission at Beyrout, has begun to take some hold of
                    the population, and is daily gaining ground. The Catholic missions also, with
                    Beyrout for their centre, are meeting with some success, and the Western schools
                    are indisputably affecting the culture and manners of the country. The present
                    comparative security of life and property are highly favourable to its
                    development. Since the violent outbreak of 1860, the bloody contests between the
                    Maronites and Druses have not been renewed, although the mutual hatred still
                    continues. To what has been already said on this subject (voL vii. p. 485), it
                    may here be added that the primary object of the Lebanon mountaineers is before
                    everything the maintenance of their national freedom, and that the
                    responsibility for the massacres of 1860 rests chiefly upon the Turkish
                    Government (Ahmet Pasha of Damascus). The property of the Maronites had been
                    promised to the Druses, and the Maronites on the other hand had been persuaded
                    to disarm; as soon as the latter had done so they were attacked by Druses and
                    Turks together. In Deir el-Kamar alone, the chief place of South Lebanon,
                    eighteen hundred Maronites perished. Since the pacification of the country by
                    foreign intervention, particularly on the part of Napoleon HL, the Druses have
                    withdrawn more into the inaccessible Hauran. Although every inhabitant of
                    Lebanon still retains his warrior habits, and willingly enough joins the
                    highland troops (six hundred regular soldiers), the situation is now much more
                    pacific, a circumstance due in large measure to the fact that the power of the
                    numerous noble families has been much curtailed. On the other hand the clergy,
                    although for the most part an extremely uneducated body of men, has great
                    influence among the Maronites. The number of Maronite monks in the mountain
                    district is said to reach eight thousand. The monasteries possess a large
                    portion of the best land, which is cultivated by the monks themselves, and is
                    quite exempt from all public burdens. Other land is liable to be taxed annually
                    at the rate of 3s. 6d. upon every <hi rend="italic">£55</hi> of assessed value;
                    there is, besides, a poll tax exigible from every healthy male from the age of
                    fourteen until he becomes unfit for work. The village head (sheikh), for every
                    .£8 of taxes, is entitled to exact from the inhabitants 4s. for his own
                    remuneration. Every inhabitant must devote to the public service four days of
                    free labour in the year. The gross revenue of Lebanon, which amounts to about
                    £32,000 per annum, does not cover the expenses of administration.</p>
                <p>The Lebanon mountaineers are a fine vigorous set of men. In what relates to dress
                    they show a preference for gay colours. Tattooing is universal in both sexes.
                    Their diligence is worthy of all praise. In the upper regions cattle breeding is
                    the chief occupation; the numerous flocks of sheep and goats are the great
                    obstacle to forestry in these parts. No care is taken to protect the woods. For
                    practical utility the trees which are planted (besides various fruit trees,
                    especially figs) are the white poplar (for building purposes), the walnut, the
                    olive, and above all the mulberry,—silk culture being an important industry with
                    the mountain population, and still remunerative notwithstanding the occasional
                    fall of prices. In 1872 the production amounted to 2,000,000 okes (about
                    5,000,000 &amp;) of fresh cocoons, from which 1,200,000 okes of raw silk and
                    200,000 okes of silk fabrics were produced, the latter exclusively for home use.
                    The vine is cultivated, and with great care, at an elevation of 3900 to 5200
                    feet. Unfortunately the wine is simply stored in large stone jars, there being
                    neither barrels nor cellars; the consequence is that it cannot be kept—in point
                    of fact it is seldom more than a year old—and exportation is impossible. The
                    excellent Lebanon white wine known as vino d’oro belongs to the class of sweet
                    wines. Amongst the mineral products coal deserves special mention; the beds are
                    thick, but the presence of iron pyrites prevents it from coming into more
                    general use. Some shafts, from which bitumen is obtained, occur in the
                    neighbourhood of Hasbaya; also petroleum wells. The chief food crops are wheat,
                        <hi rend="italic">Holcus</hi><hi rend="italic">sorghum,</hi> and barley, the
                    last being cultivated as high as 6500 feet above the sea. Tobacco culture is
                    universal.</p>
                <p>Throughout the whole of Lebanon, but especially on the slope towards the sea,
                    carefully tended terraces occur. The houses, little four-cornered boxes,
                    generally shaded by a walnut or fig tree, stand as a rule upon the slope; the
                    roof is formed by pine stems upon which other timber, brushwood, and finally a
                    coating of mud clay are laid. Under good government Lebanon, with its able and
                    vigorous population, would rapidly develop.</p>
