                    Matura, Ceylon, on 28th June 1806 (see last article). He inherited his father’s
                    stern devotion to duty and Celtic impulsiveness, tempered by his mother’s
                    gentleness and power of organization. Early in 1823 he joined the Bengal
                    Artillery at the Calcutta suburb of Dum Dum where also Havelock was stationed
                    about the same time. The two officers pursued a very similar career, and
                    developed the same Puritan character up to the time that both passed away at
                    Lucknow in 1857. In the first Burmese war Henry Lawrence and his guns formed
                    part of the Chittagong column which General Morrison led over the jungly hills
                    of Arakan, till fever decimated the officers and men, and the lieutenant found
                    himself at home again, wasted by a disease which never left him. On his return
                    to India with his younger brother John in 1829 he was appointed revenue surveyor
                    by Lord William Bentinck. At Gorakhpur the wonderful personal influence which
                    radiated from the young officer formed a school of attached friends and
                    subordinates who were always eager to serve under him. After some years spent in
                    camp, during which he had married his cousin Honoria Marshall, and had surveyed
                    every village in four districts each larger than Yorkshire, he was recalled to a
                    brigade by the outbreak of the first Afghan war towards the close of 1838. As
                    assistant to Sir George Clerk, he now added to his knowledge of the people
                    political experience in the management of the district of Firozpur; and when
                    disaster came he was sent to Peshawar in order to push up supports for the
                    relief of Sale and the garrison of Jalalabad. The war had been begun under the
                    tripartite treaty signed at Lahore on 20th June 1838. But the Sikhs <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0390-0373"/> were slow to play their part when the calamities
                    in Afghanistan made it possible that the British might be driven south of the
                    Jumna. No one but Henry Lawrence could manage the disorderly contingent which
                    they reluctantly supplied to Pollock’s avenging army in 1842. He helped to force
                    the Khyber Pass on 5th April, playing his guns from the heights, for eight and
                    twenty miles. In recognition of his services Lord Ellenborough appointed him to
                    the charge of the charming valley of Dehra Dun and its hill stations, Mussuri
                    and Landaur, where he first formed the idea of asylums for the children of
                    European soldiers. After a month’s experience there it was discovered that the
                    coveted appointment was the legal right of the civil service, and he was
                    transferred, as assistant to the envoy at Lahore, to Ambala, where he reduced to
                    order the lapsed territory of Kaithal. Soon he received the well-paid office of
                    resident at the protected court of Nepal, amid the rest of which, assisted by
                    his noble wife, he began a series of contributions to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calcutta Review,</hi> a selected volume of which forms an Anglo-Indian classic.
                    There, too, he elaborated his plans which resulted in the erection and endowment
                    of the noblest philanthropic establishments in the East—the Lawrence military
                    asylums at SanAwar (on the road to Simla), at Murree in the Punjab, at Mount Abu
                    in Rajputana, and on the Madras Nilgiris. From 1844 to his death he devoted all
                    his comparatively large income, above a modest pittance for his children, to
                    this and other forms of catholic Christian charity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> articles led the new governor-general, Lord
                    Hardinge, to summon Lawrence to his side during the first Sikh war; and not
                    these articles only. He had published the results of his experience of Sikh rule
                    and soldiering in a vivid work, the <hi rend="italic">Adventures of an Officer
                    in the Service of Ranjit Singh</hi> (1845), in which he vainly attempted to
                    disguise his own personality and exploits. For the next four years he virtually
                    became Ranjit Singh’s successor in the government of the Punjab. After the
                    doubtful triumphs of Mudki and Firozshah Lawrence was summoned from Nepal to
                    take the place of the heroic Major George Broadfoot, who had fallen. Aliwal
                    came; then the guns of Sobraon chased the demoralized Sikhs across the Sutlej.
                    All through the smoke Lawrence was at the side of the chivalrous
                    governor-general. He gave his voice, not for the rescue of the people from
                    anarchy by annexation, but for the reconstruction of the Sikh government, and
                    was himself appointed resident at Lahore, with power “over every department and
                    to any extent” as president of the council of regency till the maharaja Dhalip
                    Singh should come of age. Soon disgusted by the “venal and selfish durbar” who
                    formed his Sikh colleagues, he summoned to his side assistants like Nicholson,
                    James Abbott, and Edwardes, till they all did too much for the people, as he
                    regretfully confessed. But “my chief confidence was in my brother John, . . .
                    who gave me always such help as only a brother could.” Wearied out he went home
                    with Lord Hardinge, and was made K.C.B., when the second Sikh war summoned him
                    back at the end of 1848 to see the whole edifice of Sikh “reconstruction”
                    collapse. It fell to the marquis of Dalhousie to proclaim the Punjab up to the
                    Khyber British territory on 29th March 1849. But still another compromise was
                    tried. As the best man to reconcile the Sikh chiefs to the inevitable, Henry
                    Lawrence was made president of the new board of administration with charge of
                    the political duties, and his brother John was entrusted with the finances. John
                    could not find the revenue necessary for the rapid civilization of the new
                    province so long as Henry would, for political reasons, insist on granting life
                    pensions and alienating large estates to the needy and sensual remnants of
                    Ranjit Singh’s court. Lord Dalhousie delicately but firmly removed Sir Henry
                    Lawrence to the charge of the great nobles of Rajputana, and installed John as
                    chief commissioner. If resentment burned in Henry’s heart, it was not against
                    his younger brother, who would fain have retired. To him he said, “If you
                    preserve the peace of the country and make the people high and low happy, I
                    shall have no regrets that I vacated the field for you.”</p>
                <p>In the comparative rest of Rajputana he once more took up the pen as an army
                    reformer. In March and September 1856 he published two articles, called forth by
                    conversations with Lord Dalhousie at Calcutta, whither he had gone as the hero
                    of a public banquet. The governorgeneral had vainly warned the home authorities
                    against reducing below 40,000 the British garrison of India even for the Crimean
                    campaigns, and had sought to improve the position of the sepoys. Lawrence
                    pointed out the latent causes of mutiny, and uttered warnings only to be too
                    soon justified. In March 1857 he yielded to Lord Canning’s request that he
                    should then take the helm at Lucknow, but it was too late. In ten days his magic
                    rule put down administrative difficulties indeed, as he had done at Lahore. But
                    what could even he effect with only 700 European soldiers, when the epidemic
                    spread after the Meerut outbreak of mutiny on 10th May? In one week he had
                    completed those preparations which made the defence of the Lucknow residency for
                    ever memorable. Amid the deepening gloom Lord Canning ever wrote home of him as
                    “a tower of strength,” and he was appointed provisional governor-general. On the
                    30th May mutiny burst forth in Oudh, and he was ready. On 29th June, pressed by
                    fretful colleagues, and wasted by unceasing toil, he led 336 British soldiers
                    with 11 guns and 220 natives out to Chinhat to reconnoitre the insurgents, when
                    the natives joined the enemy and the residency was besieged. On 2d July, as he
                    lay exhausted by the day’s work and the terrific heat in an exposed room, a shot
                    struck him, and in forty-eight hours he was no more. A baronetcy was conferred
                    on his son. A marble statue was placed in St Paul’s as the national memorial of
                    one who has been declared to be the noblest man that has lived and died for the
                    good of India.</p>
                <p>The authorities for his career, besides his own writings above mentioned, are his

                    published by Parliament. His form was tall, spare, and wasted, as is best seen
