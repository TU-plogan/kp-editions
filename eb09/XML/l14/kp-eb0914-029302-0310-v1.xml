                <p><label type="entry">LAON</label>, capital of the department of Aisne, France, is
                    situated 87 miles N.E. of Paris, on an isolated and singularly buttressed hill,
                    which rises some 330 feet above the surrounding plain and the little river of
                    Ardon, which flows into the Lette, a tributary of the Oise. From the railway
                    station, which is situated in the plain to the north, a straight staircase of
                    several hundred steps leads up to the gate of the town, but all the roads
                    connecting Laon with the surrounding district are cut in zigzags on the steep
                    slopes, which are crowned by the old and partly ruinous ramparts. At the eastern
                    extremity of the hill rises the citadel; at the other end is a parade-ground,
                    and on the south stands the ancient abbey of St Vincent. Between the latter and
                    the town is the Cuve St Vincent, the slopes of which are covered with trees,
                    vegetable gardens, and vineyards. From the promenade along the line of the
                    ramparts there is an extensive view northward to beyond St Quentin, westward to
                    the forest of St Gobain, and southward over the wooded hills of the Lnonnais and
                    Soissonnais.</p>

                <p>The cathedral of Laon is one of the most important creations of the art of the
                    12th and 13th centuries. It took the place of the old cathedral, burned at the
                    beginning of the communal struggles mentioned below. The building is cruciform,
                    and the choir, instead of being apsidal, terminates in a straight wall. Each of
                    the three façades formerly had two towers with spires, and there was also a
                    great central tower. Of these only four remain, and, being without spires, they
                    give the building the aspect of a strong castle. The west front ranks next to
                    that of Notre Dame at Paris in purity. The chapter house and the cloister
                    contain beautiful specimens of the architecture of the beginning of the 13th
                    century. The old episcopal palace, contiguous to the cathedral, is now used as a
                    court-house. The front, flanked by turrets, is pierced by great Pointed windows.
                    There is also a Gothic cloister and an old chapel of two stories, of a date
                    anterior to the cathedral. The church of St Martin dates from the middle of the
                    12th century. The old abbey buildings of the same foundation are now used as the
                    hospital. The old 12th century chapel of the Templars now forms part of the
                    establishment of the Brothers of Christian Doctrine. The church of the suburb of
                    Vaux near the railway station dites from the 11th century. Numerous cellars of
                    two or three stories have taken the place of the old quarries in the hill-side.
                    The old ramparts have been demolished, but the 13th century gates of Ardon,
                    Royer, and Chenizelles have been preserved. The Société Académique of Laon has
                    collected in its museum of arts and antiquities many archaeological treasures,
                    among others a striking. Roman mosaic of the 2d century, representing Orpheus
                    charming the animals by his lyre, and some Roman ewers, noticeable for quality
                    of metal and purity of form. The communal library contains 30,000 volumes,
                    mostly from the neighbouring convents; it has also interesting manuscripts and
                    autographs, the most ancient of which, signed by Lothair, bears date 972. Laon
                    owes its rank as capital of the department to its central position and to its
                    age; it numbers only 12,000 inhabitants, and has hardly any trade. The
                    surrounding district produces vegetables and beet root; the latter crop supplies
                    the sugar-works, which come close to the foot of the hill; but in the town
                    itself the only industries are coopering and the manufacture of blankets and
                    common woollen stuffs.</p>
                <p>In virtue of its geographical position, the hilly district of Laon has always had
                    some strategic importance. Even in the time of Caesar there was a Gallic village
                    where the Remi (inhabitants of the country round Rheims) had to meet the onset
                    of the confederated Belgi. Whatever may have been the precise locality of that
                    battlefield, Laon was fortified by the Romans, and successively checked the
                    invasions of the Franks, Burgundians, Vandals, Alani, and Huns. St Remigius, the
                    famous archbishop of Rheims who baptized Clovis, was born in the Laonnais, and
                    it was he who instituted the bishopric of the town. Thenceforward Laon was one
                    of the principal towns of the kingdom of the Franks, and the possession of it
                    was often disputed. Charles the Bald had enriched its church with the gift of
                    very numerous domains. After the fall of the Carlovingians Laon took the part of
                    Charles of Lorraine, their heir, and Hugh Capet only succeeded in making himself
                    master of the town by the connivance of the bishop, who, in return for this
                    service, was made second ecclesiastical peer ot the kingdom. Early in the 12th
                    century the communes of France set about emancipating themselves, and the
                    history of the commune of Laon is one of the richest and most varied. The
                    citizens had profited by a temporary absence of Bishop Gaudri to secure for
                    themselves from his representatives a communal charter, but he, on his return,
                    purchased from the king of France the revocation of this document, and
                    recommenced his oppressions. The consequence was a revolt, in which the
                    episcopal palace was burnt and several of his partisans were put to death. The
                    fire spread to the cathedral, and reduced it to ashes. Uneasy at the result of
                    their victory, the rioters went into hiding outside the town, which was anew
                    pillaged by the people of the neighbourhood, eager to avenge the death of their
                    bishop. The king alternately interfered in favour of the bishop and of the
                    inhabitants till 1239. After that date the liberties of Laon were no more
                    contested. But it retained its strategic importance, and during the Hundred
                    Years’ War it was attacked and taken by the Burgundians, who gave it up to the
                    English, to be retaken by the French after the consecration of Charles VII.
                    Under the League Laon took the part of the Leaguers, and was taken by Henry IV.
                    During the campaign of 1814 Napoleon tried in vain to dislodge Blücher from it.
                    In 1870 an engineer blew up the powder magazine of the citadel at the moment
                    when the German troops were entering the town. Many lives were lost; and the
                    cathedral and the old episcopal palace were damaged by the explosion. At the
                    Revolution Laon permanently lost its rank as a bishopric.</p>
