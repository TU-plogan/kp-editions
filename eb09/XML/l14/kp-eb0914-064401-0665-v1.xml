                    department and province of Lima, is situated on an extensive plain, 500 feet
                    above the sea-level, and 7 miles east from its port Callao on the Pacific coast,
                    in 12° 2' 34" S. lat., 77° 7' 36" W. long. The general configuration of the main
                    portion of the city, previous to 1870 surrounded by walls, is that of an
                    irregular triangle, whose base rests on the river Rimae, which separates the
                    city from its offshoot or suburb of San Lazaro. Sheltered on the north and east
                    by the spurs of the Andes, the city is exposed to the winds prevailing from the
                    south-east, as also to those from the south and west. Although the atmosphere is
                    moist, and the transitions of the seasons are rapid, the climate is not
                    unhealthy, the rainfall being slight, and the variations of temperature not
                    excessive. The summer commences in December, and the winter in June, and the
                    mean temperature for the year is about 73° Fahr. The city is divided into five
                    quarters or parishes, and is well laid out with broad and regular thoroughfares,
                    the streets intersecting one another at right angles. The houses are spacious,
                    but generally of only two stories, and are approached by portals leading into an
                    open court or yard. In the principal square, which covers an area of 9 English
                    acres in the centre of the city, stands a fine fountain of bronze. Here also are
                    the cathedral, a stone structure with two lofty towers and a broad façade, the
                    archiepiscopal palace, the Government house, and the Portal de los Escribanos,
                    containing the municipal offices and archives. Besides the cathedral there are
                    five chief parochial and sixty-two other churches and chapels, and numerous
                    monasteries and convents. Of the churches, the largest is that of San Pedro
                    (1598), which has seventeen altars; of the religious houses that of the
                    Dominicans is the finest, and that of the Franciscans the most extensive. The
                    university, built in 1576, is the oldest in America; it contains the hall and
                    offices used by the chamber of deputies. Lima has more than seventy schools, a
                    public library containing upwards of forty thousand volumes, and many charitable
                    institutions, several of them connected with the religious orders. The principal
                    place of amusement is the amphitheatre for bullfights in the Plaza del Acho,
                    accommodating nine thousand spectators. In the Plaza de la Exposicion is a
                    marble statue of Columbus unveiling a figure of America. Of the many other
                    monuments in Lima the most famous is the bronze equestrian statue of Simon
                    Bolivar in the Plaza de la Independencia (or de Bolivar), 11 tons in weight,
                    commemorating the battle of Ayacucho, which secured the independence of Peru.
                    Among the public promenades are reckoned the cemetery outside the Maravillas
                    gate, and the Paseo de la Alameda de los Descalzos, in the centre of which is a
                    gorgeous garden. As the capital of Peru, Lima is one of the most important
                    trading centres in South America. It has, however, but few home industries, its
                    manufactured goods being chiefly imported from Europe <hi rend="italic">via</hi>
                    Callao, the medium of nearly all its foreign commerce. Several attempts have
                    from time to time been made to establish factories, but the high <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0666-0645"/> price of labour has hitherto prevented any
                    efforts on a large scale being permanently successful. There are, however,
                    manufactories for tallow, soap, sperm candles, glue, gold lace, gilt leather,
                    and silver filigree work, and the capital supplies the towns of the republic
                    with coarse woollen fabrics. The market is attended daily by about a thousand
                    dealers. Fish is supplied from Callao, and vegetables partly from gardens in the
                    city and environs, and partly from the native villages. Since 1857 the water for
                    drinking purposes has been obtained filtered from the Rimae, and supplied by
                    pipes to the houses. The imports are various; the exports include guano,
                    cinchona, Indian wool, raw cotton, hides, sugar, saltpetre, gold, silver, and
                    other minerals. Under ordinary conditions the imports and exports together
                    exceed £5,000,000 annually. There are railways f.om Lima leading to Callao,
                    Chancay, Chorrillos, and Oroya; the construction of several other lines has been
                    stopped by the war with Chili. In 1780 the population of Lima was 50,000; in
                    1860 it had reached 100,341, and in 1868 121,362, of whom 38,761 were
                    foreigners. A recent estimate (1877) gives the number at about 200,000, but,
                    considering the vicissitudes the city has since then endured, these figures must
                    be considered at the present time (1882) as far too high. The Spanish natives
                    have the reputation of being courteous, affable, and generous, but at the same
                    time fond of pleasure, improvident, and superstitious. By confession they are
                    mostly Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Lima was founded 18th January 1535, by Francisco Pizarro, who named it <hi

                        >Reyes</hi> in honour of the emperor Charles V. and Dona Juana his mother,
                    or, according to some authors, from its site having been selected on the 6th
                    January, the Feast of the Epiphany. The name afterwards gave place to that of
                        <hi rend="italic">Lima,</hi> a Spanish corruption of the Quichua word <hi
                        rend="italic">Rimae.</hi> In 1548 Lima received its first archbishop, and in
                    1582 the earliest provincial council for the state was held there. .Remaining
                    under Spanish rule during the 17th, 18th, and early part of the 19th centuries,
                    the city continued to increase in prosperity, though often visited by terrible
                    earthquakes, of which the most disastrous was that of the 28th October 1746,
                    when 5000 of the inhabitants perished and the port of Callao was destroyed (see
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Callao,</hi> vol. iv. p. 107). On the 12th July 1821,
                    after a siege of some months, Lima was entered by a Chilian force under General
                    San Martin, who on the 28th was proclaimed protector of Peru as a free state,
                    but its independence was not finally secured until after the victory of Ayacucho
                    (9th December 1824). In March 1828 the city again suffered from an earthquake,
                    and in 1854-55 the yellow fever earned off a great number of the inhabitants. On
                    the 11th of August 1857, Mr Sullivan, British minister to Peru, was
                    assassinated. In November 1864 a congress of plenipotentiaries from Chili and
                    other South American states was held here to concert measures of·mutual defence.
                    Of the various revolts which have during the last few years taken place at Lima
                    may be mentioned that of November 1865, when President Pezet was displaced for
                    Canseco; the riots against religious toleration, 15th April 1867; and the
                    military insurrection, 22d July 1872, when Gutierrez, minister of war,
                    arbitrarily assumed power, had President Balta imprisoned and shot, but himself
                    soon fell a victim to the popular fury; order being afterwards with difficulty
                    restored by Vice-President Zavallos. In consequence of the ill-success of the
                    war with Chili, Lima towards the close of 1879 was again in an unsettled
                    condition; President Prado fled, and ou the 22d December, after a sanguinary
                    coup d’état, Pierola was proclaimed dictator. In April 1880 Callao was blockaded
                    by Chilian war ships, and Lima had to be placed in a state of defence. On the
                    20th of November the Chilian army effected a landing at Pisco, a fortified place
                    about 100 miles south of Lima, and, having afterwards advanced upon the capital,
                    forcibly occupied it upon the 17th of January 1881.</p>
