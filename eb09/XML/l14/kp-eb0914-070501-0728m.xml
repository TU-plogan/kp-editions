                    down as a collector of taxes, he married Sophie Johaunot, a free-thinker like
                    himself, and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent
                    to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he had for friends Hachette and Eugène
                    Burnouf, and he distinguished himself alike in his work and in all athletic
                    exercises. After he had completed his course at school, he hesitated for a time
                    as to what profession he should adopt, and meanwhile made himself master, not
                    only of the English and German languages, but of the classical and Sanskrit
                    literature and philology. At last he determined to study medicine, and in 1822
                    entered his name as a student of medicine. He passed all his examinations in due
                    course, and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as
                    doctor when in 1827 his father died, leaving his mother absolutely without
                    resources. He at once renounced his degree, and, while attending the lectures of
                    Rayer and taking a keen interest in medicine, began teaching Latin and Greek for
                    a livelihood. He carried a musket on the popular side in the revolution of
                    February 1830, and was one of the national guards who followed Charles X. to
                    Rambouillet. At last, in 1831, when quite thirty years of age, he obtained an
                    introduction to Armand Carrel, the editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >National,</hi> who gave him the task of reading the English and German papers
                    for excerpts. Carrel by the merest chance, in 1835, discovered the ability of
                    his reader, who from that time became a constant contributor, and eventually
                    director of the paper. In 1836 he began to contribute articles on all sorts of
                    subjects to the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes·,</hi> in 1837 he
                    married; and in 1839 appeared the first volume of his edition of the works of
                    Hippocrates. This volume at once placed Littré in the forefront of the literary
                    and scientific world; its ability was recognized by his election the same year
                    into the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. At the age of thirtyeight
                    then he had won for himself a high reputation as a learned man of letters and of
                    science, but was still tormented by the unsettled ideas and thoughts which
                    generally beset younger men, and were only increased by the study of his
                    favourite authors Byron and Obermann. At this epoch he came across the works of
                    Auguste Comte, the reading of which formed, as he himself said, “the cardinal
                    point of his life,” and from this time onward appears the influence of
                    positivism on his own life, and, what is of even more importance, his influence
                    on positivism, for he gave at least as much to positivism as he received from
                    it. He brought to it a wide knowledge of science and literature, a great and
                    growing reputation, and a clear head. He soon became an intimate friend of
                    Comte’s, and set to work to popularize his ideas in numerous works on the
                    positivist philosophy, while at the same time continuing his edition of
                    Hippocrates, which was not completed till 1862, publishing a similar edition of
                    Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> assisting after 1844 in the
                    place of Fauriel at the committee engaged on the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    littéraire de la France,</hi> where his knowledge of the early French language
                    and literature was invaluable, and contributing largely to the <hi rend="italic"

                    took part in the repression of the extreme republican party in June 1849, under
                    the banner of order. His essays, contributed during this period to the <hi
                    rend="italic">National,</hi> were collected together and published under the
                    title of <hi rend="italic">Conservation,</hi><hi rend="italic">Révolution, et
                    Positivisme</hi> in 1852, and show, not only a lively faith in a good time
                    coming, but a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte.
                    However, during the later years of his master’s life, he began to perceive that
                    he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend
                    and master, but he studiously concealed his differences of opinion almost from
                    himself, and Comte failed to perceive that his pupil had outgrown him, as he
                    himself had outgrown his master Saint-Simon. Comte’s death in 1858 freed Littré
                    from any fear of embittering his master’s later years, and he published his own
                    ideas in his <hi rend="italic">Paroles</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">Positive</hi> in 1859, and at still greater
                    length in his work in <hi rend="italic">Auguste</hi><hi rend="italic">Comte et
                    la Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">positive</hi> in 1863. In this book he
                    traces the origin of Comte’s ideas through Turgot, Kant, and Saint-Simon, then
                    eulogizes Comte’s own life, his method of philosophy, his great services to the
                    cause, and the effect of his works, and finally proceeds to show where he
                    himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte’s philosophy, his great
                    laws of society, and his philosophical method, which indeed he defended warmly
                    against J. S. Mill, but declared that, while he believed in a positivist
                    philosophy, he did not believe in a religion of humanity. In the year 1863,
                    after completing his Hippocrates and his Pliny, he set to work on his great
                    French dictionary, bringing to the task an unexampled knowledge of old French,
                    of modern and classical languages, and of modern philology, which were to make
                    his dictionary unique in its interest and accuracy. In the same year he was
                    proposed for the Académie Française, but rejected, owing to the opposition of
                    the fiery bishop of Orleans, who denounced him as the chief of the French
                    materialists. He also at this time started with M. Wyrouboff the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">Positive,</hi> a review which
                    was to embody the views of modern positivists, and to which he largely
                    contributed. His life was thus absorbed in literary work, and flowed quietly on,
                    till the overthrow of the empire called on him to take a part in politics. He
                    felt himself too old to undergo the privations of the siege of Paris, and
                    retired with his family to Britanny, whence he was summoned by M. Gambetta to
                    Bordeaux, to lecture on history, and thence to Versailles to take his seat in
                    the senate to which he had been chosen by the department of the Seine. In
                    December 1871 he was elected a member of the Académie Française in spite of the
                    renewed opposition of the Mgr. Dupanloup, bishop of Orleans, who resigned his
                    seat rather than receive him. His dictionary was completed in 1873, and he lived
                    on full of years and honours, for in 1874 he was elected a life senator. The
                    most notable of his productions in these latter years were his political papers
                    attacking and unveiling the confederacy of the Orleanists and legitimists, and
                    in favour of the republic, his republication of many of his old articles and
                    books, among others the <hi rend="italic">Conservation, Revolution,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et Positivisme</hi> of 1852 (which he reprinted word for word,
                    appending a formal, categorical renunciation of many of the Comtist doctrines
                    therein contained), and a little tract <hi rend="italic">Pour la dernière
                    fois,</hi> in which he maintained his unalterable belief in materialism. When it
                    became obvious that the old man could not live much longer, his wife and
                    daughter, who had always been fervent Catholics, strove to convert him to their
                    religion. He had long, interviews with Père Millériot, a celebrated
                    controversialist, and was much grieved at his death; but it is hardly probable
                    he would have ever been really converted. Nevertheless, when on the point of
                    death, his wife had him baptized, and his funeral was conducted with the rites
                    of the Catholic Church. He died June 2, 1881.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible to characterize the varied learning and immense
                    intellectual activity of Littré. As a philosopher he had popularized and sifted
                    the ideas of Comte, and had succeeded Comte as Comte succeeded Turgot, Kant, and
                    Saint-Simon; as a lexicographer he has been compared to Johnson, though his work
                    is as far ahead of Johnson’s as the philological knowledge of the 19 th century
                    is in advance of that of the 18th; and as a man of almost universal knowledge,
                    and a writer on every sort of subject, from barbarian learning and modern
                    science to epic poetry and the military genius of Napoleon, he remains
                    unrivalled, even in a country which can boast of Diderot and Comte.</p>
                <p>It would take too much space to give a complete list of all Littré’s voluminous
                    works, but the following are those of greatest importance his editions of
