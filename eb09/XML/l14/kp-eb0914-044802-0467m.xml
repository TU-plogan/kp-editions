                    was highly cultivated according to the standards of his time is obvious, but it
                    does not appear that he could write Greek, or even that he understood that
                    language. No certain traces of his early ecclesiastical career have been
                    discovered. In one of the letters <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 104) of Augustine,
                    an acolyte named Leo is mentioned as having been in 418 the bearer of a
                    communication from Sixtus of Rome (afterwards pope of that name) to Aurelius of
                    Carthage against the Pelagians; but it is possible that this Leo is rather to be
                    identified with the Leo a priest who is recorded to have been sent by Pope
                    Celestine to Africa with reference to the matter of Apiarius about the year 425.
                    In 429, when the first unmistakable reference to Pope Leo occurs, he was still
                    only a deacon, but already a man of commanding influence; it was at his
                    suggestion that the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Incarnatione</hi>
                    of the aged Cassianus, having reference to the Nestorian heresy, was composed in
                    that year, and some two years later (about 431) we find Cyril of Alexandria
                    writing to him that he might prevent the Roman Church from lending its support
                    in any way to the ambitious schemes of Juvenal of Jerusalem. In 440, while Leo
                    was in Gaul, whither he had been sent to compose some differences between Aetius
                    and another general named Albinus, Pope Sixtus III. died, and the absent deacon,
                    or rather archdeacon, was forthwith unanimously chosen to succeed him, and
                    received consecration on his return six weeks afterwards (September 29). In 443
                    he began to take measures against the Manichaeans (who since the capture of
                    Carthage by Genseric in 439 had become very numerous at Rome), and in the
                    following year he was able to report to the Italian bishops that some of the
                    heretics had returned to Catholicism, while a large number had been sentenced to
                    perpetual banishment “in accordance with the constitutions of the Christian
                    emperors,” and others had fled; in seeking these out the help of the provincial
                    clergy was sought. It was during the earlier years of Leo’s pontificate that the
                    events in Gaul occurred which resulted in his triumph over Hilarius of Arles,
                    signalized by the edict of Valentinian III. (445), denouncing the contumacy of
                    the Gallic bishop, and enacting “that nothing should be done in Gaul, contrary
                    to ancient usage, without the authority of the bishop of Rome, and that the
                    decree of the apostolic see should henceforth be law.” In 447 he held the
                    correspondence with Turribius of Astorga which led to the condemnation of the
                    Priscillianists by the Spanish national church, and to the putting to death of
                    Priscillian—an act which met with Leo’s approval. In 448 he received with
                    commendation a letter from Eutyches, the Constantinopolitan monk, complaining of
                    the revival of the Nestorian heresy there; and in the following year Eutyches
                    wrote his circular, appealing against the sentence which at the instance of
                    Eusebius of Dorylaeum had been passed against him at a synod held in
                    Constantinople under the presidency of the patriarch Flavian, and asking papal
                    support at the oecumenical council at that time under summons to meet at
                    Ephesus. The result of a correspondence was that Leo by his legates sent to
                    Flavian that famous epistle in which he sets forth with great fulness of detail
                    the doctrine ever since recognized as orthodox regarding the union of the two
                    natures in the one person of Jesus Christ. The narrative of the events at the
                    “robber” synod at Ephesus belongs to general church history rather than to the
                    biography of Leo; suffice it to say that his letter, though submitted, was not
                    read by the assembled fathers, and that the papal legates had some difficulty in
                    escaping with their lives from the violence of the theologians who, not content
                    with deposing Flavian and Eusebius, shouted for the dividing of those who
                    divided Christ. W <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> hen the news of the result of
                    this oecumenical council (oecumenical in every circumstance except that it was
                    not presided over by the pope) reached Rome, Leo wrote to Theodosius “with
                    groanings and tears,” requesting the emperor to sanction another council, to be
                    held this time, however, in Italy. In this petition he was supported by
                    Valentinian HL, by the empress-mother Galla Placidia, and by the empress
                    Eudoxia, but the appeal was made in vain. A change in the position of affairs,
                    however, was brought about by the accession in the following year of Marcian,
                    who three days after coming to the throne published an edict bringing within the
                    scope of the penal laws against heretics the supporters of the dogmas of
                    Apollinaris and Eutyches. To convoke a synod in which greater orthodoxy might
                    reasonably be expected was in these circumstances no longer difficult, but all
                    Leo’s efforts to secure that the meeting should take place on Italian soil were
                    unavailing. When the synod of Chalcedon assembled in 451, the papal legates were
                    treated with great respect, being provided with seats on the immediate right of
                    the president, and Leo’s former letter to Flavian was adopted by acclamation as
                    formulating the creed of the universal church on the subject of the person of
                    Christ. Among the reasons urged by Leo for holding this council in Italy had
                    been the threatening attitude of the Huns; the dreaded irruption took place in
                    the following year (452). After Aquileia had succumbed to Attila’s long siege,
                    the conqueror set out for Rome. Near the confluence of the Mincio and the Po he
                    was met by Leo, whose eloquence persuaded him to turn back. Legend has sought to
                    enhance the impressiveness of the occurrence by an unnecessarily imagined
                    miracle. The pope was less successful with Genseric when the Vandal chief
                    arrived under the walls of Rome in 455, but he secured a promise that there
                    should be no incendiarism or murder, and that three of the oldest basilicas
                    should be exempt from plunder,—a promise which seems to have been faithfully
                    observed. The death of Leo occurred in 461, according to the Roman breviary on
                    April 11, on which day the festival of “Pope Leo, confessor and doctor of the
                    church” is celebrated (duplex). The title of “doctor ecclesiae” was given by
                    Benedict XIV. The successor of Leo was Hilarius or Hilarus, who had been one of
                    the papal legates at the “robber” synod in 449.</p>
                <p>As bishop of the diocese of Rome, Leo distinguished himself above all his
                    predecessors by his preaching, to which he devoted himself with great zeal and
                    success. From his short and pithy <hi rend="italic">Sermones</hi> many of the
                    lessons now to be found in the Roman breviary have been taken. Viewed in
                    conjunction with his voluminous correspondence, the sermons sufficiently explain
                    the secret of his greatness, which chiefly lay in the extraordinary strength and
                    purity of his convictions as to the primacy of the successors of St Peter at a
                    time when the civil and ecclesiastical troubles of the civilized world made men
                    willing enough to submit themselves to any authority whatsoever that could
                    establish its right to exist by courage, honesty, and knowledge of affairs. The
                    works of Leo I. were first collectively edited by Quesnel (Lyons, 1700), and
                    again, on the basis of this, in what is now the standard edition by Ballerini
                    (Venice, 1753-56). Ninety-three <hi rend="italic">Sermones</hi> and one hundred
                    and seventy-three <hi rend="italic">Epistol</hi><hi rend="italic">ae</hi> occupy
                    the first volume; the second contains the Ziδer <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacramentorum,</hi> usually attributed to Leo, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Vocatione</hi><hi rend="italic">Omnium Gentium,</hi>
                    also ascribed, by Quesnel and others, to him, but more probably the production
                    of a certain Prosper, of whom nothing further is known. The works of Hilary of
                    Arles are appended.</p>
