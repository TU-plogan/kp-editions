                    miles north-west of Manchester. It is built on the slope of an eminence crowned
                    by the old castle and church, and commanding fine views of the river and
                    surrounding country. The older portion of the town is irregularly built, but of
                    late years it has been much improved by the formation of new streets; and the
                    sanitary and other arrangements are complete and satisfactory. The Lune is
                    crossed by a bridge of five arches erected in 1788, and to the north of the town
                    the Lancaster Canal is conveyed over the river by a handsome aqueduct. The
                    ancient castle occupies the site of a Roman <hi rend="italic">castrum.</hi> The
                    Saxon foundations of a yet older structure still remain, and the tower at the
                    south-west corner is supposed to have been erected during the reign of the
                    emperor Hadrian. The Dungeon Tower, also supposed to be of Roman origin, was
                    taken down in 1818. The greater part of the old portion of the present structure
                    was built by Roger de Poictou, who, however, utilized some of the old Roman
                    towers and the old walls in its erection. In 1322 much damage was done to the
                    castle by Robert Bruce, whose attack it successfully resisted, but it was
                    restored and strengthened by John of Gaunt, who added the greater part of the
                    Gateway Tower as well as turrets to the Lungess Tower, which on that account has
                    been named “John o’ Gaunt’s Chair.” During the wars of the Commonwealth the
                    castle was captured by Cromwell. Shortly afterwards it was converted into the
                    county jail, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n270/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0270-0255"/> and the building now includes the governor’s
                    house and the crown and nisi prius courts. To the north-east of the castle is
                    the church of St Mary, in the Early English style, originally erected by Roger
                    de Poictou, but partly rebuilt in 1759, when the present lofty tower was added.
                    The church contains several old monuments and brasses. A large Gothic Roman
                    Catholic church, with a convent and schools adjoining, was erected in 1859, and
                    there are also several other churches and chapels of some architectural
                    pretensions. There is a grammar school, completed in 1853. Among the charitable
                    institutions are the county lunatic asylum, the Ripley orphan hospital, opened
                    in 1864, erected and endowed at a cost of £100,000, the dispensary and infirmary
                    instituted in 1781, and the Royal Albert asylum for idiots and imbeciles. The
                    town possesses a large market and a handsome town-hall. The principal industries
                    of the town are cotton and silk spinning, cabinetmaking, and the manufacture of
                    oil-cloth tablecovers; and there are also iron-foundries, marble-polishing
                    works, and a manufactory for railway carriages and waggons. The bulk of the
                    shipping is engaged in the coasting trade, and large vessels require to unload
                    at Glasson, 5 miles down the river, the cargoes being carried up to the town by
                    lighters. The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 17,245, and in
                    1881 it was 20,724.</p>
                <p>From discoveries of celts, flint arrow-heads, and other similar remains, it is
                    probable that Lancaster was an old British town. Its Roman name is unknown, but
                    inscribed Roman altars, tombstones, Samian ware, and other pottery, and the
                    remains of the old fortress preceding the castle, and of other buildings, leave
                    no doubt that it was a Roman station of great importance. It was constituted a
                    borough in the fourth year of Richard I., and it first returned members to
                    parliament in the twenty-third year of Edward I. The privilege was withdrawn for
                    some years before 1547, but from that time was enjoyed without interruption
                    until 1867, when it was disfranchised for corrupt practices. The town was
                    plundered and burned by the Scots in 1329 and 1389, was nearly depopulated
                    during the Wars of the Roses, was captured by the Parliamentary forces in 1643,
                    and retaken by the Royalists under the earl of Derby in the same year, was held
                    by the Parliamentary troops in 1648, and was partly destroyed by fire in 1698.
                    It was entered by the rebels in 1715, and again by a larger force of them in
                    1745.</p>
