                    and the Latin <hi rend="italic">Lamentationes</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    >Lamentations of Jeremiah,</hi> expresses the ancient tradition as to the
                    authorship of the book. It is found in the Syriac and in some MSS. of the LXX.,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in N, but not in A and B; and the shorter anonymous
                    form is undoubtedly older.</p>
                <p>The dirges which make up the book are five in number, and the first four are
                    alphabetical acrostics,—successive verses in chaps, i., ii., iv., or successive
                    sets of three verses in the case of chap, iii., beginning with successive
                    letters of the alphabet. The last chapter has twenty-two verses, like chaps i,,
                    ii., and iv., but is not an acrostic.</p>
                <p>It is noteworthy that in chaps, it, iii., and iv. the letter Pe (£) precedes
                    'Ayin QJ), contrary to the ancient and established order common to the Hebrew
                    alphabet with its Greek and Latin derivatives, in which 0 stands for JZ. The
                    sense shows that this irregularity is not due to a transposition of the original
                    order of the verses, while the fact that the same transposition occurs three
                    times makes it plain that the deviation from the common order is not due to want
                    of skill to make the acrostic perfect, but rests on a variation in the order of
                    the alphabet as used by the author. Thus it has not unnaturally been argued by
                    Thenius that chap, i., which takes the alphabet in the common order, must have a
                    different author from chaps ii.-iv.; but it is quite as probable that in chap,
                    i., as Ewald suggests in the 2d ed. of his Dichter, p. 326, ver. 16 originally
                    followed ver. 17, and was transposed to reduce the acrostic to the usual form.
                    In the other chapters the sense forbade such transposition.</p>
                <p>The subject of the five dirges is not the death of an individual; they refer to a
                    national calamity—the widowhood of Jerusalem and the overthrow of the Judaean
                    state by the Chaldaeans. But the examples of Amos v. 1, 2, Jer. ix. 19 [18],
                    Ezek. xix., show that they are not less properly called dirges on that account;
                    the lamentations of Israel over the desolation of Zion, the agonies of the last
                    desperate struggle and the extinction of national existence, appropriately took
                    a form modelled on the death-wail sung by “cunning women” (Jerem. ix. 17) and
                    poets “skilful of lamentation” (Amos v. 16) at the wake (⅛^) of the illustrious
                    dead. Among the Hebrews, as among other primitive peoples, this type of poetry
                    was much cultivated, <pb break="no"

                    date, as appears from David’s elegy on Sauland Jonathan; and as it was practised
                    by persons of special skill, whose services were engaged by the relatives of the
                    dead, it naturally assumed a certain formal and even artificial character. This
                    accounts for the use in our book of the elaborate acrostic form, which to our
                    minds seems little suited for such composition. We are not to think of these
                    dirges as an unstudied effusion of natural feeling, but as carefully elaborated
                    poems in which every element of pity and terror which the subject supplied is
                    brought forward with conscious art to stir the minds of the hearers. It is far
                    from improbable that the Lamentations were originally composed, as Ewald
                    suggests, for a solemn act of mourning in which the captive or fugitive
                    Israelites united, and we know that they ultimately took their place in the
                    ritual of the great day of mourning, the 9th of Ab, when the synagogue still
                    celebrates the fall of the temple.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Mas. S6pherlm, chap, xviii., aud the notes in Müller’s
                    édition, Leipsic, 1878.</p></note> The fast or weeping of the fifth month (Ab)
                    was already an old usage in the time of Zechariah (vii. 3), and it is quite
                    possible that the ritual use of the book of Lamentations goes back to the early
                    days of this ancient custom, Such considerations meet the difficulty which has
                    sometimes been felt in supposing a single author to have written a whole series
                    of elegies on the fall of Jerusalem. In a solemn and formal ceremony of mourning
                    the repetition of the same theme in successive songs of lamentation is only
                    natural. These observations do not of course prove the unity of the book, but
                    they add force to the arguments for unity derived from the plan and language of
                    the whole, and urged by critics, like Ewald and Nägelsbach, who are not
                    influenced by the tradition which makes Jeremiah the author. The evidence for
                    unity of authorship, it may be at once observed, applies most forcibly to the
                    first four chapters, which are also connected by their acrostic form, and
                    especially by the peculiarity in the order of the alphabet already alluded to as
                    still found in chaps, ii,, iii., and iv., and perhaps at one time found even in
                    chap. i.</p>
                <p>The first elegy commences with a picture of the distress of Zion during and after
                    the siege (i. 1-11), Jerusalem, or the people of Judah, being figured as a
                    widowed and dishonoured princess. Then in the latter half of the poem she
                    herself takes up the lamentation, describes her grievous sorrow, confesses the
                    righteousness of Jehovah’s anger, and invokes retribution on her enemies. In the
                    second chapter the desolation of the city and the horrors of the siege are again
                    rehearsed and made more bitter by allusion to the joy of the enemies of Israel.
                    The cause of the calamity is national sin, which false prophets failed to
                    denounce while repentance was still possible, and now no hope remains save in
                    tears and supplication to stir the compassion of Jehovah for the terrible fate
                    of his people. The third elegy takes a personal turn, and describes the
                    affliction of the individual Israelite or of the nation under the type of a
                    single individual under the sense of Jehovah’s just but terrible indignation.
                    But even this affliction is a wholesome discipline. It draws the heart of the
                    singer nearer to his God in penitent self-examination, sustained by trust in
                    Jehovah’s unfailing mercy, which shows itself in the continued preservation of
                    His people through all their woes. From the lowest pit the voice of faith calls
                    to the Redeemer, and hears a voice that says, “Fear not.” Jehovah will yet plead
                    the cause of His people, and so in the closing verses the accents of humble
                    entreaty pass into a tone of confident appeal for just vengeance against the
                    oppressor. In the fourth acrostic the bitter sorrow again bursts forth in
                    passionate wailing. The images of horror imprinted on the poet’s soul during the
                    last months of Jerusalem’s death-struggle and in the flight that followed are
                    painted with more ghastly detail than in the previous chapters, and the climax
                    is reached when the singer describes the capture of the king, “the breath of our
                    nostrils, the anointed of Jehovah, of whom, we said, ‘ Under his shadow we shall
                    live among the nations.’” The cup of Israel’s sorrow is filled up. The very
                    completeness of the calamity is a proof that the iniquity of Zion has met with
                    full recompense. The day of captivity is over, and the wrath of Jehovah is now
                    ready to pass from His people to visit the sins of Edom, the most merciless of
                    its foes.</p>
                <p>Thus far there is both unity and progress in the thought.</p>
                <p>Behind the division into four acrostics lies a larger grouping in three sections,
                    each of which begins with the elegiac Π□'K, followed by a representation in
                    increasing detail of the great calamity, and passes on through the thought of
                    Jehovah’s righteousness to hope, which, as in Psalm cxxxvii., finds its
                    characteristic culmination and point of rest in the assurance of righteous
                    vengeance. The central section (chaps, ii. and iii.) is the most subdued in
                    tone, and sounds the profoundest depths of religious feeling, while the opening
                    section presents the theme in its broadest unity, under the form of
                    personification, and is balanced in chap. iv. by the surging flood of an anguish
                    which pours itself forth all the more unreservedly that it contains the seeds of
                    hope.</p>
                <p>The fifth chapter, which takes the form of a prayer, does not follow the scheme
                    common to the three foregoing sections. The elegy proper must begin with the
                    utterance of grief for its own sake. Here on the contrary the first words are a
                    petition, and the picture of Israel’s woes comes in to support the prayer. The
                    point of rest too is changed, and the chapter closes under the sense of
                    continued wrath. The centre of the singer’s feeling no longer lies in the
                    recollection of the last days of Jerusalem, but in the long continuance of a
                    divine indignation which seems to lay a measureless interval between the present
                    afflicted state of Israel and those happy days of old which are so fresh in the
                    recollection of the poet in the first four chapters. The details too are drawn
                    less from one crowning misfortune than from a continued state of bondage to the
                    servants of the foreign tyrant (ver. 8), and a continued series of insults and
                    miseries. And with this goes a change in the consciousness of sin: “Our fathers
                    have sinned, and are not; and we have borne their iniquities” (ver. 7; compare
                    Zech. i. 2-6, and similar complaints in very late psalms). These differences,
                    combined with the absence of the acrostic form, suggest that the chapter may be
                    a later addition. It may be noted also that in ver. 6 the community which joins
                    in the prayer has humiliating relations to Assyria (Syria ?) on the one hand and
                    to Egypt on the other, which seems to imply that it dwells in Palestine,—a
                    situation to which the complaint that strangers possess its land and houses,
                    that the weak remnant of Israel is in constant danger from Bedouin incursions
                    (ver. 9), and the picture of the foxes that walk among the rains of Zion, may
                    also point. Moreover, the fact that the book has five parts, like the Psalter
                    and the Pentateuch, makes it Λ ’ ery conceivable that it received its present
                    form after the Pentateuch was complete, that is, after the time of Ezra. The
                    linguistic arguments for the unity of the book (most fully stated by Nägelsbach,
                    p. xvi.) seem to break down as regards chap. v.</p>
                <p>According to a tradition which passed unquestioned among Jews and Christians till
                    recent times, the author of the whole book is the prophet Jeremiah. To estimate
                    the value of this tradition, we must trace it back as far as possible. A note
                    prefixed to the Septuagint translation says that, “after Israel was taken
                    captive and Jerusalem laid waste, Jeremiah sat down and wept, and sang this
                    elegy over Jerusalem.” This note may very possibly have stood in the Hebrew copy
                    of the translator, but it certainly cannot be regarded as part of the original
                    text, and it does not bring the tradition within three hundred years of the age
                    of Jeremiah. Another argument bearing on the authority of the tradition has
                    regard to the original place of the book in the Old Testament canon. In Hebrew
                    Bibles the Lamentations stand among the Hagiographa, forming one of the five
                    Megilloth or small books written on separate rolls for liturgical use on
                    separate occasions. In the common order of printed Hebrew Bibles the book stands
                    third among the Megilloth, because in the order of the ecclesiastical year the
                    solemnity of the 9th of Ab was the third annual occasion at which a Megillah was
                    used (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Canticles,</hi> vol. v. p. 32). In the Septuagint
                    and Syriac, on the other hand, the Lamentations are attached to the book of
                    Jeremiah, Baruch intervening in the former version; and it has been often
                    supposed that this was the older arrangement,—that is, that even in Hebrew
                    copies the book originally formed an appendix to Jeremiah, and was afterwards
                    separated for liturgical reasons. The argument for this view turns on the fact
                    that side by side with the Talmudic enumeration of twenty-four Old Testament
                    books, agreeably to the present Hebrew arrangement, there was another
                    enumeration which gave twenty-two books, taking Ruth with Judges and
                    Lamentations with Jeremiah (Jerome, <hi rend="italic">Prol. Calf</hi> This seems

                    it applied to the Hebrew Bible it would also prove, what we know to be false,
                    that the epistle of Jeremiah stood in the Hebrew canon. Origen, Jerome, and
                    other Christian writers were probably influenced by the statement of Josephus.
                    The testimony of the Book of Jubilees, as cited by Syncellus and Cedrenus, is
                    very doubtful (Rönsch, B. der Jub., p. 527 sg ’.).</p></note> At any rate the
                    artificial scheme which accommodates the number of sacred books to the number of
                    the twenty-two Hebrew letters is one that can hardly be original. It first
                    appears about the time of the labours of the rabbins in the last days of the
                    Jewish state to give final form to the canon.</p>
                <p>Here then there is nothing to carry us beyond the evidence of the Septuagint, and
                    Nδldeke has pointed out that there is some reason to suspect that the Septuagint
                    translation of Lamentations is not by the same hand with that of Jeremiah, which
                    goes to prove that even in the Greek the two books (which are in fact separated
                    by the Apocryphal Baruch) were not originally one. Certainly the book of
                    Lamentations has not shared the very peculiar history of the text of Jeremiah,
                    the Greek of the former agreeing with the Hebrew so closely as to make it
                    probable that the text was early established by frequent liturgical use, while
                    the prophecies underwent many variations in transmission. There is, however, one
                    piece of evidence in the Hebrew canon itself which ancient writers accepted as
                    connecting the name of Jeremiah with our book. In 2 Chron. xxxv. 25 we read that
                    Jeremiah pronounced a dirge over Josiah, and that the death of Josiah was still
                    referred to according to stated usage in the dirges used by singing men and
                    women in the author’s day, and collected in a volume of ∏irp—the ordinary Jewish
                    name of our book. Josephus says that the dirge of Jeremiah on this occasion was
                    extant in his days <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi><hi rend="italic">x. 5,</hi> 1),
                    and no doubt means by this the canonical Lamentations. Jerome on'Zech. xii. 11
                    understands the passage in Chronicles in the same sense; but modern writers have
                    generally assumed that, as our book was certainly written after the fall of
                    Jerusalem, the dirges alluded to in Chronicles must be a separate collection.
                    This, however, is far from clear. The TT)Γp of the Chronicler had, according to
                    his statement, acquired a fixed and statutory place in Israel, and were
                    connected with the name of a prophet. In other words, they were canonical as far
                    as any book outside the Pentateuch could be so called at that age. Moreover, the
                    allusion to the king, the anointed of Jehovah, in Lam. iv. 20, though it really
                    applies to Zedekiah, speaks of him with a warm sympathy which later ages would
                    not feel for any king later than Josiah. The Chronicler in particular recognizes
                    only thoroughly good kings (of whom Josiah was the last), and kings altogether
                    bad, for whom he had nothing but condemnation, and with whom he certainly could
                    not imagine a prophet to sympathize.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Nöldeke, ATliche Literatur, p. 144.</p></note> It thus
                    seems highly probable that in the time of the Chronicles, that is, about the
                    close of the Persian period, the book of Lamentations had a recognized
                    liturgical use in the hands of a guild of singers, and was already connected
                    with the name of Jeremiah, though the passage in Chronicles does not make it
                    apparent that the whole official collection of dirges was ascribed to him. But
                    even this testimony is some two centuries and a half later than the events which
                    the book of Lamentations bewails, and is connected with an undoubted error,
                    though a natural one, as to the reference of the book. We cannot therefore feel
                    sure that the tradition current in the guild of singers was authentic and
                    continuous; the general subject of the Lamentations, and particularly the
                    obvious applicability to the personal circumstances of Jeremiah of such passages
                    as iii. 14, <hi rend="italic">55</hi> (comp. Jer. xx. 7; xxxviii,), made it
                    natural or even· inevitable to think of him as author, if any attempt was made
                    to connect the book, as the later Jews sought to connect all books, with some
                    known name. Nor can we lay special weight on the acceptance of the tradition by
                    an author who transfers post-exile Psalms to the Davidic age (1 Chron. xvi. 7
                    <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi></p>
                <p>When we proceed to test the internal probability of the tradition we find it to
                    be surrounded by grave difficulties. The language, as Ewald observes, and
                    Nägelsbach (p. xi. <hi rend="italic">sqf</hi> has shown with great completeness,
                    is very remote from that of Jeremiah, and even if we separate out chap, v., in
                    which the features already pointed out make it peculiarly difficult to think of
                    him as author, the standpoint of the book corresponds very imperfectly with that
                    of the prophet. Jeremiah, through all his life, was a man standing by · himself,
                    isolated from his people. At the taking of the city the Chaldaeans themselves
                    acknowledged this and treated him with favour. He was carried into Egypt against
                    his will, still counselling patient submission to the foreign rule, and there he
                    continued in opposition to the mass of the fugitives as decidedly as before. The
                    Lamentations, on the contrary, show us a poet in sympathy with the old life of
                    the nation, whose attitude to the temple services, and especially to the king,
                    is far more popular than Jeremiah’s. Nor could Jeremiah speak of the calamity as
                    involving the cessation of revelation and the silence of prophecy (ii. 9); for
                    the Divine word in his breast was as clear and strong after the catastrophe as
                    before it. The judgment, terrible as it was, had far less painful significance
                    to Jeremiah than to the nation at large (Jer. xxiv. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.,</hi> xlii. 9 <hi rend="italic">sqf.</hi> To this it may be objected that
                    in chap, iii., where the singer’s complaint takes a more personal turn, Jeremiah
                    himself is pictured in his isolation from Israel at large. A closer examination
                    shows, however, that this interpretation turns on a single word in iii. 14. The
                    addition of a final D, not always written in old times, changes “all my people”
                    into “all peoples,” restores the harmony between iii. 14 and verses 61-63, and
                    makes the singer of chap, iii., as the general argument of the chapter requires,
                    a representative of Israel among the heathen, not an isolated figure among
                    unsympathetic countrymen.</p>
                <p>Thus viewed, the Lamentations are the earliest evidence of the great national
                    repentance wrought by the fall of the Jewish state. We have here for the first
                    time a genuine expression of popular feeling fully penetrated by those
                    convictions of Israel’s sin and Jehovah’s righteousness which the people of
                    Judah had long resisted, mocking and persecuting the divine messengers who had
                    sought to force them on the conscience of their countrymen. This cry of deepest
                    anguish from the depths of a nation’s despair, chastened by a sense of sin, and
                    rising at length into an attitude of sublime faith in the confident appeal to
                    the righteousness and love of Jehovah, contains the germ of the new life of the
                    Israel of the restoration, and may be taken as the starting point of a fresh
                    epoch in the Old Testament development. It is not probable that these new
                    thoughts and new hopes found so clear and perfect literary expression in the
                    very first days of the exile. Several passages, especially ii. 14 compared with
                    Ezek. xiii. <hi rend="superscript"> κ</hi> l <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> ^),
                    appear to indicate acquaintance with the book of Ezekiel, which is, as
                    Nägelsbach points out, another argument against authorship by Jeremiah, and
                    combines with the expression in ii. 9 to point to the time when the study of the
                    written word, so characteristic of the age of the exile, had begun to supply the
                    lack of continuous oral revelation. It is hardly possible to give a more exact
                    determination of the place and time of writing. Ewald argues for an origin among
                    the fugitives in Egypt; but the passages to which he appeals (i. 3; iv. 18 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq∙,</hi> v.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n254/mode/1up"

                <p>4 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> do not bear out this conclusion, and our scanty
                    historical knowledge of the period points to the eastern captivity as the more
                    probable seat of the spiritual movement to which the book belongs.</p>
