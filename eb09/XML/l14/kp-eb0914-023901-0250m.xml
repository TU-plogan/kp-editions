                    brother Jean, priest, educationist, and author, had taught him the elements of
                    Latin, and by his own further efforts he comprehended Livy at ten. Well read in
                    Rousseau at twelve, he criticized religion so adroitly with the parish priest
                    that he could not be admitted to communion. In 1796 ho sent a discourse
                    combating modern philosophy to a provincial academy. He visited Paris with his
                    father next year, where he wrote democratic letters to the newspapers. On his
                    return he joined his brother for study at a house near Dinan called La Chenaie,
                    built by their maternal grandfather. Greek, Latin, Hebrew, modern languages, the
                    church fathers, the controversialists, and historians occupied him. Religious
                    struggle, and an intense melancholy, aided it may be by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >malheureuse</hi><hi rend="italic">passion</hi> which he is said to have
                    suffered from, account for the fact that he was twenty-two before taking his
                    first communion, though in direct preparation for the clerical life.</p>
                <p>In 1808 his hand found its proper work. His <hi rend="italic">Deflexions on the
                    State of the Church during the</hi> 1877t <hi rend="italic">Century and on the
                    Actual Situation,</hi> published anonymously at Paris, was the first important
                    theological stand made against the materialistic philosophy which had its
                    apotheosis in imperialism. Napoleon’s police seized the book as dangerously
                    ideological, with its eager recommendation of religious revival and active
                    clerical organization. It awoke the ultramontane spirit which has played so
                    great a part since in the politics of churches and states. But Lamennais was not
                    yet ready for the contest. Pious exaltation of spirit was his prevailing mood,
                    as is shown by his translation next year of the <hi rend="italic">Spiritual
                    Guide</hi> of the ascetic BIosius. Indeed, to the end of his life there is
                    recurrence to what may be called poetic religious feeling, one of his latest
                    reliefs from the storms of political struggle being a translation of the
                    Gospels. In 1811 he took the tonsure, but shortly after became teacher of
                    mathematics in the seminary founded by his brother at St Malo. Theological
                    politics had large discussion after the concordat of 1802, by which the Gallican
                    Church was re-established; and the brothers’ joint work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tradition upon the Institution of Bishops,</hi> which was published a few days
                    after the restoration, condemns the Gallican principle which allowed bishops to
                    be created irrespective of the pope’s sanction.</p>
                <p>The revival of the Bourbon monarchy drew Lamennais to Paris, and the Hundred Days
                    sent him to exile. The abbé Caron gave him work in his school for French exiles
                    in London; and he also became tutor at the house of Lady Jerningham, whose first
                    impression of him as an imbecile changed into friendship. In 1815 he returned
                    with the abbé to Paris, where his seeming fatuity cost him much misery as a
                    seminarist of St Sulpice; but with Caron’s aid, whom he called his spiritual
                    father, he took full sacerdotal ordination next year, though with reluctance, as
                    a letter to his sister shows. He enjoyed much peace with his friend at the
                    Maison des Feuillantes, and finished there the first volume of his great work,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Essay on Indifference in the Matter of Religion.</hi>
                    Published in 1817, it affected Europe like a spell. Since Bossuet no clergyman
                    wielded such power as he gained at a blow. He denounced toleration, and
                    advocated a Catholic restoration to belief. The right of private judgment,
                    introduced by Descartes and Leibnitz into philosophy and science, by Luther into
                    religion, and by Rousseau and the Encyclopedists into politics and society, had,
                    he contended, terminated in practical atheism and spiritual death.
                    Ecclesiastical authority, founded on the absolute revelation delivered to -the
                    Jewish people, but supported by the universal tradition of all nations, he
                    proclaimed to be the sole hope of regenerating the European communities. In 1824
                    the fourth volume completed the work, and the <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> of
                    the same date indicates the violent opposition he met with, not only from his
                    natural enemies, the lovers of personal freedom in thought, science, and
                    politics, sacred or civil, but from the Gallican bishops and monarchists,
                    because he argued that all authority rests in the Holy See, and from his
                    ultramontane friends, because he dared to support the Christian revelation by an
                    analysis of human, or, as they considered, profane tradition.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Lamennais had become journalist on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Conservateur,</hi> with Chateaubriand, De Bonald, and De Villèle for his
                    fellows in essentially political work. When in 1820 De Villèle became the chief
                    of the ultras, or friends of absolute monarchy, Lamennais, who was not the
                    monarchist they thought him, left the <hi rend="italic">Conservateur</hi> with
                    other contributors, named “the incorruptibles,” and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drapeau Blanc</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">Mémorial Catholique</hi> he
                    opposed his previous comrade. His principles compelled him to draw a firm line
                    as to the divine right of even legitimate kings, especially in connexion with
                    church supremacies. In 1823 he was before the tribunals for an article in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Drapeau Blanc.</hi> He went to Rome in 1824, and Pope Leo.
                    XII., his admirer, offered him the cardinal’s hat, which he refused. On his
                    return he published <hi rend="italic">Religion in its Relations to Civil and
                    Political Order,</hi> the first volume of which was a picture of the religious
                    state of France, and the second an attack on the competence of the assembly of
                    the clergy in 1682 to decree the liberties of the Gallican Church. The law
                    accepting these liberties, Lamennais was summoned before the state courts, and
                    with all France keenly interested was condemned to pay a fine. From this time he
                    broke with the legitimists and the liberals, and Rome became to him the only
                    seat of the social problem. His ideal was a pure theocracy.</p>
                <p>But in the <hi rend="italic">Progress of the Revolution and War against the
                    Church</hi> the element of popular political liberty began to appear, modifying
                    such infallibility of the head of the church as deposing of princes and
                    dispensing with oaths of allegiance taken by their subjects implied. The
                    revolution of 1830 increased his popular leanings, and in the journal <hi
                    rend="italic">H Avenir,</hi> which he founded in September with the mottoes “God
                    and Liberty,” “The Pope and the People,” theories strange to ultram on tanism
                    were broached. With Lacordaire, Montalembert, Gerbet, and other disciples, he
                    demanded rights of local administration, enlarged suffrage, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n251/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0251-0240"/> universal and equal freedom of conscience, of
                    instruction, of meeting, and of the press. Methods of worship were to be
                    criticized, improved, or abolished, and all in absolute submission to papal
                    spiritual but not temporal authority. The Jesuits and the prelates grew alarmed,
                    and “the modern Savonarola” was denounced to Gregory XVI. On their spiritual
                    obedience the writers of <hi rend="italic">L'Avenir</hi> were ordered to suspend
                    the journal, which they did (1831), and Lamennais, Lacordaire, and Montalembert
                    set out for Rome to get the papal pardon and blessing. They were not received,
                    and “Catiline departed,” to be overtaken by a bitter encyclical letter at Munich
                    from the pope condemning the new doctrines. So interested was Gregory in the
                    questions raised that under an assumed name he published a work of refutation.
                    To his demand of submission Lamennais signed obedience, with a saving clause as
                    to his country and humanity. The iron had entered his soul, and deeply wounded
                    he retired to La Chenaie, the scene of his youthful inquiries and memories. His
                    genius had turned the entire Christian church against him, and those whom he
                    fought for so long, the ultramontanes, were the fiercest of all his opponents.
                    The famous <hi rend="italic">Words of a Believer</hi> appeared in 1834, and his
                    final rupture with the church took place. “Small in size but immense in its
                    perversity,” was the pope’s criticism in a new encyclical letter. Λ tractate of
                    aphorisms, it has the vigour and sacred breathing of a Hebrew prophet.</p>
                <p>Henceforth Lamennais is the apostle of the people alone. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Affairs of Rome and the Ills of the Church and Society</hi> came from old habit
                    of religious discussions rather than from his real mind of 1837, or at most it
                    was but a last word. <hi rend="italic">Modern Slavery, The Book of the People,
                    Politics for the People,</hi> two volumes of articles from the journal of the
                    extreme democracy, <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Monde,</hi> are
                    titles of works which show that he has arrived among the missionaries of
                    liberty, equality, and fraternity, and he soon gets a share of their martyrdom.
                    <hi rend="italic">The Country and the Government</hi> caused him a year’s
                    imprisonment in Ste Pélagie. He struggled through difficulties of lost
                    friendships, limited means, and personal illnesses, faithful to the last to his
                    hardly won dogma of the sovereignty of the people, and, to judge by his
                    contribution to Louis Blanc’s <hi rend="italic">Review of Political
                    Progress,</hi> was ready for something like communism. He was named president of
                    the “Société de la Solidarité républicaine,” which counted half a million
                    adherents in fifteen days. The Revolution of 1848 had his sympathies, and he
                    started <hi rend="italic">Le Peuple Constituant,</hi> but was compelled to stop
                    it on 10th July, complaining that silence was for the poor; but again he was at
                    the head of <hi rend="italic">La Révolution Démocratique et Sociale,</hi> which
                    also succumbed. He managed his own publications; and pamphlets without number,
                    and at intervals volumes of <hi rend="italic">Melanges,</hi> kept his influence
                    fresh and his republican aims to the front as much as possible. In the
                    constituent assembly he sat on the left till the <hi rend="italic">coup
                    d’etat</hi> of Napoleon III. in 1851 put an end to all hopes of popular freedom.
                    While deputy he drew up a constitution, but it was rejected as too radical. Λ
                    translation of Dante chiefly occupied him till his death in the fourth year of
                    the second empire. He refused to be reconciled to the church, and was buried at
                    Père La Chaise without fuueral rites, according to his own directions, mourned
                    for by a countless concourse of democratic and other admirers.</p>
                <p>During the most difficult time of his republican period he had one resource by
                    which to find solace for his intellect from the noise of daily politics. From
                    1841 till 1846 he was engaged on the work which will remain longest as evidence
                    of his thinking power and of his clear brilliant style, his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sketch of a Philosophy.</hi> Of the four volumes, the third, which is an
                    exposition of art as development from the necessities and aspirations of the
                    temple, stands pre-eminent. The rest of the work somewhat answers to the modest
                    title of the book. Some papers which he wished to be published intact after his
                    death were kept back by the religious zeal of his brother and sister, but in
                    1855 and afterwards till 1859 six volumes appeared under the care of Émile
                    Forgues. Blaize, the nephew of Lamennais, disputed various rights with Forgues,
                    and in his biography of his uncle he questions facts in the account of the life
                    prefixed by the editor to the <hi rend="italic">Posthumous Works.</hi> But the
                    whole matter is of private rather than public interest, affecting the position
                    of Lamennais in little degree.</p>
                <p>The complete works have beeil published twice at Paris, in 12 volumes, 1836-37,
                    and in 11 volumes by Pagnerre, 1844 sq. Neither edition is anything like
                    complete, but that of Pagnerre is the more so. Besides the biographical matter
                    given by Forgues and Blaize as preface—the former to the Posthumous Works, the
                    latter to the Unedited Works, Sainte-Beuve has Lamennais as one of his skilful
                    Portraits Contemporains, Castille has him among the Portraits politiques au
                    dix-neuvieme siècle, and George Sand’s thoughts of “the Breton” can be read in
                    French Authors at Home. Kobinet, Gerbet, and Régnault may be selected from many
                    others who give personal details. Querard’s Les Supercheries Littéraires
                    Dévoilées, article “La Mennais,” will give ample introduction to all that is
                    known of the author’s works, and of the works connected with him. (T. SI.)</p>
