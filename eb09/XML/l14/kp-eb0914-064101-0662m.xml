                    to the Scheldt by the Lys. It is the chief fortress of the north of France, and
                    headquarters of the first army corps, and is defended by a rampart and by a
                    pentagonal citadel situated to the west of the town beside the Deule. The water
                    of the river fills the moat, and the environs of the citadel can be laid under
                    water. Prior to 1858 the town occupied an elliptical area of about 2500 yards by
                    1300, with the church of Notre Dame de la Treille in the centre, but the
                    ramparts on the south side have since been demolished and the ditches filled up,
                    their place being now occupied by the great Boulevard de la Liberté, which
                    extends in a straight line from the goods station of the railway to the citadel.
                    The new enceinte is much more extensive, and encloses the old communes of
                    Esquermes, Wazemmes, and Moulins-Lille, the area of the town being thus more
                    than doubled; in the new quarters fine boulevards and handsome squares, such as
                    that De la République, have been laid out in pleasant contrast with the sombre
                    and dirty aspect of the old town. The district of St André to the north, the
                    only elegant part of the old town, is the residence of the Lille
                    aristocracy.</p>
                <p>At the demolition of the old fortifications, the Paris gate, a triumphal arch
                    erected in 1682 in honour of Louis XIV., after the conquest of Flanders, was
                    preserved, as also the Ghent and Roubaix gates, which date from the time of the
                    Spanish domination, and are built in the Renaissance style, with bricks of
                    different colours. The present rampart is pierced by eleven gates, besides a
                    special gate for the railway, and two water gates for the canal of the Deule.
                    The goods station has also its special outlet, and a line from it, after making
                    the round of the new quarters, passes within the enceinte to the quays of the
                    river. Crossing the bridges which span the different arms of the Deule, we reach
                    the citadel, the glacis of which; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0663-0642"/> planted with trees, form a public walk. Within
                    the citadel are extensive barracks and a considerable arsenal. The church of
                    Notre Dame de la Treille, in the style of the 13th century, which has been in
                    process of building since 1855, occupies the site of the old Château du Buc, the
                    original nucleus of the city. The town-house, on the site of the old palace of
                    the duke of Burgundy, Philip the Good, was built in 1846. The exchange, which
                    dates from the period of the Spanish domination, is in an original style. It is
                    surmounted by a graceful campanile, and contains a statue of Napoleon I., made
                    from cannon taken at Austerlitz. In the middle of the great square stands a
                    column, erected in 1848, commemorating the defence of the town in 1792. There
                    are several large hospitals, faculties of medicine and of science, a Catholic
                    institute, comprising the five faculties of theology, letters, law, science, and
                    medicine, an academy of music affiliated to the Conservatoire at Paris, several
                    learned societies, and a large number of various kinds of schools. The picture
                    gallery, with upwards of eight hundred works, is one of the richest in the
                    provinces, and the Wicar museum contains a unique collection of original designs
                    of the great Italian masters. Lille possesses also an ethnographical museum
                    (Musée Moillet), as well as museums of archaeo-lsgy, numismatics, the industrial
                    arts, and natural history. The communal library is also worthy of mention; it
                    includes numerous MSS., and particularly a valuable <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evangeliariwn</hi> of the 12th or 13th century. On the front of the building
                    where the departmental archives are kept are to be seen medallions of all the
                    sovereigns who have successively possessed Lille from Baldwin of the Iron Arm to
                    Louis XIV. Lille, which is pre-eminently a manufacturing and commercial town,
                    enjoys exceptional advantages as regards means of transit. The lower Deule is
                    canalized to its junction with the Lys, and there is continuous water
                    communication with the Scheldt in Belgium, and with Paris by way of Douai and St
                    Quentin. The town is at the same time an important railway junction, and is also
                    provided with tramways.</p>
                <p>The principal industry is flax-spinning, in which thirty-five mills, with 190,000
                    spindles, give employment to 14,000 persons (of whom 9000 are females), the
                    annual turnover being £1,800,000. Forty thread mills employ 2000 persons, and
                    produce thread to the annual value of £240,000. Fifteen factories, with 1000
                    operatives, produce woollen goods worth from £120,000 to £160,000 per annum;
                    5000 persons are engaged in cotton-spinning (115,000 spindles), to the amount of
                    £800,000. There are besides eighty factories in which damasks, tickings, and the
                    usual staples of the linen trade are manufactured; quilts and packsheets occupy
                    from 6000 to 7000 persons, and 4000 are employed in producing the fabric out of
                    which the smock frocks of the peasantry are made. Connected with these
                    industries are dye-works, bleachfields, and establishments for the production of
                    engines, looms, and combing and carding machines; and there are also chemical
                    works, sugar-works, breweries, and oil-works.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The old commune of Moulins, now annexed to
                    the town, derived its name from the windmills in which the oil was
                    pressed.</p></note> The state manufacture of tobacco in Lille gives employment
                    to 1200 persons. The total population of Lille in 1876 was 162,775.</p>
                <p>Lille is said, to date its origin from the time of Count Baldwin IV., who in 1030
                    surrounded, with walls a little town.which had arisen around the castle of Buc.
                    At the end of the 12th century Lille, which had developed rapidly, obtained
                    communal privileges. Destroyed by Philip Augustus in 1212, it was rebuilt by
                    Johanna of Constantinople, but besieged and retaken by Philip the Fair in 1297.
                    After having taken part with the Flemings against the king of France, it was
                    ceded to the latter in 1312. In 1369 Charles <hi rend="italic">V.</hi> gave it
                    to Louis de Male, who transmitted his rights to his daughter</p>
                <p>Margaret, wife of Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. Under the Burgundian rule
                    Lille enjoyed great prosperity; its merchants were at the head of the London
                    Hansa. Philip the Good made it his residence, and within its walls held the
                    first chapters of the order of the Golden Fleece. With the rest of Flanders it
                    passed from the dukes of Burgundy to Austria, and then to Spain. After the death
                    of the Philip IV. of Spain, Louis XIV. reclaimed the territory, and besieged
                    Lille in 1667. He forced it to capitulate, but preserved all its laws, customs,
                    privileges, freedoms, and liberties. In 1708, after an heroic resistance, it
                    surrendered to Prince Eugene and the duke of Marlborough. The treaty of Utrecht
                    restored it to France. In 1792 the Austrians bombarded it for nine days and
                    nights without intermission, but had ultimately to raise the siege. (G. ME.)</p>
