                    portions. Though the boundaries, which now include about 467 acres, have been
                    six times extended, the general shape is wonderfully regular, nor is regularity
                    wanting in the interior arrangement of the quiet respectable town with its
                    canals and moats, its broad streets, and lifeless squares. The pensive and even
                    melancholy impression which it seems sometimes to produce on the stranger is
                    easily explained. Leyden is <hi rend="italic">par excellence</hi> an academic
                    city; the bustle of its great markets for cattle and dairy produce is <pb

                    many hours on so many days, and its industrial activity, considerable though it
                    be, is not sufficient to give that appearance of life and movement which their
                    flourishing local and transit trade makes so generally characteristic of the
                    towns of Holland. The woollen goods (coverlets and broadcloths), the cotton
                    stuffs, the worsted and yarns, the iron and copper wares, and the books and
                    lithographic work which it still produces, are far from maintaining for it the
                    position which it enjoyed when, at the close of the 15th century, its weaving
                    establishments (mainly broadcloth) numbered from three to four hundred, or when,
                    after the expulsion of the Spaniards, Leyden cloth, Leyden baize, and Leyden
                    camlet became familiar terms at home and abroad. Owing to changes of fashion,
                    unwise preservation of old customs and institutions, party spirit, the
                    development of manufactures in other places, these industries had so far
                    declined in the beginning of the 19th century—the total production of all the
                    factories in 1802, for example, did not exceed 1086 pieces of cloth—that the
                    baize manufacture was altogether given up, and the beautiful Say (Worsted) Hall
                    was closed. Although after the revolution of 1813 comparative prosperity was the
                    result of the removal of the French yoke, and more especially of the
                    introduction of steam, the times of a Maurice or a Frederick Henry have never
                    returned, and still less the wonderful days of the 15th century. The university
                    is still a flourishing institution, with fifty professors; but other
                    universities have grown up in the Netherlands, and even professors of European
                    reputation can no longer attract from foreign lands the numbers that visited
                    Leyden in the days of Lipsius, Vossius, Heinsi·us, Gronovius, Hemsterhuis,
                    Ruhnken, Valckenaer, Scaliger, and Boerhaave. As a class the students are
                    remarkably quiet and orderly. Many are destined to a diplomatic career. The
                    university <hi rend="italic">(Akademie)</hi> was opened in February 1575, and
                    originally located in the convent of St Barbara. In 1581 it was transferred to
                    the convent of the White Nuns, the site of which it still occupies, though the
                    building was destroyed in 1616. Of the institutions connected with the
                    university it is sufficient to mention the library (upwards of 160,000 volumes
                    and 4650 MSS. and 2400 pamphlet portfolios), rich in Oriental and Greek
                    manuscripts and old Dutch travels; the botanic gardens, with splendid
                    collections of East Indian plants; the observatory (1860); the museum of natural
                    history, one of the principal establishments of its kind in Europe; the museum
                    of antiquities, with a specially valuable Egyptian department; the
                    ethnographical museum, of which the nucleus was Von Siebold’s Japanese
                    collections; and the national institution for East Indian languages,
                    ethnography, and geography. The Thysian library and the library of the Society
                    of Dutch literature (1766) are both large collections, the former especially
                    rich in legal works and native chronicles; the great school of navigation, and
                    the Remonstrant seminary, transferred from Amsterdam in 1873, deserve special
                    mention, and in general it may be said that there is no city in the Netherlands
                    better supplied than Leyden is with educational and intellectual
                    institutions.</p>
                <p>Objects of artistic and antiquarian interest are fewer than might be expected
                    from the position which Leyden holds in the history of painting (Rembrandt, Jan
                    Steen, and Gerard Douw were natives of the town); but such as they are—pieces by
                    Van Finck, Fr. van Mieris, Cornelis Engelbrechtszoon, Lucas of Leyden, and other
                    masters —they have for the most part been collected in the newly founded
                    municipal museum located in the old cloth hall. More interesting is the great
                    collection of portraits of famous professors in the aula of the university. All
                    the gate-houses of the city were still standing about the close of the 17th
                    century; two only, the Zijlpoort and the Morschpoort have been spared. The old
                    town-hall is a quaint 16th century building, and St Pancratius church has some
                    striking features. Near the site of the Rijnsburg gate is the statue of
                    Boerhaave by Stracké. The “Burg,” on an artificial mound (perhaps of Roman
                    origin) in the centre of the town, is an old circular wall resting on twenty
                    arches; it forms a favourite promenade, and affords a fine point of view.
                    Towards the south side of the town lies an open space, suggestively called the
                    Ruin, which in 1807 was the scene of a terrible disaster, a powdership blowing
                    up and destroying eight hundred houses and killing hundreds of men. In 1623 the
                    population of Leyden was much more than 50,000, and in 1640, it is estimated,
                    reached 100,000. Between 1796 and 1811 it sunk to 30,000. In 1850 it was 35,864;
                    in 1870, 38,943 (9632 Roman Catholics, 396 Jews); and in 1882 about 41,000.</p>
                <p>Though Lugdunum Batavorum is used by the learned as the Latin name for Leyden,
                    there is no possibility of identifying the town itself with the Lugdunum of the
                    Romans. It first appears in 11th and 12th century documents as Leythen, Leithen,
                    Leithon, and Leithan. The history of Leyden follows the same general lines as
                    the history of the Netherlands. During the period of the counts the city
                    suffered from the quarrels of one count with another (as when Countess Ada was
                    besieged in the castle by Lewis of Loon in 1203), or of the nobles with the
                    citizens; between 1419 and 1485 it was besieged and captured no less than six
                    times by the “Hooks” or the “Cods.” From Floris V. it received the confirmation
                    of its privileges (1266) and of its freedom from toll throughout Holland (1290).
                    During the struggle with Spain Leyden covered itself with glory by the
                    persistence with which it held out against the double siege from 31st October
                    1573 to 21st March 1574, and from 25th May to 2d October (see Motley, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rise of the Dutch Republic,</hi> vol. ii.). With the internal
                    troubles of the 17th century it was closely connected. Coolhas, one of the first
                    professors of its university, gave rise about 1578 to a question of heresy which
                    formed in some sort the prelude to the great contest in which his successors
                    Arminius and Gomarus were protagonists. In 1587 Leicester vainly attempted to
                    bring the city over to his side; in 1618 Maurice was there constrained to alter
                    the government; and in 1672 there were violent disturbances in connexion with
                    the elevation of William III. to the stadtholdership. The revolution, excited by
                    the French, took place in 1798; and in 1813 the Rhenish peasants, in revolt
                    against the conscription, marched into the city. In 1836 there was a great
                    inundation caused by the Haarlem Lake. The bicentenary of the university was
                    celebrated with great ceremony in 1874.</p>
