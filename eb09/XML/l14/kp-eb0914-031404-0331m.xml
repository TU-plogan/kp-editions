                    certainly) used in a rather general sense, the specific meaning being signified
                    by a prefix, as Skylark, Titlark, Woodlark, and so forth. It seems to be nearly
                    conterminous with the Latin <hi rend="italic">Alauda</hi> as used by older
                    authors; and, though this was to some extent limited by Linnaeus, several of the
                    species included by him under the genus he so designated have long since been
                    referred elsewhere. By Englishmen the word Lark, used without qualification,
                    almost invariably means the <hi rend="smallcaps">Skylark,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Alauda</hi><hi rend="italic">arvensis,</hi> which, as the best known and most
                    widely-spread species throughout Europe, has been invariably considered the type
                    of the genus. It scarcely needs description. Of all birds it holds
                    unquestionably the foremost<pb break="no"

                    poet or poetaster who has not made it his theme, to say nothing of the many
                    writers of prose who have celebrated its qualities in passages that will be
                    remembered so long as our language lasts. It is also one of the most favourite
                    cage birds, as it will live for many years in captivity, and, except in the
                    season of moult, will pour forth its thrilling song many times in an hour for
                    weeks or months together, while its affection for its owner is generally of the
                    most marked kind. Difficult as it is to estimate the comparative abundance of
                    different species of birds, there would probably be no error in accounting the
                    Skylark the most plentiful of the Class in Western Europe. Not only does it
                    frequent almost all unwooded districts in this quarter of the globe, making
                    known its presence throughout spring and summer, everywhere that it occurs, by
                    its gladsome and heart-lifting notes, but, unlike most birds, its numbers
                    increase with the spread of agricultural improvement, and since the beginning of
                    the century the extended breadth of arable land in Great Britain must have
                    multiplied manifold the Lark-population of the country. Nesting chiefly in the
                    growing corn, its eggs and young are protected in a great measure from all
                    molestation; and, as each pair of birds will rear several broods in the season,
                    their produce on the average may be set down as at least quadrupling the
                    original stock—the eggs in each nest varying from five to three. The majority of
                    young Larks seem to leave their birthplace so soon as they can shift for
                    themselves, but what immediately becomes of them is one of the many mysteries of
                    bird life that has not yet been penetrated. When the stubbles are cleared, old
                    and young congregate in flocks; but the young then seen appear to be those only
                    of the later broods. In the course of the autumn they give place to others
                    coming from more northerly districts, and then as winter succeeds in great part
                    vanish, leaving but a tithe of the numbers previously present. On the approach
                    of severe weather, in one part of the country or another, flocks arrive,
                    undoubtedly from the Continent, which in magnitude cast into insignificance all
                    those that have hitherto inhabited the district. On the east coast of both
                    Scotland and England this immigration has been several times noticed as
                    occurring in a constant stream for as many as three days in succession. Further
                    inland the birds are observed “in numbers simply incalculable,” and “in
                    countless hundreds.” On such occasions the bird-catchers are busily at work with
                    their nets or snares, so that 20,000 or 30,000 Larks are often sent together to
                    the London market, and at the lowest estimate &lt;£2000 worth are annually sold
                    there. During the winter of 1867-68, 1,255,500 Larks, valued at £2260, were
                    taken into the town of Dieppe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Yarrell {Hist. Br. Birds, ed. 4, i. pp. 618-621), where
                    particular references to the above statements, and some others, are
                    given.</p></note> The same thing happens in various places almost every year,
                    and many persons are apt to believe that thereby the species is threatened with
                    extinction. When, however, it is considered that, if these birds were left to
                    continue their wanderings, a large proportion would die of hunger before
                    reaching a place that would supply them with food, and that of the remainder an
                    enormous proportion would perish at sea in their vain attempt to find a
                    settlement, it must be acknowledged that man by his wholesale massacres, which
                    at first seem so brutal, is but anticipating the act of Nature, and on the whole
                    probably the fate of the Larks at his hands is not worse than that which they
                    would encounter did not his nets intervene.</p>
                <p>The Skylark’s range extends across the Old World from the Faroe to the Kurile
                    Islands. In winter it occurs in North China, Nepaul, the Punjab, Persia,
                    Palestine, Lower Egypt, and Barbary. It sometimes strays to Madeira, and has
                    been killed in Bermuda, though its unassisted appear ance there is doubtful. It
                    has been successfully introduced σn Long Island in the State of New York, and
                    into New Zealand—in which latter it is likely to become as troublesome a denizen
                    as are other subjects upon which Acclimatization Societies have exercised their
                    meddlesome activity. Allied to the Skylark a considerable number of species have
                    been described, of which perhaps a dozen may be deemed valid, besides a supposed
                    local race, <hi rend="italic">Alauda agrestis,</hi> the difference between which
                    and the normal bird is shown in the annexed woodcut (fig. 1), kindly lent to
                    this work by Mr Dresser, in whose <hi rend="italic">Birds of Europe</hi> it is
                    described at length. These are found in various parts of Africa and Asia.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Woodlark,</hi><hi rend="italic">Alauda arborea,</hi> is
                    the only other clearly-established European species of the genus, as now limited
                    by some recent authorities. It is a much more local and therefore a far less
                    numerous bird than the Skylark, from which it may be easily distinguished by its
                    finer bill, shorter tail, more spotted breast, and light superciliary stripe.
                    Though not actually inhabiting woods, as its common name might imply, it is
                    seldom found far from trees. Its song wants the variety and power of the
                    Skylark’s, but has a resonant sweetness peculiarly its own. The bird, however,
                    requires much care in captivity, and is far less often caged than its congener.
                    It has by no means so wide a range as the Skylark, and perhaps the most eastern
                    locality recorded for it is Erzeroum, while its appearance in Egypt and even in
                    Algeria must be accounted rare.</p>
                <p>Not far removed from the foregoing is a group of Larks characterized by a larger
                    crest, a stronger and more curved bill, a rufous lining to the wings, and some
                    other minor features. This group has been generally termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >Galerita</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name,
                    however, is inadmissible, owing to its prior use in Entomology.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and has for its type the Crested Lark, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alauda cristata</hi> of Linnaeus, a bird common enough in parts of
                    France and some other countries of the European Continent, and said to have been
                    obtained several times in the British Islands. Many of the birds of this group
                    frequent the borders if not the interior of deserts, and such as do so exhibit a
                    more or less pale coloration, whereby they are assimilated in hue to that of
                    their haunts. The same characteristic may be observed in several other
                    groups—especially those known as belonging to the Genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calandrella, Ammomanes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Certhilauda,</hi> some
                    species of which are of a light sandy or cream colour. The genus last named is
                    of very peculiar appearance, presenting in some respects an extraordinary
                    resemblance to the Hoopoes, so much so that the first specimen described was
                    referred to the genus <hi rend="italic">Upupa,</hi> and named <hi rend="italic"
                    >U. alaudipes.</hi> The resemblance, however, is merely one of analogy. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hoopoe</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(ç.v.)</hi> belongs to a
                    totally distinct Order of birds, widely differing anatomically and
                    physiologically, and we can hardly yet assume that this resemblance is the
                    effect of what is commonly <pb break="no"

                    prove to be the case.</p>
                <p>There is, however, abundant evidence of the susceptibility of the Alaudine
                    structure to modification from external circumstances,—in other words, of its
                    plasticity; and perhaps no homogeneous group of <hi rend="italic">Passeres</hi>
                    could be found which better displays the working of “Natural Selection.” This
                    fact was recognized many years ago, and ere “Darwinism” was founded as a creed,
                    by one whose knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">Alaudidse</hi> was based on the
                    safe ground of extensive personal observation, and by one who cannot be
                    suspected of any prejudice in favour of new-fangled notions. The remarks made by
                    Canon Tristram <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1859, pp. 429-433) deserve all
                    attention, going, as they go, to the root of the matter, and nothing but the
                    exigencies of space precludes their reproduction here. A monograph of the Family
                    executed by a competent ornithologist from an evolutionary point of view could
                    not fail to be a weapon of force in the hands of all evolutionists. Almost every
                    character that among Passerine birds is accounted most sure is in the Larks
                    found subject to modification. The form of the bill varies in an extraordinary
                    degree. In the Woodlark (fig. 2, A), already noticed, it is almost as slender as
                    a Warbler’s; in <hi rend="italic">Ammomanes</hi> it is short; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Cerlhi-lauda</hi> (fig. 2, B) it is elongated and curved; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrrhu-ιauda</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Melanocorypha</hi>
                    (fig.</p>
                <p>3, A) it is stout and Finchlike; while in <hi rend="italic">Rhamphocorys</hi>
                    (fig. 3, B) it is exaggerated to an extent that surpasses almost any Fringilline
                    form, exceeding in its development that found in some members of the perplexing
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Para-doxornis,</hi> and even presenting a resemblance to
                    the same feature in the far-distant <hi rend="italic">Anas-tornus—</hi> the
                    tomia of the maxilla not meeting those of the mandibula along their whole
                    length, but leaving an open space between them. The hind claw, generally greatly
                    elongated in Larks, is in <hi rend="italic">Calandrella</hi> (fig. 4) and some
                    other genera reduced to a very moderate size. The wings exhibit almost every
                    modification, from the almost entire abortion of the first primary in the
                    Skylark to its c ∣n-siderable development (fig. 5), and from tertials and
                    scapulars of ordinary length to the extreme elongation found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Motacillidae</hi> and almost in certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolae.</hi> The most constant character indeed of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alaudidae</hi> would seem to be that afforded by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρodotlιeca</hi> or covering of the tarsus, which is scutellate behind as well
                    as in front, but a character easily overlooked.<note anchored="true"

                    is represented by two species, one of which, found over nearly the whole of
                    North America, is certainly not distinguishable from the Shore-Lark of Europe
                    and Asia, <hi rend="italic">0. alpestris;</hi> while the other, confined to the
                    higher elevations of more southern latitudes, seems to be the relic of a former
                    immigration (perhaps during a glacial period) of the northern form, which has
                    through isolation come to be differentiated as <hi rend="italic">O.
                    chrysolaema</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 746). The
                    Shore-Lark is in Europe a native of only the extreme north, but is very common
                    near the shores of the Varanger Fjord, and likewise breeds on mountain-tops
                    further south-west, though still well within the Arctic circle. The mellow tone
                    of its call-note has obtained for it in Lapland a name signifying “Bell-bird,”
                    and the song of the cock is lively, though not very loud. The bird trustfully
                    resorts to the neighbourhood of houses, and even enters the villages of East
                    Finmark in search of its food. It produces at least two broods in the season,
                    and towards autumn migrates to lower latitudes in large flocks. Of late years
                    these have been observed almost every winter on the east coast of Great Britain,
                    and the species instead of being regarded, as it once was, in the light of an
                    accidental visitor to the United Kingdom, must now be deemed an almost regular
                    visitor, though in very varying numbers. The observations on its habits made by
                    Audubon in Labrador have long been known, and often reprinted.<note
