                    has an irregular oval form, its greatest length being about 50 miles, and it
                    greatest breadth about 40. The area comprises 513,388 acres, or about 802 square
                    miles. The county consists chiefly of river valleys surrounded by elevated
                    table-lands rising occasionally into mountains, while on the borders of the
                    sea-coast the surface is generally level. The principal river is the Roe, which
                    flows northwards from the borders of Tyrone into Lough Foyle below
                    Newtown-Limavady, and divides the county into two unequal parts. Further west
                    the Faughan also falls into Lough Foyle, and the river Foyle passes through a
                    small portion of the country near its north-western boundary. In the south-east
                    the Moyola falls into Lough Neagh, and the Lower Bann from Lough Neagh forms for
                    some distance its eastern boundary with Antrim. The only lake in the county is
                    Lough Finn on the borders of Tyrone, but Lough Neagh, which is included in
                    Antrim, forms for about 6 miles its south-eastern boundary. The valley of the
                    Roe is a line of division between two entirely different geological structures.
                    To the east there is a basaltic tract in all respects similar to that in Antrim,
                    except that on the Londonderry side, of the Bann the dip of the strata is
                    reversed and lies north-east. At Benyevenagh, which has an elevation of 1262
                    feet, the basalt reaches a thickness of 900 feet. It is succeeded by chalk lias,
                    limestone, and red sandstone, the whole resting on primitive rock. The remainder
                    of the county consists chiefly of mica-slate and primitive limestone, and
                    includes the mountain of Sawel, with an elevation of 2236 feet, as well as other
                    eminences approaching 2000 feet in height. Hornblende and granite frequently
                    emerge above the slate, and limestone is not uncommon. Sandstone crops to the
                    surface throughout nearly the whole of the valley of the Roe. Fine rock crystals
                    are found in Finglen, near Dungiven, and in several other districts. Iron was at
                    one time worked at Slieve Gullion, and is obtained in abundance in the bogs.
                    There are a few unimportant veins of copper and lead.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The excessive rainfall and the cold and
                    uncertain climate are unfavourable for agricultural operations, and except in
                    the valleys the soil is unsuitable for tillage. In the basalt region large
                    tracts are partially submerged, and the hard and firm portions consist chiefly
                    of rock Along the sea-coast there is an extensive district of red clay formed by
                    the decomposition of sandstone, and near the mouth of the Roe there is an
                    extensive tract of a marly nature. Along the valleys the soil is often very
                    fertile, and the elevated districts of the clay-slate region afford rich pasture
                    for sheep.</p>
                <p>In 1880 181,239 acres were under tillage, 206,044 were pasture, 5305 plantation,
                    and 120,451 waste. The total number of holdings in the same year was 17,351, of
                    which 1377 were under 1 acre. More than half of the total number were included
                    in those between 5 and 15 acres and those between 15 and 30 acres, which
                    numbered 5467 and 4848 respectively. The following table shows the area under

                <p>The increase in the area under crops is due chiefly to the increase in that under

                    annual value per acre being 14s. 3d. Of the owners about 36 per cent, possessed
                    less than 1 acre. As many as 153,419 acres were possessed by the Irish Society
                    and seven of the livery companies of London—the Irish Society possessing 6075
                    acres; the Drapers’ Company, 27,025; the Fishmongers’, 20,509; the Grocers’,

                    and some salt-works. There are important fisheries of salmon and eels on the

                    Londonderry with Enniskillen.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> The county comprises 6
                    baronies, with 43 parishes and 1202 townlands. It is in the northwest circuit.
                    Assizes are held at Londonderry, and quarter sessions at Coleraine, Londonderry,
                    Magherafelt, and Limavady. Within the county there are 14 petty sessions
                    districts. It includes two poor-law unions and portions of other three.
                    Londonderry is in the Belfast military district and Omagh subdistrict. The
                    county is represented in parliament by two members, and the boroughs of
                    Londonderry (28,947) and Coleraine (6684) by one each. The population of the
                    county, which in 1760 was only 46,182, had increased by 1821 to 193,869, and by
                    1841 to 222,461, but in 1851 had diminished to 192,269, in 1871 to 173,906, and
                    in 1881 to 164,714, of whom 79,138 were males and 85,576 females. From the 1st
                    May 1851 to 31st December 1881 the number of emigrants was 73,725. For every
                    1000 of the population the death-rate in 1880 was 19’2, the marriage-rate 4 <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> At an early period the county
                    was inhabited by the O’Cathans, or O’Catrans, who were tributary to the O’Nials
                    or O’Neils. Towards the close of the reign of Elizabeth the county was seized
                    with the purpose of checking the power of the O’Neils, when it received the name
                    of Coleraine, having that town for its capital. In 1609, after the confiscation
                    of the estates of the O’Neils, the citizens of London obtained possession of the
                    towns of Londonderry and Coleraine and adjoining lands, 60 acres out of every
                    1000 being assigned for church lands, and certain other portions to three native
                    Irish gentlemen. The common council of London undertook to expend £20,000 on its
                    reclamation, and elected a body of twenty-six for its management, who in 1613
                    were incorporated as the Irish Society, and retained possession of the towns of
                    Londonderry and Coleraine, the remainder of the property being divided among
                    twelve of the great livery companies of the city. Notwithstanding the
                    expenditure of large sums by these companies in its management, their estates
                    were afterwards sequestrated by James I., and in 1637 the charter of the Irish
                    Society was cancelled. Cromwell restored the society to its former position, and
                    Charles II. at the Restoration granted it a new charter, and confirmed the
                    companies in the possession of their estates. In the insurrection of 1641
                    Moneymore was seized by the Irish, and Magherafelt and Bellaghy, then called
                    Vintner’s Town, burned, as well as other towns and villages. The most remarkable
                    ancient ruin is that of the Cyclopean fortress of the Giant’s Sconce or Ring,
                    situated in the pass between Drumbo and Lar-gantea, the interior of which, 600
                    feet in diameter, is partly hollowed out of a knoll of basalt, by which it is
                    enclosed on all sides except the north-east, where it is defended by a wall of
                    great thickness, with access for only one person in a stooping posture. The most
                    remarkable of the Druidical circles is that at Slacht <pb break="no"

                    caves. The most ancient castle of Irish origin is that of Carrickreagh; and of
                    the castles erected by the English those of Dungiven, Salterstown, and Muff are
                    still in good preservation. The old abbey of Dungiven, founded in 1109, and
                    standing on a rock about 200 feet above tho river Roe, is a very picturesque
                    ruin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Londonderry,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Derry,</hi> a
                    county of a city, parliamentary borough, and the chief town of the county of
                    Londonderry, is situated on an eminence rising abruptly from the west side of
                    the river Foyle to the height of about 120 feet, 4 miles from the junction of
                    the river with Lough Foyle, and 80 miles north-north-west of Belfast. It is
                    still surrounded by an ancient rampart about a mile in circumference and having
                    seven gates, but the buildings now extend considerably beyond this boundary. The
                    summit of the hill, which is at the centre of the town, is occupied by a
                    quadrangular area from which the main streets, which for the most part are
                    spacious, diverge at right angles. Some of the original houses with high
                    pyramidal gables remain, but they have been much modernized. The river is
                    crossed by an iron bridge 1200 feet in length. The cathedral in the Later
                    English style, and consisting of nave and aisles separated by pointed arches,
                    with tower and spire at the west end, was completed in 1633 at a cost of £4000,
                    contributed by the city of London. The building is 240 feet in length with a
                    breadth of 62 feet, and the height of the tower and spire is 228 feet. The spire
                    was added in 1788, when the old tower was raised 21 feet, and in 1302 the spire
                    was rebuilt. The bishop’s palace, erected in 1716, occupies the site of the
                    abbey founded by Columba. The abbot of this monastery, on being made bishop,
                    erected in 1164 Temple More or the “Great Church,” one of the finest buildings
                    in Ireland previous to the Anglo-Norman invasion. The original abbey church was
                    called the “Black Church,” but both it and the “Great Church” were demolished in
                    1600, and their materials used in fortifying the city. There is a large Roman
                    Catholic cathedral. The court-house was completed in 1824 at a cost of about
                    £34,000. For the free grammar school, founded in 1617, a new building was
                    erected in 1814 at a cost of over £14,000. There are a number of charitable
                    foundations. The staple manufacture of the town is linen, and there are also
                    shipbuilding yards, iron foundries, saw-mills, manure-works, distilleries,
                    breweries, and flour-mills. The salmon fishery on the Foyle is also very
                    valuable. The river affords facilities for a secure and commodious harbour, its
                    greatest depth being 33 feet, with a depth of 12 feet at low water. The port has
                    a considerable coasting trade with Great Britain, exporting agricultural produce
                    and provisions. For the last five years its imports have averaged over £600,000
                    (chiefly grain and provisions), and its exports, which vary very greatly, over
                    £10,000. In 1880 the number of vessels that entered the port was 1569, with a
                    total tonnage of 335,544, the number that cleared 1452, with a tonnage of
                    326,178. Londonderry returns one member to parliament. The population of the
                    city, which in 1857 was 19,399, had increased in 1871 to 25,242, and in 1881 to
                    28,947.</p>
                <p>Derry, the original name of Londonderry, is derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Doire,</hi> the “place of oaks.” It owes its origin to the monastery founded by
                    Columba in 546. From the 9th to the 11th century the town was frequently in the
                    possession of the Danes, and was often burned and devastated, but they were
                    finally driven from it by Murtagh O’Brien about the beginning of the 12th
                    century. In 1311 it was granted by Edward II. to Richard de Bnrgo. After the
