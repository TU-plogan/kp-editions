                    its greatest breadth, from Wroot on the west to Saltfleet on the east, is 50
                    miles, its circuit about 260 miles. Its area is 1,767,962 acres, or about 2762
                    square miles, making it the second largest county in England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coast-Line.</hi> —The coast-line, about 110 miles in length, is
                    low and marshy, and artificial banks for guarding against the inroads of the sea
                    are to be found, in places, all along the coast. From Grimsby to Skegness traces
                    of a submarine forest are visible; but while the sea is encroaching upon some
                    parts of the coast it is receding from others, as shown by Holbeach, which is
                    now 6 miles from the sea. Several thousand acres have been reclaimed from this
                    part of the Wash, and round the mouth of the Nene on the southeast. The deep bay
                    between the coasts of Lincolnshire and Norfolk, called the Wash, is full of
                    dangerous sandbanks and silt; the navigable portion, off the Lincolnshire coast,
                    is known as the Boston deeps. The rapidity of the tides in this inlet, and the
                    lowness of its shores, which are generally indistinct on account of mist from a
                    moderate offing, render this the most difficult portion of the navigation of the
                    east coast of England.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geology.—</hi> The surface of Lincolnshire is
                    generally a large plain, some portions of which are below the level of the sea.
                    The south-east parts are perfectly flat; and about one-third of the county
                    consists of fens and marshes, intersected in all directions by artificial
                    drains, called locally dykes, delphs, drains, becks, learns, and eaux. This flat
                    surface is, however, broken by two ranges of calcareous hills running north and
                    south through the county, and known as the Cliff and the Wolds. The former
                    range, on the west, runs nearly due north from Grantham to Lincoln, and thence
                    to the Humber, traversing the Heaths of Lincolnshire, which were formerly open
                    moors, rabbit warrens, and sheep walks, but are now enclosed and brought into
                    high cultivation. Parallel with this range on the east side of it runs the old
                    Roman Ermine Street, sometimes called the Cliff Row Road. The Wolds form a ridge
                    of bold hills extending from Spilsby to Barton-on-Humber for about 40 miles,
                    with an average breadth of about 8 miles. Between the Wolds and the sea lie the
                    Marshes, a level tract of rich alluvial soil extending from Barton-on-Humber to
                    Wainfleet, varying in breadth from 5 to 10 miles. Between the Welland and the
                    Nene in the south-east of the county are Gedney Marsh, Holbeach Marsh, Moulton
                    Marsh, and Sutton Marsh.</p>
                <p>The Fens, the soil of which has been formed partly by tidal action and partly by
                    the decay of forests, occupy the Isle of Axholme on the north-west, the vale of
                    Ancholme on the north, and most of the country south-east of Lincoln. The chief
                    of these are the Holland, Wildmore, West, and East Fens draining into the
                    Witham; and the Deeping, Bourn, Great Porsand, and Whaplode Fens draining into
                    the Welland. Owing to the dead level of these districts there is perhaps more
                    artificial drainage in Lincolnshire than in any other English county; and this
                    part of the country resembles in many respects, especially in embankments and
                    dykes, the continental Holland.</p>
                <p>The drainage of the Fens appears to have early occupied attention. Shortly after
                    the Norman Conquest Richard de Rulos, lord of Brunn, and chamberlain to William
                    I., enclosed and drained a large part of Deeping Fen in so complete a manner
                    that the work would not be disgraced by a comparison with the more scientific
                    efforts of modern times. Excluding the Welland by a bank, he changed ‘ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> deep lakes and impassable fens into most fruitful
                    fields and pastures, and the most humid and moorish parts thereof into a garden
                    of pleasure.”</p>
                <p>The drainage of the remaining levels of Lincolnshire was chiefly commenced in the
                    reigns of James I. and Charles I. The East, West, and Wildmore Fens were
                    contracted for in the 7tħ Charles I. The earl of Lindsey undertook all the fens
                    in Holland and Kesteven, north of the river Glen up to Lincoln, on the
                    completion of which 24,000 acres were awarded to him. In the 13th of the same
                    reign, the king declared himself the “Undertaker” of the Holland Fen, containing
                    22,000 acres, out of which he was to have 8000 for his share. Sir John Monson
                    with other freeholders drained the Ancholme level in the north, and had 5827
                    acres assigned to them. In the same reign the Isle of Axholme was undertaken by
                    Cornelis Vermuijden and his Dutch and Flemish followers. These operations were
                    interrupted during the civil wars, and many of the works destroyed by the
                    “stilt-walkers,” so curiously described by Camden. Little was done towards
                    restoring the works thus destroyed till the middle of the 18th century, when
                    several townships, having a right of common over particular fens, began to join
                    in procuring Acts of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0677-0654"/> Parliament for their drainage, enclosure, and
                    division. The Holland Fen was the first to be dealt with, about 1768; in spite
                    of renewed and riotous opposition from the “stilt-walkers,” all the fen lands
                    were successfully drained and enclosed, and on the completion of the East, West,
                    and Wildmore Fens (about 60,000 acres) the race of “stilt-walkers” became
                    extinct. The low lands adjoining the tidal reaches of the Trent and Humber, and
                    part of those around the Wash, have been raised above the natural level, and
                    enriched by the process of warping, which consists in letting the tide run over
                    the land, and retaining it there a sufficient time to permit of the deposit of
                    the sand and mud held in solution by the waters.</p>
                <p>The general appearance of the county is very pleasing. The level tracts are
                    richly cultivated; the hills and dales are interspersed with wood and lawn; and
                    many spots on the Cliff or Wolds command extensive and charming views. The
                    charms of the Fen districts are described as “a beauty as of the sea, of
                    boundless expanse and freedom” (Kingsley). Not a few passages in the writings of
                    Tennyson (a native of the county) bear the impress of the scenery and colourings
                    of the Fens.</p>
                <p>The geological formations, for the most part, extend in parallel belts, nearly in
                    the line of the length of the county, from north to south, and succeed one
                    another, in ascending order, from west to east.</p>
                <p>1. The lowest is the <hi rend="italic">Triassic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New Red
                    Sandstone</hi> found in the Isle of Axholme and the valley of the Trent in the
                    form of marls, sandstone, and gypsum. The presence of the peroxide of iron which
                    tinges the beds red seems to have been prejudicial to animal life; therefore few
                    fossils are found. Fish scales and teeth, with bones and footprints of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Labyrinthodon,</hi> are to be met with in the sandstone. The red
                    clay is frequently dug for brick-making. The beds dip gently towards the east.
                    At the junction between the Trias and Lias are series of beds termed Rhaetics,
                    which seem to mark a transition from one to the other. These beds are in part
                    exposed in pits near Newark, and extend north by Gainsborough to where the Trent
                    flows into the Humber, passing thence into Yorkshire. The characteristic shells
                    are found at Lea, 2 miles south of Gainsborough, with a thin stratum of bone bed
                    full of fish teeth and scales.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Lower Lias</hi> comes next in order, with a valuable bed
                    of ironstone now largely worked. This bed is about 27 feet in thickness, and
                    crops out at Scunthorpe, where the workings are open and shallow. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle Lias,</hi> which enters the county near Woolsthorpe, is
                    about 20 or 30 feet thick, and is very variable both in thickness and
                    mineralogical character. The <hi rend="italic">Upper Lias</hi> enters the county
                    at Stainby, passing by Grantham and Lincoln. It forms the west slope of the
                    Cliff range, and is thickest upon the highest hills. The Lias thus occupies a
                    band about 8 or 10 miles in width in the south, narrowing until on the Humber it
                    is about a mile wide.</p>
                <p>3. To this succeed the three Oolite formations. The <hi rend="italic">Lower
                    Oolite,</hi> somewhat narrower than the Lias, extends from the boundary with
                    Rutland due north past Lincoln to the vicinity of the Humber. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Middle Oolite,</hi> very narrow in the south near Wilsthorpe,
                    widening gradually about Sleaford, and then suddenly contracting again south of
                    Lincoln, sends out a narrow band south-east towards Spilsby. It then proceeds
                    north from Lincoln with decreasing width to the vicinity of the Humber. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Upper Oolite</hi> and Kimmeridge clay start from the vicinity of
                    Stamford, and after attaining their greatest width near Horncastle, run
                    north-north-west to the Humber.</p>
                <p>4. In the <hi rend="italic">Cretaceous</hi> system of the Wolds, the Lower
                    Greensand runs nearly parallel with the Upper Oolite past South Willingham to
                    the Humber. The Upper Greensand and Gault run north-west from Irby, widening out
                    as far as Kelstern on the east, and cross the Humber. The Chalk formation, about
                    equal in breadth to the three preceding, extends from Burgh across the
                    Humber.</p>
                <p>5. All the rest of the county, comprising all its south-east portions between the
                    Middle Oolite belt and the sea, all its north-east portion between the Chalk
                    belt and the sea, and a narrow tract up the course of the Ancholme river,
                    consists of alluvial deposits or of reclaimed marsh.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Gypsum is dug in the Isle of Axholme, whiting
                    is made from the chalk near the shores of the Humber, and lime is made on the
                    Wolds. Freestone is quarried around Ancaster, and good oolite building stone is
                    quarried near Lincoln and other places. Ironstone is found and worked at Claxby
                    near Caistor, and carried into Yorkshire to be smelted; it is also worked at
                    Frodingham, 9 miles north-north-west of Brigg.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> The Humber separates Lincolnshire from Yorkshire.
                    Its ports on the Lincolnshire side are Barton, New Holland, and Grimsby. The
                    Trent divides the Isle of Axholme from Lindsey, and falls into the Humber about
                    30 miles below Gainsborough. Like the Severn, it is noted for a tidal phenomenon
                    called the “eager” or bore, which, at spring tides, rises to the height of from
                    6 to 8 feet. The Witham rises on the south-west border of the county, flows
                    north past Grantham to Lincoln, and thence east and south-east to Boston, after
                    a course of about 80 miles. This river was once noted for its pike. The Welland
                    rises in north-west Northamptonshire, enters the county at Stamford, and, after
                    receiving the Glen, flows through an artificial channel into the Fossdyke Wash.
                    The Nene on the south-east has but a small portion of its course in
                    Lincolnshire; it flows due north through an artificial outfall called the
                    Wisbech Cut.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Canals.—</hi> The principal canals are—the Stainforth and
                    Keadby, connecting the Trent with the Yorkshire coal-field; the Louth
                    Navigation, from Louth to Tetney Haven; the Sleaford Navigation, connecting
                    Sleaford with the Witham; and the Grantham Canal, from that town to the Trent at
                    Nottingham. The remainder are chiefly small rivers artificially deepened and
                    embanked.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> The climate of the higher grounds is now noted
                    for its salubrity, and meteorological observation does not justify the
                    reputation for cold and damp often given to the county as a whole. The mean
                    annual temperature of the Fens as given by ten years’ observation (1864-73) is
                    47 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 9, 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 0,</hi> 6 below
                    that of Greenwich. The rainfall of the Fen district is very small as compared
                    with other parts of England. While the average of the whole country was little
                    over 30 inches, at Boston the average fall from 1830 to 1849 was 23 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 58 inches, and from 1850 to 1869 22Ό8. At Wisbech
                    south-west winds prevail on an average six months in the year, and north-east
                    winds barely two months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Soil and Agriculture.—</hi> The soils vary considerably,
                    according to the geological formations; ten or twelve different kinds may be
                    found in going across the country from east to west. A good sandy loam is common
                    in the Heath division; a sandy loam with chalk, or a flinty loam on chalk marl,
                    abounds on portions of the Wolds; an argillaceous sand, merging into rich loam,
                    lies on other portions of the Wolds; a black loam and a rich vegetable mould
                    cover most of the Isle of Axholme on the north-west; a well-reclaimed marine
                    marsh, a rich brown loam, and a stiff cold clay variously occupy the low tracts
                    along the Humber, and between the north Wolds and the sea; a peat earth, a deep
                    sandy loam, and a rich soapy blue clay occupy most of the east and south Fens;
                    and an artificial soil, obtained by “warping,” occupies considerable low strips
                    of land along the tidal reaches of the rivers. The wide grazing lands of
                    Lincolnshire have long been famous, and the arable lands are specially adapted
                    for the growth of wheat and beans. There is no generally recognized rotation of
                    crops. The cattle raised are the Shorthorns and improved Lincolnshire breeds.
                    The dairy, except in the vicinity of large towns, receives little attention. The
                    sheep are chiefly of the Lincolnshire and large Leicestershire breeds, and go to
                    the markets of Yorkshire and the metropolis. Lincolnshire has long been famous
                    for a fine breed of horses both for the saddle and draught. Horse fairs are held
                    every year at Horncastle and Lincoln. Large flocks of geese were formerly kept
                    in the Fens, but their number has been diminished since the drainage of these
                    parts. Where a large number of them were bred, nests were constructed for them
                    one above another; they were daily taken down by the gooseherd, driven to the
                    water, and then reinstated in their nests, without a single bird being
                    misplaced. Decoys were once numerous in the undrained state of the Fens.</p>

                    orchards 1788, under market gardens 660, under nursery grounds 137. Of the corn
                    crops the most largely grown is wheat, which in 1881 occupied 245,645

                    occupied 41,073 acres, pease 10,495 acres. Of the green crops the most largely
                    grown in 1881 were turnips and swedes, 142,300 acres, mostly on the Wolds and
                    Lincoln Heath. Potatoes occupied 39,794 acres; mangold, 21,438; vetches and
                    other green crops, except clover or grass, 18,615 acres; cabbage, kohl-rabi, and
                    rape, 15,057 acres; carrots, 1515 acres. Onions are raised to a great extent in
                    the Isle of Axholme, and under good management have been known to return £50 per
                    acre. Flax occupied 353 acres, and hops 3. The bare fallow or uncropped arable
                    land in 1881 was 39,950 acres. In 1870, 81‘7 per cent, of the entire area of
                    Lincolnshire was returned as cultivated, in 1879, 841 per cent., and in 1880, 84

                <p>The agriculture of Lincolnshire is only second to that of East Lothian, by which
                    alone it is excelled in the use of fixed steam-engines upon its farmsteads. In
                    the south part of the county small proprietors abound. According to the
                    landowner’s returns for 1872-73, the land in the county of Lincoln was divided
                    among 30,497 owners, and its gross estimated rental was £3,173,825. Of the
                    owners, 13,768, or more than 45 per cent., possessed less than 1 acre; the
                    average value per acre was £1, 19s. 6⅜d. There were four proprietors possessing
                    over 20,000 acres each :—Earl of Yarborough, 55,272 acres; Lady Willoughby de
                    Eresby, 24,696 acres; Henry Chaplin, Μ. P., 23,370 acres; and Christopher Tumor,

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> The manufactures are few and
                    comparatively small. There are, however, some large agricultural machine and
                    steam-engine factories in and around Lincoln; and similar works exist at Boston,
                    Gainsborough, Grantham, and Louth. At Frodingham there are extensive iron-works.
                    At Little Bytham a very hard brick, called the adamantine clinker, is made of
                    the silicious clay that the Romans used for their manufactures of pottery. At
                    Louth there is a carpet manufactory, also several tanneries and iron foundries.
                    Bone crushing, leather working, the manufacture of oil-cake for cattle, rope
                    making, and sack weaving are carried on in various places. The chief ports are
                    Grimsby, Boston, Sutton Bridge, and Gainsborough, the first being by far the
                    most important. For the fisheries of <hi rend="smallcaps">Grimsby</hi> see vol.
                    ix. p. 249.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The first line opened in the county was the
                    Midland Railway to Lincoln, in August 1846. The Manchester, Sheffield, and
                    Lincolnshire Railway, first opened in 1848-49, goes from Lincoln north-east to
                    Market Rasen, and thence, by way of Barnetby and Ulceby junctions, to Grimsby
                    and Cleethorpes. A second branch runs north-east from Gainsborough to New
                    Holland and Barton on the Humber, and a third from Barnetby due west to the
                    Yorkshire coal-fields. The Great Northern main line runs through the south-west
                    of the county past Grantham to Newark, and throws off several branches. A loop
                    line connecting Spalding, Boston, and Lincoln with the direct line from London
                    to York was opened in 1848. The East Lincolnshire Railway (leased to the Great
                    Northern) runs from Boston to Grimsby.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration.—</hi> The primary divisions of Lincolnshire are
                    three trithings or ridings. The north division constitutes the Parts of Lindsey,
                    the south-west the Parts of Kesteven, and the south-east the Parts of Holland.
                    Each of these divisions had before the Norman Conquest its own trithing gerefa
                    or reeve, and to this day each has its separate magistrates, quarter sessions,
                    clerk of the peace and treasurer, but they are all under one lord-lieutenant and
                    one sheriff, and subject to the court of assize held at Lincoln. These “Parts”
                    are again subdivided into wapentakes, sokes, and hundreds. The trithings do not
                    in any way coincide with parliamentary divisions. The Parts of Lindsey comprise
                    more than half the county, and contain seventeen wapentakes. The Parts of
                    Kesteven, exclusive of the soke and borough of Grantham and the borough of
                    Stamford, comprise nine wapentakes. The Parts of Holland comprise three
                    wapentakes only. Before the passing of the Reform Act of 1832 Lincolnshire sent
                    twelve members to parliament—two for the county, two for the city of Lincoln,
                    and two each for the boroughs of Great Grimsby, Boston, Grantham, and Stamford.
                    After the passing of that Act the county returned four members, and Grimsby lost
                    one. In 1867 Stamford also lost a member, and the representation of the county,
                    newly divided into Mid, North, and South Lincolnshire, was increased to six,
                    each new division returning two members. Lincolnshire comprises one city,
                    Lincoln (population 37,312), which is also a municipal and parliamentary
                    borough; four other municipal and parliamentary boroughs—Boston (18,867),
                    Grantham (17,345), Great Grimsby (45,373), Stamford, partly in Northampton
                    (8995); and one municipal borough—Louth (10,690).</p>
                <p>The county belongs to the midland circuit. Besides the winter and summer assizes
                    held at Lincoln, there are spring assizes held at the same place for Lincoln and
                    Notts, and autumn assizes at Nottingham for Notts and Lincoln. Quarter sessions
                    for the Parts of Lindsey are held at Lincoln and Spilsby, for the Parts of
                    Kesteven at Bourn and Sleaford, for the Parts of Holland at Boston and Spalding.
                    The county is divided into seventeen county court districts, many of which
                    coincide with the unions. For the convenience of rating there are eighteen poor
                    law unions; five of these, however, include eighty parishes in the adjacent
                    counties. Ecclesi-tically the county, with that of Nottingham, forms the diocese
                    of Lincoln, which is divided into the three archdeaconries of Lincoln, Stow, and
                    Nottingham, the latter place giving title to a suffragan bishop without a
                    see.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> The educational resources of the county in
                    1881 embraced one theological and one training college, both at Lincoln, and
                    fourteen endowed grammar schools at the following places :— Alford (founded
                    1565), Boston (1554), Bourn (1636), Caistor (1630), Donington (1701),
                    Gainsborough (1589), Grantham (1528), Horncastle (1571), Lincoln (1583), Louth
                    (1551), Moulton (1561), Sleaford (1604), Spalding (1588), Spilsby (1550).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> In 1881 the population of the county was
                    469,994 (235,014 males and 234,980 females); in 1861 it had been 412,246, and
                    436,599 in 1871. The figures for nine of the principal towns, in addition to the
                    boroughs already given, are as follows: —Bourn (7121), Caistor (8793),
                    Gainsborough (10,964), Glandford Brigg (3107), Holbeach (5190), Horncastle
                    (4814), Sleaford (4967), Spalding (9260), and Spilsby (7082).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> It is highly probable that the
                    territory now forming Lincolnshire was first settled by a tribe of the Belgae,
                    who, however, at the time of the invasion by Caesar, had become a mixed race
                    with the real Britons. This territory was unaffected by Caesar’s first invasion,
                    and even after the reduction of Britain by Claudius the Fenland remained intact.
                    The county was conquered about 70 A.D., and formed part of the province of
                    Flavia Caesariensis. The tribes which occupied Lincolnshire, according to
                    Ptolemy, were the Coritani, who had Lindum and Ratae (Leicester) for their
                    towns. The date of the introduction of Christianity is uncertain, but we learn
                    from Bede <hi rend="italic">{Hist. Eccles.,</hi> ii. 16) that Adelphius of
                    Colonia Londinensium, which has been mistaken for London, attended the council
                    of Arles (314). Under the Saxon kingdom of Mercia, Lindsey, which probably
                    extended nearly or quite over the modern county of Lincoln, appears to have been
                    a dependent state. Under Edwin of Northumbria, the conqueror of Mercia,
                    Christianity was reintroduced by Paulinus of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0679-0656"/> York, and Bede tells us that Blaecea, the
                    governor of Lincoln, was, with his household, among the first converts
                    (628).</p>
                <p>Early in 870 the Danes or Northmen landed at Humberstone near Grimsby, and
                    ravaged Lindsey and the famous monastery of Bardney on the Witham. Lincolnshire
                    passed permanently into the hands of the Danes about 877, and was included
                    within the boundary of the “Danelage” of Danish jurisdiction as settled by the
                    treaty of 878. Probably the greatest changes consequent upon the Danish invasion
                    are, first, the supplanting of the Anglo-Saxon names of places by those of the
                    Danish termination ending in <hi rend="italic">by,</hi> which are numerous, and
                    the substitution of the wapentake for the earlier division of the hundred; the
                    ancient British laws and those of the Danes were otherwise not dissimilar. In
                    time the two populations became amalgamated and came under the dominion of the
                    Anglo-Saxon crown. The subsequent history of the county under the Normans is
                    associated more or less with the city of Lincoln. In the civil war between
                    Stephen and the empress Matilda a battle was fought near Lincoln in 1141. In
                    1174 the Isle of Axholme was the scene of the struggle between Roger de Mowbray,
                    one of the adherents of Prince Henry, and the forces sent against him by his
                    father Henry II. The issue was decided by the Lincolnshire men in favour of the
                    king. In 1216 occurred King John’s march across the county, when he lost all his
                    baggage and jewels in the Fossdyke Wash on his way to Swineshead Abbey. In the
                    reign of Edward IV. Sir Robert Wells, at the head of 30,000 Lincolnshire men,
                    was defeated at Losecoat Field near Stamford, March 1470. At the suppression of
                    the monasteries a rebellion broke out at Louth headed by Makerel, the last prior
                    of the abbey of Barlings Oxney, October 1536. The prior was hanged, and the
                    shire for the trouble it gave to King Henry VIII. was designated in a state
                    paper as ‘ ‘ one of the most brute and beestalie of the whole realm.” During the
                    civil wars the county was a scene of numerous contests, the most famous of which
                    was the battle at Grantham in 1643, won by Cromwell over the royalists. The
                    advantage that was taken by the Fenmen to destroy the efforts made to drain and
                    enclose the remaining levels of Lincolnshire during this stormy period has been
                    already noticed. Riots broke out at intervals, and were continued down to the
                    middle of the 18th century.</p>
                <p>Remains of British camps are found at Barrow, Folkingham, Ingoldsby, Revesby, and
                    Well. Traces of Roman camps are found at Alkborough, Caistor, Gainsborough,
                    Gedney Hill near Holbeach, Honington near Grantham, South Ormsby, and
                    Yarborough. The Roman roads are nearly perfect,—Ermine Street, on the east side
                    of the Cliff hills, and the Fossway running southwest from Lincoln. The crown of
                    these remains is without doubt the famous Roman arch called the Newport Gate at
                    Lincoln. Tesselated pavements have been found at Denton, Horkstow, Lincoln,
                    Scampton, and Winterton. Coins of the emperors Nero, Vespasian, and Julian have
                    been found at Lincoln and Ancaster, and two Roman altars to the west of
                    Stow.</p>
                <p>There are remains of feudal castles at Boston, Lincoln, Sleaford, Somerton,
                    Tattershall, and Torksey. The seats worthy of note (chiefly modern) are Appleby
                    Hall, Aswarby Hall, Belton House, Blankney Hall, Brocklesby, Bulby House,
                    Burghley House (near Stamford), Burton Hall, Casewick House, Denton Hall, Easton
                    Hall, Hackthorn Hall, Haverholm Priory, Lea Hall, Leadenham House, Manby Hall,
                    Newton House, Nocton Hall, Normanby Hall, Norton Place, Panton Hall, Riby Grove,
                    Somerby Park, Stourton, Syston Park, Thonock House, Thurlby Hall, Uffington, and

                <p>At the time of the suppression of the monasteries in the reign of Henry VIII.
                    there were upwards of one hundred religious houses; and among the Fens rose some
                    of the finest abbeys held by the Benedictines. The Gilbertines were a purely
                    English order which took its rise in Lincolnshire, the canons following the
                    Austin rule, the nuns and lay brothers that of the Cistercians. They generally
                    lived in separate houses, but formed a community having a common church in which
                    the sexes were divided by a longitudinal wall. These houses were at Alvingham,
                    Catley, Holland Brigg, Lincoln, before the gate of which was erected the first
                    Eleanor Cross, Newstead in Lindsey, Semperingham, the chief house of the order,
                    founded by St Gilbert of Gaunt in 1139, Stamford (a college for students), and
                    Welles. There were nunneries of the order at Haverholm, Nun Ormsby, and
                    Tunstal.</p>
                <p>The following are a few of the most famous abbeys. (1) Barlings Oxney
                    (Premonstratensian), founded 1154, for fourteen canons. The tower, Decorated,

                    Part of the west front was repaired in 1255-81, with beautiful Early English
                    sculpture of the legend of St Guthlac and saints; this, with the Perpendicular
                    north-west tower, 1460-70, remain. (3) Swineshead Abbey (Carthusian), colonized

                    Thomton-upon-Humber Abbey (Black Canons), founded in 1139. There remain a
                    fragment of the south wing of the transept, two sides of the decagonal
                    chapterhouse (1282), and the beautiful west gate-house, Early Perpendicular
                    (1382-88), with an oriel window on the east.</p>
                <p>The general beauty of the parish churches of Lincolnshire is proverbial, but it
                    is incorrect to suppose that they are equally good in every part of the county.
                    In the Parts of Lindsey, though there are some of considerable beauty and
                    interest, the churches can scarcely be considered above the average; several
                    though small and mean present curious early features, particularly the
                    well-known tower of St Peter, Barton-on-Humber, supposed to be of the Saxon
                    period, and those of Crowle, Heapham, and Stow. Those of Grimsby and Wainfleet
                    are cruciform.</p>
                <p>In the Parts of Kesteven the churches are not only elegant but well finished,
                    built of excellent stone which abounds at Ancaster and near Sleaford. The church
                    of St Andrew Heckington is the best example of Middle Pointed architecture in
                    the county; it is famed for its Easter sepulchre and fine sedilia. The largest
                    and finest church in this division is doubtless that of St Wolfran at Grantham,
                    200 by 87 feet, with three collateral naves, and steeple, 271 feet high, of the
                    14th century.</p>
                <p>It is principally in the Parts of Holland that we are to look for the finest
                    churches in the county; they are not to be equalled by those of any other
                    district in the kingdom, which is the more remarkable as the district is
                    comprised wholly of marsh land, and is without stone of any kind. It is highly
                    probable that the churches of the south part of this district owe their origin
                    to the munificence of the abbeys of Crowland and Spalding. The earliest specimen
                    of Norman architecture is that of Long Sutton, which has been called the
                    counterpart of Christ Church, Oxford. St Mary and Nicholas at Spalding, 157 feet
                    by 95, has the uncommon feature of a double aisle on each side of the nave, as
                    well as a transept. The glory of the division of Holland is beyond question the
                    church of St Botolph, Boston.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lincoln,</hi> the capital of the county of that name, is a
                    city and county in itself, and is also a municipal and parliamentary borough. It
                    is picturesquely situated on the summit and south slope of the limestone ridge
                    of the Cliff range of hills which rises from the north bank of the river Witham,
                    at its confluence with the Foss Dyke, to an altitude of 200 feet above the banks
                    of the river. It is 132 miles north-west from London by road, and 138 miles by
                    rail; 53° 15' N. lat., 32' W. long.</p>
                <p>Lincoln is one of the most ancient and interesting cities in England. The ancient
                    British town occupied the crown of the hill beyond the Newport or North Gate of
                    the subsequent Roman town, the ancient earthworks and ditches of which are
                    nearly conterminous with the present boundaries of the parish of St John. The
                    Roman town consisted of two parallelograms of unequal length, the first of which
                    extended west from the Newport gate to a point <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n680/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0680-0657"/> a little west of the castle keep. The second
                    parallelogram extended due south from this point down the hill towards the
                    Witham as far as Newland, and thence in a direction due east as far as Broad
                    Street. Returning thence due north, it joined the south-east corner of the first
                    and oldest parallelogram in what was afterwards known as the Minster yard, and
                    terminated its east side upon its junction with the north wall in à line with
                    the Newport gate. This is the oldest part of the town, and is named “above
                    hill.” After the departure of the Romans, the city walls were extended still
                    further in a south direction across the Witham as far as the great bar gate, the
                    south entrance to the High Street of the city; the junction of these walls with
                    the later Roman one was effected immediately behind Broad Street. These three
                    divisions comprise the boundaries of the municipal and parliamentary boroughs,
                    which are conterminous. The “above hill” portion of the city is not well built,
                    but consists of narrow irregular streets, some of which are too steep to admit
                    of being ascended by carriages. The south portion, which is named “below hill,”
                    is much more commodious, and contains the principal shops and inns, with many
                    elegant buildings and private residences. Here also are the Great Northern and
                    Midland Railway stations.</p>
                <p>The glory of Lincoln is its noble minster. As a study to the architect and
                    antiquary this stands unrivalled, not only as the earliest purely Gothic
                    building in Europe, but as containing within its compass every variety of style
                    from the simple massive Norman of the west front, to the Late Decorated of the
                    east portion. The building material is the oolite and calcareous stone of
                    Lincoln Heath and Haydor, which has the peculiarity of becoming hardened on the
                    surface when tooled. In former days the cathedral had three spires, all of wood
                    or leaded timber. The spire on the central tower was blown down in 1547. Those
                    on the two western towers, 101 feet high, were removed in 1808; good
                    representations of them will be found in the well-known views by Hollar and
                    Buck. The ground plan of the first church, adopted from that of Rouen, was laid
                    by Bishop Remigius in 1086, and the church was consecrated four days after his
                    death, May 6, 1092; the central west front and the font are of this period. The
                    approximate dates of the remaining portions of the fabric may be assigned as
                    follows :—the three west portals and the Norman portion of the west towers above
                    the screen to the top of the third story, about 1148; the nave, its aisles, and
                    the north and south chapels of the west end, completed 1220; the Early English
                    portion of the west front, and the upper parts of the north and south wings,
                    with pinnacle turrets, 1225; the west porch of the main transept, 1220; the
                    crossing, and lower part of the central tower, 1235; the upper part, 1307; the
                    west door of the choir aisles, 1240. The south porch of the presbytery dates
                    1256. The east window, the finest of its style in England, 57 by 34 feet, dates
                    1258-88. The choir screens date 1280, the Easter sepulchre 1290. The gables and
                    upper parts of the main transept, the parapets of the south side of the nave,
                    south wing, and west front, and the screen in the south aisle, all date from
                    1225. The upper parts of the west towers date from 1365; their upper stories,
                    the west windows and parapet of the galilee porch, and the chapel screens in the
                    transept, 1450. The vaulted lantern of the central tower is 127 feet above the
                    floor. The main transept has two fine rose windows; the one on the north called
                    the Dean’s Eye is 30 feet in diameter. The Bishop’s Eye to the south is very

                    feet, which contains a little museum. Among the most famous bishops were St
                    Hugh, who died 1200; Grosseteste, died 1253; Flemming, died 1431, founder of
                    Lincoln College, Oxford; Smith, died 1521, founder of Brasenose, Oxford; Wake;
                    and Gibson. Every stall has produced a prelate or cardinal; among those who have
                    been capitular members may be named Walter Mapes, Henry of Huntingdon, Polydore
                    Vergil, W. Grocyn, W. Outram, George Herbert, S. Pegge, W. Paley, Cartwright,
                    inventor of the power-loom, and O. Manning the topographer. Lincoln, the
                    enormous diocese of which in early times extended from the Thames to the Humber,
                    was one of the thirteen cathedrals of the old foundation served by secular
                    canons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The name of Lincoln is a hybrid of Celtic and
                    Latin. It appears in the Ravenna geographer in the form of Lindum Colonia, and
                    in Bede as Lindocolina. Lindum is purely Celtic, and exactly describes the early
                    British settlement as the “hill fort by the pool.” Lindum Colonia was founded on
                    the site of what is now the castle and cathedral, about 100 A.D. It was besieged
                    by Saxons in 518, and became one of the chief cities of Mercia. After being
                    frequently ravaged by the Danes, Lincoln was recovered by Edmund II. in 1016.
                    Lincoln Castle was built by William I. in 1086, which occasioned the removal of
                    one hundred and sixty-six houses. Great and destructive fires occurred in 1110,
                    1123, and 1141. King Stephen besieged the empress Matilda in the castle in 1140.
                    Henry II. was crowned there in the followingyear, as was King Stephen at
                    Christmas 1147; David, king of Scots, did homage to King John, 1201. Lincoln was
                    captured by King John in 1216, and invested by the barons in 1217. The battle of
                    Lincoln Fair took place in 1218. The city was sacked in 1266. John of Gaunt,
                    earl of Lincoln, married there in 1396 Lady Swinford, Chaucer’s sister-in-law;
                    in virtue of his title he held the castle, but built himself a winter house in
                    the lower part of the city. A parliament of Henry VI. met at Lincoln in 1466.
                    The town was stormed by Earl Manchester on behalf of the Parliament in 1644.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.—</hi> One of the most perfect specimens of genuine
                    Roman architecture in England is the Newport or North Gate of Lincoln. It is
                    sunk fully 11 feet below the present level of the street, and has two smaller
                    arches on each side, the one to the west being concealed by an adjoining house.
                    The Roman Ermine Street passes through this gate, and runs north from it for 11
                    or 12 miles as straight as an arrow. Many Roman coins, &amp;c., have been found
                    in the immediate vicinity of the gate. The other gates within the city worthy of
                    notice are the Exchequer Gate, a fine specimen of 13th century work, one of the
                    bosses of the north arch having upon it a carved representation of the
                    crucifixion, Pottergate and Stonebow at the top of High Street, over which is
                    the guildhall. The castle shows traces of Norman work, the foundations of which
                    consisted of massive beams of wood and grouting. The hall of the old episcopal
                    palace is 90 feet by 60 wide, and had two rows of grey marble pillars. The
                    modern palace is at Riseholme, 3 miles north of Lincoln. In the cloister garden
                    are preserved a tesselated pavement and the sepulchral slab of a Roman soldier;
                    the splendidly carved stone coffin lid of Bishop Remigius found there has
                    recently been removed into the cathedral. The ancient conduits of St Mary le
                    Wigford, picturesque Gothic, and ‘ ‘ the Greyfriar’s goodly conduit” in the High
                    Street, may also be noticed. The St Mary’s G ’ uild near St Peters at Gowts is a
                    fine specimen of Norman architecture; another fine relic of the domestic
                    architecture of this period is the Jews’ House, the mouldings of which are
                    identical with those of the west portals of the cathedral (c. 1148). Near this
                    is Dunestall, where the little Lincoln boy afterwards known as Little St Hugh
                    was crucified by Jews in August 1255. There were formerly three small priories,
                    five friaries, and four hospitals in or near Lincoln. The preponderance of
                    friaries over priories of monks is explained by the fact that the cathedral was
                    served by secular canons. The famous Bishop Grosseteste was the devoted patron
                    of the friars, particularly the Franciscans, who were always in their day the
                    town missionaries.</p>
                <p>There were fifty-two churches in the city before the Reformation, all the names
                    of which are preserved. Fourteen remain or have been rebuilt. There are fifteen
                    benefices in the city, consisting of three rectories and twelve vicarages. There
                    are fourteen Nonconformist places of worship.</p>
