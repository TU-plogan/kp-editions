                    share in the obscurity that envelops all antique Roman religion. They belonged
                    to the cultus of the dead, from which so much of Roman and Greek religion was

                    house, and worshipped by the family as their guardians and protectors. But the
                    dead were powerful also to do harm, unless they were duly propitiated with all
                    the proper rites; they were spirits of terror as well as of good; in this
                    fearful sense the names <hi rend="italic">Lemures</hi> and still more <hi
                    rend="italic">Larvae</hi> were appropriated to them. The name Lar has been
                    thought to bean Etruscan word, meaning “lord”; it is a common personal name or
                    title in Etruria. We find certainly, from a very early time, a distinction
                    between <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi rend="italic">privati</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Lares frublici.</hi> The former were worshipped in the house by
                    the family alone, and the <hi rend="italic">Lar</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >familiaris</hi> was conceived as the head of the family and of the family
                    cultus. The <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi rend="italic">publici</hi> belonged
                    to the state religion; and their worship, after having fallen into neglect, was
                    restored by Augustus and to some extent remodelled. It is therefore difficult to
                    distinguish how far the known rites of the cultus are ancient; but it seems
                    certain that the <hi rend="italic">genius</hi> of Augustus, as refounder of the
                    state, was added, and that the original <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">praestites</hi> were two in number. Schwegler and others have
                    maintained that this pair are the twin brothers so frequent in early religions,
                    the Romulus and Remus of the Roman foundation-legend; that the tale of the
                    twinsis in most of its elements derived from the religion of the two Lares; that
                    Acca Larentia, the fostermother of the twins, is the same as Lara, Larunda,
                    Mania, or Muta, the mother of the Lares; and that the Larentalia, celebrated on
                    December 23, was a feast of the Lares. But the two sets of legends must be
                    strictly distinguished: the difference in the quantity of the opening syllable
                    shows that Larentia has no connexion with Larunda and the Lares; the Larentalia
                    was a festival of Jupiter and Acca Larentia, in which the Lares had no place;
                    and Mommsen argues that Remus was a late addition to the foundation legend, in
                    which originally Romulus alone was known. As restored by Augustus, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi rend="italic">praestites</hi> were the guardians of
                    the state and protectors of its unity; and, in lesser circles, every division of
                    the city had likewise its <hi rend="italic">Lares</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >compitales,</hi> now three in number, who had their own aedicula at the cross
                    roads and their special festival, <hi rend="italic">Compitalia.</hi> The temple
                    of the city Lares <hi rend="italic">(sacellum Larum)</hi> was near the top of
                    the Via Sacra.</p>
                <p>The worship of the private Lares, who had their heme either on the hearth of the
                    atrium or in their own little shrine, lararium, persisted throughout the pagan
                    period, but in later time changed its character to a great extent. The emperor
                    Alexander Severus had images of Abraham, Christ, and Alexander the Great among
                    his household Lares. These domestic Lares were worshipped daily, but with
                    special rites on the kalends, nones, and ides of every month; they shared with
                    the family in every festival; when the young bride entered the house for the
                    first time she offered a sacrifice to them; when the boy assumed the toga
                    virilis he dedicated his childish bulla to the Lar familiaris. Marquardt
                    maintains that there was only one Lar in each household, and that the two Lares
                    compitales were the .guardians of the two roads that intersected at the compita.
                    The Lemures as distinguished from the Lares were propitiated at the festival of
                    the Lcmuralia, on the 9th, llth, and 13th of May. In it the dead were
                    propitiated, and the strange unexplained ceremony of throwing the argei into the
                    river was performed. A legend of the birth of the Lares makes them children of
                    the god Mercury and a female figure, Larunda, Lara, or Lala. The fact that the
                    dog was sacred to them, and that a stone figure of a dog stood in the Sacellum
                    Larum, deserves notice in illustration of this legend, for the dog is connected
                    with the Greek god Hermes. Probably this may have arisen under Greek influence.
                    Other classes of Lares mentioned as early as the republican period are the Laves
                    rurales, viales, permarini. · To the last-named Aurelius dedicated a temple in
                    commemoration of the naval victory over Antiochus, 190 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> The generally accepted view is that the Lares are represented as
                    young men, crowned with laurel, dressed in short high-girt tunics, holding horns
                    and cups in their hands; but Marquardt, in accordance with his view that there
                    was only one Lar, considers that these two figures are penates, and on a coin of
                    the gens Caesia the Lares are represented aS two young men with chlamys and <pb

                    remarks that in the cinctus Gabinus the end of the toga was thrown over the
                    head, whereas the Lares always wear only a tunic, and have never veiled heads.
                    The Compitalia was, during the Republican time, &amp;feria conceptiva, set by
                    the praetor at some time soon after the Saturnalia, December 17-19. Under the
                    empire it was fixed for January 3-5.</p>
