                    became a scholar of St John’s, Oxford, and a fellow in 1593. In 1601 he entered

                    president of St John’s. His career at Oxford brought him into collision with the
                    authorities of the university. He was one of those who were revolted by the
                    Calvinistic Puritanism which prevailed, and he upheld in a sharp irritating way
                    the doctrines on the divine right of Episcopacy, and of the permanent existence
                    of the church during the Middle Ages, which was regarded as rank heresy by the
                    Puritans. In 1616 he was appointed to the deanery of Gloucester, and, with the
                    king’s approbation, removed the communion table in the cathedral to the east
                    end. In 1621 James made him bishop of St David’s, though, if a commonly received
                    story is to be believed, he entertained grave doubts whether Laud would exercise
                    the episcopal authority with wisdom. In 1622 the new bishop took part in a
                    controversy with Fisher the Jesuit, on the claims of the Papal Church. His
                    argument, which was afterwards published, was not only a serious contribution to
                    controversial literature, but marks a distinct advance in the direction which
                    was afterwards taken by Chillingworth.</p>
                <p>The controversy with Fisher had been entered on in order to save Buckingham’s
                    mother from conversion to the Church of Rome. It failed in this object, but it
                    gained f &gt;r Laud considerable influence over Buckingham himself, and through
                    Buckingham over Prince Charles, who when he became king in 1625 was attracted to
                    an ecclesiastical adviser whose opinions so closely resembled his own, and whose
                    firmness of character supplied a contrast to the irresoluteness of which he
                    could scarcely be unconscious. During the first years of the reign Laud was
                    frequently consulted in matters relating to the church. He is found favouring
                    the promotion of anti-Puritan divines, approving Montague’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appello</hi><hi rend="italic">Caesarem,</hi> and generally throwing his weight
                    into the scale against the assumption of the House of Commons to lay down the
                    law in politics and religion.</p>
                <p>In 1628 Laud was made bishop of London, and when the ecclesiastical controversy
                    came to a head in the session of 1629, his biography became identified, till the
                    meeting of the Long Parliament, with the history of the Church of England.</p>
                <p>Intellectually Laud’s position was that of a man opposed to the dogmatism of the
                    Calvinists. “The wisdom of the church,” he wrote, “hath been in all ages, or the
                    most, to require consent to articles in general as much as may be, because that
                    is the way of unity, and the church in high points requiring assent to
                    particulars hath been rent.” Laud’s love of peace unhappily led him to shrink
                    from the free exuberance of spiritual life. Perhaps it could hardly be expected,
                    in an age when each ecclesiastical party was longing to persecute all others,
                    that any man placed in authority should think it possible to allow the
                    struggling parties to grow up side by side, in what must have seemed the vain
                    hope that liberty would bring a larger harmony. Laud, at least, had no
                    conception of the kind. He was by nature a lover of order and discipline, devoid
                    of the higher spiritual enthusiasm or breadth of judgment which characterizes
                    the highest order of intellect. He spoke of Aristotle, the philosopher who lays
                    such stress on the formation of habits, as his great master <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">humanis.</hi> All Laud’s work in life was to attempt
                    to form habits, to make men learn to be decent by acting decently, and to be
                    religious by acting religiously. “Since I came to this place,” he said of
                    himself, “I laboured nothing more than that the external public worship of
                    God—too much slighted in most parts of this kingdom—might be preserved, and that
                    with as much decency and uniformity as might be, being still of opinion that
                    unity cannot long continue in the church when uniformity is shut out at the
                    church doors. And I evidently saw that the public neglect of God’s service in
                    the outward face of it, and the nasty lying of many places dedicated to that
                    service, had almost cast a damp upon the true and inward worship of God,—which,
                    while we live in the body, needs external helps, and all little enough to keep
                    it in any vigour.”</p>
                <p>Upon these principles he acted, more especially after his promotion in 1633 to
                    the archbishopric of Canterbury. His metropolitical visitation of the province
                    enforced his system of uniformity in every parish contained in it. He had no
                    sympathy with the special doctrines of the Papal Church, still less with its
                    ceremonial; but he held that conformity to the prayer book was to be the
                    universal rule. He gave great offence to the Puritans by insisting upon the
                    removal of the communion table to the east end of the church, while the
                    communicants were to receive the sacrament on their knees. For this and for the
                    enforcement of other observances he was stigmatized as an innovator, but he
                    repelled the charge in the speech which he delivered at the trial in the Star
                    Chamber of Prynne, Bastwick, and Burton in 1637, declaring that the Puritan
                    usages were themselves innovations on the practice inculcated at the
                    Reformation.</p>
                <p>Nor did Laud confine himself to imposing ceremonies upon the clergy. The church
                    courts undertook in those days to reform the morals of the laity, and Laud
                    excited <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0364-0347"/> much ill-feeling by insisting that the powerful
                    and the wealthy should submit to punishment as well as the poor. As a privy
                    councillor he took part in affairs of state, and upon the death of Portland in
                    1635 he became a commissioner of the treasury till he procured for Bishop Juxon
                    the appointment of lord treasurer in 1637. The advice which he gave to the king
                    with respect to the introduction of a uew prayer book into Scotland proved
                    ultimately fatal to him. Of this prayer book, in the amendment of which he had
                    had a considerable share, he was not unnaturally regarded as the author; and,
                    when in 1640 the Scots triumphantly occupied the northern counties, and sent
                    commissioners to London to negotiate a peace, they called for the punishment of
                    the archbishop as the great incendiary. One of the first acts of the Commons
                    after the meeting of the Long Parliament was to impeach him. For some time he
                    remained in prison, apparently overlooked. But in 1643 there was fresh need of
                    conciliating the Scots, and his impeachment was proceeded with. He made an able
                    and in many respects a satisfactory defence, but his condemnation was a foregone
                    conclusion, and he was executed on January 10, 1644, at the age of
                    seventy-two.</p>
