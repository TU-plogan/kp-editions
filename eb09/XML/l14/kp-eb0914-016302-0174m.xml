                    order against the wishes of his parents. In 1626 he began to study philosophy
                    and theology, and in due time made his profession. From a study of the Bible, of
                    Augustine, Bernard, and the mystics, he was led to hold somewhat extreme views
                    about the efficacy of prayer and the direct influence of the Holy Spirit upon
                    believers, and adopted Augustinian views about grace, free will, and
                    predestination, which brought him into collision with his order. The result was
                    that he resigned and was separated from the Jesuits on the plea of ill health.
                    He then became a preacher to the people, and was encouraged by his bishop to
                    devote himself to this work. The study of Calvin’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes,</hi> however, taught him that he had more in common with the
                    Reformed than with the Roman Catholic Church, and after various adventures he
                    joined the Reformed Church of France at Montauban in 1650. His fame had preceded
                    him, and his accession to the ranks of the Protestants was deemed a great
                    triumph; no such man since Calvin himself, it was said, had left the Roman
                    Catholic Church. He was called to the pastorate of the church at Orange on the
                    Rhone, and at once became noted for the severity of the discipline he exercised.
                    He set his face zealously against dancing, card-playing, and worldly
                    entertainments. The unsettled state of the country, recently annexed to France,
                    compelled him to leave Orange. He accepted a call to the French church in
                    London, but did not stay there long; and after various wanderings he at length
                    settled at Middelburg, where he was called to be pastor to the French-speaking
                    congregation. His peculiar opinions were by this time (1666) well known, and his
                    congregation and himself at once found themselves in conflict with the
                    ecclesiastical authorities. Various “classes” and synods met and discussed the
                    “seditious sermons and new and erroneous doctrine which De la Badie had preached
                    in various of our churches before he had been inducted at Middelburg,” and the
                    result was the establishment of a separate church by De la Badie and his
                    followers. He had gathered round him some enthusiastic disciples, Peter Yvon at
                    Montauban, Peter Dulignon, Francis Menuret, and more important than any Anna
                    Maria v. Schiirman, whose book <hi rend="italic">Eucleιia</hi> is perhaps the
                    best exposition of the tenets of her master. At Middelburg, at the head of his
                    separatist congregation, De la Badie developed his views for a reformation of
                    the Reformed Churches :—the church is a communion of holy people who have been
                    born again from sin; baptism is the sign and seal of this regeneration, and is
                    to be administered only to believers; the Holy Spirit guides the regenerate into
                    all truth, and the church possesses throughout all time those gifts of prophecy
                    which it had in the ancient days; the community at Jerusalem is the continual
                    type of every Christian congregation, therefore there should be a community of
                    goods, the disciples should live together, eat together, dance together;
                    marriage is a holy ordinance between two believers, and the children of the
                    regenerate are born without original sin; marriage with an unregenerate person
                    is not binding. The life and separatism of the community brought them into
                    frequent collision with their neighbours and with the magistrates of Middelburg,
                    and in 1670 they accepted the invitation of the princess Elizabeth, abbess of
                    Herford in Westphalia, to take up their abode within her territories, and
                    settled down in Herford to the number of about fifty. Not finding the rest they
                    expected, however, they migrated to Altona in 1672, where they were dispersed on
                    the death of the leaders. Small communities also existed in the Rhineland, and a
                    missionary settlement was established in New York.</p>
