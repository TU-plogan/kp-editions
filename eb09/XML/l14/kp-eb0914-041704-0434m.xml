                <p><label type="entry">LEIBNITZ, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Leibniz, Gottfried
                    Wilhelm</hi></label> (1646— 1716), almost equally distinguished as philosopher,
                    mathematician, and man of affairs, was born on the 21st June (o.s.) 1646, at
                    Leipsic, where his father was professor of moral philosophy. The name Leibniz,
                    Leibnitz, or Lubeniecz was originally Slavonic, but his family was German, and
                    for three generations his ancestors had been in the employment of the Saxon
                    Government. Young Leibnitz was sent to the Nicolai school at Leipsic, but, from
                    the time of his father’s death, which took place when he was only six years old,
                    seems to have been for the most part his own teacher. From his father he had
                    acquired a love of historical study that bore remarkable fruit in after life.
                    The German books at his command were soon all read through, and with the help of
                    two Latin books which fell in his way—the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus
                    Chronologicus</hi> of Calvisius and an illustrated edition of Livy—he learned
                    Latin for himself at the age of eight. By the advice of a neighbouring gentleman
                    his father’s library was now thrown open to him with the permission “Tolle,
                    lege.” At this his joy knew no bounds. “For,” he says, “I burned to get sight of
                    the ancients, most of them known to me only by name, Cicero and Seneca, Pliny,
                    Herodotus, Xenophon, Plato, and the historical writers, and many church fathers,
                    Latin and Greek.” Thus before he was twelve he could read Latin easily and had
                    begun Greek; and his facility in writing Latin verses made his instructors fear
                    that he would be seduced by poetry from more serious pursuits. Neκt he took with
                    avidity to the study of logic, attempting already to reform its doctrines, and
                    reading the scholastics and some of the Protestant theologians with such zeal
                    that his <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n435/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0435-0418"/> friends now began to fear that he would never
                    leave scholastic subtleties, “not knowing,” as he said, “that my mind could not
                    be satisfied with one kind of things.”</p>
                <p>In the autumn of 1661, at the age of fifteen, he entered the university of
                    Leipsic as a student of law. His first two years were devoted to philosophy
                    under Scherzer, a follower of the scholastics, and Jacob Thomasius, a
                    Neo-Aristotelian, who is looked upon as having founded the scientific study of
                    the history of philosophy in Germany. It was at this time probably that he first
                    made acquaintance with the modern thinkers who had already revolutionized
                    science and philosophy, Francis Bacon, Cardan, and Campanella, Kepler, Galileo,
                    and Descartes; and he began to discuss with himself the difference between the
                    old and new ways of regarding nature. “I remember,” he says, “walking alone, at
                    the age of fifteen, in a wood near Leipsic called the Rosenthal, to deliberate
                    whether I should retain the doctrineof substantial forms. At last mechanism
                    triumphed and induced me to apply myself to mathematics.” It was not, however,
                    till the summer of 1663, which he spent at Jena under Weigel, that he obtained
                    the instructions of a mathematician of repute; nor was the deeper study of
                    mathematics entered upon till his visit to Paris and acquaintance with Huygens
                    many years later.</p>
                <p>The three years following his return from Jena were devoted to legal studies, and
                    in 1666 Leibnitz became a candidate for the degree of doctor of law. The
                    doctorate was a pathway to the post of assessor which he coveted, but through
                    the opposition of older candidates for the same office his youth was made an
                    excuse for refusing him the degree. Upon this he left his native town for ever.
                    The doctor’s degree refused him there was at once (November 5, 1666) conferred
                    on him at Altdorf,—the university town of the free city of Nuremberg,—where his
                    brilliant dissertation procured him the immediate offer of a professor’s chair.
                    This, however, he declined, having, as he said, “very different things in
                    view.”</p>
                <p>Leibnitz, not yet twenty-one years of age, was already the author of several
                    remarkable essays. In his bachelor’s dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">principio individui</hi> (1663), he defended the nominalistic
                    doctrine that individuality is constituted by the whole entity or essence of a
                    thing; his arithmetical tract <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >complexionibus,</hi> published in an extended form under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">De arte combinatoria</hi> (1666), is an essay towards his life
                    long project of a reformed symbolism and method of thought; and besides these
                    there are four juridical essays, including the <hi rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">methodus docendi</hi><hi rend="italic">discendiqιιe juris,</hi>
                    written in the intervals of his journey from Leipsic to Altdorf. This last essay
                    is remarkable, not only for the reconstruction it attempted of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris,</hi> but as containing the first clear recognition
                    of the importance of the historical method in law.</p>
                <p>Rejecting the professorial career, but without any definite plan for the future,
                    Leibnitz turned his steps to Nuremberg. That city was a centre of the
                    Rosicrucians, and Leibnitz, busying himself with writings of the alchemists,
                    soon gained such a knowledge of their tenets that he was supposed to be one of
                    the secret brotherhood, and was even elected their secretary. A more important
                    result of his visit to Nuremberg was his acquaintance with Johann Christian von
                    Boineburg, formerly first minister to the elector of Mainz, and one of the most
                    distinguished statesmen of the day. By his advice Leibnitz printed his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi rend="italic">methodus</hi> in 1667, dedicated it to
                    the elector, and, going to Mainz, presented it to him in person. It was thus
                    that Leibnitz entered the service of the elector of Mainz, at first as an
                    assistant in the revision of the statute-book, afterwards on more important
                    work.</p>
                <p>The policy of the elector, which the pen of Leibnitz was now called upon to
                    promote, was to maintain the security of the German empire, threatened on the
                    west by the aggressive power of France, on the east by Turkey, and Russia. Thus
                    when in 1669 the crown of Poland became vacant, it fell to Leibnitz to support
                    the claims of the German candidate, which he did in his first political writing,
                    <hi rend="italic">Specimen</hi><hi rend="italic">demonstrationum
                    politicarum,</hi> attempting, under the guise of a Catholic Polish nobleman, to
                    show by mathematical demonstration that it was necessary in the interest of
                    Poland that it should have the count palatine of Neuburg as its king. But
                    neither the diplomatic skill of Boineburg, who had been sent as plenipotentiary
                    to the election at Warsaw, nor the arguments of Leibnitz were successful, and a
                    Polish prince was elected to fill the vacant throne.</p>
                <p>A greater danger threatened Germany in the aggressions of Louis XIV. and the wars
                    of conquest on which he was entering. Though Holland was in most immediate
                    danger from his arms, the seizure of Lorraine in 1670 showed that Germany too
                    was threatened. It was in this year that Leibnitz wrote his <hi rend="italic"

                    for the protection of Germany, and contended that the states of Europe should
                    employ their power, not against one another, but in the conquest of the
                    non-Christian world, in which Egypt, “one of the best situated lands in the
                    world,” would fall to the share of France. The plan thus proposed of averting
                    the threatened attack on Germany by a French expedition to Egypt was discussed
                    with Boineburg, and obtained the approval of the elector. French relations with
                    Turkey were at the time so strained as to make a breach imminent, and at the
                    close of 1671, about the . time when the war with Holland broke out, Louis
                    himself was approached by a letter from Boineburg and a short memorial from the
                    pen of Leibnitz, who attempted to show that Holland itself, as a mercantile
                    power trading with the East, might be best attacked through Egypt, while nothing
                    would be easier for France or would more largely increase her power than the
                    conquest of Egypt. On February 12, 1672, a request came from the French
                    secretary of state, Pomponne, that the author of the memorial should further
                    explain himself, and on the 18th of next month Leibnitz started for Paris. Louis
                    seems still to have kept the matter in view, but never granted Leibnitz the
                    personal interview he desired, while Pomponne wrote from the camp before
                    Doesburg, “I have nothing against the plan of a holy war, but such plans, you
                    know, since the days of St Louis, have ceased to be the fashion.” Not yet
                    discouraged, Leibnitz wrote a full account of his project for the king,<note

                    Boineburg died in December 1672, before the latter could be sent to him. Nor did
                    the former ever reach its destination. The French quarrel with the Porte was
                    made up, and the plan of a French expedition to Egypt disappeared from practical
                    politics till Napoleon menaced, the power of England by the same means as those
                    by which Louis had been invited to cripple Holland. The history of this scheme,
                    and the reason of Leibnitz’s journey to Paris, long remained hidden in the
                    archives of the Hanoverian library. It was on his taking possession of Hanover
                    in 1803 that Napoleon learned, through the <hi rend="italic">Consilium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Aegyptiacum,</hi> that the idea of a French conquest of Egypt had
                    been first put forward by a German philosopher. In the same year there was

                <p>But it is only since the appearance of the edition of Leibnitz’s works begun by
                    Onno Klopp in 1864 that the full history of the scheme has been made known.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz had other than political ends in view in his visit to France. It was as
                    the centre of literature and science that Paris chiefly attracted him. Political
                    duties never made him lose sight of his philosophical and scientific interests.
                    At Mainz he was still busied with the question of the relation between the old
                    and new methods in philosophy. In a letter to Jacob Thomasius (1669) he contends
                    that the mechanical explanation of nature by magnitude, figure, and motion alone
                    is not inconsistent with the doctrines of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physics,</hi> in which he finds more truth than in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meditations</hi> of Descartes. Yet these qualities of bodies, he argues in 1668
                    (in an essay published without his knowledge under the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confessio</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae contra atheistas'),</hi> require an
                    incorporeal principle, or God, for their ultimate explanation. He also wrote at
                    this time a defence of the doctrine of the Trinity against Wissowatius (1669),
                    and an essay on philosophic style, introductory to an edition of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Antibarbams</hi> of Nizolius (1670). Clearness and distinctness
                    alone, he says, are what makes a philosophic style, and no language is better
                    suited for this popular exposition than the German. In 1671 he issued a <hi
                    rend="italic">Hypothesis</hi><hi rend="italic">physica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nova,</hi> in which, agreeing with Descartes that corporeal phenomena should be
                    explained from motion, he carried out the mechanical explanation of nature by
                    contending that the original of this motion is a fine aether, similar to light,
                    or rather constituting it, which, penetrating all bodies in the direction of the
                    earth’s axis, produces the phenomena of gravity, elasticity, &amp;c. The first
                    part of the essay, on concrete motion, was dedicated to the Royal Society of
                    London, the second, on abstract motion, to the French Academy.</p>
                <p>Leibnitz thus came to Paris, not merely as a young diplomatist on an important if
                    not very hopeful mission, but also as an author who had already made his début
                    in the world of science and philosophy. At Paris he met with Arnauld,
                    Malebranche, and, more important still, with Christian Huygens. This was
                    pre-eminently the period of his mathematical and physical activity. Before
                    leaving Mainz he was able to announce<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In a letter to the duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (autumn 1671),

                    >sq.</hi></p></note> an imposing list of discoveries, and plans for discoveries,
                    arrived at by means of his new logical art, in natural philosophy, mathematics,
                    mechanics, optics, hydrostatics, pneumatics, and nautical science, not to speak
                    of new ideas in law, theology, and politics. Chief among these discoveries was
                    that of a calculating machine for performing more complicated operations than
                    that of Pascal—multiplying, dividing, and extracting roots, as well as adding
                    and subtracting. This machine was exhibited to the Academy of Paris and to the
                    Royal Society of London, and Leibnitz was elected a fellow of the latter society
                    in April 1673.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>He was
                    made a foreign member of the French Academy in 1700.</p></note> In January of
                    this year he had gone to London as an attaché on a political mission from the
                    elector of Mainz, returning in March to Paris, and while in London had become
                    personally acquainted with Oldenburg, the secretary of the Royal Society, with
                    whom he had already corresponded, with Boyle the chemist, and Pell the
                    mathematician. It is from this period that we must date the impulse that
                    directed him anew to mathematics. By Pell he had been referred to Mercator’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Logamthmotechnica</hi> as already containing some numerical
                    observations which Leibnitz had thought original on his own part; and, on his
                    return to Paris, he devoted himself to the study of higher geometry under
                    Huygens, entering almost at once upon the series of investigations which
                    culminated in his discovery of the differential and integral calculus. For the

                <p>Shortly after his return to Paris in 1673, Leibnitz ceased to be in the Mainz
                    service any more than in name, but in the same year entered the employment of
                    Duke John Frederick of Brunswick-Lüneburg, with whom he had corresponded for
                    some time. In 1676 he removed at the duke’s request to Hanover, travelling
                    thither by way of London and Amsterdam. At the latter place he saw and conversed
                    with Spinoza, now in the last year of his life.</p>
                <p>For the next forty years, and under three successive princes, Leibnitz was in the
                    service of the Brunswick family, and his headquarters were at Hanover, where he
                    had charge of the ducal library. In leaving the electorate of Mainz for the
                    dukedom of Brunswick, Leibnitz passed into a political atmosphere formed by the
                    dynastic aims of the typical German state. The recognition of the rights of the
                    dukedom amongst the states of Europe, the consolidation and permanence of the
                    reigning house, the union of the two branches of the Brunswick family, and
                    lastly, —the aim to which all the others led up—the attainment of the electoral
                    hat, were the ends of its political action. Leibnitz had thus to support by his
                    pen the claim of Hanover to appoint an ambassador at the congress of Nimeguen

                    establishment of primogeniture in the Lüneburg branch of the Brunswick family;
                    and, when the proposal was made to raise the duke of Hanover to the electorate,
                    with the charge of the imperial banner, he had to show that this did not
                    interfere with the rights of the duke of Würtemberg, who was the hereditary
                    custodian of the imperial colours. It was in 1692 that the duke of Hanover was
                    made elector. Before, and with a view to this, Leibnitz had been employed by him
                    to write the history of the Brunswick-Lüneburg family, and, to collect material
                    for his history, had undertaken a journey through Germany and Italy in 1687-90,
                    visiting and examining the records in Marburg, Frankfort-on-theMain, Munich,
                    Vienna (where he remained nine months), Venice, Modena, and Rome. At Rome he was
                    offered the custodianship of t∣ιe Vatican library on condition of his joining
                    the Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>About this time too his thoughts and energies were partly taken up with the
                    scheme for the reunion of the Catholic and Protestant Churches. While at Mainz
                    he had joined in an attempt made by the elector and Boineburg to bring about a
                    reconciliation, and now, chiefly through the energy and skill of the Catholic
                    Royas de Spinola, and from the spirit of moderation which prevailed among the
                    theologians he met with at Hanover in 1683 it almost seemed as if some agreement
                    might be arrived at. It was in these circumstances that, in 1686, Leibnitz wrote
                    his <hi rend="italic">Systema theologicum,</hi><note anchored="true"

                    strove to find common standing-ground for Protestants and Catholics in the
                    details of their creeds. But the English Revolution of 1688, and the
                    establishment of the Protestant succession, became a political obstacle to the
                    prosecution of the scheme in Hanover, while it was soon found that the religious
                    difficulties were greater than had at one time appeared. Spinola’s practical and
                    conciliatory tone did not make full allowance for the ecclesiastical and
                    dogmatical claims of Rome, and the moderation of the Hanover theologians was not
                    fairly representative of the spirit of the Protestant Churches. In the letters
                    to Leibnitz from Boβsuet, the <pb break="no"

                    Brinon, the aim is obviously to make converts to Catholicism, not to arrive at a
                    compromise with Protestantism, and when it was found that Leibnitz refused to be
                    converted the correspondence ceased. A further scheme of church union in which
                    Leibnitz was engaged, that between the Reformed and Lutheran Churches, met with
                    no better success.</p>
                <p>Returning from Italy in 1690, Leibnitz was appointed librarian at Wolfenbüttel by
                    Duke Anton of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Some years afterwards began his connexion
                    with Berlin through his friendship with the electress Sophie Charlotte of
                    Brandenburg and her mother the princess Sophie of Hanover. He was invited to
                    Berlin in 1700, and on the 11th July of that year the academy he had planned was
                    founded, with himself as its president for life. In the same year he was made a
                    privy councillor of justice by the elector of Brandenburg. Four years before he
                    had received a like honour from the elector of Hanover, and twelve years
                    afterwards the same distinction was conferred upon him by Peter the Great, to
                    whom he gave a plan for an academy at St Petersburg, carried out after the
                    czar’s death. At Berlin, in the pleasant suburb of Charlottenburg, Leibnitz read
                    and philosophized with his royal pupil, whose death in 1705 was the greatest
                    loss he ever suffered. After this event his visits to Berlin became less
                    frequent and less welcome, and in 1711 he was there for the last time. In the
                    following year he undertook his fifth and last journey to Vienna, where he
                    stayed till 1714. An attempt to found an academy of science there was defeated
                    by the opposition of the Jesuits, but he now attained the honour he had coveted
                    of an imperial, privy councillorship (1712), and either at this time or on a
                    previous occasion, was made a baron of the empire <hi rend="italic"

                    found the elector George Louis had already gone to assume the crown of England.
                    Leibnitz would gladly have followed him to London, but was bidden remain at
                    Hanover and finish his history of Brunswick.</p>

                    and at whose order the work had been carried out, left it to lie unheeded in the
                    archives of the Hanover library, till it was published by Pertz in 1813.</p>
                <p>It was in the years between 1690 and 1716 that Leibnitz’s chief philosophical
                    works were composed, and during the first ten of these years the accounts of his
                    system were, for the most part, preliminary sketches. Indeed, he never gave a
                    full and systematic account of his doctrines. His views have to be gathered from
                    letters to friends, from occasional articles in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Acta</hi><hi rend="italic">Eruditorum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Journal des
                    Savants,</hi> and other journals, and from one or two more extensive works It is
                    evident, however, that philosophy had not been entirely neglected in the years
                    in which his pen was almost solely occupied with other matters. A letter to the
                    duke of Brunswick, and another to Arnauld, in 1671, show that he had already
                    reached his new notion of substance; and it seems to have been the want of
                    leisure and opportunity alone that prevented the systematic expression of his
                    views. In a letter to Arnauld, of date March 23, 1690, the leading peculiarities
                    of his system are clearly stated. The appearance of Locke’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essay</hi> in 1690 induced him (1696) to note down his objections to it, and
                    his own ideas on the same subjects. In 1703-4 these were worked out in detail
                    and ready for publication, when the death of the author whom they criticized
                    prevented their appearance (first published by Raspe, 1765). In 1710 appeared
                    the only complete and systematic philosophical work of his life-time, <hi

                    request of the late queen of Prussia, who had wished a reply to Bayle’s
                    opposition of faith and reason. In 1714 he wrote, for Prince Eugene of Savoy, a

                    perhaps more occupied with correspondence than any others, and, in a
                    philosophical regard, were chiefly notable for the letters which, through the
                    desire of the new queen of England, he interchanged with Clarke, <hi

                <p>Leibnitz died on the 14th November 1716, his closing years enfeebled by disease,
                    harassed by controversy, embittered by neglect, darkened by the loss of his
                    dearest friend; but to the last he preserved the indomitable energy and power of
                    work to which is largely due the position he holds as, more perhaps than any one
                    in modern times, a man of almost universal attainments and almost universal
                    genius. Neither at Berlin, in the academy which he had founded, nor in London,
                    whither his sovereign had gone to rule, was any notice taken of his death. At
                    Hanover, Eckhart, his secretary, was his only mourner; no courtiers, no
                    clergyman followed him to the grave; not till 1787 was the simple monument that
                    marks the place erected; “he was buried,” says an eye-witness, “more like a
                    robber than what he really was, the ornament of his country.”<note

                <p>Accustomed from his boyhood to a studious life, Leibnitz possessed a wonderful
                    power of rapid and continuous work, and for days together would hardly leave his
                    chair. Even in travelling his time was employed in solving mathematical
                    problems. He is further described as moderate in his desires and habits, quick
                    of temper but easily appeased, charitable in his judgments of others, and
                    tolerant of differences of opinion, though impatient of contradiction on small
                    matters. He is also said to have been fond of money to the point of
                    covetousness; he was certainly desirous of honour, and felt keenly the neglect
                    in which his last years were passed.</p>

                    philosophy ot Leibnitz was only arrived at after many advances and corrections
                    in his opinions. This point is his new doctrine of substance (p. 702<note

                    the references are to Erdmann’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi

                    given to the succession of occasional writings, scattered over fifty years, in
                    which he explained his views. More inclined to agree than to differ with what he
                    read (p. 425), and borrowing from almost every philosophical system, his own
                    standpoint is yet most closely related to that of Descartes, partly as
                    consequence, partly by way of opposition. Cartesianism, Leibnitz often asserted,
                    is the ante-room of truth, but the ante-room only. Descartes’s separation of
                    things into two heterogeneous substances only connected by the omnipotence of
                    God, and the more logical <pb break="no"

                    substance, followed from an erroneous conception of what the true nature of
                    substance is. Substance, the ultimate reality, can only be conceived as force.
                    Hence Leibnitz’s metaphysical view of the monads as simple, percipient,
                    self-active beings, the constituent elements of all things, his physical
                    doctrines of the reality and constancy of force at the same time that space,
                    matter, and motion are merely phenomenal, and his psychological conception of
                    the continuity and development of consciousness. In the closest connexion with
                    the same stand his logical principles of consistency and sufficient reason, and
                    the method lie developed from them, his ethical end of perfection, and his
                    crowning theological conception of the universe as the best possible world, and
                    of God both as its efficient cause and its final harmony.</p>
                <p>The ultimate elements of the universe are, according to Leibnitz, individual
                    centres of force or monads. Why they should be individual, and not
                    manifestations of one world-force, he never clearly proves.<note anchored="true"

                    seems to have been arrived at, not by strict deduction from the nature of force,
                    but rather from the empirical observation that it is by the manifestation of its
                    activity that the separate existence of the individual becomes evident; for his
                    system individuality is as fundamental as activity. “The monads,” he says, “are
                    the very atoms of nature —in a word, the elements of things,” but, as centres of
                    force, they have neither parts, extension, nor figure (p. 705). Hence their
                    distinction from the atoms of Democritus and the materialists. They are
                    metaphysical points or rather spiritual beings whose very nature it is to act.
                    As the bent bow springs back of itself, so the monads naturally pass and are
                    always passing into action without any aid but the absence of opposition (p.
                    122). Nor do they, like the atoms, act upon one another (p. 680); the action of
                    each excludes that of every other. The activity of each is the result of its own
                    past state, the determinator of its own future (pp. 706, 722). “The monads have
                    no windows by which anything may go in or out” (p. 705).</p>
                <p>Further, since all substances are of the nature of force, it follows that—“in
                    imitation of the notion which we have of souls”—they must contain something
                    analogous to feeling and appetite. It is the nature of the monad to represent
                    the many in one, and this is perception, by which external events are mirrored
                    internally (p. 438). Through their own activity the monads mirror the universe
                    (p. 725), but each in its own way and from its own point of view, that is, with
                    a more or less perfect perception (p. 127); for the Cartesians were wrong in
                    ignoring the infinite grades of perception, and identifying it with the reflex
                    cognizance of it which may be called apperception. Every monad is thus a
                    microcosm, the universe in little,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">&lt;/ opera,</hi> ed. Dutens, II. ii.
                    20.</p></note> and according to the degree of its activity is the distinctness
                    of its representation of the universe (p. 709). Thus Leibnitz, borrowing the
                    Aristotelian term, calls the monads <hi rend="italic">cntelcclιies,</hi> because
                    they have a certain perfection (τδ eVτ∈λes) and sufficiency <hi rend="italic"
                    >(abτdpκeιa)</hi> which make them sources of their internal actions and, so to
                    speak, incorporeal automata (p. 706). That the monads are not pure entelechies
                    is shown by the differences amongst them. Excluding all external limitation,
                    they are yet limited by their own nature. All created monads contain a passive
                    element or <hi rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi> (pp. 440,
                    687, 725), in virtue of which their perceptions are more or less confused. As
                    the activity of the monad consists in perception, this is inhibited by the
                    passive principle, so that there arises in the monad an appetite or tendency to
                    overcome the inhibition and become more perceptive, whence follows the change
                    from one perception to another (pp. 706, 714). By the proportion of activity to
                    passivity in it one monad is differentiated from another. The greater the amount
                    of activity or of distinct perceptions the more perfect is the monad; the
                    stronger the element of passivity, the more confused its perceptions, the less
                    perfect is it (p. 709). The soul would be a divinity had it nothing but distinct
                    perceptions (p. 520).</p>
                <p>The monad is never without a perception; but, when it has a number of little
                    perceptions with no means of distinction, a state similar to that of being
                    stunned ensues, the <hi rend="italic">monade nue</hi> being perpetually in this
                    state (p. 707). Between this and the most distinct perception there is room for
                    an infinite diversity of nature among the monads themselves. Thus no one monad
                    is exactly the same as another; for, were it possible that there should be two
                    identical, there would be no sufficient reason why God, who brings them into
                    actual existence, should put one of them at one definite time and place, the
                    other at a different time and place. This is Leibnitz’s principle of the <hi
                    rend="italic">identity of iιuliscernibles</hi> (pp. 277, 755); by it his early
                    problem as to the principle of individuation is solved by the distinction
                    between genus and individual being abolished, and every individual made <hi
                    rend="italic">sui generis.</hi> The principle thus established is formulated in
                    Leibnitz’s law of continuity, founded, he says, on the doctrine of the
                    mathematical infinite, essential to geometry, and of importance in physics (pp.
                    104, 105), in accordance with which there is neither vacuum nor break in nature,
                    but “everything takes place by degrees” (p. 392), the different species of
                    creatures rising by insensible steps from the lowest to the most perfect form
                    (p. 312).</p>
                <p>As in every monad each succeeding state is the consequence of the preceding, and
                    as it is of the nature of every monad to mirror or represent the universe, it
                    follows (p. 774) that the perceptive content of each monad is in “accord” or
                    correspondence with that of every other (c∕. p. 127), though this content is
                    represented with infinitely varying degrees of perfection. This is Leibnitz's
                    famous doctrine of pre-established harmony, in virtue of which the infinitely
                    numerous independent substances of which the world is composed are related to
                    each other and form one universe. It is essential to notice that it proceeds
                    from the very nature of the monads as percipient, self-acting beings, and not
                    from an <hi rend="italic">arbitrary</hi> determination of the Deity.</p>
                <p>From this harmony of self-determining percipient units Leibnitz has to explain
                    the world of nature and mind. As everything that really exists is of the nature
                    of spiritual or metaphysical points (p. 126), it follows that space and matter
                    in the ordinary sense can only have a phenomenal existence (p. 745), being
                    dependent not on the nature of the monads themselves but on the way in which
                    they are perceived. Considering that several things exist at the same time and
                    in a certain order of coexistence, and mistaking this constant relation for
                    something that exists outside of them, the mind forms the confused perception of
                    space (p. 768). But space and time are merely relative, the former an order of
                    coexistences, the latter of successions (pp. 682, 752). Hence not only the
                    secondary qualities of Descartes and Locke, but their so-called primary
                    qualities as well, are merely phenomenal (p. 445). The monads are really without
                    position or distance from each other; but, as we perceive several simple
                    substances, there is for us an aggregate or extended mass. Body is thus active
                    extension (pp. 110, 111). The unity of the aggregate depends entirely on our
                    perceiving the monads composing it together. There is no such thing as an
                    absolute vacuum or empty space, any more than there are indivisible material
                    units or atoms from which all things are built up (pp. 126, 186, 277). Body,
                    corporeal mass, or, as Leibnitz calls it, to distinguish it from the <hi
                    rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima</hi> of which every monad
                    partakes (p. 440), <hi rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">secunda,</hi>
                    is thus only a “phenomenon bene fundatum” (p. 436). It is not a <hi
                    rend="italic">substantia</hi> but <hi rend="italic">substantiae</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">snbftantiatum</hi> (p. 745). While this, however, is the only view
                    consistent with Leibnitz’s fundamental principles, and is often clearly stated
                    by himself, he also speaks at other times of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >materia</hi><hi rend="italic">secunda</hi> as itself a composite substance, and
                    of a real metaphysical bond between soul and body. But these expressions occur
                    chiefly in the letters to Des Bosses, in which Leibnitz is trying to reconcile
                    his views with the doctrines of the Roman Catholic Church, especially with that
                    of the real presence in the Eucharist, and are usually referred to by him as
                    doctrines of faith or as hypothetical (see especially p. 680). The true <hi
                    rend="italic">vinculum</hi><hi rend="italic">substantiale</hi> is not the <hi
                    rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">secunda,</hi> which a consistent
                    development of Leibnitz’s principles can only regard as phenomenal, bnt the <hi
                    rend="italic">materia</hi><hi rend="italic">prima,</hi> through which the monads
                    are individualized and distinguished and their connexion rendered possible. And
                    Leibnitz seems to recognize that the opposite assumption is inconsistent with
                    his cardinal metaphysical view of the monads as the only realities.</p>
                <p>From Leibnitz’s doctrine of force as the ultimate reality it follows that his
                    view of nature must be throughout dynamical. And though his project of a <hi
                    rend="italic">dynamic</hi> or theory of natural philosophy was never carried
                    out, the outlines of his own theory and his criticism of the mechanical physics
                    of Descartes are known to us. The whole distinction between the two lies in the
                    difference between the mechanical and the dynamical views of nature. Descartes
                    started from the reality of extension as constituting the nature of material
                    substance, and found in magnitude, figure, and motion the explanation of the
                    material universe. Leibnitz too admitted the mechanical view of nature as giving
                    the laws of corporeal phenomena (p. 438), applying also to everything that takes
                    place in animal organisms,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The difference between an organic and an inorganic body consists, he says,
                    in this, that the former is a machine even in its smallest parts.</p></note>
                    even the human body (p. 777). But, as phenomenal, these laws must find their
                    explanation in metaphysics, and thus in final causes (p. 155). All things, he
                    says (in his <hi rend="italic">Specimen Dynamicum),</hi> can be explained either
                    by efficient or by final causes. But the latter method is not appropriate to
                    individual occurrences,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi> ed. Dutens, iii. 321.</p></note> though it
                    must be applied when the laws of mechanism themselves need explanation (p. 678).
                    For Descartes’s doctrine of the constancy of the quantity of motion <hi
                    rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> momentum) in the world Leibnitz substitutes the
                    principle of the conservation of <hi rend="italic">vis viva,</hi> and contends
                    that the Cartesian position that motion is measured by velocity should be
                    superseded by the law that moving force <hi rend="italic">(vis motrix) is</hi>
                    measured by the square of the velocity (pp. 192, 193). The long controversy
                    raised by this criticism was really caused by the ambiguity of the terms
                    employed. The principles held by Descartes and Leibnitz were both correct,
                    though different, and their conflict only apparent. Descartes’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n439/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0439-0422"/> principle is now enunciated as the conservation
                    of momentum, that of Leibnitz as the conservation of energy. Leibnitz further
                    criticizes the Cartesian view that the mind can alter the direction of motion
                    though it cannot imitate it, and contends that the quantity of ‘ ‘ <hi
                    rend="italic">vis direction"</hi> estimated between the same parts, is constant
                    (p. 108)— a position developed in his statical theorem for determining
                    geometrically the resultant of any number of forces acting at a point.</p>
                <p>Like the monad, body, which is its analogue, has a passive and an active element.
                    The former is the capacity of resistance, and includes impenetrability and
                    inertia; the latter is active force (pp. 250, 687). Bodies, too, like the
                    monads, are self-contained activities, receiving no impulse from without—it is
                    only by an accommodation to ordinary language that we speak of them as doing
                    so—but moving themselves in harmony with each other (p. 250).</p>
                <p>The psychology of Leibnitz is chiefly developed in the <hi rend="italic">Nouveaux
                    Essais sur</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">entendement
                    humain,</hi> written in answer to Locke’s famous <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi>
                    and criticizing it chapter by chapter. In these essays he worked out a theory of
                    the origin and development of knowledge in harmony with his metaphysical views,
                    and thus without Locke’s implied assumption of the mutual influence of soul and
                    body. When one monad in an aggregate perceives the others so clearly that they
                    are in comparison with it bare monads <hi rend="italic">{monades nues),</hi> it
                    is said to be the ruling monad of the aggregate, not because it actually does
                    exert an influence over the rest, but because, being in close correspondence
                    with them, and yet having so much clearer perception, it seems to do so (p.
                    683). This monad is called the entelechy or soul of the aggregate or body, and
                    as such mirrors the aggregate in the first place and the universe through it (p.
                    710). Each soul or entelechy is surrounded by an infinite number of monads
                    forming its body (p. 714); soul and body together make a living being, and, as
                    their laws are in perfect harmony—a harmony established between the whole realm
                    of final causes and that of efficient causes (p. 714)—we have the same result as
                    if one influenced the other. This is further explained by Leibnitz in his
                    well-known illustration of the différent ways in which two clocks may keep
                    exactly the same time. The machinery of the one may actually move that of the
                    other, or whenever one moves the mechanician may make a similar alteration in
                    the other, or they may have been so perfectly constructed at first as to
                    continue to correspond at every instant without any further influence (pp. 133,
                    134). The first way represents the common (Locke’s) theory of mutual influence,
                    the second the method of the occasionalists, the third that of pre-established
                    harmony. Thus the body does not act on the soul in the production of cognition,
                    nor the soul on the body in the production of motion. The body acts just as if
                    it had no soul, the soul as if it had no body (p. 711). Instead, therefore, of
                    all knowledge coining tous directly or indirectly through the bodily senses, it
                    is all developed by the soul’s own activity, and sensuous perception is itself
                    but a confused kind of cognition. Not a certain select class of our ideas only
                    (as Descartes held), but all our ideas, are innate, though only worked up into
                    actual cognition in the development of knowledge (p. 212). To the aphorism made
                    use of by Locke, “Nihil est in intellectu quod non prius fuerit in sensu,” must
                    be added the clause, “nisi intellectus ipse” (p. 223). The soul at birth is not
                    comparable to a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa,</hi> but rather to an unworked
                    block of marble, the hidden veins of which already determine the form it is to
                    assume in the hands of the sculptor (p. 196). Nor, again, can the soul ever be
                    without perception; for it has no other nature than that of a percipient active
                    being (p. 246). Apparently dreamless sleep is to be accounted for by unconscious
                    perception (p. 223); and it is by such insensible perceptions that Leibnitz
                    explains his doctrine of pre-established harmony (p. 197).</p>
                <p>In the human soul perception is developed into thought, and there is thus an
                    infinite though gradual difference between it and the mere monad (p. 464). As
                    all knowledge is implicit in the soul, it follows that its perfection depends on
                    the efficiency of the instrument by which it is developed. Hence the importance,
                    in Leibnitz’s system, of the logical principles and method the consideration of
                    which occupied him at intervals throughout his whole career.</p>
                <p>There are two kinds of truths—(1) truths of reasoning, and (2) truths of fact
                    (pp. 83, 99, 707). The former rest on the principle of identity (or
                    contradiction) or of possibility, in virtue of which that is false which
                    contains a contradiction, and that true which is contradictory to the false. The
                    latter rest on the principle of sufficient reason or of reality <hi
                    rend="italic">(compossibilité),</hi> according to which no fact is true unless
                    there be a sufficient reason why it should be so and not otherwise (agreeing
                    thus with the <hi rend="italic">principium melioris</hi> or final cause). God
                    alone, the purely active monad, has an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> knowledge
                    of the latter class of truths; they have their source in the human mind only in
                    so far as it mirrors the outer world, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, in its
                    passivity, whereas the truths of reason have their source in our mind in itself
                    or in its activity.</p>
                <p>Both kinds of truths fall into two classes, primitive and derivative. The
                    primitive truths of fact are, as Descartes held, those of internal experience,
                    and the derivative truths are inferred from them in accordance with the
                    principle of sufficient reason, by their agreement with our perception of the
                    world as a whole. They are thus reached by probable arguments—a department of
                    logic which Leib-nitzwasthefirst to bring into prominence (pp. 84,164, 168,169,
                    343). The primitive truths of reasoning are identical (in later terminology,
                    analytical) propositions, the derivative truths being deduced from them by the
                    principle of contradiction. The part of his logic on which Leibnitz laid the
                    greatest stress was the separation of these rational cognitions into their
                    simplest elements—for he held that the root-notions <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cogitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">primae)</hi> would be found to be few in
                    number (pp. 92, 93)—and the designation of them by universal characters or

                    so as to reduce the syllogism to a calculus. This is the main idea of Leibnitz’s
                    “universal characteristic,’’never fully worked out by him, which he regarded as
                    one of the greatest discoveries of the age. An incidental result of its adoption
                    would be the introduction of a universal symbolism of thought comparable to the
                    symbolism of mathematics and intelligible in all languages <hi rend="italic"
                    >{cf.</hi> p. 356). But the great revolution it would effect would chiefly
                    consist in this, that truth and falsehood would be no longer matters of opinion
                    but of correctness or error in calculation<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The places at which Leibnitz anticipated the modern theory

                    Aristotelian analytic is not to be superseded; but it is to be supplemented by
                    this new method, for of itself it is but the ABC of logic.</p>
                <p>But the logic of Leibnitz is an art of discovery (p. 85) as well as of proof,
                    and, as such, applies both to the sphere of reasoning and to that of fact. In
                    the former it has by attention to render explicit what is otherwise only
                    implicit, and by the intellect to introduce order into the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> truths of reason, so that one may follow from another and they may

                    >intellectuel.</hi> To this art of orderly combination Leibnitz attached the
                    greatest importance, and to it one of his earliest writings was devoted.
                    Similarly, in the sphere of experience, it is the business of the art of
                    discovery to find out and classify the primitive facts or data, referring every
                    other fact to them as its sufficient reason, so that new truths of experience
                    may be brought to light.</p>
                <p>As the perception of the monad when clarified becomes thought, so the appetite of
                    which all monads partake is raised to will, their spontaneity to freedom, in man
                    (p. 669). The will is an effort or tendency to that which one finds good (p.
                    251), and is free only in the sense of being exempt from external control<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence the difference of his
                    determinism from that of Spinoza, though Leibnitz too says in one place that “it
                    is difficult enough to distinguish the actions of God from those of the
                    creatures” <hi rend="italic">(Werke,</hi> cd. Pertz, 2d ser., ι.
                    160).</p></note> (pp. 262, 513, 521 ), for it must always have a sufficient
                    reason for its action determined by what seems good to it. The end determining
                    the will is pleasure (p. 269), and pleasure is the sense of an increase of
                    perfection (p. 670). A will guided by reason will sacrifice transitory and
                    pursue constant pleasures or happiness, and in this weighing of pleasures
                    consists true wisdom. Leibnitz, like Spinoza, says that freedom consists in
                    following reason, servitude in following the passions (p. 669), and that the
                    passions proceed from confused perceptions (pp. 188, 269). In love one finds joy
                    in the happiness of another; and from love follow justice and law. “Our reason,”
                    says Leibnitz,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    belongs to every monad—comes from God having provided that the changes of matter
                    will not make man lose his individuality (pp. 126, 466).</p>
                <p>Leibnitz thus makes the existence of God a postulate of morality as well as
                    necessary for the realization of the monads. It is in the <hi rend="italic"

                    the best possible world defended. In it he contends that faithand reason are
                    essentially harmonious (pp. 402, 479), and that nothing can be received as an
                    article of faith which contradicts an eternal truth, though the ordinary
                    physical order may be superseded by a higher.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The ordinary arguments for the being of God are retained by Leibnitz in a
                    modified form (p. 375). Descartes’s ontological proof is supplemented by the
                    clause that God as the <hi rend="italic">ens a sc</hi> must either exist or be
                    impossible (pp. 80, 177, 708); in the cosmological proof he passes from the
                    infinite series of finite causes to their sufficient reason which contains all
                    changes in the series necessarily in itself (pp. 147, 708); and he argues
                    teleologically from the existence of harmony among the monads without any mutual
                    influence to God as the author of this harmony (p. 430).</p>

                <p>In these proofs Leibnitz seems to have in view an extramun&lt;lane power to whom
                    the monads owe their reality, though such a conception evidently breaks the
                    continuity and harmony of his system, and can only be externally connected with

                    “universal harmony”; and the historians Erdmann and Zeller are of opinion that
                    this is the only sense in which his system can be consistently theistic. Yet it
                    would seem that to assume a purely active and therefore perfect monad as the
                    source of all things is in accordance with the principle of continuity and with
                    Leibnitz’s conception of the gradation of existences. In this sense he sometimes
                    speaks of God as the first or highest of the monad (p. 678), and of created
                    substances proceeding from Him continually by “fulgurations” (p. 708) or by “a
                    sort of emanation as we produce our thoughts.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>The positive properties or perfections of the monads, Leibnitz holds, exist <hi

                    that attaches to created monads (p. 716), in God—their perception as His wisdom
                    or intellect, and their appetite as His absolute will or goodness (p. 654);
                    while the absence of all limitation is the divine independence or power, which
                    again consists in this, that the possibility of things depends on His intellect,
                    their reality on His will (p. 506). The universe in its harmonious order is thus
                    the realization of the divine end, and as such must be the best possible (p.
                    506). The teleology of Leibnitz becomes necessarily a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Théodicée.</hi> God created a world to manifest and communicate His perfection
                    (p. 524), and, in choosing this world out of the infinite number that exist in
                    the region of ideas (p. 515), was guided by the <hi rend="italic">principium
                    melioris</hi> (p. 506). With this thoroughgoing optimism Leibnitz has to
                    reconcile the existence of evil in the best of all possible worlds.<note

                    655) between (1) metaphysical evil or imperfection, which is unconditionally
                    willed by God as essential to created beings; (2) physical evil, such as pain,
                    which is conditionally willed by God as punishment or as a means to greater good
                    (c∕. p. 510); and (3) moral evil, in which the great difficulty lies, and which
                    Leibnitz makes various attempts to explain. He says that it was merely permitted
                    not willed by God (p. 655), and, that being obviously no explanation, adds that
                    it was permitted because it was foreseen that the world with evil would
                    nevertheless be better than any other possible world (p. 350). He also speaks of
                    the evil as a mere set-off to the good in the world, which it increases by
                    contrast (p. 149), and at other times reduces moral to metaphysical evil by
                    giving it a merely negative existence, or says that their evil actions are to be
                    referred to men alone, while it is only the power of action that comes from God,
                    and the power of action is good (p. 658).</p>
                <p>The great problem of Leibnitz’s <hi rend="italic">Théodicée</hi> thus remains
                    unsolved. The suggestion that evil consists in a mere imperfection, like his
                    idea of the monads proceeding from God by a continual emanation, was too bold
                    and too inconsistent with his immediate apologetic aim to be carried out by him.
                    Had he done so his theory would have transcended the independence of the monads
                    with which it started, and found a deeper unity in the world than that resulting
                    from the somewhat arbitrary assertion that the monads reflect the universe.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of Leibnitz, in the more systematic and abstract form it received
                    at the hands of Wolf, ruled the schools of Germany for nearly a century, and
                    largely determined the character of the critical philosophy by which it was
                    superseded. On it Baumgarten laid the foundations of a science of aesthetic. Its
                    treatment of theological questions heralded the German <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aufklärung.</hi> And on many special points—in its physical doctrine of the
                    conservation of force, its psychological hypothesis of unconscious perception,
                    its attempt at a logical symbolism—it has suggested ideas fruitful for the
