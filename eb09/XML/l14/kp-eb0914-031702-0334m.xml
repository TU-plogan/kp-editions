                    took the Protestant side for a time in the quarrels of the 16th century, but was
                    faithful to Henry IV. in religion as in politics. La Rochefoucauld’s father was
                    a favourite of Louis XIII., and was created by him duke and peer in 1622, the
                    possessions of the family in Angoumois and the neighbouring provinces being very
                    considerable. The author of the <hi rend="italic">Maxims,</hi> who during the
                    lifetime of his father and his own most stirring years bore the title of Prince
                    de Marcillac, was somewhat neglected in the matter of education, at least of the
                    scholastic kind; but he joined the army before he was sixteen, and almost
                    immediately began to make a figure in public life. He had been nominally married
                    a year before to Andrée de Vivonne, of whom little enough is known to satisfy
                    even a Greek. She seems to have been an affectionate wife, and not a breath of
                    scandal touches her,—two points in which La Rochefoucauld was perhaps more
                    fortunate than he deserved. For some years Marcillac continued to take part in
                    the annual campaigns, where he displayed the utmost bravery, though he never
                    obtained credit for much military skill. Then he fell under the influence of
                    Madame de Chevreuse, the first of three celebrated women who successively
                    influenced his life. Through Madame de Chevreuse he became attached to the queen
                    Anne of Austria, and in one of her quarrels with Richelieu and her husband a
                    wild scheme seems to have been actually formed, according to which Marcillac was
                    to carry her off to Brussels on a pillion. These caballings against Richelieu,
                    however, had no more serious results than occasional exiles, that is to say,
                    orders to retire to his father’s estates. After the death of the great minister
                    (1642), opportunity seemed to be favourable to the vague ambition which then
                    animated half the nobility of France. Marcillac became one of the so-called <hi
                    rend="italic">importants,</hi> and took an active part in reconciling the queen
                    and Condé in a league against Gaston of Orleans. But the growing credit of
                    Mazarin came in his way, and the <hi rend="italic">liaison</hi> in which about
                    this time (1645) he became entangled with the beautiful duchess of Longueville
                    made him irrevocably a Frondeur. He was a conspicuous figure in the siege of
                    Paris, fought desperately in the desultory engagements which were constantly
                    taking place, and was severely wounded. In the second Fronde Marcillac followed
                    the fortunes of Condé, and the death of his father, which happened at the time
                    (1650), gave rise to a characteristic incident. The nobility of the province
                    gathered to the funeral, and the new duke de la Rochefoucauld took the
                    opportunity of persuading them to follow him in an attempt on the royalist
                    garrison of Saumur, which, however, was not successful. We have no space to
                    follow La Rochefoucauld through the tortuous cabals and negotiations of the
                    later Fronde; it is sufficient to say that he was always brave and generally
                    unlucky. His run of bad fortune reached its climax in the battle of the Faubourg
                    Saint Antoine (1652), where he was shot through the head, and it was thought
                    that he would lose the sight of both eyes. It was nearly a year before he
                    recovered, and then he found himself at his country seat of Verteuil, with no
                    result of twenty years fighting and intriguing except impaired health, a
                    seriously embarrassed fortune, and some cause for bearing a grudge against
                    almost every party and man of importance in the state. He spent some years in
                    this retirement, and he was fortunate enough (thanks chiefly to the fidelity of
                    Gourville, who had been in his service, and, passing into the service of Mazarin
                    and of Condé, had acquired both wealth and influence) to be able to repair in
                    some measure the breaches in his fortune. He did not, however, return to court
                    life much before Mazarin’s death. Louis XIV. was then in the full adolescence of
                    his absolute power, and the turbulent aristocratic anarchy of the Fronde was a
                    thing utterly of the past.</p>
                <p>Somewhat earlier, La Rochefoucauld had taken his place in the salon of Madame de
                    Sablé, a member of the old Rambouillet coterie, and the founder of a kind of
                    successor to it. It was known that La Rochefoucauld, like almost all his more
                    prominent contemporaries, had spent his solitude in writing memoirs, while the
                    special literary employment of the Sablé salon was the fabrication of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sentences</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Maximes.</hi> In 1662,
                    however, more trouble than reputation, and not a little of both, was given to
                    him by a surreptitious publication of his memoirs, or what purported to be his
                    memoirs, by the Elzevirs. Many of his old friends were deeply wounded, and he
                    hastened to deny flatly the authenticity of the publication, a denial which (as
                    it seems, λvithout any reason) was not very generally accepted. Three years
                    later (1665) he published, though without his name, the still more famous <hi
                    rend="italic">Maxims,</hi> which at once established him high among the men of
                    letters of the time. About the same date began the friendship with Madame de la
                    Fayette, which lasted till the end of his life. The glimpses which we have of
                    him henceforward are chiefly derived from the letters of Madame de Sévigné, and,
                    though they show him suffering agonies from gout, are on the whole pleasant. He
                    had a circle of devoted friends; he was recognized as a moralist and man of
                    letters of the first rank; he might have entered the Academy for the asking; and
                    in the altered measure of the times his son the Prince de Marcillac, to whom
                    some time before his death he resigned his titles and honours, enjoyed a
                    considerable position at court. Above all, La Rochefoucauld was generally
                    recognized by his contemporaries from the king downward as a type of the older
                    noblesse as it was before the sun of the great monarch dimmed its brilliant
                    qualities. This position he has retained until the present day. He died at Paris
                    on the 17th of March 1680, of the disease which had so long tormented him.</p>
                <p>La Rochefoucauld’s character, if considered without the prejudice which a dislike
                    to his ethical views has sometimes occasioned, is thoroughly respectable and
                    even amiable. Like almost all his contemporaries, he saw in politics little more
                    than a chessboard where the people at large were but pawns, and the glory and
                    profit were reserved to the nobility. The weight of testimony, however, inclines
                    to the conclusion that he was unusually scrupulous in his conduct, and that bis
                    comparative ill success in the struggle arose more from this scrupulousness than
                    from anything else. He has been charged with irresolution, and there is some
                    ground for admitting the charge so far as to pronounce him one of those the
                    keenness of whose intellect, together with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n335/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0335-0318"/> their apprehension of both sides of a question,
                    interferes with their capacity as men of action. But there is no ground whatever
                    for the view which represents the <hi rend="italic">Maxims</hi> as the mere
                    outcome of the spite of a disappointed intriguer, disappointed through his own
                    want of skill rather than of fortune.</p>
                <p>Interesting, however, as he is when considered as a man and as a typical figure
                    of a brilliant and historically important class, his importance as a social and
                    historical figure is far inferior to his importance as a man of letters. His
                    work in this respect consists of three parts—letters, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Maxims.</hi> The letters collected by
                    the diligence of his latest editor exceed one hundred in number, and are
                    biographically valuable, besides displaying not a few of his literary
                    characteristics; but they need not further detain us. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoirs,</hi> when they are read in their proper form, yield in literary merit,
                    in interest, and in value to no memoirs of the time, not even to those of Retz,
                    between whom and La Rochefoucauld there was a strange mixture of enmity and
                    esteem which resulted in a couple of most characteristic portraits. But their
                    history is unique in its strangeness. It has been said that a pirated edition
                    appeared in Holland, and this despite the author’s protest continued to be
                    reprinted for some thirty years. It has been now proved beyond doubt or question
                    to be a mere cento of the work of half a dozen different men, scarcely a third
                    of which is La Rochefoucauld’s, and which could only have been possible at a
                    time when it was the habit of persons who frequented literary society to copy
                    pell-mell in commonplace books the MS. compositions of their friends and others.
                    Some years after La Rochefoucauld’s tleath a new recension appeared, somewhat
                    less incorrect than the former, but still largely adulterated, and this held its
                    ground for more than a century. Only in 1817 did anything like a genuine edition
                    (even then by no means perfect) appear. The <hi rend="italic">Maxims,</hi>
                    however, had no such fate. The author re-edited them frequently during his life,
                    with alterations and additions; a few were added after Ids death, and it is
                    usual now to print the whole of them, at whatever time they appeared, together.
                    Thus taken, they amount to about seven hundred in number, in hardly any case
                    exceeding half a page in length, and more frequently confined to two or three
                    lines. The view of conduct which they illustrate is usually and not quite
                    incorrectly summed up in the words “everything is reducible to the motive of
                    self-interest.” Though not absolutely incorrect, the phrase is misleading. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Maxims</hi> are in no respect mere deductions from or
                    applications of any such general theory. They are on the contrary independent
                    judgments on different relations of life, different affections of the human
                    mind, and so forth, from which, taken together, the general view may be deduced
                    or rather composed. Sentimental moralists have loudly protested against this
                    view, yet it is easier to declaim against it in general than to find a flaw in
                    the several parts of which it is made up. With a few exceptions La
                    Rochefoucauld’s maxims represent the matured result of the reflexion of a man
                    deeply versed in the business and pleasures of the world, and possessed of an
                    extraordinarily fine and acute intellect, on the conduct and motives which have
                    guided himself and his fellows. There is as little trace in them of personal
                    spite as of <hi rend="italic">forfanterie</hi><hi rend="italic">de vice.</hi>
                    But the astonishing excellence of the literary medium in which they are conveyed
                    is even more remarkable than the general soundness of their ethical import. In
                    uniting the four qualities of brevity, clearness, fulness of meaning, and point
                    La Rochefoucauld has no rival. His <hi rend="italic">Maxims</hi> are never mere
                    epigrams; they are never platitudes; they are never dark sayings. He has packed
                    them so full of meaning that it would be impossible to pack them closer, yet
                    there is no undue compression; he has sharpened their point to the utmost, yet
                    there is no loss of substance. The comparison which occurs most frequently, and
                    which is perhaps on the whole the justest, is that of a bronze medallion, and it
                    applies to the matter no less than to the form. Nothing is left unfinished, yet
                    none of the workmanship is finical. The sentiment, far from being merely hard as
                    the sentimentalists pretend, has a vein of melancholy poetry running through it
                    which calls to mind the traditions of La Rochefoucauld’s devotion to the
                    romances of chivalry. The maxims are never shallow; each is the text for a whole
                    sermon of application and corollaries which any one of thought and experience
                    can write. Add to all this that the language in which they are written is
                    French, still at almost its greatest strength, and chastened but as yet not
                    emasculated by the reforming influence of the 17th century, and it is not
                    necessary to say more. To the literary critic no less than to the man of the
                    world La Rochefoucauld ranks among the scanty number of pocket-books to be read
                    and re-read with ever new admiration, instruction, and delight.</p>
                <p>The editions of La Rochefoucauld’s Maxims published in his lifetime<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The full original title was
                    Reflexions ou Sentences et Maximes Morales.</p></note> bear the dates 1665
                    {editiο princeps), 1666, 1671, 1675, 1678. An important edition which appeared
                    after his death in 1693 may rank almost with these. As long as the Memoirs
                    remained in the state above described no edition of them need be mentioned, and
                    none of the complete works was possible. There have been several editions more
                    or less complete in the last seventy years, but they are all thrown into the
                    shade by that of MM. Gilbert and Gourdault, 1868-81, in the series of Grands
                    Écrivains de la France, 3 vols. This is complete as to the text, but a glossary
                    and some other additional matters have yet to appear. The handsomest separate
                    edition of the Maxims is the so-called Édition des Bibliophiles, 1870; but cheap
                    and handy issues are plentiful. (G. SA.)</p>
