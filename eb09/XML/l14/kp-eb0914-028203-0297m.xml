                    of learning for its own sake, which induced him to visit other schools; on his
                    return, after a long absence, he became teacher of jurisprudence in his native
                    town. About 1039, driven from home by the disturbances then prevalent in Italy,
                    and attracted by what he had heard of the need and demand for a supply of
                    competent scholars in Normandy, he with some learned companions migrated thither
                    and set up a school at Avranches, which met with great success. Some three years
                    afterwards (1042), having formed the resolution to become a monk, he suddenly
                    withdrew from his promising career as a secular teacher. The causes which led to
                    this change in the plan of his life are not known. Hook thinks it was suggested
                    by the death of his wife, which <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0298-0283"/> there is some reason to believe happened about
                    this time; but, however it may have been occasioned, the fact that a man of his
                    energy and strength of will should, although somewhat late in life, have
                    transferred himself to a career which not only was universally supposed to
                    involve great spiritual advantages, but must also have been seen to offer a
                    peculiarly favourable field for the exercise of his special talents and
                    acquirements, need cause no surprise. After a lengthened novitiate of ascetic
                    humiliation and seclusion in the Benedictine monastery of Bec, then under the
                    presidency of abbot Herluin, Lanfrane was at last called upon to resume the work
                    of teaching; his fame speedily attracted numerous pupils, and it became
                    necessary to enlarge the conventual buildings. He now became prior, with full
                    control of the internal discipline of the establishment (1046). Among those who
                    became his pupils about this time are mentioned Witmund (afterwards bishop of
                    Aversa), Anselm of Aosta (afterwards of Canterbury), and Anselm of Lucca
                    (afterwards Pope Alexander II.). It was during his priorship at Bec that
                    Lanfrane began to figure somewhat prominently in the eucharistie controversy
                    associated with the name of Berengarius of Tours. This able but unfortunate
                    controversialist, while maintaining the doctrine of a real presence of Christ in
                    the Eucharist, had denied that presence to be one of essence, or the change
                    effected to be one of substance. In doing so he had placed himself in an
                    attitude of opposition not so much to the lately formulated theory of Paschasius
                    Radbertus as to the entire current of ecclesiastical opinion then prevalent. The
                    earliest extant letter of Berengarius to Lanfrane implies a previous friendship,
                    but is written in a tone of remonstrance, beseeching the latter not to treat as
                    heretics those who had Scripture on their side and could also claim the support
                    of Ambrose, Augustine, and Jerome. It is to be regretted that we are not in
                    possession of more of the correspondence, and especially that we are left
                    entirely to conjecture with regard to the circumstances which occasioned it. It
                    seems to have been somewhat compromising to Lan franc, for at the Easter synod
                    held at Rome in 1050, which he had been summoned to attend, the prior of Bec
                    was, after the condemnation of the absent Berengarius, called upon to vindicate
                    his own orthodoxy by a public confession of his faith. He had no difficulty,
                    however, in thus purging himself of all suspicion of heretical pravity, and was
                    afterwards present in September, by special request, at the synod of Vercelli,
                    where Berengarius, again absent, was excommunicated. A personal controversy was
                    renewed by Berengarius from time to time, but, so far as we know, Lanfranc’s
                    share in it came to an end with the composition (probably some time between 1063
                    and 1069) of his <hi rend="italic">Liber de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Corpore</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Sanguine Domini</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nostri</hi><hi rend="italic">contra Berengarium.</hi> Other events
                    of much more exciting and absorbing personal interest to him had meanwhile
                    intervened. In 1053 William of Normandy, in spite of the express prohibition of
                    the council of Rheims (1049), had married his cousin Matilda, daughter of
                    Baldwin, duke of Flanders,—a defiance of ecclesiastical authority which involved
                    the highest ecclesiastical censures. The now powerful prior of Bec was not slow
                    to express his condemnation, which he further accentuated by his contemptuous
                    treatment of Herfast, the duke’s chaplain, who had been sent on some errand of
                    conciliation. Peremptorily ordered to leave the duchy, Lanfrane, when setting
                    out on his journey into exile on an excessively lame horse, whether by accident
                    or design came across the path of William; some genial touch of humanity and
                    good humour suddenly converted them (such is the import of the Chronicles) into
                    firm friends; the prior accompanied the duke to his castle, and shortly
                    afterwards undertook a mission to Rome for a papal dispensation which should
                    legalize the obnoxious marriage. This was obtained in 1059; Lanfranc’s influence
                    with William and Matilda steadily increased, and soon the abbeys of St Stephen
                    and of the Holy Trinity at Caen— part of the price of the papal grace—began to
                    rise. In 106'2 the former building was sufficiently far advanced to be fit for
                    use, and, at the urgent request of the founder, Lanfrane became its first abbot.
                    In this position he was one of the most intimate advisers of William during the
                    anxious times which immediately preceded and followed the Conquest. Already
                    destined for the more splendid if more arduous see of Canterbury, he, doubtless
                    with the royal approval, declined that of Rouen, which had been put within his
                    reach in 1067. In 1070 he was, at the Whitsungemot held at Windsor, chosen to
                    the primacy of England, vacant by the deposition of Stigand; and, at a synod in
                    Normandy where the legates of the pope were present, he was constrained to
                    accept, vainly pleading “his weakness and unworthiness, his ignorance of a
                    foreign tongue, and the barbarism of the nations he was thus compelled to
                    visit.” His consecration took place on Augus <hi rend="superscript"> k</hi> 29,
                    1070, in a temporary structure raised on the site of the cathedral which had
                    been destroyed by fire three years before; and in the following year he went to
                    Rome to receive the pallium from his former pupil Alexander II. The pope
                    received him with great cordiality, giving him a second pallium for old
                    friendship’s sake; but he did not thereby succeed in attaching the new
                    archbishop to the ultramontane policy; during the nineteen years of the primacy
                    of the brilliant Lombard it became ever more apparent that neither Hildebrand’s,
                    nor Lanfranc’s, but William’s was the master mind in England. Lanfranc ably
                    seconded the Conqueror in the line of action which resulted in the subordination
                    of York to Canterbury, and also in the gradual removal from power of all English
                    prelates and abbots, and their replacement by foreigners, until at last Wolfstan
                    of Worcester was the only Anglo-Saxon left undisturbed; but, if these measures
                    were fitted in some ways to denationalize the English Church, and bring it into
                    closer relation with the central authority at Rome, any such tendency was more
                    than counterbalanced by the legislation, also supported by Lanfranc, which
                    placed the royal supremacy on a footing which it had never before attained. Thus
                    it was enacted that bishops, like barons, were to pay homage to the crown, and
                    the clergy were to acknowledge no one as pope until the royal consent had first
                    been obtained; that no letters from Rome were to be published till approved by
                    the king; that no council was to pass laws or canons except such as should be
                    agreeable to the king’s pleasure; that no bishop was to implead or punish any of
                    the king’s vassals without the king’s precept; and that no ecclesiastic was to
                    leave the country without leave obtained. As regarded church discipline the
                    Hildebrandine reforms were followed, but with wisdom and moderation; thus strict
                    regulations against simony were enforced, but with respect to clerical celibacy
                    a distinction was drawn between the parochial and the capitular clergy, the
                    former being permitted to retain their wives. A striking illustration of the
                    recognized ecclesiastical independence of England under William and his able
                    minister is furnished in the fact that, in the very year (1076) of the synod of
                    Winchester at which so important a modification of the decrees of a Roman
                    council had been resolved on, Lanfranc along with Thomas of York and Remigius of
                    Dorchester presented themselves at the holy see in a mission from the king to
                    seek a confirmation of certain ancient privileges, and that they were successful
                    in their application. No less eloquent is the fact that, after William’s
                    rejection of Gregory’s demand for his homage, Lanfranc had the courage to refuse
                    the papal summons to appear at the threshold of the apostles. After his return
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n299/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0299-0284"/> from Rome in 107C and the consecration of the new
                    buildings at Bee in which he took part in 1077, he does not appear to have again
                    left England. As regards his administration of his own diocese, Lanfranc’s
                    principal achievements were the rapid rebuilding of the metropolitan church
                    (1072-79), the reforms he introduced among the monks of Christ Church, and his
                    successful recovery of the estates of the see, which had been encroached on by
                    the king’s brother bishop Odo, earl of Kent. Lanfranc died at Canterbury in May
                    1089.</p>
                <p>The extant works of Lanfranc are not voluminous. The Epistolarum Liber contains
                    fifty-five of his own letters, many of them of considerable interest and
                    importance, as well as some of those of his distinguished
                    correspondents,—Berengarius, William, Popes Alexander II. and Gregory VII. The
                    short Oratio in concilio habita represents his argument before the synod of
                    Winchester in 1072 in support of his claims to the primacy. Statuta pro ordine
                    Benedicti are an adaptation and expansion of the ordinary Benedictine rules,
                    written, when he was primate, especially for his otvn monks; Sermo sive
                    Sententiae also relates to the duties of monks. Libellus de celanda confessione
                    has no special interest. Commentarius in B. Pauli epistolas seems rather to be a
                    collection of some student’s notes than to have been prepared for publication by
                    himself. Elucidarium sive dialogus de summa totius Christianae theologiae, the
                    most voluminous of all the works assigned to him, is of more than doubtful
                    genuineness, but it certainly is an adequate sketch of the scholastic theology
                    in its infantile stage. Most important is the Tractatus de Corpore ct Sanguine
                    Domini, a vigorous and even violent defence of the dogma of transubstantiation,
                    for which it helped to secure currency and permanency, but it adds little to
                    what had already been said by Paschasius Radbertus.</p>
                <p>The Benedictine edition of the works of Lanfranc by D’Achery, in one folio volume
                    (Paris, 1648), was reprinted at Lyons in 1677. A new edition by Giles appeared
                    at Oxford in two octavo volumes in 1844. The authorities for the life and times
                    of Lanfranc are the Chronicon Βeccense, and Vita Abbatum Βeccensium (which are
                    printed in both editions of the Opera), and the Historia Ecclesiastica of
                    Ordericus vitalis. See Hook, Lives of the Archbishops of Canterbury, vol. ii.,
