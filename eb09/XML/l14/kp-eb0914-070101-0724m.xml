                    origin, and nothing about the time of their appearance in the country they now
                    inhabit. Ptolemy mentions (lib. iii. chap. 5) two clans, the Galindae and
                    Sudeni, most probably Lithuanians of the western branch of this nationality, the
                    Borussians. In the 10th century they were already known under the name of Litva,
                    and, together with two other branches of the same stem,—the Borussians and the
                    Letts,—they occupied the south-eastern coast of the Baltic Sea from the Vistula
                    to the Duna, extending north-east towards the Lakes Wierzi-yärvi and Peipus,
                    south-east to the watershed between the affluents of the Baltic and those of the
                    Black Sea, and south to the middle course of the Vistula (Brest Litovsky),—a
                    tract bounded by Finnish tribes in the north, and by Slavonians elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The country which since that time they have continued to inhabit is flat,
                    undulating, and covered by numberless small lakes, ponds, and wide marshes,
                    which, though to a great extent drained during the last ten centuries,
                    nevertheless still cover immense tracts of land. The costly work of artificial
                    draining has been actively carried on during late years, but in the south the
                    marshes are disappearing slowly. The soil, being sandy in the north, and a hard
                    boulder-clay elsewhere, is unproductive. Thick forests cover it, and—though
                    considerable tracts have been destroyed by fires and by the hatchets of the <hi
                    rend="italic">budniki</hi> who during many centuries have cleared the most
                    remote thickets, founding there their villages, while, later, wide forest
                    regions, given by Catherine II. as gifts to her officials, have quite
                    disappeared—there still remain immense tracts of land covered with nearly virgin
                    forests; thus, the Byelovyesh Pushcha covers no less than 550,000 acres of land
                    on the level plateau 650 feet high, where tributaries of the Nareff and Bug have
                    a common origin in marshes. These forests have played an important part in the
                    history of the Lithuanians, giving many original features to their history, as
                    well as to their mythology, poetry, and music. They protected them from foreign
                    invasions, and have contributed to the maintenance of their national character,
                    notwithstanding the vicissitudes of their history, and of their primitive
                    religion until the 14th century. Their chief priest, the Krive-Kriveyto (the
                    judge of the judges), under whom were no less than seventeen different classes
                    of priests and elders, worshipped in the forests; the Waidelots brought their
                    offerings to the divinities at the foot of mighty oaks, and even during the 14th
                    century an un extinguishable fire, the “zincz,” was maintained in the midst of
                    the “pushta,”or “pushcha”; even now, the worship of great oaks is a widely
                    spread custom in the villages of the Lithuanians, and even of the Letts. In the
                    absence of great forests they worship isolated trees.</p>

                <p>Even at that time the Lithuanian stem was divided into three main branches :—the

                    rend="italic">Zemailef),</hi> the “Lowlanders.” To these three main branches,
                    which have maintained their national distinctions uninterrupted until the
                    present time, must be added also the <hi rend="italic">Yatvyags,</hi> or <hi

                    thick forests at the upper tributaries of the Niemen and Bug, and the survivors
                    of whom are easily distinguishable now as a mixture with White-Russians and
                    Mazurs in some parts of the governments Grodno and Plotsk, and in several
                    north-eastern parts of those of Lomza and Warsaw. Nestor’s chronicle

                    rather a mixture of Lithuanians and Slavonians.</p>
                <p>All these peoples are only ethnographical subdivisions, and each of them was
                    subdivided in its turn into numerous independent clans and villages, separated
                    from one another by forests and marshes; they had no towns or fortified places,
                    a feature which has struck many earlier Occidental writers. The Lithuanian
                    territory thus lay open to foreign invasions, and the warlike Russian <hi
                    rend="italic">Kniaz</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">es,</hi> as well as the German
                    crusaders, availed themselves of the opportunity. The Borussians soon fell under
                    the dominion of Germans, and ceased to constitute a separate nationality,
                    leaving only their name to the state which later became Prussia. The Letts were
                    driven farther to the north, mixing there with Livs and Ehsts, and fell under
                    the dominion of the Livonian order. Only the Lithuanians proper, together with
                    Samoghitians, succeeded in forming an independent state. The early history of
                    this state is but imperfectly known, all the more that the old Lithuanian
                    chronicles have suffered from subsequent alterations (Antonovitch, <hi
                    rend="italic">loc. cit.).</hi> During the continuous petty war carried on
                    against Slavonic invasions, the military chief of one of the clans, Ryngold,
                    acquired, in the first half of the 13th century, a certain preponderance over
                    other clans of Lithuania and Black Russia (Yatvyags), as well as over the
                    republics of Red Russia. At this time, the invasions of the Livonian order
                    becoming more frequent, and always extending southward, there was a general
                    feeling of the necessity of some organization to resist them, and Ryngold’s son,
                    Mendowg, availed himself of this opportunity to pursue the policy of his father.
                    He made different concessions to the order, ceded to it several parts of
                    Lithuania, and even agreed to be baptized, in 1250, at Novograd Litovsky,
                    receiving in exchange a crown from Innocent IV., with which he was crowned king
                    of Lithuanians. He ceded also the whole of Lithuania to the order in case he
                    should die without leaving offspring. But he had accepted Christianity only to
                    increase his influence among other clans: and.</p>
                <p>as soon as he had consolidated a union between Lithuanians, Samoghitians, and
                    Cours, he relapsed, proclaiming, in 1260, a general uprising of the Lithuanian
                    people against the Livonian order. The yoke was shaken off, but internal wars
                    followed, and three years later Mendowg was killed. About the end of the 13th
                    century a new dynasty of rulers of Lithuania was founded by Lutouver, whose
                    second son, Gedymin (1316-1341), with the aid of fresh forces he organized from
                    his relations with Red Russia, established something like regular government; he
                    extended at the same time his dominions over Russian countries—over Black Russia
                    (Novogrodok, Zditoff, Grodno, Slonim, and Volkovysk) and the principalities of
                    Polotsk, Tourovsk, Pinsk, Vitebsk, and Volhynia. He named himself <hi
                    rend="italic">Rex Lethowinorum</hi><hi rend="italic">et multorum
                    Ruthenorum.</hi> In 1325 he concluded a treaty with Poland against the Livonian
                    order, which treaty was the first step towards the union of both countries
                    realized two centuries later. The seven sons of Gedymin considered themselves as
                    quite independent; but two of them, Olgerd and Keistut, soon became the more
                    powerful. They represented two different tendencies which existed at that time
                    in Lithuania. Olgerd, whose family relations attracted him towards the south,
                    was the advocate of union with Russia; rather politician than warrior, he
                    increased his influence by diplomacy and by organization. His wife and sons
                    being Christians, he also soon agreed to be baptized in the Greek Church.
                    Keistut represented the revival of the Lithuanian nationality. Continually
                    engaged in wars with Livonia, and remaining true to the national religion, he
                    became the national legendary hero. In 1345 both brothers agreed to re-establish
                    the great principality of Lithuania, and, after having taken Vilna, the old
                    sanctuary of the country, all the brothers recognized the supremacy of Olgerd.
                    His son Yagello, who married the queen of Poland, Yadviga, after having been
                    baptized in the Latin Church, was crowned, on February 14, 1386, king of Poland.
                    At the beginning of the 15th century Lithuania was a mighty state, extending her
                    dominions as far east as Vyazma on the banks of the Moskva river, the present
                    government of Kaluga, and Poutivl, and southeast as far as Poltava, the shores
                    of the Sea of Azoff, and Hadji-bey (Odessa), thus including Kieff and Loutsk.
                    The union with Poland remained, however, but nominal until 1569, when Sigismund
                    Augustus was king of Poland. In the 16th century Lithuania did not extend its
                    power so far east and south-east as two centuries before, but it constituted a
                    compact state, including Polotsk, Moghileff, Minsk, Grodno, Kovno, Vilna, Brest,
                    and reaching as far south-east as Tchernigoff. From the union with Poland, the
                    history of Lithuania becomes a part of Poland’s history, Lithuanians and
                    White-Russians partaking of the fate of the Polish kingdom. After its three
                    partitions, they fell under the dominion of the Russian empire. In 1792 Russia
                    took the provinces of Moghileff and .Polotsk, and in 1793 those of Vilna, Troki,
                    Novgorod-Syeversk, Brest, and Vitebsk. In 1797 all these provinces were united
                    together, constituting the “Lithuanian government” (Litovskaya Gubernia). But
                    the name of Lithuanian provinces was usually given only to the governments of
                    Vilna and Kovno, and, though Nicholas I. prohibited the use of this name, it is
                    still used, even in official documents. In Russia, all the White-Russian
                    population of the former Polish Lithuania are mostly considered as Lithuanians,
                    the name of Jmud being restricted to Lithuanians proper.</p>
                <p>The ethnographical limits of the Lithuanians are quite undefined, and their
                    number is estimated very differently by different authors. The Letts occupy a
                    part of the Courland peninsula (according to Μ. Rittich, they numbered there
                    305,300 in 1870, to which several authors add 185,800 Cours), of Livonia
                    (416,400 at same date), and of Vitebsk (185,600), a few other settlements being
                    spread also in the governments of Kovno (18,500), St Petersburg (2700), and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n726/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0726-0703"/> Mogbileff (1000). The Lithuanians proper inhabit
                    the governments of Kovno (435,810), Vilna (350,700), Suvalki (54,300), and
                    Grodno (2500); whilst the Samoghitians, or Jmud, inhabit the governments of
                    Kovno (498,900) and Suvalki (165,200). To these must be added about 200,000
                    Borussians, the whole number of Lithuanians being 2,687,000 in 1870 (2,873,000
                    with the Cours), or, taking into account the rate of increase of population for
                    different governments, about 3,014,700 in 1882 (3,231,000 with Cours). Other
                    authors estimate the number of Lithuanians in the Polish provinces at 277,050 in
                    1869, probably including Yatvyags, mixed to some extent with Mazurs. In this
                    case the number of Lithuanians would be in 1882 about 3,082,000 (3,298,000 with
                    Cours). They are now slowly extending towards the south, especially the Letts,
                    who leave their country in consequence of want of land and of the difficulty
                    they experienced in getting means of subsistence; numerous emigrants have
                    already penetrated into Slavonic lands as far as the government of Voronesh.</p>
                <p>The Lithuanians are well built; the face is mostly elongated, the features fine;
                    the very fair hair, blue eyes, and delicate skin distinguish them from Poles and
                    Russians. Their dress is usually plain in comparison with that of Poles, and the
                    predominance in it of greyish colours has been frequently noticed. Their
                    language has great similarities to the Sanskrit. It is affirmed that whole
                    Sanskrit phrases are well understood by the peasants of the banks of the Niemen.
                    But it contains also a considerable amount of Slavonic words. The vocabulary is
                    very copious, especially in words referring to natural phenomena, and which
                    express certain pathological states of the mind. Diminutives are exceedingly
                    numerous, and various diminutive forms are applied even to adjectives and verbs.
                    But, as a whole, the Lithuanian language is at a very low stage of development,
                    and the written literature is very poor; only religious books, a few
                    translations, and a single newspaper are published in it. On the other hand, the
                    unwritten popular literature is very rich, and contains true treasures of
                    poetry. It was long doubted if Lithuanians have any epic poetry; it now appears,
                    however, that there are, scattered in songs, fragments of a great Lithuanian
                    epic poem. But the popular poetry is especially rich in idyllic and lyric songs,
                    imbued with tenderest love and melancholy, and a most poetical feeling of
                    nature, and remarkable by their absolute chastity; the irony which sometimes
                    appears in them is usually refined and gentle. The elegies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(raudas)</hi> are very melancholy, and of a rare beauty. The national character
                    is fully expressed in these songs,—not warlike at all, melancholy, very lovely,
                    and not very sociable.</p>
                <p>The language of the Letts is, according to Schleicher, as similar to the
                    Lithuanian as the Italian to the Latin, but contains a greater mixture of German
                    and Slavonic words. The literary language is more developed. A scientific
                    Lettish grammar was published by Stender at the end of the last century, and the
                    Letts possess translations of Shakespeare, Schiller, and other great poets. Five
                    political papers were published in Lettish in 1876. A revival of national
                    feeling having begun in this century, rich collections of Lettish songs were
                    published by Germans, Russians, and Letts, Μ. Briwsemniaks’s collection,
                    published by the Moscow Anthropological Society, being the most recent. The
                    Lettish songs have the same characters as those of the Lithuanians, to which a
                    special feature, the hatred of the people to the Gennan landholders, must be
                    added.</p>
                <p>The Letts of Courland, with the exception of about 50,000 who belong to the Greek
                    Church, are Lutherans. Nearly all can read. Those of the government of Vitebsk,
                    who were under Polish dominion, are Catholics, as well as the Lithuanians
                    proper, a part of whom, however, have returned to the Greek Church, in which
                    they were before the union with Poland. The Samoghitians are Catholics; they
                    more than other Lithuanians have conserved their national features. But all
                    Lithuanians have maintained much of their heathen practices and creed; the names
                    of pagan divinities, very numerous in the former mythology, are continually
                    mentioned in songs, and also in common speech.</p>
                <p>The chief occupation of Lithuanians is agriculture. The trades in towns are
                    generally carried on by men of other races—mostly by Germans, Jews, or Poles.
                    The only exception is afforded to some extent by the Letts. The Samoghitians are
                    good hunters, and all Lithuanians are given to apiculture and cattle breeding.
                    But the Lithuanians, as well in the Baltic provinces as in the central ones,
                    were not until the most recent time proprietors of the soil they tilled. They
                    have given a few families to the Russian nobility, but the great mass of the
                    people became serfs of foreign landowners, German and Polish, who reduced them
                    to the greatest misery. Since the Polish insurrection of 1863, the Russian
                    Government has given to the Lithuanians the land of the Polish proprietors on
                    much easier terms than in central Russia; but the allotments of soil and the
                    redemption taxes are very unequally distributed; and a not insignificant number
                    of peasants (the <hi rend="italic">tchinsheviki)</hi> were even deprived of the
                    land they had for centuries considered their own. The Letts remain in the same
                    state as before, and are restrained from emigrating <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi
