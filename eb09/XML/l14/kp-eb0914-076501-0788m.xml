                <p><label type="entry">LOCUST</label>. In its general acceptation this term is
                    strictly applicable only to certain insects of the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthoptera,</hi> family <hi rend="italic">Acrydiidx</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Insects)</hi>; and it is advisable to reiterate that according
                    to modern classification the family <hi rend="italic">Locustidx</hi> is now
                    viewed in a sense that does not admit of what are popularly termed “locusts”
                    being included therein. We universally associate with the term the idea of a
                    very destructive insect; therefore many orthopterous species that cannot be
                    considered true locusts have had the term applied to them; in North America it
                    has even embraced certain <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera-Homoptera,</hi> belonging
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Cicadidx,</hi> and in some parts of England cockchafers
                    are so designated. In a more narrow definition of the term we are wont to
                    associate with the destructive propensities the attribute of migration, and it
                    therefore becomes necessary that a true locust should be a migratory species of
                    the family <hi rend="italic">Acrydiidx.</hi> Moreover, the term has yet a
                    slightly different signification as viewed from the Old or New World. In Europe
                    by a locust is meant an insect of large size, the smaller allied species being
                    ordinarily known as “grasshoppers,” hence the notorious “Rocky Mountain locust”
                    of North America is to Eastern ideas rather a grasshopper than a locust.</p>
                <p>In Europe, and a greater part of the Old World, the best known migratory locust
                    is that which is scientifically termed <hi rend="italic">Pachytylus
                    migratorvus,</hi> to which is attached an allied (but apparently distinct)
                    species known as <hi rend="italic">P. cinerascens.</hi> Another locust found in
                    Europe and neighbouring districts is <hi rend="italic">Caloptenus italicus,</hi>
                    and still another, <hi rend="italic">Acrydium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >peregrinum,</hi> has once or twice occurred in Europe (even in England in
                    1869), though it can only be considered a straggler, its home (even in a
                    migratory sense) being more properly Africa and Asia. These practically include
                    all the locusts of the Old World, though a migratory species of South Africa
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Pachytylus pardaliηus</hi> (presumed to be distinct
                    from <hi rend="italic">P. migratorius)</hi> should be mentioned. The Rocky
                    Mountain locust of North America is <hi rend="italic">Calοptenus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">spretus,</hi> and in that continent there occurs an <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrydium (A. americanum)</hi> so closely allied to <hi
                    rend="italic">A. peregrinum</hi> as to be scarcely distinct therefrom, though
                    there it does not manifest migratory tendencies. In the West Indies and Central
                    America the absolutely true <hi rend="italic">A. peregrinum</hi> is also
                    reported to occur.</p>
                <p>As to general biology, a few words will suffice. The females excavate holes in
                    the earth in which the eggs are deposited regularly arranged in a long
                    cylindrical mass enveloped in a glutinous secretion. The young larvae hatch, and
                    immediately commence their destructive career. As these insects are
                    “hemimetabolic” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Insects),</hi> there is no quiescent
                    stage; they go on increasing rapidly in size, and as they approach the perfect
                    state the rudiments of the wings begin to appear. Naturally in this stage they
                    are incapable of flight, but their locomotive powers are nevertheless otherwise
                    extensive, and their capacity for mischief very considerable, for their voracity
                    is great. Once winged and perfect these powers become infinitely more
                    disastrous, redoubled by the development of the migratory instinct. The laws
                    regulating this instinct are not yet perfectly understood. Food and temperature
                    have a great deal to do with it, and there is a tendency for the flights to take
                    a particular direction, varied by the physical circumstances of the breeding
                    districts. So likewise it is certain that each species has its area of constant
                    location in which it always exists, and its area of extraordinary migration to
                    the extremes of which it only occasionally extends. Perhaps the most feasible of
                    the suggestions as to the causes of the migratory impulse is that locusts
                    naturally breed in dry sandy districts in which food is scarce, and are thus
                    impelled to wander in order to procure the necessaries of life; but against this
                    it has been argued that swarms bred in a highly productive district in which
                    they have temporarily settled will seek the barren home of their ancestors.
                    Another ingenious suggestion is that migration is intimately connected with a
                    dry condition of the atmosphere, urging them to move on until compelled to stop
                    for food or procreative purposes. The distance particular swarms may travel
                    depends upon a variety of circumstances, such as the strength of impulse, the
                    quantity of food, and many other causes. Certain it is that 1000 miles may, in
                    particularcases, be taken as a moderate estimate; probably it is often very much
                    less, certainly sometimes very much more. As a rule the progress is only
                    gradual, and this adds vastly to the devastating effects, which may be likened
                    to those caused by a foreign army levying black-mail upon the inhabitants of an
                    invaded country through which it is marching. When an extensive swarm
                    temporarily settles in a district, all vegetation rapidly disappears, and then
                    hunger urges them on another stage. Such is their voracity that it has been
                    tolerably well ascertained that the large Old World species, although
                    undoubtedly phytophagous, are often compelled by hunger to attack at least dry
                    animal substances, and even cannibalism has been asserted as an outcome of the
                    failure of all other kinds of food. The length of a single flight must depend
                    upon circumstances. From certain individual peculiarities in the examples of <hi
                    rend="italic">Acrydium peregrvnum</hi> that were taken in England in 1869, it
                    has been asserted that they must of necessity have come direct by sea from the
                    west coast of Africa; and what is probably the same species has been seen in the
                    Atlantic at least 1200 miles from land, in swarms completely covering the ship,
                    and obscuring the air; thus, although it is no doubt usual for the swarms to
                    rest during the night, it undoubtedly happens in certain cases that flight must
                    be sustained for several days and nights together. The height at which swarms
                    fly, when their horizontal course is not liable to be altered by mountains, has
                    been very variously estimated at from 40 to 200 feet, or even in a particular
                    case to 500 feet. A “dropping from the clouds” is a common expression used by
                    observers when describing the apparition of a swarm. The extent of swarms, and
                    the number of individuals in a swarm, are matters that must of necessity be
                    purely speculative. That the sun may sometimes be utterly obscured, and the
                    noise made hy the rustling of the wings be deafening, is confirmed by a
                    multitude of observers. We prefer to decline the attempt to grapple with so vast
                    a subject,—not unnaturally so when one observer says of a particular swarm that,
                    when driven out to sea and drowned, the dead bodies washed up formed a bank 50
                    miles long and 3 or 4 feet high.</p>
                <p>No special periodicity appears to have governed these flights (which, it is
                    necessary to state, happily do not occur to an alarming extent every year),
                    still an American writer (Mr Thomas) makes the interesting remark that the
                    interim between the years of superlatively extraordinary appearance is both in
                    Europe and America “very nearly a multiple of 11.”</p>
                <p>In Europe the best known and ordinarily most destructive species is <hi
                    rend="italic">Pachytylus migratοrius</hi> (fig. 1), and it is to it that the
                    numerous records of devastations in Europe mainly refer, but it is probably not
                    less destructive in many parts of Africa and Asia. Eastern Europe, and
                    especially the plains of southern Russia, appear to be more especially liable to
                    its attacks. That the arid steppes of Central Asia are the home of this insect
                    appears probable; still much on this point is enveloped in uncertainty. In any
                    case the area of permanent distribution, according to Koppen (who published an
                    elaborate memoir on the subject in 1871), is enormous, and that of occasional
                    distribution is still greater. The former area extends from the parallel of 40°
                    N. in Portugal, rising to 48° in France and Switzerland, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n789/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0789-0766"/> passing into Russia at 55°, thence continuing
                    across the middle of Siberia, north of China to Japan; thence south to the Fiji
                    Islands, to New Zealand, and North Australia; thence again to Mauritius and over
                    all Africa to Madeira. But Koppen remarks that the southern distribution is
                    uncertain and obscure. Taking exceptional distribution, it is well known that it
                    occasionally appears in the British Isles, and has in them apparently been
                    noticed as far north as Edinburgh; so also does it occasionally appear in
                    Scandinavia, and it has probably been seen up to 63° N. in Finland. Looking at
                    this vast area, it is easy to conceive that an element of uncertainty must
                    always exist with regard to the exact determination of the species, and in
                    Europe especially is this the case, because (as before stated) there exists an
                    apparently distinct species, known as <hi rend="italic">P. cinerascens,</hi>
                    which Koppen does not take into account. This latter species is certainly the
                    most common of the “locusts” occasionally found in the British Isles, and De
                    Selys-Longchamps is of opinion that it breeds regularly in Belgium, whereas the
                    true <hi rend="italic">P. migratorius</hi> is only accidental in that country.
                    In the case of this, as of all other locusts, it is impossible within the limits
                    of this article to chronicle even the years of greatest abundance. That they are
                    probably as destructive now as formerly appears within the bounds of belief. At
                    any rate we read that only a year or two ago a detachment of Russian soldiers in
                    Turcomania was so beset that a stampede at last took place, and eventually the
                    men were held prisoners by the insects forty-eight hours until the villagers
                    killed them and carried them away for manure, locomotion being as difficult as
                    if the men had been on ice.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Acrydium</hi><hi rend="italic">peregrinum</hi> (fig. 2) can
                    scarcely be considered even an accidental visitor to Europe; yet it has been
                    seen in the south of Spain, and, most extraordinarily, in many examples spread
                    over a large part of England in the year 1869. It is a larger insect than <hi
                    rend="italic">P. migratorius.</hi> No serious attempt to define the range of
                    this species has yet been made, but there is every reason to believe that it is
                    the most destructive locust throughout Africa and India and other parts of
                    tropical Asia, and its ravages are not one whit less important than are those of
                    <hi rend="italic">P. migratorius.</hi> Presumably it is the species that, on
                    more than one occasion, has been noticed in a vast swarm in the Atlantic, very
                    far from land, and presumably also it occurs in the West Indies and some parts
                    of Central America. But it has been already remarked that <hi rend="italic">A.
                    americamum</hi> of North America, although so closely allied as to be scarcely
                    distinguishable, is said not to be migratory, and is therefore scarcely a
                    true</p>
                <p>“locust.” In the Argentine Republic a (possibly) distinct species <hi
                    rend="italic">(A. paranense)</hi> is the migratory locust.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caloptenus</hi><hi rend="italic">italiens</hi> (fig. 3) is a
                    smaller insect, with a less extended area of migration; and, though from this
                    cause its ravages are not so notable, still the destruction occasioned in the
                    districts to which it is limited is often scarce less than that of its more
                    terrible allies. It is essentially a species of the Mediterranean district, and
                    especially of the European side of that sea, yet it is also found in North
                    Africa, and appears to extend far into southern Russia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Caloptenus</hi><hi rend="italic">spretus</hi> (fig. 4) is the
                    “Rocky Mountain locust” or ‘ ‘ hateful grasshopper” of the North American
                    continent. Though a comparatively small insect, not so large as some of the
                    grasshoppers of English fields, its destructiveness has procured for it within
                    the last twenty years a notoriety scarcely excelled by that of any other. It is
                    only recently that the persistent migration of American settlers westward
                    extended into the home of this creature. Travellers and prospectors in these
                    regions had previously spoken of enormous swarms of a destructive grasshopper as
                    existing there, and no doubt these occasionally extended into regions already
                    civilized, but the species was not recognized as distinct from some of its
                    non-migratory congeners to which it is so closely allied as to require a
                    practised entomological eye to separate it therefrom. As time drew on, the
                    various “State entomologists” made it their special duty to 'report on the
                    insect, and at length, in 1877, the matter had become so serious that Congress
                    appointed a United <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n790/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0790-0767"/> States Entomological Commission to investigate
                    the subject, and report upon the best (if any) means of counteracting the evil
                    effects of the pest. The result, so far as published, consists of two enormous
                    volumes, teeming with information, and taking up the whole subject of locusts
                    both in America and the Old World. <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spretus</hi> has its home or permanent area in the arid plains of the central
                    region east of the Rocky Mountains, extending slightly into the southern portion
                    of British North America; outside this is a wide fringe to which the term
                    sub-permanent is applied, and this is again bounded by the limits of only
                    occasional distribution, the whole occupying a large portion of the North
                    American continent; but it is not known to have crossed the Rocky Mountains
                    westward, or to have extended into the eastern States.</p>
                <p>As to remedial or preventive measures tending to check the ravages of locusts,
                    little unfortunately can be said, but anything that will apply to one species
                    may be used with practically all. One point is certain; direct remedies must
                    always be of small avail. Something can be done (as is now done in Cyprus) by
                    offering a price for all the egg-tubes collected, which is certainly the most
                    direct manner of attacking them. Some little can be done by destroying the young
                    larvae while yet in an unwinged condition, and by digging trenches in the line
                    of march into which they can fall and be drowned or otherwise put an end to.
                    Infinitesimally little can be done with the winged hordes having the migratory
                    instinct upon them; starvation, the outcome of their own work, probably here
                    does much. It has been shown that with all migratory locusts the breeding
                    places, or true homes, are comparatively barren districts (mostly elevated
                    plateaus); hence the progress of civilization and colonization, withits
                    concomitant necessity for converting those heretofore barren plains into areas
                    of fertility, may (and probably will) gradually lessen the evil.</p>
                <p>Locusts, like all other animals, have their natural enemies. Many birds greedily
                    devour them, and it has many times been remarked that migratory’swarms of the
                    insects were closely followed by myriads of birds. Predatory insects of other
                    orders also attack them, especially when they are in the unwinged condition.
                    Moreover, like all other insects, they have still more deadly insect foes as
                    parasites. Some attack the fully developed winged insect. But the greater part
                    adopt the more insidious method of attacking the eggs. To such belong certain
                    beetles, chiefly of the family <hi rend="italic">Can-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tharidae,</hi> and especially certain two-winged flies of the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombyliidae.</hi> These latter, both in the Old and New World,
                    must prevent vast quantities of eggs from producing larvae. Popular ignorance on
                    this subject is yet great, and within a few months before this article was
                    written it was exemplified in a remarkable manner by a suggestion from the
                    Government officials of Cyprus that a certain parasite known to be destructive
