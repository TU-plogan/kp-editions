                    on 21st April 1806. l·Iis father, Thomas F. Lewis of Harpton Court, Radnorshire,
                    after holding subordinate office in various administrations became a poor-law
                    commissioner. He was made a baronet in 1846. Lewis was educated at Eton, and at
                    Christ Church, Oxford, where in 1828 he took a first-class in classics and a
                    second-class in mathematics. He then entered the Middle Temple, and was called
                    to the bar in 1831. In the year before he had, with John Romilly and John Stuart
                    Mill, attended the celebrated lectures on jurisprudence delivered by John Austin
                    at London University. In 1832 he undertook his first public work as one of the
                    commissioners to inquire into the condition of the poor Irish residents in the
                    United Kingdom.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                    <hi rend="italic">Abstract of Final Report of Commissioners of Irish Poor
                    Enquiry,</hi> &amp;c., by G. C. Lewis and N. Seniσr, 1837.</p></note> Again, in
                    1834, Lord Althorp included him in the commission to inquire into the state of
                    church property and church affairs generally in Ireland. To this fact we owe his
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Local Disturbances in Ireland, and the Irish Church
                    Question</hi> (London, 1836), in which he condemned the existing connexion
                    between church and state, proposed a state provision for the Catholic clergy,
                    and maintained the necessity of an efficient workhouse organization. During this
                    period of apprenticeship to politics Lewis’s mind was much occupied with the
                    phenomena of language. Before leaving college he had published some observations
                    on Whately’s doctrine of the predicables, and soon afterwards he assisted
                    Thirlwall and Hare in starting the <hi rend="italic">Philological Museum.</hi>
                    Its successor, the <hi rend="italic">Classical Museum,</hi> he also supported by
                    occasional contributions. In 1835 he published an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Origin and Formation of the liomance Languages</hi> (re-edited in 1862), which,
                    though anticipated by Schlegel, may be taken as the first effective criticism in
                    England of Raynouard’s theory of a uniform romance tongue, represented by the
                    poetry of the troubadours. He also set an excellent example to county gentlemen
                    by compiling a glossary of provincial words used in Herefordshire and the
                    adjoining counties. But the most important work of this earlier period was one
                    to which his logical and philological tastes both contributed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Remarks on the Use and Abuse of some Political Terms</hi> (London,
                    1832) may have been suggested by Bentham’s <hi rend="italic">Look of
                    Parliamentary Fallacies,</hi> but it shows all that power of clear sober
                    original thinking which marks his larger and later political works. And yet this
                    original mind did more than most scholars in the humbler walk of useful
                    translation. He translated Boeckh’s <hi rend="italic">Public Economy of
                    Athens</hi> and Miiller’s <hi rend="italic">History of Greek Literature,</hi>
                    and he assisted Tufnell in the translation<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0512-0493"/> of Miiller’s <hi rend="italic">Dorians.</hi> Some
                    time afterwards he edited a text of the <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> of
                    Babrius. While his friend Hayward conducted the <hi rend="italic">Law
                    Magazine,</hi> he wrote in it frequently on such subjects as secondary
                    punishments and the penitentiary system. In 1836, at the request of Lord
                    Glenelg, he accompanied John Austin to Malta, where they spent nearly two years
                    reporting on the condition of the island and framing a new code of laws. One
                    leading object of both commissioners was to associate the Maltese in the
                    responsible government of the dependency. On his return to England Lewis
                    succeeded his father as one of the principal poor-law commissioners. But his
                    literary activity did not cease. In 1841 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    the Government of Dependencies,</hi> a systematic statement and discussion of
                    the various relations in which colonies may stand towards the mother country. In
                    1844 Lewis married Lady Maria Theresa Lister, sister of Lord Clarendon, and a
                    lady of literary tastes. Much of their married life was spent in Kent House,
                    Knightsbridge. They had no children. In 1847 Lewis resigned his office. He was
                    then returned for the county of Hereford, and Lord John Russell appointed him
                    secretary to the Board of Control, but a few months afterwards he became under
                    secretary to the Home Office. In this capacity he introduced two important
                    bills, one for the abolition of turnpike trusts and the management of highways
                    by a mixed county board, the other for the purpose of defining and regulating
                    the law of parochial assessment. On the latter subject his evidence before the
                    select committee (Lords) of 1850 is the clearest statement of general results
                    which we have. In that year he succeeded Hayter as financial secretary to the
                    Treasury. About this time, also, appeared his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                    Influence of Authority in Matters of Opinion.</hi> Lewis seems to have thought
                    that authority was too much divided to be of much use in theological matters,
                    while in the world of science he found sufficient authority for declaring that
                    homoeopathy, mesmerism, and phrenology were all impostures. On the dissolution
                    of parliament which followed the resignation of Lord John Russell’s ministry in
                    1852, Lewis was defeated for Herefordshire and then for Peterborough. Excluded
                    from parliament he accepted the editorship of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                    Review,</hi> which the death of Empson had left vacant. Lord Halifax offered
                    him, in 1853, the governorship of Bombay, but he remained editor until 1855.
                    During this period he did some public work on the Oxford commission, and on the
                    commission to inquire into the government of London. But its chief fruits were
                    the <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Methods of Observation and Reasoning in
                    Politics,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Enquiry into the Credibility of the
                    Early Roman History,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Translated into German by Liebrecht, ∏anover, 1858.</p></note> in which he
                    vigorously attacks the theory of epic lays and other theories on which Niebuhr’s
                    reconstruction of that history had proceeded. In 1855 Lewis succeeded his father
                    in the baronetcy. He was at once elected member for the Radnor boroughs, and
                    Lord Palmerston made him chancellor of the exchequer. The position was
                    difficult, for he had a war loan to contract and heavy additional taxation to
                    impose. But his industry, method, and clear vision carried him safely through.
                    His financial statement of 13th February 1857, and his speech on 12th
                    February</p>
                <p>1858 on the bill for the better government of India were most successful efforts.
                    After the change of ministry in</p>
                <p>1859 Sir George became home secretary under Lord Palmerston, and in 1861, much
                    against his wish, he succeeded Sidney Herbert (Lord Herbert of Lea) at the War
                    Office. The closing years of his life were marked by increasing intellectual
                    vigour. In 1859 he published an able <hi rend="italic">Essay on Foreign
                    Jurisdiction and the Extradition of Criminals,</hi> a subject to which the
                    attempt on Napoleon’s life, the discussions on the Conspiracy Bill, and the
                    trial of Bernard, had drawn general attention. He advocated the extension of
                    extradition treaties, and condemned the principal idea of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Weltrechtsordnung</hi> which Mohl of Heidelberg had proposed. His two latest
                    works were the <hi rend="italic">Survey of the Astronomy of the Ancients,</hi>
                    in which, without professing any knowledge of Oriental languages, he applies a
                    sceptical analysis to the ambitious Egyptology of Bunsen; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialogue on the Best Form of Government,</hi> in which, under the
                    name of Crito, the author points out to the supporters of the various systems
                    that there is no one abstract government which is the best possible for all
                    times and places. An essay on the <hi rend="italic">Characteristics of Federal,
                    National, Provincial, and Municipal Government</hi> does not seem to have been
                    published. Sir George died in April 1863. A marble bust by Weekes stands in
                    Westminster Abbey. He has two other monuments—the reprint from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> of his long series of papers on the <hi
                    rend="italic">Administrations of Great Britain</hi> (1864), and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Letters to various Friends</hi> (1870), edited by his brother, who
                    succeeded him in the baronetcy.</p>
                <p>Lewis was a man of mild and affectionate disposition, much beloved by a large
                    circle of friends, among whom were Sir E. Head, the Grotes, the Austins, Lord
                    Stanhope, J. S. Mill, Dean Milman, the Duff Gordons. In public life he was
                    distinguished, says Lord Aberdeen, “for candour, moderation, love of truth.” He
                    had a passion for the systematic acquirement of knowledge, and a keen and sound
                    critical faculty. Nothing is more remarkable than the practical good sense of
                    his speculative writings. Sometimes he betrayed a slight intellectual
                    impatience: but this was merely the passing irritation of a healthy and modest
                    judgment.</p>
