                    Latinized as <hi rend="italic">Leodium),</hi> a city of Belgium, the chief town
                    of the province of Liége, is situated in 50° 39' N. lat. and 5° 3Γ E. long., 56
                    miles east of Brussels (62J by rail), and 16 miles south-south west of
                    Maestricht. It occupies a remarkably fine position on the banks of the Meuse,
                    which at this point is joined by the Ourthe. On the left-hand side stands the
                    older city with the citadel and the more important historical buildings; on the
                    right hand lies the lower and more modern portion, commanded by the fort of the
                    Chartreuse. The river, there 460 feet across, is spanned by several bridges, of

                    the 8th century, and plays a prominent part in the local annals. Place St
                    Lambert is the historical centre of Liege. Here still stands the noble
                    building—erected (1508-40) by Cardinal de la Marek in a late Gothic style—which
                    down to the revolution was the palace of the prince-bishops, and is now with its
                    modern extensions occupied by the public courts and other administrative
                    offices. And here, till it was ruined by the revolutionists in 1794, and
                    completely removed in 1808, stood the old cathedral of St Lambert, originally
                    founded in 712, and rebuilt after a great fire at the close of the 12th century.
                    The rank of cathedral was in 1802 transferred to the abbey-church of St Paul,
                    the foundation of which is assigned to 968, though the nave is no older than the
                    16th century, and the choir belongs to 1280. The stained glass and the wood
                    carving of the pulpit by Geefs deserve particular mention. Other churches of
                    note are St Jacques, a fine Gothic building founded in 1016, with a Romanesque
                    west tower and a polygonal choir; St Barthélemy, a completely modernized
                    basilica of the 12th century; St Martin, founded in 962 and rebuilt in the
                    middle of the 16th century; and the Holy Cross, founded by Notker in 979, with a
                    west choir dating from the 12th century, and the east choir and nave from the
                    14th. The university of Liège, established in 1817, is a flourishing institution
                    with about 40 professors and 800 students, a library of 100,000 volumes, a
                    botanic garden (1819, formerly the Jesuits’ garden), a school of mines (1825), a
                    school of arts and manufactures, a normal grammar school, and several other
                    auxiliary foundations. There is no theological faculty,—the theological
                    seminary, with a large library of its own, being an independent institution. The
                    city further possesses a blind asylum, a deaf and dumb institute, schools of
                    design, painting, and music, a zoological garden, a municipal museum, &amp;c.
                    The Place d’Avroi is adorned by an equestrian statue of Charlemagne by Jehotte;
                    and in front of the theatre stands a bronze statue of Gretry, the composer, who
                    was born at Liège.</p>
                <p>Liège is the centre of a great mining district rich in coal, lead, zinc, and
                    iron; the coal-mines extend under the city and the river. In 1879 358,100 tons
                    of coal were raised in the province, 22,156 persons being employed in the pits.
                    The iron, lead, and zinc foundries in the town ami neighbourhood work up large
                    quantities of ore in addition to the. local supply. Steel, copper, and tin
                    wares, steam-engines and general machinery, woollen goods, excellent saws and
                    files, nails, needles, mirrors, clocks, leather, paper, and oil are among the
                    products of the versatile industry of the place. Liège firearms have long
                    enjoyed a wide reputation. They give employment to about 30,000 workmen, who for
                    the most part work in their own houses, though in 1878 a large factory was
                    erected in the American style for making all parts of the weapon by machinery.
                    In 1878 183,806 single-barrelled guns, 113,121 double-barrelled guns, 403,649
                    revolvers, 19,395 saddle pistols, and about 85,000 army weapons, <hi
                    rend="italic">ke.,</hi> were passed by Liège through the Government testing
                    office. The trade of Liege is favoured by the fact that the town is an important
                    junction on the Rhenish Belgian Railway, commands more than one navigable river,
                    and has long been one of the leading cattle-markets in the country. The
                    population was 115,956 in 1874.</p>
                <p>About 720 the bishops of Tongres, after oscillating between Tongres and
                    Maestricht, settled at Liège, though they did not take the title bishop of Liège
                    for more than two centuries. Their church of St Lambert received large
                    territorial endowments, and in the 14th century they became princes of the
                    empire. For centuries the straggle was maintained between episcopal tyranny and
                    civic independence; and ducal and imperial armies were called in to crush the
                    insurrections. In this way Charles the Bold of Burgundy made himself master of
                    the city in 1467, and again with much bloodshed and barbarity in 1468. Bishop
                    Ferdinand in 1650 and Bishop Maximilian in 1684 were each imposed on the
                    citizens by force of arms, and kept them down by means of a strong citadel and
                    foreign soldiers. In 1691 Liège was bombarded for five days by Marshal de
                    Bouffiers; in 1702 Marlborough took the citadel by storm from a French garrison;
                    and in 1792 the town was the scene of a great defeat of the Austrians by the
                    French.</p>
