                <p><label type="entry">LEATHER</label> consists of the hides and skins of certain
                    animals, prepared by chemical and mechanical means in such a manner as to resist
                    influences to which in their natural condition they are subject, and also to
                    give them certain entirely new properties and qualities. Skins in an unprepared
                    moist condition are readily disintegrated and destroyed by putrefaction, and if
                    they are dried raw they become hard, horny, and intractable. The art of the
                    leather manufacturer is principally directed to overcoming the tendency to
                    putrefaction, to securing suppleness in the material, to rendering it impervious
                    to and unalterable by water, and to increasing the strength of the skin and its
                    power to resist tear and wear.</p>
                <p>Leather is made by three processes, or with three classes of substances. Thus we
                    have—(1) tanned leather, in which the hides and skins are combined with tannin
                    or tannic acid; (2) tawed leather, in which skins are prepared with mineral
                    salts; (3) shamoyed leather, consisting of skins combined with oils or fatty
                    substances.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tanned Leather.</hi><hi rend="italic">Hides and Skins.—</hi>
                    The skins of all mammalians may be made into leather, but in practice it is only
                    from a few of the larger animals, readily obtainable in sufficient numbers, and
                    reared and slaughtered for other objects, that commercial supplies are obtained.
                    The term hides is by tanners restricted to the large and heavy skins of
                    full-grown oxen, horses, and other large animals—all the lighter stock being
                    known as skins (calf skins, sheep skins, goat skins, &lt;tc.). Of all hides and
                    skins used by the tanner, by far the most important and valuable are those
                    obtained from oxen. Not only do these yield the most useful and valuable hides,
                    but they are slaughtered in all civilized countries in enormous quantities; and,
                    while in Europe the skins of cattle are only of secondary importance, the vast
                    herds which roam practically wild in the plains of South America are valuable
                    more on account of their hides and other products than as sources of animal
                    food. Ox hides are imported into Europe and the United States of America in
                    enormous quantities, and come principally from South America, the Cape,
                    Australia, the East Indies, and North Africa. The main centres of the import
                    trade in hides are Antwerp, Liverpool, Havre, and New York. For tanners’
                    purposes calf skins are distinguished from ox hides, and the kinds of leather
                    into which they are manufactured are entirely distinct. Intermediate between the
                    heavy ox hides and calf skins are East Indian kips, a medium weight skin which
                    comes both raw and tanned from Calcutta and Madras in such large quantities as
                    to form a distinct branch of the leather trade. Horse hides and the skins of the
                    other <hi rend="italic">Equidae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the ass, zebra,
                    quagga, &amp;c.—have in modern times become important raw materials of leather.
                    The various breeds of sheep, on account of the vast numbers in which their skins
                    come into the market and the numerous applications of sheep and lamb skins, come
                    near in value to oxen as sources of leather. As a rule the importance of a breed
                    of sheep for the purposes of the tanner is in inverse proportion to its value as
                    a source of wool. Goat and kid skins come next in order of importance, the
                    products they yield being beautiful in texture, of high value, and of varied
                    usefulness. Goat skins are obtained <pb break="no"

                    Africa, South America, Mexico, Asia Minor, and the hilly regions of Europe. Seal
                    skins, obtained from the arctic regions, are an important material, while hog
                    skins are of value for the purposes of the tanner almost exclusively for making
                    saddle leather. Among the skins which are only occasionally or locally used may
                    be enumerated walrus, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and elephant hide, yielding very
                    thick leather used for buffing wheels in cutlery manufacture, &lt;fcc., and the
                    skins of the numerous species of deer and antelope, dogs, kangaroo, and other
                    Australian marsupials, porpoises, alligators, and occasionally boas.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of Skin.—</hi> All hides and skins are externally
                    clothed more or less with wool, hair, bristles, or scales. The skin itself has a
                    thin superficial horny and cellular layer, the cuticle or epidermis, into which
                    neither nerves nor blood-vessels penetrate. This layer is, during the life of
                    the animal, continually in progress of peeling off in the form of small flat
                    scales, and is renewed from the inner portion of the epidermis known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">rete mucosum</hi> or Malpighian net. The skin proper <hi
                    rend="italic">(comum, dermis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cutis'),</hi> which is
                    the only portion of the hide of use for the tanner, consists of a dense plexus
                    of fibrous bundles, knit together and interwoven in every direction, the
                    interspaces being filled up with an albuminoid substance. The bundles of fibres
                    terminate on the upper surface of the corium in separate masses, producing the
                    irregularly papillated appearance seen in the “grain” of leather, and hence that
                    surface is distinguished as the grain side in contradistinction to the flesh or
                    under side. Chemically the connective tissue or fibrous portion of the corium
                    consists of gelatigenous tissue or collagen, which, according to Reimer, is
                    similar in composition to the fibroin of silk. It is insoluble in cold water,
                    weak acids, and alkalies, but with boiling water it dissolves, forming gelatin,
                    and it is also soluble in concentrated acids and alkalies. It combines with
                    tannic acid, forming the essential basis of leather, and it similarly combines
                    with oils and fats. The interfibrous binding albuminoid material called by the
                    same authority coriin is soluble in alkaline solutions (being withdrawn from the
                    skin by treatment with lime water, &amp;c.) and in strong hydrochloric acids,
                    but insoluble in water. It is precipitated from solutions by tannin, with which
                    it combines. Many competent authorities maintain that the distinction between
                    the fibrous and non-fibrous portions of skin is only one of physical
                    condition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tanning Materials.—</hi> Tannin or tannic acid is a product of
                    the vegetable kingdom, abundantly formed in a very large number of plants, and
                    secreted in such diverse organs and members as the bark, wood, roots, leaves,
                    seed-pods, fruit, &amp;c. The tannin obtained from various sources is not
                    precisely the same in its chemical relations and reactions. Dr Stenhouse was the
                    first to insist on the principal distinction which possesses practical interest
                    to the tanner. He pointed out that tannin-producing bodies may be divided into
                    two classes, the first class comprising such as by their decomposition develop
                    into gallic acid, and by destructive distillation yield pyrogallic acid. Of
                    these gallotannic acid, obtainable from galls, is the type. The other principal
                    tanning materials which yield gallotannic acid are sumach, valonia, divi-divi,
                    and myrobalans. The second class embraces tannins which do not resolve
                    themselves into gallic acid or yield pyrogallic acid, and of this class oak
                    bark, mimosa bark, and gambier yield characteristic types. All varieties of
                    tannin, however, agree in possessing a powerfully astringent but not bitter
                    taste, and a distinctly acid reaction; they yield with solutions of salts of
                    peroxide of iron a deep blue-black or greenblack solution, and particularly they
                    combine and form insoluble compounds with gelatin and with the gelatigenous
                    tissue which constitutes the principal portion of animal skins. By the action of
                    ether, containing a little water, on gall-nuts, pure gallotannic acid may be
                    procured. The ethereal solution separates by repose into two layers, the lower
                    one, which is of an amber colour, being a solution of tannin in water, while the
                    upper layer contains gallic acid, mixed with other substances. On gently
                    evaporating the aqueous solution, nearly pure gallotannic acid is procured, to
                    the extent of from 35 to 40 per cent., from galls. Obtained in this way, it is a
                    shining, porous, uncrystallizable mass; it is soluble in water, and then exerts
                    the properties of an acid. By exposure to air it absorbs oxygen and gives off
                    carbonic acid,—two new products, gallic acid and ellagic acid, being formed at
                    the expense of the tannin; the latter is insoluble. Gallotannic acid may be
                    precipitated from its solutions by sulphuric and some other acids; by boiling
                    the precipitate with sulphuric acid for a few minutes in a dilute solution of
                    the same acid, gallic acid is formed, and crystallizes in cooling. Gallic acid
                    also exists ready formed in gall-nuts, sumach, valonia, tea, and other
                    substances. It does not combine with gelatin, and is therefore useless in
                    tanning. Some tanners, however, imagine the gallic acid of the waste liquor to
                    be useful in swelling or raising the hides, preparatory to removing them to a
                    stronger liquor.</p>
                <p>Tannin is in no case isolated for use as a tanning agent. It is only brought in
                    contact with skins and hides by the medium of infusions, decoctions, or extracts
                    of the various tanning materials in which a percentage of tannin is present
                    mixed with colouring and other extractive material.</p>
                <p>The substances enumerated below comprise the principal tanning materials in use
                    throughout Europe and America.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Oak Bark.—</hi> In early times the bark of the common oak, <hi
                    rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic">Rοbur,</hi> was almost the only
                    tanning material used by British tanners, and it still is the substance from
                    which the highest quality of heavy tanned leather is prepared, although with it
                    the process is necessarily tedious. Throughout the country there are still a few
                    tanners of sole leather whose boast is that they use nothing but oak bark. The
                    entire supply of British oak bark is estimated at from 200,000 to 300,000 tons
                    annually. This quantity, with the additional import of 30,000 tons from the
                    Continent, is altogether inadequate to meet the demands of the tanners, apart
                    from the necessity which is now felt for forcing the tanning operation much more
                    rapidly than was formerly the rule. The most useful bark is obtained from
                    coppice wood of about twelve years’ growth, although in inner bark of longer
                    growth a large proportion of tannin is secreted. The amount of astringent matter
                    in coppice bark may be taken to average from 8 to 10 per cent., but the
                    statements of the quantities of tannin in different samples vary within wide
                    limits, as much as 18 per cent, being in some cases found. There is no doubt
                    that the peculiar excellence of the sole leather of England is due in great
                    measure to the superior oak bark produced there. Oak bark imparts firmness and
                    solidity to leather, while other sorts give softness; thus the peculiar softness
                    of French curried leather is referred to the bark of the evergreen oak, with
                    which the better kinds are tanned, while the other tanning materials next to be
                    named give each its peculiar quality with respect to colour, scent, toughness,
                    or the power of resisting moisture and decay.</p>
                <p>Other species of oak also yield tanning materials of much importance, and are
                    extensively used. The cork oak, <hi rend="italic">Quercus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Suber,</hi> of south Europe and north Africa, in addition to its well-known
                    external layer (the cork of commerce), possesses a fibrous inner bark which is
                    richer in tannin than ordinary oak bark. It is much employed in France, and is
                    imported also to some extent into the United Kingdom. In the United States
                    several varieties of oak yield staple tanning materials. Of these the principal
                    are the rock or chestnut oak, yellow oak or quercitron, both important sources
                    of tan barks; the red oak and white oak are of less consequence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mimosa Bark.—</hi> Under this general name a large amount of
                    bark comes to the English market from Australia, principally from Melbourne and
                    Adelaide, and from Tasmania. It is obtained from a large number of trees
                    belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Acacia,</hi> widely distributed
                    throughout Australasia, and the various barks are rich in tannin, which ranges
                    from 15 up to 32 per cent. The qualities imported into England are the richer
                    kinds. They amount to about 30,000 tons annually, and may be assumed to contain
                    on an average 28 per cent, of astringent matter. These richer barks are the
                    produce of <hi rend="italic">A. harpophylla,</hi> a Queensland tree, the black
                    wattle <hi rend="italic">(A. molissima),</hi> the gold wattle (√f. <hi

                    produces a dark leather against which there is a prejudice, and the material has
                    therefore to be used sparingly in mixtures. It is also said that mimosa tanning
                    results in a somewhat hard brittle leather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemlock Bark</hi> is the most important tanning material in
                    North America. It is the produce of the hemlock spruce, <hi rend="italic">Abies
                    canadensis,</hi> which grows in vast forests throughout Canada and the northern
                    and eastern States of the Union, the principal bark-producing States being
                    Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Hemlock bark is obtained by cutting down
                    the trees; and, as no provision is made for renewing the denuded forests, the
                    strain on the more accessible portions of the American forests is already
                    beginning to make itself apparent. The bark contains 7 or 8 per cent, of tannin,
                    and the leather it makes has a strong reddish-brown colour. A large and
                    increasing amount of hemlock extract, an inspissated decoction of the bark
                    having a specified richness in tannin, is now imported into Europe, principally
                    to the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>Among barks used to a limited extent and for special purposes are <hi
                    rend="italic">larch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scotch fir barks,</hi> used for

                    satisfactory.</p>

                    several grave objections. The abundant mucilage of the pods ferments readily,
                    and thereby sometimes causes a rotting of the hides. Leather tanned by divi-divi
                    also draws moisture readily in presence of damp, while in a dry atmosphere it is
                    hard and horny, and further this agent leaves finished leather very dark in
                    colour.</p>

                    have a fine white colour, as in the case of bright morocco leather, &amp;c. Of
                    the species the most important is the Sicilian sumach, <hi rend="italic">R.
                    Coriaria,</hi> a shrub or low tree indigenous to Italy, Spain, France, and the
                    Mediterranean coasts of Africa. It is cultivated with much care in Sicily, the
                    leaves being gathered from shoots not more than a year old, which thereafter are
                    cut down close to the parent stem. The same shrub is largely cultivated in the
                    southern departments of France, in Spain, and in Portugal. The leaves gathered
                    in June are dried and ground under edge rollers to a fine dust, in which
                    condition the material comes into the market. It has a bright olive green colour
                    with something of the odour of tea, and should contain in the best qualities
                    from 25 to 30 per cent, of gallotannic acid, the same tannin which is present in
                    galls. The leaves of the Venetian sumach, <hi rend="italic">R.</hi><hi

                    Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama. These are, however, much inferior
                    to European sumach, both on account of the colour they communicate to leather,
                    and also from the smaller percentage of tannin they yield, although it is
                    believed that with careful cultivation and proper attention the quality might be

                    costly for use as tanning agents. The “knoppern” galls of Hungary, which are
                    formed on the acorn cups of a species of oak, however, are to some extent used
                    in Continental tanneries. For full information regarding galls, see vol. x. p.

                    valonia, myrobalans, and other tanning bodies are reduced to a small and as far
                    as possible uniform size by means of grinding or comminuting machinery. The main
                    object in such machines is to produce uniformity of size with as little dust as
                    possible, and the apparatus most commonly used is similar in principle to the
                    ordinary coffee-mill, with breaking arms for the bark and segmental cutters for
                    smaller materials. Various forms of disintegrator are also used, which produce
                    their effect by violent concussion obtained by the revolution in opposite
                    directions of two large and strong disks armed with projecting spikes on the
                    sides of the disks facing each other. These disks are enclosed within a stout
                    iron drum; and, as they revolve at a speed rising to three thousand revolutions
                    per minute, some conception of the violence with which the tanning materials are
                    struck and smashed may be formed. The tanning materials so prepared are next
                    leached, latched, or infused for preparing the strongest tanning solutions for
                    use in the “layers” or lay-away pits noticed below. In making these leaches or
                    infusions, some tanners use hot (even-boiling) water, others use cold water
                    alone; some employ only pure water, and by some the weak and exhausted oozes or
                    woozes from the pits are strengthened up by renewed leaching. The sole object of
                    the tanner is to obtain the greatest amount of the tanning principle contained
                    in the materials operated on, and to take care that what he gets is not lost or
                    wasted. The method of leaching commonly adopted in the United Kingdom is to pass
                    the bark through a series of leachers or spender pits. New or fresh bark is put
                    into the first of the series, and over it is pumped cold the well-strengthened
                    ooze from the next leacher. In this first pit the ooze or infusion is brought up
                    to the full strength required for the lay-away tan-pits, and after the infusion
                    is pumped off the tan (now somewhat reduced in strength) is passed over into No.
                    2 leacher, where it is treated with liquor in its turn also somewhat lower in
                    strength. In this manner the bark passes by stages through a series of pits,
                    diminishing in richness in tannin at each stage, and in the same gradual manner
                    being infused in a weaker and weaker liquor, till in the last of the series it
                    is fully exhausted with pure warm water. Thus pure water is put in at one end of
                    the range and fresh tanning material at the other; the water as it ascends is
                    gradually strengthened till it reach the maximum richness in tanning principle,
                    while the tanning material as it descends is in like proportion deprived of its
                    extractive constituents, till in the end nothing further soluble remains. From
                    the last pit the bark, &amp;c., are turned out as “spent tan,” usually to be
                    burned in a special form of tan-burning furnace for raising steam. The use of
                    leaches or infusions was first insisted on by Seguin about the end of the 18th
                    century, and the adoption of his suggestion led to the shortening of the time
                    occupied in tanning heavy leather by about one half.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Testing Tan Liquors.—</hi> The methods by which the tanning
                    value of any substance is determined are numerous, but few of them are at once
                    capable of simple application and minutely accurate. One of the commonest plans
                    for ascertaining the strength of the tan liquor technically called ooze, or
                    wooze, is by means of a kind of hydrometer called a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n400/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0400-0383"/><hi rend="italic">barkometer.</hi> It is graduated
                    to the standard of pure water; and, when it is placed in a specimen of ooze, the
                    strength of the latter is judged of by the position of the stem above or below
                    the water-mark. But, as bark or other tanning material may contain several
                    soluble substances besides tannin, the barkometer obviously cannot be relied on.
                    Some tanners judge of the strength of ooze by its astringency to the taste.
                    Seguin, who in the end of the 18th century was the first to insist on the
                    advantage of tanning with previously prepared infusions, proposed the use of a
                    solution of gelatin as a test of the presence of the tannin. In trying the
                    quantity of tannin by Seguin’s process, 480 grains of the bark in coarse powder
                    should be acted on by half a pint of boiling water. The mixture should be
                    frequently stirred, and suffered to stand twenty-four hours; the fluid should
                    then be strained through a linen cloth, and mixed with an equal quantity of
                    solution of gelatin, made by dissolving glue, jelly, or isinglass, in hot water,
                    in the proportion of a drachm of glue or isinglass, or six table-spoonfuls of
                    jelly, to a pint of water. The precipitate should be collected by passing the
                    mixture of the solution and infusion through folds of blotting-paper, and the
                    paper exposed to the air till its contents are quite dry. Every 100 grains of
                    precipitate contains 40 grains of tannin nearly. As, however, some kinds of
                    tannin produce larger precipitates of gelatin than other kinds, and as the
                    composition of tanno-gelatin varies with the strength both of the solution of
                    gelatin and of tannin, this method is not reliable. Sulphate of cinchonin is
                    said to afford a better test; a solution of this, acidulated with a few drops of
                    sulphuric acid, will, it is said, precipitate tannin completely from the
                    solution. LowenthaΓs method, founded on the fact that solutions of tannin in
                    presence of sulphuric acid are readily oxidized by permanganate of potash, is
                    very useful for the comparative determination of the value of different tanning
                    substances. A given weight of tanning material is infused, and the solution is
                    brought up to a definite volume. One half of this measured quantity of tannin
                    solution is mixed with definite quantities of a standard indigo-carmine solution
                    and sulphuric acid, and to this mixture permanganate solution is added from a
                    graduated tube till the colour of the indigo is completely discharged, when both
                    tannin and indigo are oxidised. A parallel experiment is next made with similar
                    measured amounts of indigo and sulphuric acid solutions, but without any tannin
                    infusion. The difference between the quantity of permanganate required to
                    discharge the colour in the two experiments gives the standard for calculating
                    the amount of tannin in the solution to be tested. Another good method of
                    testing the value of tanning material is to digest a piece of dry prepared hide
                    or skin in a known quantity of the infusion, until the whole of the tannin and
                    other matters be separated. The skin is then taken out, slightly washed, dried,
                    and weighed, when the increase of weight is supposed to be the weight of tannin
                    and of the other matters required. An apparatus devised by MM. Muntz and
                    Ramspacker has recently been introduced for facilitating this last test. It
                    consists essentially of a small vessel sufficient to hold a measured quantity of
                    a tanning infusion, the specific gravity of which is carefully ascertained. That
                    vessel is so arranged that strong pressure can be brought to bear on it by means
                    of a screw acting on an india-rubber surface, thereby forcing the liquid through
                    a piece of skin which covers the lower part. The skin absorbs the whole of the
                    tannin during the passage through it of the infusion, and by ascertaining the
                    specific gravity of the escaped liquor the percentage of the tannin materia] in
                    the infusion can be readily determined. This apparatus has been extensively
                    introduced in practice in England and on the Continent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sole Leather or Heavy Leather Tanning.—</hi> The hides of oxen
                    are received in the tan-yard in four different conditions. These are—(1) market
                    or slaughter hides, which, coming direct from local abattoirs, are soft, moist,
                    and covered with dirt and blood; (2) wet salted hides; (3) dry salted hides; and
                    (4) sun-dried or “flint” hides,—the three last forms being the condition in
                    which the imports of foreign hides are made. The first operation in the tannery
                    is to clean the hides, to free them from salt, and to bring the hard dry hides
                    to the uniformly soft flaccid condition in which all market hides are obtained.
                    The treatment at this stage requires skill and attention to prevent the more
                    soluble constituents of the hide from dissolving out in the washing and soaking
                    processes, and also to secure the complete softening of the entire substance,
                    upon which the successful tanning greatly depends. In the case of market hides
                    cleaning and softening are principally effected by washing and soaking in spent
                    limewater, while for dry hides and dry salted hides brine is essential. The
                    softening of these materials is helped and rendered thorough by working them for
                    some time in the stocks (fig. 1) after they have been well soaked. After being
                    thus brought as nearly as possible into a uniform condition, all hides are
                    treated alike. The first operation to which they are subjected is <hi
                    rend="italic">depilation,</hi> which removes, not only the hair, but also the
                    scarf-skin. This is effected variously in different countries. In England the
                    most common plan is to throw the hide or skin into a strong watery ley of slaked
                    lime, with lime in excess. By this, in a few days, more or less according to the
                    proportion of lime present, the hair is easily detached, the hair-sheath having
                    been dissolved. The hair was formerly taken off by making a sour liquor from
                    fermented vegetable matter, in which the hides lay for several days; they were
                    also smoked in a damp state for the same purpose; but both those methods are now
                    abandoned. They are still sometimes, especially on the Continent, sweated, that
                    is, they are laid in heaps and kept wet and warm, a plan which is still adopted
                    in England for skins. In America the sweating is performed cold; the hides are
                    hung up wet in a damp underground cellar, and are kept moist for ten days or a
                    fortnight. In either of these sweating processes incipient putrefaction takes
                    place sooner or later, when the hair and scarf-skin are easily removed; but the
                    fatty matter remains, and in some cases prevents the hide from taking the
                    tan.</p>
                <p>There have been numerous other methods proposed and patented for unhairing skins,
                    few of which have been received with much favour. Among the agents proposed may
                    be mentioned caustic soda, sulphide of sodium and sulphide of calcium, borax,
                    sugar, and charcoal—substances which it is obvious must act in very different
                    manners. Lime and alkaline solutions not only loosen the hair and scarf-skin,
                    but also “plump” the corium or true skin, that is, they swell it and render it
                    consequently porous and more permeable to the tanning solution. Lime further
                    forms with the fatty matter of the flesh side calcareous soap, thus neutralizing
                    the fat which would otherwise interfere with <pb break="no"

                    who work the so-called acid process, plump their hides by the use of sulphuric
                    acid, hanging them six or eight hours in a solution containing - <hi
                    rend="subscript"> g</hi>-⅜- <hi rend="subscript"> 75</hi>-th of acid. The
                    plumping is sometimes done as a preliminary operation, and again others add the
                    acid to the colour pits, or the first pit into which the hides go for the
                    tanning process.</p>
                <p>Among non-acid tanners the plumping of sweat stock in which there is no lime is
                    secured in the weak acid liquors of the colouring and handling pits. In the case
                    of limed stock the hides, at the proper stage, are withdrawn from the pits and
                    stretched over an unhairing beam (fig. 2), when with, a working knife (fig. 3,
                    <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> a workman partly scrapes partly shaves off the hair
                    and scarf-skin. Another workman in a similar way with a fleshing knife (fig. 3,
                    6) removes the fatty compounds and flesh from the flesh side. For these
                    operations several machines have been adapted, working mostly with revolving
                    knives or cutters, under which the hides or skins pass in a fully extended
                    state. Such machines are, however, only applied to the smaller skins. The next
                    step in the preparation of the hide is to remove from it as thoroughly as
                    possible all traces of lime. This is partly accomplished by going over the hide
                    on the beam with a scudding knife, pressing the combined lime and interfibrous
                    matter out of the tissue. For more complete neutralization of lime in the larger
                    hides the influence of the weak acid of the colouring pits is trusted to.
                    Harness hides are washed by some means in pure water, the most convenient and
                    generally adopted method being to place them in the dash wheel (fig. 4), in
                    which they revolve and tumble about whilst fresh water is continually being
                    poured on them within the revolving wheel.</p>
                <p>The hides now come to be trimmed and prepared for tanning in the shape in which
                    they are intended ultimately to be sent into the market. An entire untrimmed
                    hide (fig. 5) is termed a crop; a side is half a crop, the dividing line of the
                    two sides being shown at EF; a butt is the back portion ABCD, and a bend is half
                    a butt ABFE. G, G are belly pieces, and H, H the cheeks, both together being the
                    offal. When the shoulder (the upper part of the butt) is removed, what remains
                    is a short butt.</p>
                <p>The actual tanning now commences, and the operations involved may be divided into
                    a series of three—(1) colouring, (2) handling, and (3) the laying away. The
                    colouring consists in exposing the hides in a series of pits containing oozes
                    which are almost entirely deprived of tannin, but in which some amount of gallic
                    and acetic acids have been developed, and which, moreover, contain a large
                    proportion of the colouring matter extracted from the tanning substances. In
                    these pits (also called suspenders) the hides are suspended over poles laid
                    across the pit, and they are moved daily from one to another of a series of four
                    or six, this stage usually occupying about a week. As the hides are moved
                    forward in the series they are exposed to a liquor containing a small and
                    steadily increasing proportion of tannin, and this, it may be said, holds good
                    till the hide reaches the last lay-away pit, in which the tanning is completed.
                    The objects attained in the colouring pits are the superficial colouring or
                    dyeing of the hide, some amount of plumping from the acids of the ooze, and a
                    dissolving out of remaining traces of lime, principally by the acetic acid to
                    which the hide is exposed. After-colouring, the hides pass on to the handlers or
                    handling pits, a round or series of which may consist of from four to twelve,
                    according to the mode of working. In the handlers the hides are spread out
                    horizontally; and in the first series they are “handled” once a day or more
                    frequently if convenient. The handling consists of lifting the hides out of the
                    pit by means of a tanner’s hook (fig. 6), piling them on the side till they
                    drain, and returning them into the pit, the hide on the top in one handling
                    going to the bottom in the next. This operation is continued throughout the
                    series; only as the hides advance the necessity and advantage of frequent
                    handling decreases, while the strength of the tan liquor in which they are
                    handled increases. The whole handling stage consumes on an average about six
                    weeks. Finally, the hides are carried over into the layers or lay-aways. In
                    these the stock is exposed to the strongest tanning liquors, and between the
                    hides thin layers of the tanning bark or mixture are strewn. The object of this
                    interstratification is to separate the mass of hides so as to secure the more
                    ready permeation of the entire mass by the liquor, and also to feed and
                    strengthen the ooze itself as its tannin is absorbed by the hides. In these
                    layers the hides are allowed to rest for about six weeks, after which the pits
                    are cleared out, charged with fresh ooze, and filled with the hides and tan as
                    before. These processes may be repeated three or four times before the tanning
                    is completed. When the process is deemed complete, each hide, on being taken
                    out, will be found to be converted into leather, and a portion of its gelatin
                    which has been dissolved from its interior is, by combination with a portion of
                    tannin from the strong solution, deposited upon its surfaces, where it is found
                    in the form of a yellow deposit, technically known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >bloom,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pitching,</hi> which disguises the under
                    colour of the leather just as if it were covered with yellow paint. This,
                    prejudice says, must be on its surface, or it is not saleable, but it is so much
                    quality and weight lost to the <pb break="no"

                    leather to be worked off in the dressing and currying operations. By some
                    tanning agents—mimosa, for example—there is little or no bloom deposited.</p>
                <p>The theory of the formation of the bloom is this. As soon as ooze has penetrated
                    into a hide it loses its tanning material, but by capillary attraction is
                    detained; this exhausted ooze acts by maceration on the finer and more soluble
                    interstitial gelatin, and dissolves it. In handling, about one-twelfth of this
                    flows out; the remaining eleven-twelfths accompany the hide into the next
                    stronger solution, of which only one-twelfth is absorbed directly, and a small
                    portion is slowly exchanged by endosmosis and exosmosis. The small portion of
                    strong solution which passes into the pores of the hide contributes to tan the
                    hard fibrous portions not dissolved, and the small portion of weak solution
                    passing out of the hide by exosmosis gives up its dissolved gelatin to the tin
                    of the stronger solution outside to form tannate of gelatin, which partly
                    adheres to the surface as bloom, and partly falls to the bottom of the pit as
                    pitching.</p>
                <p>From the time when the raw ox hide is taken in hand till the leather is fully
                    dried, not less than a year is consumed in the case of the best qualities of
                    sole leather. It was formerly the practice in England, as it still is on the
                    Continent, to tan by the process of <hi rend="italic">stratification,</hi> for
                    which purpose a bed of bark is made upon the bottom of the pit; upon this is
                    laid the hide, then bark, then a hide, and so on until the pit is full; water is
                    sometimes pumped in, and the pit left for some months; it is then emptied, and
                    the same hides returned with fresh bark and water for a few months longer; this
                    is repeated again and again, until the tanning is completed, the time varying
                    from one to four years for heavy leather.</p>
                <p>The devices and processes which have been proposed and to some degree put in
                    operation with the view of shortening the time occupied in tanning are beyond
                    all enumeration. In scarcely any case have time-abridging processes proved
                    successful in practical working, so far as the production of good leather is
                    involved; and now the opinion appears to be completely established that, for the
                    thorough tanning of heavy leather, a slowly operating influence and consequently
                    long time are essential. The devices for the hastening of tanning have for the
                    most part turned upon some plan for forcing the tan liquor into and through the
                    pelt, or for alternate soaking and squeezing of the hides. Among the plans which
                    have been tried on a commercial scale may be enumerated tanning by the
                    application of hydrostatic pressure to force the liquor through the hides, a
                    method which failed simply because the pressure was equal on both sides. The
                    vacuum tanning principle is another which has been extensively tried, only to
                    issue in disappointment. It consists in hanging the hides in a pit or cylinder
                    so constructed that the air can be exhausted by an air pump, after which tan
                    liquors are forced into the vessel, air readmitted, and again withdrawn. Hides,
                    however, loaded with water swell little under diminished atmospheric pressure,
                    and the practical difficulty of procuring and maintaining a vacuum in tan pits
                    is very great. More promising results have been obtained by setting up in tan
                    pits the physical process of endosmosis and exosmosis. This is done by sewing up
                    hides two and two as bags which, being filled with solution differing in
                    specific gravity from the tan liquor in which they are immersed, thereby set up
                    transfusion through the hide. This process failed chiefly through the hardness
                    of the leather it yielded. A plan of sewing hides into bags and suspending them
                    filled with strong tan liquor, which as the fluid exuded was renewed, was also
                    tried for some time. Again, it has been attempted to keep the hide suspended
                    stationary <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> in the pits and move the liquors
                    instead of carrying over hides from one pit into another. A more recent device,
                    which may not yet be fully tested, consists in keeping up the strength of the
                    liquor by a continuous circulation through pipes from the stronger into the
                    weaker infusions. By this system of circulation, instead of the oozes in which
                    hides are immersed becoming weaker and weaker the longer they rest in the
                    liquor, the ooze is kept up at least to its original strength, and it may
                    indeed, if desirable, be increased in proportion as the tannin combines with the
                    hide.</p>
                <p>Heavy hides for sole leather, belting, and similar purposes do not require to
                    undergo any elaborate dressing or currying. When finally removed from the tan
                    pits they are piled grain to grain and flesh to flesh to drain, care being taken
                    that no tan liquor is allowed to lurk in the pile, which is covered over from
                    the light. When sufficiently drained, they are brushed or scoured to free them
                    from adhering impurities, and removed to the drying loft, where, after lightly
                    rubbing over with oil, they <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> are hung on poles to
                    dry. In the loft steam-heated pipes keep a dry atmosphere during winter, and
                    enable the attendants to regulate and control the drying of the leather. The
                    leather when dried in this condition is rough tanned, and for finishing as sole
                    leather it has to be struck out or “pinned” and compressed by rolling. For
                    striking or pinning by hand the hide is dampened with water, thrown over a beam,
                    and worked all over the grain side with a striking pin (fig. 3, c). This
                    operation smoothes and levels the grain, removes smaller wrinkles, and to some
                    extent compresses and solidifies the leather. Striking machines (fig. 7) are now
                    very generally used for the operation.</p>
                <p>These consist of a drum or cylinder having a parallel series of projecting
                    knives, or plates of gun-metal, set angularly across its surface. Underneath the
                    drum is a brass bed, fixed on a yielding cushion, which can be pressed up or
                    eased by means of a foot lever, according as the leather operated on is thick or
                    thin. The drum is made to revolve at a very rapid rate, the blunt edges and
                    external angles of the knives thereby striking the surface of the leather with
                    great violence, and thus the grain is struck out, smoothed, and compressed in a
                    very rapid and efficient manner. Finally’, the leather is rolled and compressed
                    on a level zinc-lined wooden bed by a heavy hand roller, such as is shown in fig
                    8, or on the platform of one of the numerous forms of machines designed for that
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>The yield of leather from a given weight of dry hide varies very much according
                    to the different styles of tannage and materials used. As a mean outcome, it may
                    be said that 100 lb of green hide, tanned with from 300 to 400 of oak bark, will
                    yield 40 to 50 lb of leather; 100 lb of green hide, however, when deprived of
                    hair, flesh, and moisture, will weigh only 18 fi&gt;, and, taking 100 lb of
                    dryhide, which, fleshed and unhaired, weighs 85 lb, the yield of leather will be
                    from 180 to 200 lb according to tannage.</p>

                <p>The percentage of tannin alone absorbed from different tanning agents has been
                    found to be for hemlock, 64 ’ 2; pine, 90 ’ 8; chestnut, 85 <hi

                    sold by weight, are subject to adulteration, and have fictitious weight given
                    them without any benefit to the material, but rather the opposite, by
                    impregnation with such salts as sulphate of magnesium or chloride of barium, or
                    with glucose, the last being the most frequently used adulterant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Upper Leather.—</hi> Under this head are included the thin,
                    soft, and pliable leathers which find their principal, but by no means
                    exclusive, application in making the uppers of boots and shoes, which may be
                    taken as the type of a class of leathers. Upper leathers are made from such
                    hides and skins as East Indian kips, light cow hide, calf skins, horse hide, and
                    also from split heavy hides. The preparatory dressing of such skins, and the
                    tanning operations, do not differ essentially from those already described. In
                    proportion to the thinness of the skin treated, the processes are more rapidly
                    finished and less complex, while at the same time the skins absorb a large
                    percentage of tanning extract. The lime used for unhairing must be removed in
                    the preliminary stage, with greater thoroughness than is essential in the case
                    of hides for sole leather; and for this purpose the skins are washed in the dash
                    wheel, and undergo a process of <hi rend="italic">hating</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">grainering.</hi> A quantity of pigeon’s dung is dissolved in
                    water, and in this the hides are steeped for a week or ten days, with occasional
                    removals and strikings. The theory of this process is obscure, but it has been
                    explained on the supposition that the uric acid of the dung removes the excess
                    of lime, and that the ammonia generated by the putrefaction of the mixture tends
                    to form an ammoniacal soap with any remaining fat of the hide; but as the
                    gelatin of the hide exists in two states,—one the principal, hard, or fibrous
                    portion, and the other (which is more soluble) contained between the fibres, and
                    more affected by agents and putrefaction—this softer portion is removed by
                    grainering, and the leather, when tanned, is light and porous, and more readily
                    permeable by water. Small skins are not fished one by one out of the colouring
                    and handling pits, but the whole contents of the pits are tied together, so that
                    when the upper skin is seized it is thrown over a sparred cylinder erected
                    between each pair of pits, and, the wheel being set in motion, the entire string
                    of skins comes up over its surface and is passed into the neighbouring pit with
                    the utmost rapidity. Such an apparatus is used for handling all small pieces and
                    fragments, as for example the cheeks and bellies of heavy hides.</p>
                <p>The time occupied in tanning an upper leather, say an East Indian kip, with a
                    mixed mimosa, sumach, valonia, and terra tannage, may be about three months. In
                    the fine tanning of calf and kip skins on the Continent, for which French and
                    German tanners are famous, the duration of the operation may be from four to
                    eight months.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Splitting.—</hi> In the preparation of most kinds of upper
                    leather, the hides are split into two, or three, and sometimes more portions. In
                    the case of a single split the portions form a grain and flesh side; when three
                    sections, or slices, are made they result in grain, middle, and flesh splits.
                    Some tanners split their hides in the green condition, others after colouring,
                    and in many instances the splitting is done, after the leather is fully tanned,
                    by the currier, as a regular part of his operations, this being particularly the

                    foreign origin. Splitting machines will be alluded to in connexion with the
                    operations of currying.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Currying.—</hi> Leather as it leaves the tannery is a
                    comparatively rough, harsh, and intractable substance, and the duty of the
                    currier is to dress and otherwise fit it for the use of the shoemaker,
                    coachbuilder, saddler, and the numerous other tradesmen who work in it. The
                    currier has to smooth the leather, so to pare it down as to reduce inequalities
                    of thickness, to impregnate it with fatty matter in order to render it soft and
                    pliable, and to give it such a surface-dressing, colour, and finish as will
                    please the eye and suit the purposes of its consumers. The operations of
                    currying are complex and varied, each particular class of goods receiving a
                    treatment in many respects peculiar to itself. The fact also that machinery is
                    used by some curriers for nearly every mechanical operation, while others adhere
                    to the old manual system, renders it almost impossible to give in brief an
                    outline of operations which will be consistent with the practice of any
                    considerable number of curriers.</p>
                <p>Regarding currying as principally a handicraft, the following may be taken as an
                    outline of the range of operations for the preparation of a waxed calf leather,
                    the commonest form of upper leather in use. The leather is first made pliable by
                    soaking in water, after which it is shaved on the flesh side, and a tolerably
                    smooth surface is produced. This operation is carried on at a beam, or strong
                    frame of wood, supporting a stout plank faced with lignum vitae, and set
                    vertically, or nearly so. The knife (fig. 9) is a double-edged rectangular
                    blade, about 12 inches by 5 inches, with a straight handle at one end, and a
                    cross handle at the other in the plane of the blade. The edges of this knife are
                    first made very keen, and are then turned over so as to form a wire edge by
                    means of the thicker of the two straight steel tools shown in fig. 10. The wire
                    edge is preserved by drawing the thinner steel tool along the interior angle of
                    the wire edge from time to time as required, for which purpose the man holds
                    this smaller tool between his fingers, together with the beamknife. The skin
                    being thrown over the plank, the man presses his body against it, and leaning
                    over the top holds the knife by its two handles, almost perpendicularly to the
                    leather, and proceeds to shave it, shifting it from time to time so as to bring
                    all the parts under the action of the knife, and frequently passing a fold
                    between his fingers to test the progress of his work. The skin is then placed in
                    hot water, and removed to a mahogany or stone table, to which the wet flesh side
                    adheres, and is worked with a tool called a stretching-iron, or slicker S (fig.
                    10), consisting of a flat, rectangular piece of iron, copper, or smooth hard
                    stone, fixed in a handle. With this tool a man scrapes the surface of the skin,
                    exerting a strong pressure with both hands, and dashing water upon it from time
                    to time, by which means lumps and inequalities are made to disappear, the
                    leather is equalized and extended, and the bloom is brought to the surface. The
                    superfluous moisture and the superficial bloom are now <hi rend="italic"
                    >slicked</hi> out, and a stuffing, or <hi rend="italic">dubbing,</hi> of cod oil
                    and tallow is rubbed into both sides of the skin, but chiefly the flesh side, by
                    means of a brush, or with the woolly side of a piece of sheep skin. The skin is
                    now dried in a loft, and, as the water only evaporates, the dubbing sinks into
                    the pores. When dry enough for the <pb break="no"

                    >boarded,</hi> or worked with a graining board or pommel C (fig. 10), the effect
                    of which is to bring up the <hi rend="italic">grain,</hi> or give a granular
                    appearance to the leather, and also to make it supple. The pommel is a piece of
                    hard wood, grooved like a crimping-board, and attached to the hand by means of a
                    strap, whence the word pommel, from the French <hi rend="italic">paumelle,</hi>
                    or palm of the hand. The leather passes through various manipulations, each
                    having its distinct name; thus <hi rend="italic">graining</hi> consists in
                    folding the skin with the grain sides in contact, and rubbing strongly on the
                    flesh side; <hi rend="italic">bruising,</hi> or rubbing the extended skin on the
                    grain side; <hi rend="italic">τvhiteniηg,</hi> or passing a knife with a very
                    fine edge over the skin at the beam, so as to clean the flesh side preparatory
                    to <hi rend="italic">waxing,</hi> which is done just before the skins are sold;
                    for at this point the currier stores his skins, as they can be kept best in the
                    state of <hi rend="italic">finished russet,</hi> as it is called, previous to
                    waxing. Waxing consists of two parts: the first is the laying on the <hi
                    rend="italic">colour,</hi> or blacking of oil, lampblack, and tallow, which is
                    well rubbed in on the flesh side with a hard brush; then, secondly, the skin is
                    black-sized with stiff size and tallow, laid on with a sponge or a soft brush,
                    and thoroughly rubbed with a glass slicker, a finishing gloss being given with a
                    little thin size. The curried skin is now said to be <hi rend="italic">black on
                    the flesh,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ivaxed,</hi> in which state it is used for
                    the upper leathers of men’s boots and shoes. In the case of any of the numerous
                    varieties of grained leather which are blackened and dressed on the grain side,
                    the finishing operations are different. These are hard dried after slicking, and
                    the operation of stuffing or dubbing is omitted. They are grained in the dry
                    state, often by machinery, then boarded to soften them, and next blackened on
                    the grain side with a solution of copperas. The flesh side is whitened or <hi
                    rend="italic">fluffed</hi> and the grain is treated with sweet oil or some
                    similar oil, and finally glazed with a thin solution of gelatin or of
                    shellac.</p>
                <p>For almost every operation in currying efficient machinery has now been adapted,
                    the use of λvhich not only modifies the operations of the currier, but also
                    enables him to split up hides and to finish his splits as imitations of any kind
                    of leather he may desire to copy. In machine currying the tanned hides, duly
                    damped, are struck out in a “stoning” machine. It consists of a strong
                    oscillating armor bar having a blunt steel blade fixed on its end, which works
                    back and forward over a concave bed on which the hide is laid, and which by its
                    scraping and striking action on the softened leather smooths and equalizes the
                    grain, and produces a compact uniform surface on it. From the stoning machine
                    the hide may pass to the splitting machine, of which th⅛re are numerous forms,
                    the American union splitter with a fixed knife being the oldest and best known.
                    A much more perfect machine, however, is the belt or band splitting machine. In
                    this machine (fig. 11) the knife or cutter <hi rend="italic">α</hi> is an
                    endless band of steel which revolves at considerable speed with its cutting
                    edges close to the sides of a pair of rollers through which the leather is fed
                    and pressed against the knife. The lower of these rollers is made of short
                    segments or rings, each separately capable of yielding to some extent so as to
                    accommodate itself to the inequal thicknesses of various parts of a hide. The
                    thickness of the slice of leather to be cut is gauged to the utmost minuteness
                    by means of the hand screws <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi> which raise or lower
                    the upper roller. The knife edge of the cutter is kept keen by rubbing against
                    revolving emery.wheels c as it passes round. So delicately can this machine
                    effect its work that slices of leather uniform throughout and as thin as paper
                    can be easily prepared by it, and with its help it is no uncommon practice to
                    divide a comparatively thin East Indian kip into three useful splits. Another
                    machine now largely used by curriers is the scouring machine (fig. 12), a level
                    table or platform freely movable in all directions, having mounted over it a
                    reciprocating frame in which are fixed brushes and pieces of slate or thin
                    stone. These, with a small jet of water, scour and brush the entire surface of
                    the leather lying on the platform, effectually scouring out bloom and all
                    soluble impurities. Other machines are washing and stuffing drums and whitening
                    machines. In the latter the leather is pared and equalized by the cutting action
                    of a small cylinder armed with oblique cutting edges. The cylinder, moved to and
                    fro with a pendulum motion, and revolving at the enormous rate of from 2000 to
                    3000 revolutions per minute, pares and shaves the leather on the same principle
                    as the lawn-mower cuts grass. Embossing or graining cylinders, boarding
                    cylinders, glassing machines, and emery wheels for fluffing the flesh side of
                    levant leather are also among the mechanical adaptations for currier’s use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Patent or Enamelled Leather.—</hi> Leather finished with a
                    brilliant, smooth, and glossy surface, used for dress boots and shoes, dress
                    belts, and fine harness, is known under a variety of names, as lacquered,
                    varnished, japanned, and enamelled leather, &amp;c. Such leather is finished
                    principally from tanned calf skins, and in more recent times from seal, goat,
                    and sheep skins, but lighter ox hides and horse leather are also japanned for
                    special purposes. The finishing of leather in this style involves two
                    processes—(1) the grounding or preparation of a smooth surface, and (2) the
                    varnishing and polishing. The grounding material used by French and German
                    finishers, who greatly excel in the production of such leather, consists of a
                    thick syrupy mixture of lamp-black with a varnish of boiled linseed oil, umber,
                    and litharge. This is uniformly spread over the surface of the leather, which
                    has been previously stretched and tacked on a wooden frame. The first coating is
                    dried in the air, then exposed in the japanning stove to a heat of about 170°
                    Fahr., and afterwards rubbed smooth with pumice stone. This process of coating,
                    drying, and smoothing is repeated several times, and the leather is next
                    varnished with a compound of boiled oil, Berlin blue, litharge, and some dryer,
                    thinned either with oil of turpentine or petroleum spirit. Two or three thin
                    coatings of such varnish are given, the surface being carefully polished after
                    each; but the composition of the varnishes, &amp;c., and the number of coatings
                    applied, vary much in the hands of different manufacturers. Coloured enamel
                    leathers receive two preliminary coatings of oil, rosin, and spirit of
                    turpentine, which are sun-dried ’ they are then brought up <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n405/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0405-0388"/> with several coatings of oil, varnish, and the
                    special colouring substance, and finished with a thin coat of copal varnish.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Seal Leather.—</hi> The tanning of seal skins is now an
                    important department of the leather industry of the United Kingdom, in which
                    this branch has been specially developed. The skins form one of the items of the
                    whaling industry, which principally centres in Dundee, and at that port, as well
                    as at Hull and Peterhead, they are received in large quantities from the arctic
                    regions. A considerable number are also imported at Greenock from the coast of
                    Newfoundland. The skin of these seals is light but exceedingly close in texture,
                    and yields a very strong tough leather. The skins are prepared, split, and
                    tanned in the same way as other light leathers, tanning with mixed oak bark and
                    sumach usually occupying about six weeks. Seal leather is generally finished on
                    the grain side as “levant” seal with a large coarse grain, and in that form it
                    is principally used by bootmakers. A proportion of seal leather is finished as
                    enamel and japanned leather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russia Leather</hi> was originally, as the name implies, a
                    speciality of Russia, where it was made from the hides of young cattle, and
                    dressed either a brownish-red or a black colour, for upper leather or for
                    bookbinding, dressing cases, purses, and similar objects. Russia leather is now
                    made throughout both Europe and America, the best qualities being obtained from
                    Austria. Horse hides, calf, goat, and sheep skins, and even splits, are now
                    finished as russia leather; but most of these are decidedly inferior in quality,
                    and, as they are merely treated with birch bark oil to give them something of
                    the odour by which an ordinary observer recognizes russia leather, they scarcely
                    deserve the name under which they pass. Genuine russia leather is tanned like
                    other light leathers, but properly in willow bark, although poplar and spruce
                    fir barks also are used. After tanning, scouring, and setting out, the hides are
                    treated on the flesh side with an empyreumatic oil obtained by the dry
                    distillation of birch tree bark and buds, to which the peculiar smell of the
                    leather is due. The red colour commonly seen in russia leather is given by
                    dyeing wi⅛h a preparation of brazil wood, rubbed over the grain side with a
                    brush or sponge. Black-coloured russia leather owes its colour to repeated
                    stainings with acetate of iron. The leather of genuine quality is very
                    water-tight and strong, and, owing to its impregnation with empyreumatic oil, it
                    wards off the attacks of insects.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Morocco and Thin Leathers.—</hi> Originally morocco leather was
                    a product of the Levant, Turkey, and the Mediterranean coast of Africa, where
                    the leather was made from goat skins tanned with sumach, and finished either
                    black or various bright colours. Such leather was peculiarly clear in colour,
                    elastic, and soft, yet firm and fine in grain and texture, and has long been
                    much prized for bindings, being the material in which most of the artistic work
                    of the 16th century binders was executed. Now, in addition to genuine morocco
                    made from goat skins, we have imitation or French moroccos, for which split calf
                    and especially sheep skins are employed, and it may be said that, as the
                    appearance of morocco is the result of the style of graining, which can be
                    artificially produced on any leather, and of the finish, morocco can be made
                    from all varieties of thin leather. The Germans distinguish between saffian and
                    morocco, including under the former term leather tanned with sumach, and dyed
                    bright colours without previous stuffing with fats, while as morocco proper they
                    reckon leather which may be prepared with mixed tannage, is stuffed, and
                    afterwards is finished black. Saffians are, according to this classification,
                    the leathers principally used for bindings and fancy purposes, morocco being
                    more especially devoted to shoe work.</p>
                <p>The preparation of skins for morocco leathers must be conducted with much care.
                    The skins, being usually hard and dry when received, are first soaked and
                    softened by milling in the stocks and working on the tanner’s beam. They are
                    next limed, unhaired, tleshed, and trimmed in effect as already described in the
                    section on sole leather, and they are pured or bated in a preparation of dog’s
                    dung. After undergoing the influence of this preparation, the skins are washed
                    and slated with a knife-edged piece of slate to remove from their surface fine
                    hairs and adhering dirt, and then they are put into a drench of bran and water,
                    heated to about 185° Fahr., after which they ought to be perfectly free from
                    deleterious impurities and ready for tanning. Several processes are adopted in
                    tanning, but that most approved is based on the original Eastern practice, which
                    consists in first treating the skins with an already used sumach infusion. Next
                    they are, in pairs, sewed up as bags, grain side outwards, and these bags are
                    filled with concentrated sumach liquor and a proportion of powdered sumach, and
                    by the exudation of the liquor through the skins, partly aided by pressure, the
                    tanning is quickly completed. After ripping out, the skins arc thrown into vats
                    containing sumach liquor, to tan the edges and shanks, which are not reached by
                    the liquor in the bags. The fully tanned skins are now struck out on the beam
                    with the striking pin, and hung in the loft to dry, when they are ready for the
                    finishing processes. A large proportion of the goat skins imported into western
                    Europe from the East Indies, whence they are exported in enormous quantities,
                    are received in the fully tanned condition, and ready for the morocco finishing
                    operations, after a short treatment with sumach liquor. For finishing, the
                    leather is first damped in soap-suds, and shaved on the flesh side to equalize
                    the thickness of the leather, and next on a table worked over repeatedly with
                    slickers, which renders the skin firm, smooth, and uniform. The skins are next
                    blacked on the grain side with a solution of acetate of iron, and from this
                    point the methods of finish diverge in an endless manner according as it is
                    desired to finish the leather as “kid,” “levant,” “peebled,” “bright,” or
                    “dull,” &lt;fcc. The bright-coloured moroccos are dyed in two different methods,
                    the dyeing being done as a preliminary to the finishing operations. In the case
                    of genuine moroccos, the skins are dipped and drawn through small troughs
                    containing the dye liquor; two skins are taken, placed flesh side to flesh side,
                    and so worked through the liquor by hand, the operation being repeated as often
                    as necessary to bring up the requisite strength of colour. Imitation morocco, on
                    the other hand, is usually dyed by stretching the skins on a table and brushing
                    the dye liquor over the grain side. After the dyeing the skins are shaved and
                    dressed, the dyed surface is rubbed over with an emulsion of white of egg,
                    linseed oil, and dye liquor, and afterwards grained and glassed, or finished
                    smooth and glossy, according to the purpose for which the leather may be
                    required. In recent times aniline colours have been very largely employed in the
                    dyeing of all bright leathers.</p>
                <p>In the tanning of sheep and lamb skins the general operations outlined above in
                    the case of goat skins are necessary. Previous to tanning, the prepared skins
                    are submitted to hydraulic pressure, to expel the oleaginous matter with which
                    sheep skins are richly impregnated. Sheep skins tanned, generally with beech
                    bark in the United Kingdom, and uncoloured are known as <hi rend="italic"
                    >basils. Roan Leather</hi> is sheep skin tanned in sumach, coloured and dressed
                    throughout in the same manner as imitation morocco, excepting that it is
                    finished smooth and glassed. <hi rend="italic">Skivers</hi> are split grain
                    sides of sheep skins tanned in sumach, and similarly finished,—the flesh split
                    being shamoyed for inferior qualities of shamoy or wash leather. Skivers from
                    their thinness are quickly tanned through in a sumach <pb break="no"

                    as is most commonly the case with entire sheep and goat skins. The splitting
                    machine used for split sheep skins has two rollers, the lower one of gun-metal
                    and solid, and the upper made of gun-metal rings, while between the two rollers,
                    and nearly in contact, is the edge of the sharp knife, to which an oscillating
                    movement is given by a crank. When a skin is introduced between the two rollers,
                    it is dragged through against the knife edge and divided, the solid lower roller
                    supporting the membrane, while the upper one, being capable of moving through a
                    small space by means of its rings, adjusts itself to inequalities in the
                    membrane; where this is thin the rings become depressed, and where it is thick
                    they rise up, so that no part escapes the action of the knife. Skivers are
                    finished white, or in colours in variously lined or diced patterns, and in
                    imitation grain, and are principally employed for hat and other linings and
                    various purposes in which they meet little strain or tear and wear.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Danish Leather</hi> is tanned sheep and lamb skins principally,
                    but goat and kid skins also are used. The tanning medium is willow bark, and the
                    leather, bright in colour and highly elastic, is used for strong gloves. The
                    same name is also applied to tawed lamb skins, dressed and finished on the flesh
                    side.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alligator Leather.—</hi> For a number of years leather tanned
                    from the skins of the Mississippi alligator has formed an item in the trade
                    lists of the United States, and it is now also being sought after in the
                    European markets. The industry was started about the year 1860, and centred
                    first at New Orleans, the raw skins being obtained from the rivers of Louisiana.
                    Now, however, the skins are principally procured in Florida, and the tanning is
                    a considerable industry in Jacksonville. The parts of the skin useful for
                    leather making are the belly and flanks, and these portions alone are steeped in
                    lime to preserve them for the tanner. Alligator leather, which has a scaly
                    surface, is useful for fancy boot and shoe making, and for many small articles
                    such as cigar cases, pocket books, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Kangaroo Leather.—</hi> The Australian colonists have turned
                    their attention to the preparation of leather from the skins of the kangaroo,
                    wallaby, and other marsupials native to their continent. These skins are both
                    tanned and tawed, the principal tanning agent being the mimosa bark, which
                    abounds in Australia. The leathers they yield are of excellent quality, strong,
                    and elastic, and rival in texture and appearance the kid of European tanners.
                    The circumstance that the animals exist only in the wild state renders this a
                    limited and insecure source of leather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tαwcd Leather.</hi></p>
                <p>Under the term tawing is embraced the preparation of leather by the action of
                    mineral substances on hides and skins. In the process of tawing the substance
                    principally employed is alum or some of the simple aluminous salts, although
                    many other inorganic salts have been proposed, some of which have given
                    considerable promise of practical success. The system of tawing is principally
                    applied to thin and light skins of sheep, lambs, kids, and goats, although in
                    former times much heavy leather was tawed for military belts, heavy gloves,
                    machine belts, &amp;c., for most of which purposes, however, sumach-tanned or
                    similar leathers are now found more applicable and durable. The products
                    obtained by tawing are of a pure white colour, whence the name white leather is
                    frequently applied to goods of this class. The most important departments of the
                    tawing industry are the calf kid manufactures for boots and shoes, and glove kid
                    or glacé leather tawing, the products of which are exclusively devoted to glove
                    making. A large number of white tawed sheep skins are also used by druggists and
                    perfumers as tie-over leather for bottles, and for linings by bootmakers,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calf Kid.—</hi> The various steps of preparation through which
                    the light skins suitable for this manufacture pass, in respect of softening,
                    liming, unhairing, puring, and drenching, are similar to the process by which
                    morocco skins are prepared for tanning. The tawing itself is accomplished in a
                    drum or cylinder the same as the currier’s stuffing wheel, into which is
                    introduced for one hundred average skins a mixture consisting of 20 lb of alum,
                    9 lb salt, 40 lb flour, 250 eggs (or about 1⅛ gallons of egg yolk), g pint of
                    olive oil, and 12 to 16 gallons of water. In this mixture, at a temperature of
                    not more than 100 Fahr., the skins are worked for about forty minutes, by which
                    action the tawing is completed. After the withdrawal from the drum the skins are
                    allowed to drain, dried rapidly by artificial heat, damped, staked out by
                    drawing them over a blunt steel tool, and then wetted and shaved down on the
                    beam to the required thickness. Next they receive, if necessary, a second
                    treatment with the tawing mixture. The dyeing or colouring follows, which in the
                    case of calf kid is always black, the colour consisting of a compound of
                    bichromate of potash, stale urine, logwood extract, and copperas. It is applied
                    either by brushes on a table, or by dyeing the leather in small vats as in the
                    parallel case of morocco leather. The dyed leather is washed with pure water,
                    dried, grounded with a curious moon knife, stretched in all directions, ironed,
                    and oiled on the flesh side with a mixture of oil, wax, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Glove Kid.—</hi><hi rend="italic">lu</hi> the preparation of
                    kid leather for gloves the tender skins of young kids alone are used for the
                    best qualities, but for a large proportion of such leather young lamb skins are
                    also tawed. The genuine kid leather is for the most part produced in France,
                    specially at Annonay and Paris, while lamb kid is more particularly a product of
                    Germany, Austria, and Denmark. In all stages of the preparation of this leather
                    the utmost care and attention are requisite, and it is specially of consequence
                    that the operations preparatory to tawing should receive thorough attention. The
                    unhairing is best effected by steeping the skins in a mixture of lime and
                    orpiment, and, while the general sequence of unhairing, fleshing, bating with
                    dog’s dung, scudding, washing, and treating with the bran drench is the same as
                    in the case of other skins, much more attention is bestowed on each stage in
                    order to maintain the smoothness of grain, and to obtain a thoroughly clean
                    elastic pelt, than is absolutely needful for any other variety of leather. The
                    tawing mixture consists for each 100 lb of skins of about 28 lb of flour, 3 ⅛ lb
                    of alum, nearly 1 lb of common salt, and 230 eggs. These substances are made
                    into the consistency of a cream with water, and placed either in a vat or in a
                    revolving drum. In the former case, the skins are trodden with the feet, while
                    in the latter they are tumbled about. The tawed skins are hung over poles, grain
                    side inwards, and dried rapidly; when hard dry they are heaped in a damp place
                    to soften a little, then damped by passing them through water, next trodden out
                    by foot on a ridged or barred floor, staked or stretched over a blunt knife,
                    partly dried, and again staked and dried thoroughly. For dyeing, the skins are
                    first washed out in warm water to free them from superfluous alum, and then
                    again “fed” with yolk of eggs and salt. For bright colours such as soft greys,
                    lavenders, and yellows, the skins are plunged into small dye vats of the proper
                    dye colours; but for all the darker colours the skins are stretched out on a
                    table and the dye stuffs applied with a brash. In the latter case the leather is
                    first grounded with some alkaline solution, then dyed mostly with logwood,
                    brazil wood, fustic, Prussian berries, or preparations of indigo,—aniline
                    colours being now little used for glove dyeing. The dye is mordanted by a wash
                    of the sulphate of either zinc, copper, or iron, which operation also clears and
                    develops the colour. Alter dyeing it only remains to free the leather from
                    superfluous moisture, dry it, and then with slight damping stake or stretch it
                    out once or twice, which finishes the preparation of this valuable class of
                    leather.</p>

                    contains, is supposed to facilitate the absorption of the alumina and thus
                    hasten the tawing.</p>

                    shamoyed. In the preparation of this leather it was formerly the practice to
                    shave off the hair with a sharp knife, but now the hides are unhaired either by
                    sweating or liming. After tawing with alum and salt the leather is stuffed by
                    first heating it over a charcoal fire and impregnating the hot leather with
                    tallow, or, as is now common, by working it in a drum with a hot mixture of cod
                    oil and tallow. This leather, being comparatively cheap, is much used on the
                    Continent for common saddlery purposes, for which it is blackened, and it is
                    also serviceable for machinery belts.</p>
                <p>A leather has been patented by Professor Knapp, in which the active tanning or
                    tawing principle is a basic salt of the cxide of iron. It was intended
                    principally for sole leather, but it does not appear to have met with practical
                    success, and its manufacture is understood to have been abandoned.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Heinzerlinfs Chrome-tanned Leather.—</hi> Quite recently a
                    large amount of attention has been devoted to a system of tanning or tawing by
                    means of chromium compounds patented by Dr Heinzerling, a German chemist. The
                    oxidizing power of chromate salts, and the deoxidizing effect which organic
                    matter has upon these salts, have long been recognized, and the knowledge of
                    this action and counter-action has led to many unsuccessful attempts, in the
                    past, to use chromates in tanning. It is claimed, however, that the difficulties
                    have been overcome by Dr Heinzerling ’ s process, which consists practically in
                    the use of bichromate of potash, chloride of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n407/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0407-0390"/> potassium or chloride of sodium, and sulphate of
                    alumina. These are mixed together in one large stock tank, from which is drawn
                    hy means of a system of piping communicating with each pit the quantity required
                    to make the necessary strength of liquor; this at first, as in tanning by bark,
                    is very weak, but is strengthened systematically every few days according to the
                    thickness of the hides being tanned. The quantity of chromic acid used
                    ordinarily amounts to from about 2⅛ to 5 per cent, of the weight of leather
                    produced. The price of bichrome at present is 5∣d. per lb, so that 100 lb weight
                    of leather would cost for this agent from Is. to 3s.</p>
                <p>Light skins such as sheep skins and calf skins are tanned in less than a week, ox
                    and buffalo hides in about a fortnight, and walrus hides, over 2 inches thick,
                    in six weeks. After being tanned, the hides, which are at this stage of a
                    yellowish tint like sumach-tanned leather, are dipped in chloride of barium,
                    which converts the soluble chromates on the surface into the insoluble chromate
                    of barium. If any particular shade of colour is desired it is then put on, and
                    in general hides are coloured like ordinary leather. After being coloured the
                    leather is allowed to get nearly dry, when it is immersed in pure paraffin wax
                    and resin dissolved together in certain proportions. These materials, with
                    chloride of potassium or chloride of sodium and sulphate of alumina, go to give
                    the necessary substance, weight, and waterproofing to the leather. The hides are
                    afterwards dried and brushed clean by brushing machinery. Thus finished, the
                    leather differs very little in appearance from ordinary leather.</p>
                <p>Dr Heinzerling claims as the meritorious and original features of his process the
                    combined use of chromate compounds and fatty matters. The stuffing with fat or
                    paraffin of chrome leather, he maintains, in the first place, reduces chromic
                    acid to chrome oxide, and secondly the oxygen thus liberated in the substance of
                    the hide oxidizes the fatty into acid bodies, which, uniting with the chrome
                    oxide, form a third insoluble compound mordanted in the fibre of the leather,
                    rendering it at once supple and waterproof.</p>
                <p>The leather has been reported on by Mr David Kirkcaldy, London, as considerably
                    stronger than the best bark-tanned leather he was able to procure. After
                    steeping samples of it in cold water six days it has been found that the total
                    quantity of -tanning material extracted amounted to from Ό14 to '135 per cent.,
                    while first-class bark-tanned leather similarly treated yielded 6 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 79 per cent. By boiling chrome leather in water for
                    half an hour, the loss ranged from ’ 005 to ’ 054 per cent.</p>
                <p>The process seems to offer the means of utilizing classes of hides, such as sheep
                    skins, and very heavy hides, as those of the walrus, hippopotamus, &amp;c., in a
                    way which has not hitherto been found practicable by other processes. Sheep
                    skins in chrome-tanning do not require to be pured and freed from their
                    oleaginous constituents, and when finished by this process arc no longer porous,
                    but become waterproof. They can be shaved and whitened like calf skins, and may
                    be used for shoe purposes.</p>
                <p>The Heinzerling process is at work in various localities throughout Germany. For
                    the United Kingdom and British colonies the patent rights have been acquired by
                    the Eglinton Chemical Company of Glasgow, who, as manufacturers of bichromate of
                    potash, have an indirect interest in the development of the system. Although the
                    method has yet scarcely passed the critical stage of practical experiment, the
                    products appear to be gaining the favour of men of experience; and, should the
                    system meet the expectation of its originator and promoters, it cannot in the
                    end fail greatly to cheapen many useful classes of leather.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Shamoy or Oil Leather.</hi></p>
                <p>The process of preparing leather by impregnating hides and skins with oil is
                    probably the oldest system of leather manufacture. It is that which in earlier
                    times was most largely followed, and among rude and semi-civilized people it is
                    still commonly practised. Notwithstanding this, well-shamoyed leather requires
                    the exercise of much care and numerous manipulative processes. Hides and skins
                    of all classes are prepared by shamoying; but sheep, goat, deer, antelope, and
                    small calf skin are those usually treated, an enormous number of flesh splits of
                    sheep being shamoyed for common purposes. The extensive employment of deer skins
                    in shamoying gives the product the name of buck or doe leather, and from the use
                    of the chamois skin of the Alps is derived the name of the process chamois or
                    shamoy, while from the fact that it maybe easily washed like cloth it is called
                    wash leather. In former times a large number of ox hides were shamoyed, but now
                    that is little practised.</p>
                <p>Skins for shamoying are in the preliminary stages treated almost as for ordinary
                    tanning; but, beyond unhairing, the surface of the grain is shaved off in all
                    except the small thin skins. They are afterwards treated with fresh lime
                    solution, and repeatedly washed to bring the pelt to somewhat open and porous
                    condition, drenched with bran to remove all lime, and rinsed in an acid liquor.
                    The skins are next staked out and taken to the fulling machine or stocks, where,
                    after being nibbed over individually with fish oil, they are hammered for about
                    two hours to force the oil into the substance of the skin. They are then
                    stretched, hung up for some time, again oiled, and fulled; and these operations
                    may be repeated from six to twelve times according to the thickness of the skins
                    treated. After thorough impregnation the skins are dried, then heaped, up in a
                    heated room, where a process of oxidation is quickly set up. So soon as the
                    skins assume a yellow colour and give off a peculiar odour, not at all like fish
                    oil, the process is complete and the fermentation is stopped. It is now found
                    that about one-half of the oil is oxidized within the skin and combined with the
                    tissue to form leather, while the remainder is present only in the condition of
                    mechanical impregnation. This uncombined oil is washed out with a warm potash
                    solution, and the fat so recovered, known as <hi rend="italic">degras,</hi>
                    forms a valuable material for the dressing of common leather by curriers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parchment, Vellum, and Shagreen.</hi></p>
                <p>These substances, properly speaking, do not come under the heading of leather at
                    all, seeing they are neither tanned nor tawed, but simply are dressed skins
                    dried and prepared for their peculiar uses. Parchment is made from calf, goat,
                    sheep, ass, and swine skins by the unhairing and dressing processes through
                    which all skins pass preparatory to tanning. When they are thoroughly' scudded
                    and fleshed, the skins are stretched tightly in every direction over a frame,
                    and in that condition shaved and equalized on both sides with the currier’s
                    knife. After drying, the skins are ready for use as drum leather and for the
                    other ordinary applications of parchment. The common kinds of vellum are made
                    from sheepskin splits, of which two may be obtained from a single skin. To
                    prepare these for use, the splits are, after stretching and drying, repeatedly
                    nibbed over with powdered chalk and powdered stone to raise the fine even
                    velvety surface peculiar to vellum. Common shagreen consists of the skins of
                    various species of sharks and rays prepared in a similar manner to parchment;
                    and Persian shagreen is a kind of tawed parchment with an artificial grain
                    embossed in it, by pressing into the substance while in a damp condition the
                    small round seeds of a species of <hi rend="italic">Chenopodium.</hi> Shagreen
                    is frequently dyed in bright colours, and used for ornamenting the surfaces of
                    small articles, and the handles of daggers, swords, &amp;c.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Commerce and Statistics.</hi></p>
                <p>It is quite impossible to form any adequate estimate of the extent and value of
                    such a trade as that in leather. The raw materials are obtained, in almost equal
                    abundance, throughout the civilized world, and the manufacturing operations are,
                    to a greater or less degree, carried on in every centre of industry. Thus local
                    wants are largely supplied by local producers, and much of this trade is never
                    recorded in any statistical returns. There can be no doubt that leather takes
                    rank among the foremost half dozen of human industries. Both in Europe and
                    America there is a large international trade in the raw materials and
                    manufactured products, while from the East Indies and the British colonies the
                    largest supplies of various untanned and tanned hides and skins are now
                    exported. Taking cattle hides alone, the import trade cf the great manufacturing
                    centres has been thus stated for 1879 :—</p>

                    enormous exports of the East Indies. The total number of hides, raw and tanned,
                    exported from India in the year 1877-78 was 9,300,955, and the average for the
                    four preceding years exceeded 7,250,000. A great proportion of these are tanned
                    kips, shipped from Madras almost exclusively to the United Kingdom,—buffalo and
                    the heavier flint dιy hides going more largely to the United States. The imports
                    of East Indian kips into the United Kingdom during 1880 amounted to 6,135,978,
                    and in 1881 the number fell to 4,580,303. Of tanned goat and sheep skins, again,
                    the annual export from Madras alone reaches nearly' 10,000,000 skins, the
                    numbers for 1880 having been 9,799,900 skins. The total number of sheep and goat
                    skins, raw and rough tanned, imported into the United States in 1880 was
                    11,731,885, of which 6,332,635 were raw soft stock, 3,353,750 were raw hard East
                    Indian skins, principally from Bengal, and 2,055,500 were tanned East Indian

                <p>The principal leather markets of the United Kingdom are London, where there are
                    quarterly fairs; Leeds, with eight fairs yearly; and Bristol, which has two
                    leather fairs per year. In the United States the commerce centres principally in
                    New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. On the European continent Paris, Marseilles,
                    Vienna, and Berlin are the most important centres of the leather trade, with
                    Antwerp and Havre as great marts for the sale of hides and skins. (J. PA.)</p>
