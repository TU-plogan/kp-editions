                    >Elevator</hi> is used in two different senses. It refers to apparatus for
                    lifting passengers to the upper stories of buildings. It also refers to the very
                    different sort of apparatus used in grain-mills and storehouses for transferring
                    the grain from one floor to another. The grain is drawn along channels or pipes,
                    which are sometimes vertical and more often inclined, by means of a rotating
                    archimedean screw, or of a strap continuously travelling upwards through the
                    interior of the channel and carrying, fastened to it, a series of small buckets.
                    Occasionally, if the inclination to the horizontal be small, a broad strap of
                    the same width as the bottom of the channel runs along that bottom, and carries
                    the grain with it simply lying on its upper surface. This latter method of
                    transportation is more efficient, however, as a horizontal carrier or
                    distributor than as a means of lifting. Grain might also easily be blown up a
                    pipe by an air-blast, but the writer does not know any instance of this method
                    having been used. <hi rend="italic">Lifts</hi> are constructed either for
                    raising passengers in buildings or for heavier loads, such as freighted trucks
                    and waggons, or the superstructure of bridges and large roofs during their
                    erection.</p>
                <p>In lifts or elevators, the working force is either hand, steam, or hydraulic
                    power. Gas-engines are unsuitable as direct sources of power for lifts, but they
                    may be advantageously used to store hydraulic power in. an accumulator from
                    which water is supplied to work an hydraulic lift. Electricity has quite
                    recently been used, but has not yet been tried sufficiently to allow of any
                    valuable opinion being formed of its ultimate practical success.</p>
                <p>The lift consists of (1) a box or “cage” to contain the persons or material to be
                    raised; (2) a vertical square well or shaft, to the walls of which are attached
                    guides to prevent the cage swinging to and fro; (3) a rope or chain by which to
                    haul the cage upwards from above, or else a long rod or pillar by which to push
                    it up from below; (4) a “barrel” or “sheave” over which to wind the chain or
                    rope, and which is mounted on a shaft lying in bearings firmly supported by the
                    building, or else a cylinder to contain water or steam to actuate the lifting
                    rod; (5) mechanism through which the working power is transmitted to the barrel,
                    or else water or steam piping connecting the cylinder above mentioned with the
                    source of power; and (6) the driving engine or other source of power.</p>
                <p>Most accidents happen to lifts through the hauling chain or rope breaking. For
                    the sake of safety, therefore, particular care should he exercised in the choice
                    of material for this part, and an appliance should always be attached to the
                    cage whereby, if the rope breaks, the cage is caught immediately in whatever
                    position it may be at the time of the breakage.</p>
                <p>For light loads hempen ropes are sufficient and more convenient than chains,
                    because they are noiseless in their action. If of the best quality (Manila) they
                    are quite as reliable as ordinary chains, and an advantage claimed for them is
                    that their gradual destruction by wear becomes easily apparent, and gives timely
                    warning before they become dangerous, whereas the failure of a chain may take
                    place without any easily visible previous sign having been given. For very heavy
                    loads, however, chains or wire ropes should be used in preference to hempen
                    ropes. Wire ropes may be made stronger for a given weight per foot of length
                    than chains are, but unfortunately as commonly manufactured their quality cannot
                    be certainly relied on. Like hempen ropes, they are almost noiseless. To insure
                    smoothness and noiselessness in passenger lifts, the sheave over which the rope
                    passes is lined in the groove with leather.</p>
                <p>For the sake of safety, the rope by which the cage hangs is often duplicated.
                    Sometimes even three or four are used. In order that these should give
                    additional safety, each rope must be capable of supporting the load by itself.
                    Generally the load is lifted by one or other kind of power, and descends by the
                    weight of the cage itself. This weight is always much more than sufficient for
                    the purpose, and therefore counterpoises are introduced to balance the greater
                    part of it, thus lessening the work to be done during ascent by an amount equal
                    to the product of the balance weight and the height of the lift. In the
                    commonest arrangement, the balance weights are hung on the same rope as that by
                    which the cage is suspended. This passes over a pulley whose diameter is half
                    the width of the well, so that the cage end of the rope rises vertically from
                    the centre of the roof of the cage. This pulley is keyed on a horizontal shaft,
                    which is driven by power from below, either directly by means of a rope or chain
                    passing over another pulley, or else through intermediate spur gearing. The
                    actual working rope is in this case not attached to the cage. Less frequently
                    the rope from the engine forms one of the suspenders of the cage, the balance
                    weights being attached by separate ropes.</p>
                <p>The rope or chain by which the load hangs has to be so strong that its own weight
                    is very considerable. A large excess of strength being more in demand in this
                    kind of machinery than in other kinds, a greater stress than about 1 ton per
                    square inch cannot be put upon the chain or rope (supposed to be of iron). This
                    would make the rope weigh 3 4 K&gt; per foot of length for every ton of load
                    carried. If the height of lift were, for example, 60 feet, then, comparing the
                    top and bottom positions of the cage, there would be in the former 60 feet less
                    of rope on the cage side of the pulley, and 60 feet more on the counterpoise
                    side, than in the latter position, so that if the counter-weight just balanced
                    the load when the cage was at the bottom, it, along with the rope, would
                    outweigh the cage in its highest position by the weight of 120 feet of rope,
                    that is 408 lb for every ton of load, or nearly ⅜th of the whole load. Since the
                    whole load—that is, that of cage, ropes, and passengers or goods—is three or
                    four and sometimes five or six times as great as the net load, this is a very
                    serious increase on the <hi rend="italic">unavoidable</hi> loss of balance
                    resulting from the fact that the cage is alternately loaded and unloaded. The
                    difficulty can be got over by extending the rope downwards from the balance
                    weight to pass underneath a grooved pulley at the bottom of the well, and up
                    from this to the under side of the cage, where it is attached. There will then
                    be an equal length of rope always hanging on each side of the top bearing
                    pulley; but an extra amount of friction occurs at the bearing journals due to
                    the weight of the extra rope. The lower half of the rope may be of cheap
                    inferior material, since there is very little stress upon it.</p>
                <p>A precisely similar difficulty occurs if the cage be lifted from below by an
                    hydraulic ram or piston-rod. Occasionally the weight of the cage and ram is left
                    unbalanced. In this case the water pressure on the ram or piston has to support
                    the whole load. Suppose the pressure in the reservoir from which the water is
                    drawn to remain steady during the ascent, then evidently at the top of its
                    stroke the water pressure on the ram is less than at the bottom of its stroke,
                    by the weight of a column of water, of section equal to that of the ram, and
                    height equal to the lift. Suppose, for example, that the water pressure at the
                    level of the face of the ram in its highest position is 200 ft&gt; per square
                    inch. Then for every ton of total load there must be provided about 11 square
                    inches of piston area. A column of water of this horizontal section and 1 foot
                    nigh weighs about 4 75 lb. This would give a difference of supporting pressure
                    of 285 lb for every ton of total load in a lift of 60 feet, —that is, about ⅛th
                    of the total load. More commonly the weight <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n594/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0594-0575"/> of the cage and the ram is balanced by
                    counterpoises on chains fastened to the top of the cage and passing over a
                    pulley overhead, while the water pressure is used to overcome only the friction,
                    and the additional load of passengers or goods. In this case again, owing to the
                    passage of the chains over the pulleys, the balance is disturbed in a rise of 60
                    feet, by about ⅜th the weight of the cage and the ram, while the upward water
                    pressure on the ram is in the same rise diminished by ⅛tn, The former
                    disturbance of balance is a <hi rend="italic">decrease</hi> of the load restmg
                    on the base of the ram, while the latter is a <hi rend="italic">decrease</hi> of
                    the supporting pressure on the same base. If these were made equal, the cage and
                    load would be perfectly balanced in every position. To make them equal, it would
                    be necessary simply to adjust the ratio of the part of the load borne by the
                    counterpoise to the part borne by the water. Let the former part be W <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and the latter W <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, the
                    total load being W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + W <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi>, Then for a water pressure of 200 lb per square inch, it would be
                    necessary to have ⅜W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-iW <hi rend="subscript">
                    a</hi>, or W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =iW <hi rend="subscript"> s</hi> = <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛(W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> + W <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p>For a pressure of 400 lb per square inch, the equation would be</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> =ΛW <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ≈⅛(W <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> +W <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi>).</p>
                <p>For 100 lb per square inch it would be</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-⅜W <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>-∣(W <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> +W <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>).</p>
                <p>This adjustment would necessitate a large unnecessary consumption of water,
                    because the weight of cage and ram always bears a much greater ratio to the
                    extra weight of passengers or goods than any of the above fractions ⅛ ⅞, or even
                    ⅞. The adjustment being attainable by other means, this waste can in no case be
                    desirable.</p>
                <p>If a second cylinder stand beside the lift-well and be connected by a pipe to the
                    cylinder directly underneath the càge, so that there is a continually open
                    passage between the two cylinders, then the supporting rod underneath the cage,
                    together with the column of water leading from its base through the pipes to the
                    second cylinder, is the exact counterpart in compression of the overhead ropes
                    in tension in the other class of machine; and, as counterweights are hung upon
                    these ropes, a balancing weight may be laid on the surface of the water in the
                    second cylinder. The balance weight, equalling that of cage and ram, rests on a
                    plunger or piston fitting this cylinder, and the rod is extended upwards into a
                    third smaller cylinder, on the plunger of which is admitted, by means of the
                    valve worked from the cage or landing-platforms, an extra amount of water
                    pressure sufficient to elevate the extra load of passengers or goods. This is
                    the arrangement in Tomassi’s hydraulic balanced lift The column of water which
                    takes the place of the rope in,the overhead arrangement passes from one cylinder
                    to the other, and vice <hi rend="italic">versa,</hi> in the same way as the rope
                    j&gt;asses from the cage side to the counterweight side of the overhead pulley.
                    Thus the balance, which may be made correct for one position of the lift,
                    becomes disturbed for other positions by a similar amount to that already
                    investigated. A perfect balance of the constant part of the total load, namely,
                    that of the cage and ram, is, however, obtained for all positions of the cage by
                    the arrangement shown in figs. 1 and 2. This is the design of Mr Edward
                    Ellington, described by him in a paper read before the Institution of Mechanical
                    Engineers in January 1882. The whole load is borne by the rod <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> underneath the cage, which enters as a ram into the vertical cylinder A.
                    This rod is made solid in orderto reduce the size of the cylinder as much as
                    possible, and, therefore, also the size of the well that has to be bored in tire
                    ground to contain this cylinder. This class of lifts is especially expensive on
                    account of this boring, and the objection to them on the score of expense is
                    lessened by making the well small. The rod is made only just strong enough to
                    safely bear the load on it. Its section should be designed with reference to the
                    height of lift, because the longer the free length of the supporting pillar the
                    greater is its tendency to buckle under a given load. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> be the stress per square inch calculated to be admissible on its
                    section, and if W be the weight of cage and ram together and w that of
                    passengers or goods to be raised, the section is made equal to i∑ . Since this
                    same load has to be supported by the water pressure on the lower end of this
                    rod, that water pressure is made also equal to <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> This
                    cylinder A is kept always in open communication with the lower end of the
                    cylinder B. In this moves a piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> fastened to the top
                    of the thick piston rod <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> This passes downwards into the
                    third cylinder C, and to its lower extremity is fastened the large piston c.
                    These pistons have a common stroke, which is much shorter than the lift of the
                    cage. The cylinders are correspondingly shorter than A, and they stand above
                    ground. The ratio of the strokes may range from 5 to 8, and is the same as the
                    ratio of the annular area of tne under side of the piston <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> to that of the rod α. If <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> be the areas of the piston and piston rod, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    that of the rod supporting the cage, the ratio of the strokes is <hi
                    rend="italic">b - d: a.</hi> Suppose the piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to be
                    at the top of its stroke and the cage to be consequently at the bottom of the
                    lift-well, then, if in this position the piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be at a
                    height above the lower end of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> inches, and if <hi rend="italic">w</hi> be the weight of a
                    cubic inch of water, then, the pressure per square inch on <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> being <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> that on the <hi rend="italic">lower</hi>
                    side of piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is <hi rend="italic">k - hw.</hi> The
                    whole upward pressure on this piston is therefore (⅛ - <hi rend="italic">hw}tf -
                    d)</hi>; and a downward pressure equal to or rather more than this must be
                    exerted on this piston in order to lift the cage. This is supplied by admitting
                    the water from the main, or from thehydraulic accumulator if force-pumps are
                    employed to provide water-pressure, into the upper ends of the cylinders B and
                    C. The lower end of C is always kept in open communication with the atmosphere.
                    The water is continually admitted to B, and the water pressure on the top
                    surface of piston <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is designed to balance the constant
                    load of cage and ram when this piston is at the top of its stroke. During the
                    ascent of the cage, the water is admitted into C by a valve moved from the cage
                    or platforms by means of the rope <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the water
                    pressure on the annular top surface of piston c, when that piston is at its
                    highest position, is designed to balance the extra load of passengers or goods.
                    During the descent, the cage being empty, the connexion between C and the
                    accumulator is shut by the valve actuated from the cage, and the water is
                    allowed to escape freely to the drains, so that the pressure on c becomes equal
                    to atmospheric pressure. Ifp be the pressure per square inch of the working

                    position, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be the area of the cross-section of
                    cylinder C, and if <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> be the length of plunger <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> then in this position the whole downward force that is
                    borne by the water underneath the piston <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and
                    distributed over its area <hi rend="italic">{b - d),</hi> is <hi rend="italic"
                    >pb + (p + h'w)(c - d),</hi> when the pressure is on piston c, and simply <hi
                    rend="italic">pb</hi> when this pressure is cut off from C. (To this should lie
                    added the weight of <hi rend="italic">b, d,</hi> and c, but for our present
                    purpose of explanation only this may be left out of account) The former quantity
                    has to equal <hi rend="italic">(k - hw)(b - d),</hi> and the latter should
                    equal</p>
                <p>These two equations serve to determine two of the quantities involved in terms of
                    the others.</p>
                <p>When the water pressure is admitted to the upper side of <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    alone, the intensity of pressure on the under side of <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    is evidently as many times greater than the intensity on its upper side as the
                    area of its upper side is greater than that of its lower surface. Thus any
                    increase of intensity on the upper surface will cause a correspondingly greater
                    increase of intensity on the lower. Now if the pressure on the under side of <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> were to remain the same while the cage ascended, the
                    pressure on the lower end of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would decrease by an
                    amount proportional to the change in their difference of level. If, for example,
                    the ratio of the strokes J-&lt;i:ais6:l, then, as the cage rises 6 inches, <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> will fall 1 inch, and <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> the
                    difference of levai <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n595/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0595-0576"/> between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> will be decreased 7 inches. The pressure per square inch
                    on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would decrease <hi rend="italic">7w</hi> if that on
                    the under side of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> kept constant. But, as the upper side
                    of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> also sinks 1 inch, the pressure per square inch on
                    it will increase by <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> If now the ratio of this upper
                    area of <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to its lower area be made 7, this increase of
                    <hi rend="italic">w</hi> on the top face will cause an increase of <hi
                    rend="italic">7w</hi> on the lower face, and thus just neutralize the diminution
                    of pressure on <hi rend="italic">a</hi> due to the combined rise of the cage and
                    fall of the lower side of <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Thus the unloaded cage will
                    be in perfect balance, at whatever height it stands, if the areas <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b-d</hi> are given the ratio <hi
                    rend="italic">b b-d b-d a</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> +</hi></p>
                <p>The ratio <hi rend="italic">b - d: a</hi> of the two strokes having been already
                    chosen, this equation gives <hi rend="italic">b</hi> directly. From the other
                    two equations c and the necessary pressure <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are found.
                    This pressure <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> may be obtained by hydraulic pumps and an
                    accumulator loaded to the right amount. If, however, the water from the mains is
                    to be used, the ratio of the strokes or the size of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> may
                    be modified so as to suit the available working pressm·e <hi rend="italic"
                    >p.</hi> If <hi rend="italic">c</hi> be proportioned for the extra load at a
                    given height, it will not be correct for all other heights, but this is of
                    little consequence, because the extra load itself is variable from 0 upwards, so
                    that no adjustment of <hi rend="italic">c</hi> except to its maximum desired
                    amount is possible. An excess of pressure on <hi rend="italic">c</hi> above that
                    needed for any given load has the effect simply of accelerating the speed of
                    ascent, and this is modified roughly by partially closing the valve admitting
                    water to C.</p>
                <p>We have chosen this lift for description as the latest improvement in the design
                    of hydraulic lifts. In it no water is wasted in raising or lowering the constant
                    load.</p>
                <p>When the hydraulic power is applied to the cage through a chain or rope passing
                    over an overhead pulley, the hydraulic cylinder is usually laid horizontally for
                    facility of setting and examination. Of course this arrangement involves much
                    greater frictional resistance to the motion of the apparatus, but in it all the
                    severely stressed parts may be in tension. There is greater security when they
                    are so than when they are in compression. Tangye Brothers’ hydraulic lift is
                    arranged in this way.</p>
                <p>Accidents to lifts occur in two ways. First, the suspending chain or rope may
                    break, or, in those supported from below, the ram may break, or the cylinder or
                    pipes enclosing the water may burst. To lessen the risk of such breakages the
                    only method is to insist on good design in the details, good materials (which
                    should be subjected to test before being used), and good workmanship. The
                    connexion at both ends of the rope or chain to the load suspended from it, or
                    the jointing of the different sections of the ram to each other and to the cage,
                    is a point especially important. If such a breakage does actually occur,
                    however, the cage is usually kept from falling by an automatic catch whioh grips
                    it in whatever position it happens to occupy when the accident occurs. Tangye
                    Brothers have for this purpose at each corner of the cage a toothed cam. The
                    suspending rope sustains the cage through levers as shown in fig. 3. So long as
                    there is a considerable pull on the rope, the levers keep the cams in the
                    position shown. If the strain on the rope is relieved by accident to it,
                    powerful spiral springs immediately force the cams outwards and the teeth become
                    buried in the wooden guide-posts. A toothed rack is sometimes bolted to the
                    vertical posts and toothshaped prongs are forced forward by springs to engage
                    with the rack when the rope breaks. Similar arrangements are not placed between
                    the top of the ram and the cage of direct-acting hydraulic lifts, but it is a
                    mistaken idea that they are not as necessary in this case as in the other. Such
                    appliances should be examined and tested at regular frequent intervals. They are
                    apt to get out of working order through disuse. A double rope is a greater
                    safeguard against accident.</p>
                <p>In chain or rope lifts the gearing or other machinery may break, and in
                    consequence the cage might run down with dangerous rapidity without the rope
                    either breaking, or being wholly relieved of tension, so that the above catches
                    may not come into action. This may be prevented by a self-acting clutch on the
                    shaft, which prevents the barrel rotating unless the clutch is specially
                    released. The most perfect and mechanically beautiful of the many devices that
                    have been invented for this purpose is Weston’s frictional automatic coupling.
                    Fig. 4 shows it as applied to a hand sack-hoist. To the shaft <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is keyed a ratchet wheel <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> A pawl gearing in
                    this prevents the shaft from ever rotating except in one direction. The plate
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is also keyed to the shaft. The hauling rope sheave <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and the winding barrel <hi rend="italic">e</hi> both run
                    loose on the shaft. Their opposing end surfaces are cut helically, so that,
                    according to the relative angular positions of <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> they are either jammed against each other and between <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> or are loose and free to
                    rotate round the shaft. On pulling the sheave <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in one
                    direction all the parts are frictionally coupled together, and the barrel hauls
                    up the load. The axial pressure producing friction between <hi rend="italic"
                    >c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and between <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is greater than the load being hauled up in the ratio
                    of the circumference of the barrel to the pitch of thé helix. As there are two
                    frictional surfaces, the whole friction is double this axial thrust multiplied
                    by the coefficient of friction, and this friction must act at such a mean radius
                    from the shaft as to have a moment greater than that of the load. If this is so
                    for one load, it is so also for all others, as the friction is proportional to
                    the load. To get sufficient friction for heavy loads with a diminished axial
                    thrust, the very ingenious design shown in. fig. 5 is adopted. Here the shaft
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is driven by power, and is keyed to the boss <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> with a helix cut on one end. This helix abuts against a
                    similar helix on the pinion <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which drives the hoisting
                    barrel on a second shaft. The ratchet wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi> abuts
                    against the collar/ on the shaft <hi rend="italic">a; b</hi> runs loose on the
                    shaft and is cast on the end of a hollow dram containing three disks of hard
                    wood, P,P,P. These disks can slide axially along the interior of the drum, but
                    are prevented from turning except along with the dram. Intervening between these
                    wood disks are two iron disks, O,O, which may slide axially along the boss of
                    the pinion <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> but are prevented from rotating except
                    along with this pinion. The axial pressure is transmitted from <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> to / through the surfaces of the disks P and 0, and, there being six
                    pairs of surfaces between which this pressure is exerted, a very slight axial
                    thrust produces sufficient friction at these surfaces to couple the ratchet
                    wheel <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to the pinion <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> So long
                    as this is exerted all the parts are jammed together, and the pawl engaging in
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> prevents the load lowering. When, however, the shaft
                    <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is rotated backwards, the helices disengage and the
                    friction no longer binds <hi rend="italic">e</hi> with <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    so that <hi rend="italic">e</hi> along with <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> can be rotated backwards and the load thus lowered. The
                    weight of the load keeps <hi rend="italic">e</hi> following <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> closely in its backward motion, and as soon as the operator or machine
                    ceases to turn the shaft backwards the whole apparatus becomes once more
                    frictionally bound together, and the ratchet wheel prevents further lowering.
                    Fig. 6 shows another arrangement whereby the pinion <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is
                    uncoupled and allowed to lower the load by only a slight backward motion of the
                    shaft <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> it being unnecessary to rotate the shaft
                    backward continuously.</p>
                <p>This last is obvious ly the most handy arrangement, and when worked carefully is
                    as absolutely safe as the other. This device in a modified form is used in
                    Tangye’s lifts.</p>
                <p>Thomas &amp; Sons, of Cardiff, have a similar patent safety shaft coupling,
                    which, although it has a very different form, is constructed on exactly the same
                    principle as that of fig. 4.</p>
                <p>Steam has been used as a motive power in long cylinders similar to those in
                    hydraulic lifts. It has the great advantage of having very little weight, so
                    that the difference of head occasioned by the rise of the piston is practically
                    nil. The disadvantage is that the steam rapidly condenses, and thus the load
                    could not be held up at any desired height for a length of time, without a
                    continual fresh supply of steam to the cylinders. It is not likely to come into
                    general use for passenger lifts, but may be used advantageously for goods lifts
                    and heavy cranes. (R. H. S∙*) <pb break="no"
