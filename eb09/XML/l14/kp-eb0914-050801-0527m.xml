                <p><label type="entry">LIBERIA</label>, a Negro republic on the Grain Coast of West
                    Africa. Founded in 1822 by American philanthropists for the settlement of
                    freedmen who wished to return to their native land, or to enjoy political and
                    social privileges then denied them in the United States, it remained for
                    twenty-five years under the tutelage of the mother country, but on the 26th July
                    1847 it was declared independent. In 1848 it was recognized as a sovereign state
                    by Great Britain, which aided it in various ways, and by other Continental
                    powers, and finally in 1861 by the United States. Its nominal boundaries are
                    from the river Jong, a tributary of the Sherbar, in 7° 35' N. lat., 12° 20' W.
                    long., and the river San Pedro, in 4° 45' N. lat., 6 <hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> 40' W. long., a distance of 380 miles, the limits of the state in the
                    interior being usually stated at from 80 to 100 miles eastward, though this is
                    unsettled, and the entire area of the country at 24,000 square miles, or 1000
                    miles less than Holland and Belgium combined. Like that of northern Guinea
                    generally, the Liberian shore is low, but the country rises towards the
                    interior, and is well-wooded and watered by numerous streams. The climate is,
                    however, hot and unhealthy for Europeans, though of late years it has been
                    improved by drainage, and is considered superior to that of any part of the
                    neighbouring coast. The soil is fertile and well suited for the growth of
                    tropical crops, such as cotton, rice, sugar, indigo, yams, groundnuts, bananas,
                    ginger, cassava,pine-apples, cocoa-nuts, limes, oranges, tamarinds, and the
                    Liberian variety of coffee<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Liberian coffee (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Coffee,</hi> vol. vi. p. 110) has
                    been introduced into Brazil, Ceylon, the Dutch Indies, &amp;c. The quantity
                    actually exported from Liberia is comparatively small.</p></note> held in such
                    high esteem. These products, in addition to palm oil, form the main support of
                    the inhabitants, who in return import arms, ammunition, tobacco, salt
                    provisions, implements of husbandry, cutlery, British cottons, and other
                    manufactured goods. Coffee, palm oil, palm-kernels, rubber, ivory, dye woods,
                    hides, ivory, arrowroot, sugar, cocoa, ginger, and rice form the principal
                    articles of its commerce, which is carried on chiefly with Great Britain,
                    Holland, Hamburg, and America. Copper, gold, iron, and deposits of gum-copal
                    exist, but they are not worked; and all the large wild animals have long since
                    been killed or driven out of the woods. Stock can be kept in the higher lands.
                    The government is modelled on that of the United States, and consists of a
                    president, and a congress composed of a senate of eight members elected for four
                    years, and of a house of representatives of thirteen members elected for three
                    years, in addition to a supreme court, and a cabinet of the American type. One
                    additional representative is given for each additional 10,000 inhabitants by
                    which the population may increase. Military service in the militia is obligatory
                    on every male citizen between the ages of sixteen and fifty, but there is no
                    standing army. There is no established church, and all faiths are equally
                    tolerated. The state is divided into four counties (Mezurada, Grand Bassa,
                    Sinoe, and Maryland<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Maryland was originally a separate colony, founded in 1831; it became an
                    independent republic in 1854, and about 1860 was incorporated with its older
                    neighbour.</p></note>), and these again into townships, each 64 square miles in
                    area. There are a number of little villages, but the only place of any
                    consequence is Monrovia, the capital, containing 13,000 inhabitants, and in
                    appearance very like a town in the southern United States, but in no way
                    remarkable except for the large number of churches within its bounds. Besides
                    Monrovia the chief ports are Robertsport, Marshall, Edina or Buchanan,
                    Greenville, Sesters River, Sasstown, and Harper, and in 1881 foreigners were
                    further permitted to trade at any point to the north of Robertsport. The present
                    population of the republic (1882) comprises 18,000 civilized negroes, chiefly of
                    American origin, and 1,050,000 half-wild natives, some of whom are adopting a
                    settled life, and conforming to the habits of their tamed countrymen. Among the
                    more interesting tribes are the Veis, the Bassas, the Krus, and the Mandingoes.
                    The American Methodist Episcopal mission dates from 1833, the American Episcopal
                    from 1834, and that of the American Baptists from 1835. The revenue of the state
                    was returned at September 30, 1875, as 111,457 dollars, chiefly derived from
                    customs, the national debt being 500,000 dollars, contracted in England in 1871.
                    Of this neither principal nor interest has been paid. Socially and politically
                    the state cannot be pronounced a marked success. The negroes in America display
                    little desire to throw in their fortunes with it, now that they are free to go
                    whither they list, nor do the barbarous tribes on the border of the republic
                    seem to admire the black parody on a white man’s government, which for sixty
                    years has been presented to them. There is now and again a small immigration
                    from the United States, but the Liberian civilization, cut off from the benefit
                    of intercourse with a higher and broader culture, is apt to deteriorate, while
                    neither the climate nor the laws and social surroundings are ever likely to
                    attract many white men to its shores. It is, however, only fair to add that,
                    though internal disorder is too often the rule, the state shows an appreciation
                    of education and religion, and a keen desire to stand well in the good opinion
                    of the powers with which it has relations by accredited representatives. It has
                    formed treaties with most of the European countries, and with Hayti and the
                    United States; and, though it has not paid its debts, successive Governments are
                    in the habit of registering vows to meet this first obligation of a nation
                    towards its neighbours. British coin and an irredeemable <pb break="no"
