                <p><label type="entry">LICHENS</label><hi rend="italic">(Lichenes)</hi> may briefly
                    be defined as cellular perennial plants, furnished with a vegetative system
                    containing gonidia, and with a reproductive system consisting of female
                    thecasporous fruits and male spermo-gonous organs. They constitute a distinct
                    class of cellular cryptogams, intermediate between algae and fungi, to both of
                    which in some respects they present certain affinities. By the earlier authors
                    they were regarded as being <hi rend="italic">Aerophycx</hi> or terrestrial
                    algae, while of recent years they have been viewed by some writers as being <hi
                    rend="italic">Ascomycetous</hi> fungi. From both of these, however, they are
                    sufficiently distinguished and separated by the special structure of their
                    thallus, by the presence of certain immediate principles proper to their
                    tissues, and by their mode of life and nutrition. Their relations to these
                    neighbouring classes, and their true systematic place, will be best elucidated
                    on considering their structure and its bearings upon some recent
                    speculations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Structure of Lichens.</hi></p>
                <p>A complete lichen consists of a nutritive and vegetative system termed the
                    thallus, and of reproductive bodies borne upon it in the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">apothecia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spermogones.</hi>
                    Occasionally, however, there is no thallus present <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    Sphinctrina,</hi> various <hi rend="italic">Lecidex, Endococcus),</hi> in which
                    case the fructification is parasitical on the thalli of other lichens.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">Vegetative System.—</hi> The thallus is very variable in
                    external form and colour, as also in internal structure.</p>
                <p>1. In external form it presents the following modifications. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(a)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">foliaceous</hi> thallus, which may be either
                    peltate, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> rounded and entire, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Umbilicaria,</hi> &amp;c., or variously lobed and laciniated, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Sticta, Parmelia,</hi> &amp;c. This is the highest type of
                    its development, and is sometimes very considerably expanded, <hi rend="italic"
                    >(b)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">fruticulose</hi> thallus, which sometimes is
                    filamentose, as in <hi rend="italic">Ephebe,</hi> and may be either erect,
                    becoming pendulous, as in <hi rend="italic">Usnea, Pamalina,</hi> &amp;c., or
                    prostrate, as in <hi rend="italic">Alectoria</hi><hi rend="italic">jubata,</hi>
                    var. <hi rend="italic">chalybeiformis.</hi> It is usually divided into branches
                    and branchlets, bearing some resemblance to a miniature shrub amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phanerogamia.</hi> An erect cylindrical thallus terminated by the
                    fruit is termed a <hi rend="italic">ρodetium,</hi> as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cladoηia. (c)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">crustaceous</hi> thallus, which is the
                    most common of all, forms a mere crust on the substratum, varying in thickness,
                    and may be squamose (in <hi rend="italic">Squamaria),</hi> radiate (in <hi
                    rend="italic">Placodium),</hi> areolate, granulose, or pulverulent (in various
                    <hi rend="italic">Lecanorx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lecidex).</hi> In its
                    pulverulent state it is either the rudimentary or the abortive condition of many
                    species, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">hypophloeodal</hi>
                    thallus is often concealed beneath the bark of trees (as in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Verrucarix</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arthonix),</hi> or enters
                    into the fibres of wood (as in <hi rend="italic">Xylographa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Agyrium),</hi> being indicated externally only by a very thin film
                    or macula. To this may also be referred the evanescent thallus which is denoted
                    solely by gonidia sparingly scattered on the stone or wood (as in some <hi
                    rend="italic">Caliciei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lecidex:).</hi> This is the
                    simplest form under which lichenose vegetation occurs. These two latter forms of
                    thalli may be either <hi rend="italic">determinate, i.e.,</hi> of a definite
                    shape with a distinct margin or boundary, or <hi rend="italic">effuse,
                    i,e.,</hi> spreading extensively over the substratum with no visible limits. The
                    differences in these forms are no doubt connected with differences in the
                    chemical composition of the thallus. In colour also the thallus externally is
                    very variable. In the dry and more typical state it is most frequently white or
                    whitish, and almost as often greyish or greyish glaucous. Less commonly it is of
                    different shades of brown, red, yellow, and black. These various colours do not
                    originate from any colouring matters contained in the cells themselves, but,
                    according to investigations made by Nylander (see <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi>
                    1879, p. 558) they depend upon such as are deposited in the granulations and
                    cellular walls, whence they appear on the epithallus. In the moist state of the
                    thallus these colours are much less apparent, as the textures then become more
                    or less translucent, and the epithallus usually presents the greenish colour of
                    the gonidia <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Parmelia Borreri, Peltidea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aphthosa, Umbilicaria pustulata,</hi> and pulverulent <hi
                    rend="italic">Lecidex).</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n572/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0572-0553"/>
                <p>2. The internal structure of the thallus presents two principal modifications,
                    viz., the <hi rend="italic">stratified</hi> thallus, having its different
                    elements (hyphae and gonidia) arranged in layers, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >unstratified</hi> thallus, in which these different elements are confused in a
                    homogeneous tissue.</p>
                <p>A. <hi rend="italic">The stratified thallus.</hi> —On making a vertical section
                    this is seen in a foliaceous lichen to consist of three layers constituting a
                    <hi rend="italic">cortical,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">gonidial,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">medullary</hi> system, to which in the case of many cnrsta-ceous
                    lichens is to be added a fourth, viz., a <hi rend="italic">hypothalline</hi>
                    stratum.</p>
                <p>(a) The <hi rend="italic">cortical</hi> stratum occupies the whole of the
                    external surface of filamentose and fruticulose lichens, both the upper· and
                    under surfaces of some foliaceous and squamulose species, while it is found only
                    on the upper surface of crustaceous lichens. It usually consists of a colourless
                    cellular tissue, in which the cellules are closely compacted and form a
                    pseudo-parenchyma. Its most superficial portion, termed by Nylander the <hi
                    rend="italic">epithallus, a</hi> sort of cuticle, is amorphous, often more
                    indurated and coloured. In some lichens <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Collenia)</hi>
                    it is the only portion of the cortex present, while in pulverulent crustaceous
                    thalli it is entirely wanting, (ό) The <hi rend="italic">gonidial</hi> stratum
                    is situated immediately beneath the cortical stratum, and consists usually of
                    greenish spherical cellules, or of granules destitute of a cellular membrane. It
                    is not always continuous, but is often interrupted,'the gonidia occurring in
                    dissociated masses. Sometimes it is situated on the upper part of the medullary
                    stratum, in which case the gonidia are arranged either between or amongst its
                    exterior elements. In general its limits may readily be distinguished from the
                    others by its peculiar colour. Various important matters relating to the gonidia
                    will more appropriately be afterwards discussed at length, (c) The <hi
                    rend="italic">medullary</hi> stratum is more variable in its constituent
                    elements, but, being always colourless, is easily recognized. It presents the
                    three following principal modifications, (a) The <hi rend="italic">woolly</hi>
                    medulla consists of simple or branched filaments, which in foliaceous species
                    are loosely intersected and entangled, and in fruticulose species are more or
                    less congluti-nated, assuming a longitudinal direction, and constituting, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Usnca,</hi> a kind of solid axis for the support of the
                    thallus, <hi rend="italic">(β)</hi> The <hi rend="italic">cretaceous</hi>
                    medulla occurs only in crustaceous lichens, and is generally characterized by
                    its tortareous appearance. It is more compact than the preceding, and consists
                    for the most part of molecular granulations often intermixed with octahedral
                    crystals of lime, and presenting but few traces of filamentose elements, (γ) The
                    <hi rend="italic">cellulose</hi> medulla consists of a tissue of angular,
                    rounded, or oblong cellules containing gonidia in their interior or in their
                    interstices <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Pannaria,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Endocarpon).</hi> In some species <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    Verrucaria fuseula)</hi> the cellules have a tendency to reunite into filaments
                    and then to separate again into rows of cellules, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">hypothalline</hi> stratum is the inferior one of the thallus
                    and that upon which the other strata are developed, though it is not always
                    visible, and is sometimes entirely wanting. - It usually presents itself under a
                    twofold aspect, viz., the <hi rend="italic">hypothallus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">rhizinae.</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">)</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypothallus</hi> proper, which is immediately developed upon the prothallus <hi
                    rend="italic">(Le.,</hi> the filaments of the germinating spore), is a
                    horizontal stratum consisting of interlacing filaments or of elongated, short,
                    or rounded cellules, and is sometimes of a white or whitish colour, but usually
                    dark or blackish. In many crustaceous lichens it is represented only by a black
                    or dark-coloured border limiting the thallus <hi rend="italic">(c.g.
                    Lecidca</hi><hi rend="italic">geographica,</hi> &amp;c.). (β) The <hi
                    rend="italic">rhizinae</hi> consist of vertical rhizoid fibrillae, usually
                    branching and tufted at their extremities, blackish or greyish in colour, rarely
                    white, which occur on the lower surface of foliaceous lichens. They consist of
                    several filamentose elements which are most frequently articulated and
                    agglutinated <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Parrnclia, Physcia),</hi> or sometimes
                    simple and then always articulated <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Sticta).</hi> It is
                    to be observed that the hypothallus and the rhizinae serve merely as bases of
                    attachment for the lichens to the substratum, and do not in any way aid in its
                    nutrition.</p>
                <p>B. <hi rend="italic">The unstratified tluillus.—</hi> This occurs amongst the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lichenacci</hi> (which, however, are most frequently stratified as
                    above), and in various species belonging to the inferior genera, which have a
                    pulverulent or hypophloeodal thallus. In these the constituent elements are more
                    or less mixed together, though the gonidial stratum generally remains distinct,
                    and is often visible when the others are absent. It is, however, the families of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Byssacei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Collemacei</hi> that
                    are more especially characterized by an unstratified thallus. Here the cortical
                    stratum is chiefly represented by a greenish <hi rend="italic">(vn.
                    Collema),</hi> rarely brown (in <hi rend="italic">Synalissa,</hi> &amp;c.).
                    non-cellular epithallus, or in others <hi rend="italic">(Leptogium)</hi> by a
                    thin stratum of angulose cellules distinct from the other elements of the
                    thallus. The gonidial granules are also disposed in a different manner to those
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Lichenacei.</hi> In the majority of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemacei</hi> they are strung together moniliformly, and
                    distributed without order in a gelatinous pellucid substance; while sometimes
                    they are agglomerated into small groups, and situated for the most part next to
                    the epithallus. In <hi rend="italic">Ephebacei</hi> they are not moniliformly
                    arranged, but are tunicated or involved in a gelatinous cellulose stratum. The
                    rest of the thallus consists of the medullary system (except in <hi
                    rend="italic">Ephebacei,</hi> in which there is no medulla), and is composed of
                    tubular or hollow filaments, with roundish cavities containing the gonidial
                    granules, and imbedded in the gelatinous substance, which very readily imbibes
                    water. There are a few lichens in which there is no trace whatever of
                    stratification, as the genus <hi rend="italic">Canogonium,</hi> in which the
                    entire thallus is composed of filamentose membranous elements, and the peculiar
                    family of the <hi rend="italic">Myriangiacei</hi> (doubtfully, however,
                    referable to lichens), in which it is equally cellulose throughout.</p>
                <p>In addition to the hyphal and gonidial anatomical elements which thus enter into
                    the structure of the thallus, there is another to be 'noticed, which, however,
                    is to be regarded rather as an immediate principle. This is the <hi
                    rend="italic">molecular granulations,</hi> which are extremely small and (in
                    form) irregular corpuscles, OO01-0 ’ 002 millim. in diameter, and visible only
                    when very highly magnified (300-400 diameters). They occur in all parts of the
                    thallus, especially in the younger cellules, from the epithallus to the
                    hypothallus, being especially abundant in the medulla of crustaceous species. In
                    the epithallus they are variously coloured according to the colours which it
                    presents, but in all other parts they are colourless. They occur also in the
                    apotheca, in the epithecium, the thecae, and the spores, and constitute the
                    famous “microgonidia” of Dr Minks. By the application of sulphuric acid many of
                    them are transformed into small acicular crystals, and in the spores they are
                    frequently agitated by a Brownian movement.</p>
                <p>We may here also, in connexion with the vegetative system of lichens, refer to
                    certain peculiar <hi rend="italic">excrescences</hi> which are sometimes
                    presented by the upper or under surface of the thallus. Of these the principal
                    are the following. (1) <hi rend="italic">Sorcdia</hi> are pulverulent eruptions
                    on the cortical stratum, varying in form, being rounded or diffuse, and either
                    are scattered upon the upper surface of the thallus or border its margins. They
                    are of a lighter colour than the thallus, and consist of a mass of gonidia and
                    of molecular granulations intermingled with filamentose elements. They occur in
                    many frιιticulose, foliaceous, and crustaceous lichens, and their protrusion
                    through the cortical stratum is owing most probably to an excessive development
                    of the gonidial element. Occasionally also they appear on the disk of apothecia
                    (in <hi rend="italic">Pcrtusaria),</hi> which they render abortive, and in this
                    case constitute the pseudo-genus <hi rend="italic">Variolaria</hi> of older
                    authors. When detached from the thallus they are capable under certain
                    favourable circumstances of giving rise to new plants, and thus act the part of
                    bulbils in the <hi rend="italic">Phancrogamia.</hi> It is no doubt by their
                    means that many species which are never-found in a fertile state <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Thamnolia</hi><hi rend="italic">vermicularis)</hi> are
                    propagated. (2) <hi rend="italic">Cyphcllae</hi> are small, urceolate, pale
                    excavations which occur abundantly on the under surface of many species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sticici.</hi> They are generally naked, but are often also pul

                    rend="italic">pseudo-cyphellae.</hi> Their physiological function is not
                    definitely known, but they are most likely connected with the nutrition of the
                    plants. (3) <hi rend="italic">Isidia</hi> constitute an exuberant condition of
                    some foliaceous and crustaceous thalli. They consist of elevated, coralloid,
                    stipitate excrescences, which are sometimes branched, and which are always of
                    the same colour and texture as the thallus itself. This isidioid condition in
                    crustaceous thalli is the basis of the old pseudo-genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isidium,</hi> which is merely an anomalous state of some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pertusaria.</hi> Isidia have the same functions as the soredia,
                    and serve as pro-pagula. (4) <hi rend="italic">Cephalodia</hi> are orbicular and
                    flattened or globular tubercles of a peculiar texture which occur on the thallus
                    of many species belonging to different genera. They are usually epigenous, as in
                    <hi rend="italic">Stereocaulon, Usnea, Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gelida,</hi><hi rend="italic">Leddea</hi><hi rend="italic">panaeola,</hi>
                    &amp;c. In a few species, however, they are hypogenous, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peltidea</hi><hi rend="italic">venosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Psoroma
                    euphyllum,</hi> while in various <hi rend="italic">Stictei, Nephroma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">expallidum,</hi> &amp;c., they are endogenous, forming pyrenoid
                    protuberances on the lower surface. Recently Nylander has detected both
                    epigenous and hypogenous cephalodia on <hi rend="italic">Psoroma arenariu/m</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lecanora allorhiza.</hi> They are of a paler colour than
                    the rest of the thallus, from which they differ also in structure, being
                    confusedly cellulose, and containing gonidial granules. According to Th. Μ.
                    Fries (in <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi> 1866, p. 19) they are only morbid
                    excrescences caused by algals intruding themselves under the cortex; but this is
                    at once refuted by the fact of their forming constant characters of so many
                    different species occurring in various situations. In these they evidently
                    constitute normal organs, the use of which, however, is unknown.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Reproductive System.—</hi> Thia consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">apotlceda</hi> or the female organs, of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sρermogones</hi> or the presumed male organs, and probably also of <hi
                    rend="italic">ρycnides</hi> or a secondary kind of fructification.</p>
                <p>1. The apothecia, like the thallus, are very variable in external form and
                    colour, as also in their internal structure. In external form they present three
                    principal modifications, viz., (1) <hi rend="italic">disciform</hi> (or
                    gymnocarpous), in which the shape is that of a disc (as in all the higher
                    genera); (2) <hi rend="italic">nucleiform</hi> (or angiocarpous), in which the
                    shape is that of a rounded tubercle with an apical ostiole (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Endocarpon, Verruearia)</hi>; and (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρeridiiform,</hi> similar in shape to the preceding, but closed, with no
                    ostiole (as in <hi rend="italic">Thelocarρon, Endococcus).</hi> The last two are
                    but little variable in figure, and consequently do not in this respect admit of
                    different designations. The disciform apothecia, however, present various
                    shapes, of which the following are the principal :—(a) <hi rend="italic"
                    >peltate,</hi> which are large, rounded, without any distinct thalline margin
                    (e√7∙, <hi rend="italic">Usnea, Peltigera) · (b) lecaηoriηe,</hi> or
                    scutelliform, which are orbicular and surrounded by a distinct, more or less
                    prominent thalline margin <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Parmelia, Lecanora),</hi>
                    having sometimes also in addition a proper one <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Thelotrema,</hi><hi rend="italic">Urceolaria)</hi>; (c) <hi rend="italic"
                    >lecideine,</hi> or patelliform, which are typically orbicular, with only a
                    proper margin <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecidea),</hi> sometimes obsolete, and
                    which are occasionally irregular in shape, angular or flexuose <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g., Lecidea jurana, L. myrmeciηa),</hi> or complicated and gyrose (e.y., <hi
                    rend="italic">Gyrophora)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and even
                    stipitate <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Baeomyces)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">; (d) lirelliform,</hi> which are of very irregular figure,
                    elongated, branched or flexuose, with only a proper margin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., Xylographa,</hi><hi rend="italic">Graphis,</hi> &amp;c.) or none <hi
                    rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> some <hi rend="italic">Arthoniae),</hi> and are often
                    very variable even in the same species. It may be here observed that young
                    disciform apothecia are more or less nucleiform. In colour the apothecia are
                    extremely variable, and it is but rarely that they are concolorous or
                    subconcolorous with the thallus <hi rend="italic">(p.g., Usnea, Ramalina).</hi>
                    Usually they are discolorous, and may be black, brown, yellowish, or also less
                    frequently rose-coloured, rusty-red, orange-reddish, saffron, or of various
                    intermediate shades. Occasionally in the same species their colour is very
                    variable <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora metaboloides, Lecidea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">decolorans),</hi> while sometimes they are white or glaucous,
                    rarely greenish, pruinose. Lecideine apothecia, which are not black, but
                    otherwise variously coloured, are termed <hi rend="italic">biatorine.</hi></p>
                <p>The two principal parts of which an apothecium consists are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypothecium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">thecium.</hi></p>
                <p>(1) The hypothecium, which corresponds to the hypothallus, is the conceptacle of
                    the^apothecia. It is composed of cellular tissue, generally very dense, *and
                    often presenting an indistinct stratification. This tissue may in general be
                    distinguished from that of the neighbouring parts of the thallus by its cellules
                    being smaller, more compact, and differently coloured, though in some instances
                    (as in certain <hi rend="italic">Pannariae)</hi> the limits are not
                    determinable. In the apothecia of such genera as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calidum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Baeomyces,</hi> &amp;c., the hypothecium te
                    composed of hollow cemented filaments arranged longitudinally and constricted
                    into a stipe for the support of the fruit. The hypothecium in disciform
                    apothecia is usually termed the <hi rend="italic">excipulum</hi> proper, while
                    in nucleiform apothecia it is termed the <hi rend="italic">pyrenium,</hi> and in
                    peridiiform apothecia the <hi rend="italic">peridium.</hi> When the pyrenium
                    quite covers the nucleus it is said to be <hi rend="italic">entire,
                    dimidiate</hi> when it covers only the upper portion. The hypothecium is either
                    colourless or dark, or reddish or yellowish, according as its cellules are
                    tinged.</p>
                <p>(2) The thecium, or as it is more frequently termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hymenium,</hi> is that part of the apothecium which contains the organs of the
                    fruit, viz., the <hi rend="italic">thalamium</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thecae,</hi> which are placed perpendicularly to the hypothecium. It is
                    penetrated by an amyloid substance, colourless and very greedy of water, termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">hyrnenial gelatine,</hi> formed of the lichenine, which
                    becomes bluish or wine-reddish when tinged with iodine. The thecium itself
                    corresponds to the gonidial-medullary stratum, while its superficial portion,
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">epithe∙ cium,</hi> corresponds to the epithallus,
                    (a) The thalamium generally consists of paraphyses which are erect colourless
                    filaments arising from the hypothecium, and whose function is to aid in the
                    expulsion of the spores by the pressure which they exercise upon the thecae.
                    They are of nearly equal height, closely placed together, usually very slender,
                    though slightly variable in thickness, frequently articulated, and rarely
                    branched or anastomosing. Internally they are hollow and filled with protoplasm,
                    which sometimes is separated into little globules. Their apices are generally
                    coloured, in most instances dilated, sometimes clavate, and are cemented
                    together by gelatin. They are frequently confused together; occasionally they
                    are but little evolute; while in many of the <hi rend="italic">Pyrenocarpei</hi>
                    they are entirely wanting, though in these the ostiolar filaments of the
                    hypothecium have sometimes been mistaken for them, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi>
                    The thecae are large, oblong, cylindrical or ovoid cellules or vesicles
                    containing the spores, and are usually more or less attenuated towards the base.
                    In size and shape they vary considerably in the different genera and species
                    according to the size, number, form, and arrangement of their spores. They
                    differ also in the same species, within certain limits, according to age, the
                    young theca being more slender than those which are older. In some genera which
                    have very large spores <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Variedlaria, Pertusaria)</hi>
                    the thecae are distended in proportion, and generally present a saccate or
                    oblongo-ventricose form. The theca itself is a thin membranous cellule, the
                    walls of which are at first of an equal thickness throughout, but in process of
                    development they become gradually thinner, except at the summit, where they
                    retain their original thickness. In some species the wall is remarkably thick at
                    the apex <hi rend="italic">{e. g., Arthonia),</hi> and in others it is invested
                    throughout with a kind of external cuticle <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Pertusaria).</hi> The thecae are resorbed after the expulsion of the spores;
                    though where their walls are extremely thin (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calidum)</hi> they are ruptured and disappear at a very early stage. The <hi
                    rend="italic">spores</hi> are the special reproductive organs of lichens, and
                    are produced in the thecae by free cell-formation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi>
                    by the separation and subsequent condensation of the protoplasm of the fully
                    developed theca around certain points in its interior, corresponding in number
                    to that of the spores to be formed. After the formation of the external
                    spore-wall has taken place, the spores have a definite outline, and may consist
                    of only one cellule or loculus <hi rend="italic">{simple</hi> spores), or may be
                    divided by one or more transverse partitional membranes <hi rend="italic"
                    >{septate</hi> spores). Sometimes the loculi are restricted to the two ends or
                    poles of the spore (one in each) and are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >polari-bilocular,</hi> the two loculi being occasionally united by a
                    longitudinal tube. At other times the transverse partitions are further divided
                    by several longitudinal partitions, in which case the spore is said to be <hi
                    rend="italic">murali-diwted,</hi> from the resemblance it then bears to the
                    stones in a wall. The contents of the spores are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n574/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0574-0555"/> a homogeneous protoplasm, molecular granulations
                    (often abundant), and a pale-yellow oily substance, which in the fully developed
                    spore often becomes condensated into one or more globules, visible generally
                    near its ends or in the middle. The number of the spores in each theca varies
                    very much in different species, being in most lichens 8, occasionally 6, 4 or 2,
                    or rarely only 1. In some species, however, they are 20-100, when the thecae are
                    said to be <hi rend="italic">polysporcd.</hi> In form they are also very
                    variable, the principal shapes assumed by them in order of frequency being <hi
                    rend="italic">ellipsoid, fusiform, oblongo-cylindrical,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sphaeroid,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">acicular,</hi> with several intermediate
                    forms. They are still more variable as to size, being smallest in polyspored <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">fuscata,</hi> &amp;c. ), and
                    largest in monospored species <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Pertusaria communis,</hi>
                    &amp;e.). The largest spores of all are found in <hi rend="italic">Varicellaria
                    amicrosticta,</hi> where they are 0‘225-0 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 030
                    millimetre long, and 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 095-0∙115 millim. thick.
                    As to colour, they are either <hi rend="italic">colourless</hi> (white, nearly
                    hyaline or pale yellow under the microscope), or <hi rend="italic">coloured</hi>
                    (brownish, or brown, or blackish), while in <hi rend="italic">Sphoerophoron</hi>
                    there is also a bluish-black superficial pigment. The spore-wall varies in
                    thickness, and is typically composed of two strata, the outer of which is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">episρore</hi> and is coloured, while the inner is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">endospore</hi> and is colourless, gelatinous, and
                    generally less distinct. Notwithstanding that in these respects the spores are
                    so variable in different species, they are when mature remarkably constant in
                    the same species, so that their characters afford valuable specific diagnoses.
                    Apparently it is only those lichens which germinate from spores that occur in a
                    fertile condition.</p>
                <p>2. The spermogones, which are the presumed male organs of reproduction, at once
                    differ in appearance from the apothecia in being very minute corpuscles. In many
                    cases their outline is invisible to the naked eye, unless the thallus has been
                    previously moistened, when they appear as minute points or papillae. When
                    magnified they externally bear a resemblance to the apothecia of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrenocarpei,</hi> but internally, on microscopical examination,
                    they are seen to differ essentially from these. In form they are nucleiform,
                    round, or oblong, and are either sessile on the surface of the thallus, or more
                    or less immersed in its substance, or sometimes enclosed in prominent thalline
                    verrucae. Usually they are simple, though occasionally two or several become
                    confluent or aggregated into little groups. They almost always occur on the same
                    thallus as the apothecia, or rarely on different thalli <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,
                    Pρhebe</hi><hi rend="italic">pubescens),</hi> so that lichens are consequently
                    monoecious and dioecious. In colour the spermogones are black or brown, or
                    concolorous with the thallus itself. They are composed of two parts, viz., a
                    shell or <hi rend="italic">conceptacle</hi> and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucleus.</hi></p>
                <p>(1) The conceptacle, which is analogous to the hypothecium of the apothecium, is
                    composed of a tissue formed of very small cellules, which are cemented together
                    and have thick walls. The <hi rend="italic">ostiole</hi> at its summit is
                    generally similar to that of nucleiform apothecia, and in the case of entirely
                    immersed spermogones is the only portion visible.</p>
                <p>(2) The nucleus consists of the <hi rend="italic">sterigmata</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">spermatia,</hi> and of a mucilaginous substance (the spermatic
                    gelatin) in the cavity between them, which very greedily imbibes water and aids
                    in the expulsion of the spermatia. Sometimes also there are present in the
                    nucleus a few elongated, articulated, and occasionally branching filaments
                    intermixed with the sterigmata which are comparable with the paraphyses of the
                    apothecia <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Ramalina). (a)</hi> The sterigmata are
                    elongated cellules filled with a colourless fluid, and are attached to the
                    interior face of the conceptacle growing from it con-vergently towards the
                    centre, and often nearly filling its entire cavity. They present two important
                    modifications, viz., <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> sterigmata and <hi
                    rend="italic">articulated</hi> sterigmata or <hi rend="italic"
                    >arthrosterigmata,</hi> both of which may become somewhat branched. When arrived
                    at maturity they possess the faculty of producing from their apices or also from
                    the articuli the spermatia, one at a time, though many in succession, as may be
                    inferred from the immense number of them lying in the cavity of the nucleus. (5)
                    The spermatia are very small, slender, colourless corpuscles, which at first
                    appear as minute protrusions on the apices of the sterigmatic cells. They
                    subsequently become gradually elongated, and, on reaching maturity, detach
                    themselves from the sterigmata and lie free in the cavity of the nucleus, till
                    in wet weather they are expelled through the ostiole of the spermogones. In form
                    they present two principal modifications, viz., <hi rend="italic">acicular</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">ellipsoid,</hi> of which the former, the more frequent, is
                    rather variable. They may be slightly fusiformi-incrassate at one apex <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;,e.g., Usnea),</hi> or at both apices <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Parmelia),</hi> or they may be cylindrical and straight, the most common shape,
                    or cylindrical and arcuate <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Roccella).</hi> The
                    spermatia of arthrosterigmata are cylindrical and straight, but slightly
                    thickened and obtuse at the apices. In size they also vary, though more in
                    length than in thickness, the arcuate spermatia being sometimes very Tong (0Ό40
                    millimetre). These differences in form and size are often very useful in the
                    discrimination of species, just as the two types of the sterigmata are sometimes
                    of great service in the distinction of genera. The spermatia frequently exhibit
                    a Brownian movement, but they possess no faculty of germination, their
                    functions, as generally acknowledged, being the fertilization or fecundation of
                    the spores. That the spermogones are rightly presumed to be the male organs of
                    reproduction may legitimately be inferred alike from their relation to and their
                    antagonism with the apothecia. In the former respect their position on the
                    thallus relatively to the apothecia is similar to that of the sexual organs in
                    other classes of plants; while in the latter respect spermogones are plentiful
                    on thalli destitute of apothecia, and on those with apothecia are much more
                    sparingly present. The manner, however, in which the spermatia impregnate the
                    spores has not yet been definitely ascertained. Most probably, as suggested by
                    Nylander (in <hi rend="italic">Syn,,</hi> p. 40, note 1), the spermatia do not
                    exercise any direct influence on the female organ in the hymenium, but their
                    fecundating influence is rather exercised on the prothalline elements of the
                    growing thallus. Μ. Stahl indeed has recorded and illustrated <hi rend="italic"

                    appearance they resemble to some extent the spermogones, from which, however,
                    they at once differ in their internal organization. They consist of simple
                    filaments composed of narrow (often short) cellules, termed <hi rend="italic"

                    spermatia, has a germinative property. Their occurrence in lichens was first
                    pointed out by Tulasne, who showed their affinity to certain analogous fruits

                    supposed that the pycnides in reality belonged to the same category. From their
                    constant occurrence, however, on the same species, and the evident correlation
                    between them and the accompanying fructifications, as also from the resemblance
                    of their stylospores to the spores of the apothecia, there are good grounds for

                <p>The Gonidia of Lichens.</p>
                <p>In view of the important place occupied by the gonidia in the structure of
                    lichens, and of the discussions that have recently taken place concerning them,
                    they require to be considered somewhat in detail in order that their real nature
                    and relation to the hyphae, or the thalline filaments, may become apparent. The
                    gonidia are spherical, ellipsoid, or variously rounded cellules, with thin,
                    colourless walls composed of cellulose, containing chlorophyll (or a subsimilar
                    colouring matter), homogeneous or granulose, with generally a solid nucleus in
                    the centre. As to the origin of the chlorophyll, it may be observed in passing
                    that this is the same in lichens as in other cryptogamie plants, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> mosses and <hi rend="italic">Hepaticae,</hi> in which
                    it occurs, the only visible difference being that gonidia often occur as
                    discrete cellules. The gonidia increase by binary (very rarely by ternary or
                    quarternary) division, the nucleus also dividing into two portions, each of
                    which forms the centre of a secondary gonidial cellule. In the gonidial stratum,
                    where they are arranged between the radicles of the hyphae, their division
                    necessarily proceeds only slowly, but in ecorticated thalli, leprose and others,
                    in which they are free, they are readily multiplied by repeated division. In
                    gonidia isolated from the thallus of some species belonging to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cladonia, Evernia,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Physcia,</hi> zoospores have been
                    detected by M. Famintzin and M. Boranetzky (see <hi rend="italic">Ann. Sc.
                    Nat.,</hi> 1868, p. 137), and, although Nylander failed to perceive such in
                    subsequent experiments <hi rend="italic">(Flora,</hi> 1877, No. 23), he adds
                    that it is possible they may be generated in free gonidia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(i.e.,</hi> in unstratified thalli), which could not be the case in gonidia
                    closely surrounded by thalline filaments. The subject will well repay further
                    investigation. Other matters relating to the character and relations of the
                    gonidia will be best elucidated by considering the forms which they present, and
                    their origin in the thallus.</p>
                <p>1∙ <hi rend="italic">The Forms of the Gonidia.—</hi> These have been fully
                    treated by Nylander in the <hi rend="italic">Flora, loc. dl,,</hi> where also
                    the first scientific exposition and classification of them have been given.
                    According to the views there propounded, gonidia in their wider acceptation
                    include three very distinct types :—(1) <hi rend="italic">Eugonidia</hi> (or
                    gonidia proper), which are involved in a distinct cellular membrane, and are
                    usually bright green; (2) <hi rend="italic">Gonimia</hi> (or the gonidial
                    granules already mentioned), which are naked, pale greenish, glaucous greenish
                    or bluish; and (3) <hi rend="italic">Gorndιmιa.(or Leptogonidia'),</hi> which
                    are intermediate between the two preceding, smaller, and of an oblong form. Of
                    these the distinction between eugonidia andgonimia is fundamental, and of “so
                    great weight that lichens seem to present a twofold parallel series” • according
                    to the presence of the one or the other in their texture These two different
                    anatomical elements, as observed by Nylander, have a certain biological analogy
                    with the blood globules in animals, •and similarly afford absolute characters.
                    The principal forms presented by these three kinds of gonidia are the following.
                    1. Eugonidia consist of—(a) <hi rend="italic">Ηaplogonidia,</hi> the most
                    frequent, simple, of a protococcoid form, or sometimes glomerulose (as in
                    granuloso-leprose thalli); (δ) <hi rend="italic">Platygonidia,</hi> being
                    depressed and variously membranosely connated gonidia <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Syngonidia},</hi> as in some foliicolous species <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Platygramma phyllosema)</hi>; (e) <hi rend="italic">Chroolepogonidia</hi> (or
                    <hi rend="italic">Ohrysogonidia∖</hi> containing chlorophyll and orange grains
                    (endo-chrorne) in the same cellule, more or less similar to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chroolepa</hi> (as in <hi rend="italic">Gyaleeta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chlorobaea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Arthonia pruiosa, Platygraρha periclea,
                    Verrucaria</hi><hi rend="italic">insiliens,</hi> and the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thelopsis)</hi>; (d) <hi rend="italic">Confervogonidia,</hi> somewhat
                    resembling <hi rend="italic">Confervae,</hi> and forming the chief element of
                    the thallus of <hi rend="italic">Coenogonium.</hi><hi rend="italic">2.</hi>
                    Gonidimia are smaller than gonidia proper, with the wall of the cellules less
                    distinct. They occur in <hi rend="italic">Peltidea, Solorina,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Nephroma</hi><hi rend="italic">expallidum.</hi> To these belong
                    also <hi rend="italic">hymenial gonidia,</hi> which are often very minute, and
                    are present in the thalamium (destitute of paraphyses) of various <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrenocaτpei {e.g., Verrucaria pallida, V. umbrina,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">V. hymenogonia), τa,τe}γ</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Arthoniae</hi>
                    as in <hi rend="italic">A. chroolepida.</hi> 3. Gonimia (including the gonimia
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cephalodia)</hi> consist of—(a) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haplogonimia,</hi> which are somewhat large (very large in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phylliseuni),</hi> and either simple, or two or several aggregated; (δ) <hi
                    rend="italic">Sirogonimia,</hi> which are scytonenιoid or sirosiphoid gonimia,
                    distinguished by the gonimia being tunicated, and are characteristic of the
                    family <hi rend="italic">Ephebacei</hi>; (c) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hormogonimia,</hi> the most common form, smaller, moniliformly arranged, and
                    contained in syngonimia, especially characteristic of the family <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemacei,</hi> whence <hi rend="italic">Collenia</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nostoc)</hi> itself, according to Nylander, is to be considered
                    but as a single syngonimium; (d) <hi rend="italic">Speirogonimia,</hi> which are
                    similar to the preceding, but are not moniliform, with the syngonimia
                    sιιbglobose, smaller and more scattered, as in <hi rend="italic">Omρha∙
                    laria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Synalissa.</hi> It will be perceived from the
                    above that many of these forms are more or less similar to “gonidioid” algae,
                    though, as we shall presently see, they are not identical with these.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">The Origin of the Gonidia.—</hi> By pre-microscopic authors
                    this was a subject necessarily ignored, and indeed it is only within the last
                    thirty years that it has been investigated by lichenists. The earliest theory as
                    to their origin was that propounded by Bayrhoffer <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Einiges</hi><hi rend="italic">ub. d. Lichenen</hi><hi rend="italic">und deren
                    Befruchtung,</hi> 1851), confirmed by observations of Speerschneider <hi
                    rend="italic">{Bot. Zeit.,</hi> 1853, &amp;c.), and supported by Schwendener <hi
                    rend="italic">{Untersuch,</hi><hi rend="italic">ub. d.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Flechtenthallus,</hi> 1868). This was to the effect that the gonidia derived
                    their origin from the hyphae <hi rend="italic">{i.e.,</hi> the thalline
                    filaments), in the way succinctly detailed by Μ. Flies (in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scand.,</hi> 1871, p. 7, where it is fully endorsed). “The hyphae,” he says,
                    “are not only elongated into filaments, but also put forth short branchlets, the
                    terminal cell of which is gradually dilated, becomes subglobose, and is at
                    length filled with chlorophyll (or a subsimilar matter); in a few that (terminal
                    cell) is changed into a gonidium, and then by varied division germinates other
                    gonidia.” For several years this theory was accepted at second-hand by most
                    authors who referred to the subject, though a different origin of the gonidia,
                    presently to be noticed, was indicated by the celebrated Tulasne so early as
                    1852, in his “Mémoire sur les lichens” <hi rend="italic">{Ann. Sc. Nat. ).</hi>
                    The erroneous nature of this theory was well pointed out by Schwendener, who <hi
                    rend="italic">{Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Algentypen</hi><hi rend="italic">d.
                    Flechtengonidien,</hi> 1869) very correctly affirmed that the actual development
                    of a gonidium from the terminal cell of a hypha had not been observed, though,
                    strange to say, he had previously himself observed this phenomenon. Not being
                    able otherwise to account for the origin of the gonidia, and following up one of
                    two alternatives put forward by De Bary <hi rend="italic">{Morpholog.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Physiolog.</hi><hi rend="italic">der
                    Pilze, Flechten,</hi><hi rend="italic">kc.,</hi> 1865, p. 291), he promulgated
                    the hypothesis now familiarly known as Schwendenerism. The conclusion to which
                    De Bary came on noticing the resemblance between the gonidia of <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemaccae</hi> and certain algae was as follows :—“Either the
                    lichens in question,” he says, “are the perfectly developed states of plants,
                    whose imperfect forms have hitherto stood amongst the algae, as <hi
                    rend="italic">Nostocaceae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chroococcaceae,</hi> or
                    these latter are typical algae which assume the forms of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Collema,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ephebe,</hi> &amp;c., through certain parasitic

                    mycelium into the continuously growing thallus, and frequently attached to their
                    phycochrome-bearing cells.” Taking this latter suggestion as his starting point,
                    and assuming the identity of certain algal types with the gonidia of lichens,
                    and the identity of the mycelium of fungi with their hyphae, Schwendener extends
                    the said alternative to various other groups of lichens than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Collemaccae,</hi> and comes to the conclusion that a lichen is
                    composed of a parasitic fungus (the hyphae) and a number of low algae <hi
                    rend="italic">{Chlorophyllaccae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phycochromaccae),</hi> the former of which produces the reproductive bodies and
                    is nourished by the latter. This theory was subsequently expanded and
                    illustrated at length by Bornet <hi rend="italic">{Recherches sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">les Gonidies des Lichens,</hi> 1873), who affirms, as the result
                    of numerous investigations, “that the connexion of the hyphae with the gonidia
                    is of such a nature as to exclude all possibility of the one organ being
                    produced by the other,” and that the theory of parasitism can alone explain it
                    satisfactorily. To give any detailed <pb break="no"

                    and the arguments by which they endeavour to support the hypothesis, would
                    exceed the limits of the present article, even were a∏ other matters relating to
                    lichens to be excluded. Suffice it to state briefly that, according to
                    Schwendenerisrn, a lichen is not an individual plant, but rather a community
                    made up of two different kinds of individuals belonging to two distinct classes
                    of cryptogams, viz., a master-fungus and colonies of algal slaves, which it has
                    sought out, caught hold of, and retains in perpetual captivity in order to
                    provide it with nourishment. To such a singular theory, which from its
                    plausibility has met with considerable support in certain quarters, various <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> objections of great validity may be taken. Amongst
                    others which have been adduced two may especially be noticed, having reference
                    to the nature of this alleged parasitism, and the situations in which lichens
                    are found. (1) The parasitism described is of a kind unknown in the vegetable
                    kingdom, inasmuch as the host <hi rend="italic">(the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Algae),</hi> instead of suffering any injury, only flourishes the more
                    vigorously. Moreover, the algal slaves being entirely enclosed in the
                    masterfungus, can evidently supply no nourishment to it whatever, while direct
                    observation shows that it is through the surface of the thallus of the lichen
                    that nourishment is conveyed to the gonidial stratum, where the active life
                    chiefly has its seat. (2) As is well known, lichens shun such habitats as are
                    most frequented by algae and fungi, and occur in situations where neither of
                    these are seen. Where then are the algal colonies which, according to the
                    hypothesis, the fungus goes forth in quest of, and “presses into its service”?
                    Either of these arguments is sufficient to throw more than doubt upon
                    Schwendenerisrn. At the same time, as will be perceived, the origin of the
                    gonidia in the thallus remains to be accounted for, in order that the hypothesis
                    may be utterly subverted. It might at first sight be supposed that this was a
                    matter of no very great difficulty, since by cultivating lichens from the spores
                    it would readily become apparent. All attempts, however, in this direction (and
                    many such have recently been made) have, owing to the peculiar character and
                    conditions of lichen-growth, confessedly proved futile, and the experiments
                    instituted have been productive of no definite results. This is not altogether
                    to be regretted, since in nature itself, when lichens occur on certain
                    substrata, we have in various instances the whole process of the evolution of
                    their vegetative system placed before our eyes, from the first germinations of
                    the spores to the formation of the perfect thallus. It is to N ylander, whose
                    services here as elsewhere in lichenological science— structural, physiological,
                    and systematic—are so valuable, that we owe the first clear enunciation as to
                    the origin of the gonidia in the lichen - thallus.</p>
                <p>This, though previously indicated by him, as we shall presently see, was at
                    greater length and still more definitely stated in several important papers in
                    <hi rend="italic">the Flora,</hi> viz., “De gonidiis et eorum formis
                    animadversiones” (1877, No. 23), “Circa lichenes vitricolas notula” (1879, No.
                    19), and “De hypothallo notula” (1879, No. 36). In these he incontrovertibly
                    demonstrates that the gonidia originate, not from the filaments themselves, but
                    in the cellules of the first cortical glomerules which are produced upon the
                    young hypothallus. This may very easily be studied in the earlier stages of
                    development of crustaceous lichens growing on pure quartz rocks <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., Lecidea</hi><hi rend="italic">geographica),</hi> on the
                    smooth bark of young trees <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora subfusca),</hi> and
                    more especially on the surface of old glass <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora
                    galactina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lecidea alboatra).</hi> In the case of the
                    young thalli of <hi rend="italic">Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">cinerea</hi>
                    this was sufficiently well delineated by the celebrated Tulasne in 1852, the
                    year subsequent to the promulgation of the Bayrhofferian theory, in his
                    elaborate “Mémoire sur les Lichens,” pl. iii. f. 3. Afterwards, as the evolution
                    of the cortical stratum advances, its lower portion is resorbed, and the gonidia
                    there become free, giving rise to the gonidial stratum, to the hyphae in which
                    they are not <hi rend="italic">adnate,</hi> as has been represented, but only
                    adherent by means of the gelatin which penetrates all the elements of the
                    lichen. Often also growing gonidia, young and adult, may be observed in the
                    pseudo-parenchymatous cortical cellules in lichens which in this respect are
                    best adapted for examination, such as <hi rend="italic">Umbilicaria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(vide</hi> Nylander in <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi> 1875, p.
                    303), <hi rend="italic">Physcia</hi><hi rend="italic">pulverulenta,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Psoroma hypnomιm,</hi> &amp;c. Similarly, with respect to the
                    origin of thegonimia, Nylander observes <hi rend="italic">(Flora,</hi> 1868, p.
                    353) that the isidia in the <hi rend="italic">Collemacei</hi> (more especially
                    in <hi rend="italic">Collema)</hi> “show very clearly under the microscope the
                    entire history of the evolution of the thallus from its first origin from a
                    cellule containing a single gonimium to a minute true nostoc, and ultimately to
                    the perfect texture of a <hi rend="italic">Collema.”</hi> With these facts
                    before us, to which various others might be added, such as the entire absence of
                    any algals on pure substrata, where lichen growth presents itself in all its
                    stages, we are compelled to come to the conclusion that the gonidia constitute a
                    true organic system in lichens, and in nature are nowhere seen outside the
                    thallus. Consequently those free algal forms, such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Protococcus,</hi> &amp;c., regarded as the free gonidia of lichens, are true
                    algae, there being indeed a parallelism between them but no identity. On the
                    other hand, as to the alleged identity of the liehen-hypha with a
                    fungus-mycelium, it is to be observed that the two are totally different in
                    their nature. The hyphae of lichens <hi rend="italic">(myelohyphae</hi> of
                    Nylander) are rigid, elastic, containing lichenine, not becoming putrid by
                    maceration, with no faculty of penetrating or involving, while the hyphae of
                    fungi are caducous, soft, flexile, with thin walls, &amp;c. Hence, as there is
                    no algal in the lichen, so neither is there any fungus, though there is a
                    parallelism between the fructification of lichens and the ascifer∙ ous section
                    of fungi (Crombie in <hi rend="italic">Pop. Sc. Rev.,</hi> 1874).</p>
                <p>Nutrition and Life of Lichens.</p>
                <p>As already intimated, lichens derive their nourishment directly from the
                    atmosphere, in the shape of rain (or dew) with the materials contained in it.
                    Here, as elsewhere, water is the condition of life, and through its medium is
                    conveyed to them the nutrient substances requisite for their existence and
                    growth, from the clouds, from rivers, and, in the case of maritime species, even
                    from the sea. Where, however, the atmosphere is impregnated with smoke, soot, or
                    other deleterious ingredients, lichens will not grow nor flourish. Hence in our
                    larger cities, or even in smaller manufacturing towns, scarcely any lichen
                    vegetation, or none whatever, is seen. Even in their more immediate suburban
                    districts they occur only in a gonidial or rudimentary state, constituting the
                    pseudo-genus <hi rend="italic">Lepraria</hi> of the older botanists, and
                    increasing through long periods by bisection, but never developing into perfect
                    plants. Indeed it is now a well-known fact that their fully developed condition
                    is a sure indication of the purity of the air and the salubrity of the districts
                    in which they occur. It has sometimes been stated that they draw some portion at
                    least of their nutriment from the substratum to which they are affixed. For
                    this, however, their structure is by no means well adapted, and such inorganic
                    substances as iron and lime, which enter into their composition, are only as if
                    mechanically derived in solution from the substratum. This in very many
                    instances, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> bare quartzose rocks, dead sapless wood,
                    and pure naked glass, can evidently supply no nutriment whatever. Moreover, in
                    the case of crustaceous species, such as <hi rend="italic">Lecanora
                    tαrtarea,</hi> &lt;fcc., and also of terricole fruticulose species, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Cetraria</hi><hi rend="italic">islaηdica,</hi> &amp;c., the
                    portion of the thallus next to the substratum is dead, so that no nutrient
                    substances can be conveyed through it to the upper layers of the thallus. A very
                    simple, but at the same time convincing, illustration of this is adduced by
                    Nylander. “By immersing,” he says, “any fruticulose thallus, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Usnea,</hi> by the base in water, it remains entirely dry (with
                    the exception of the part submersed), but if water be poured over the other
                    portions, it quickly absorbs it, softens, and revives.” The same thing may be
                    seen in nature itself, in the case of such species as <hi rend="italic">Cladina
                    rangiferina, Alectoria ochroleuca, Platysma</hi><hi rend="italic">nivale,</hi>
                    &lt;fcc., growing on temporarily wet substrata, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n577/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0577-0558"/> when the base of their thalli is soft and moist,
                    and all the rest dry and rigid. It cannot therefore be doubted that the
                    nutritive elements contained in the rain or other water are conveyed to the
                    lichen through the surface of the thallus. It is in the superficial parts also,
                    as Nylander has well observed <hi rend="italic">(in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Plora,</hi> 1874, No. 4), that “the active life has its seat, chiefly around
                    the gonidia, manifesting itself in the putting forth of young parts (lobes,
                    laciniae, branches, isidia), and in the functions of the apothecia and the
                    spermogones, so that the nourishing humours necessary for all the actions of
                    life are especially and directly poured upon these.” The vital activities,
                    however, in lichens thus nourished are, as might be expected from the nature of
                    the source whence their nutriment is derived, very intermittent, and in dry
                    weather cease to operate, and become entirely dormant. Hence their life, unlike
                    that of all other plants, is twofold, viz., one <hi rend="italic">active,</hi>
                    in which when moistened all the vegetative and reproductive functions are at
                    work, and the other <hi rend="italic">passive,</hi> in which when dry these
                    functions are completely in abeyance. For such a peculiar duplex existence, at
                    one time vegetating, at another lethargic, their organization in all its parts,
                    gonidial and otherwise, is admirably adapted. More especially is this the case
                    with respect to the lichenine found in their textures, which, being readily
                    dried and as readily moistened, enables them to resist with impunity the
                    greatest extremes of temperature, alternate periods of drought and wet, the
                    scorching heat of the sun, the vehemence of stormy winds, and the nipping frosts
                    of winter.</p>
                <p>In this fitful and abnormal life of lichens we have the explanation in a great
                    measure of their almost indefinite duration of existence. It is well known that
                    they are perennial plants in the widest sense of the term, and that, though in
                    the earlier stages of their existence their growth is comparatively rapid, yet
                    this becomes extremely slow when they arrive at a certain age. The time required
                    for the development of even the most rapidly growing species may be calculated
                    by the appearance of such of these as are met with on gravestones, mortar of
                    houses, stone walls, wooden palings, and such like, the date of whose erection
                    is known. Amongst other instances which have come under the present writer’s own
                    observation may be adduced the case of <hi rend="italic">Physcia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parietina,</hi> growing in fair quantity on the stones of a
                    granite wall built in 1836 in a maritime district where the plant is extremely
                    abundant, and where atmospherical and other conditions are well suited for its
                    growth. In a recent visit to the spot it was found that, although the thallus is
                    now well developed, no fructification whatever is visible, though traces of
                    spermogones are beginning to appear, so that in the space of forty-five years
                    this plant has not yet attained full maturity. But slow as is the growth of
                    lichens after a certain stage of their development, their tenacity of life is
                    very remarkable, as might <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> be inferred from their
                    capacity of enduring without injury the greatest extremes of temperature and of
                    hygrometrical conditions. It is on record that, after the lapse of nearly half a
                    century, the same specimen on the same spot of the same tree has been observed
                    without any change in its condition. On this point also E. Fries (in <hi
                    rend="italic">L. E.,</hi> p. xlv.) notices that certain species such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Physcia</hi><hi rend="italic">ciliaris,</hi> kept in houses for
                    upwards of a year, revive when again exposed to the influences of the
                    atmosphere,—an observation which in the case of <hi rend="italic">Cladina
                    rangiferina</hi> similarly kept for a still longer period the present writer can
                    fully corroborate. Endowed then with this singular intermittent vitality, we can
                    easily understand how many individuals which occur on hard mountainous rocks or
                    on the trunks of aged trees in ancient forests are in all probability many
                    hundreds of years old. Nor does age seem in any way to weaken their fecundity,
                    even when the thallus has apparently ceased to grow. This, as observed by
                    Nylander (in <hi rend="italic">Syn.,</hi> p. 5), is shown from the circumstance
                    that were it otherwise “the already old fruits would be destitute of spores,
                    which is never the case,” unless in plants of some lower tribes, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g., Graρhidei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Verrucaiiae,</hi> in
                    which the thallus is but sparingly gonidiose, and the life consequently is
                    shorter. In other instances the central portion of the thallus sometimes
                    normally perishes in old plants, as in <hi rend="italic">Pterygium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">centrifugum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Collema</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    and <hi rend="italic">P. saxatilis,</hi> leaving only peripherical circles, in
                    which, however, the life of the individual still continues for ages. In fact,
                    “the life of lichens bears in itself no cause of death, and is only to be ended
                    by external injuries ”(E. Fries, <hi rend="italic">L. E., loc. citf),</hi> or by
                    the alteration of climatic and atmospherical conditions. Hence the assumption is
                    not unwarrantable that individuals of such confessedly long-lived species as <hi

                    upon the summits of lofty mountains, date from more than “fabulous epochs,” and
                    probably outrival in longevity the ages assigned to the oldest trees on the
                    surface of the globe.</p>

                    rend="italic">Chemistry of Lichens.—</hi> This is still but little understood,
                    notwithstanding that the subject has been more or less investigated by authors.
                    Their examinations, however, have been too limited and desultory to enable us to
                    give any detailed account of the different principles which enter into the
                    composition of the lichen tissues. Moreover, with respect to those species which
                    have been more particularly analysed, they have sometimes employed not only the
                    same terms in different senses, but also different terms to denote the same
                    substance. There can, however, be no doubt that the chemical composition of
                    lichens not only produces great modifications in their form, but also
                    considerable diversities in their properties.</p>
                <p>The principal substance which occurs in lichens, especially in such as are
                    foliaceous and fruticulose, is <hi rend="italic">lichenine—</hi> a special kind
                    of gelatin peculiar to them. It is intermediate in character between dextrin and
                    starch, and very eagerly imbibes water, though if boiled in water it is
                    dissolved and lost. <hi rend="italic">Starch</hi> also very rarely occurs in
                    large lenticular grains scattered in the tissues. In crustaceous lichens <hi
                    rend="italic">oxalate of lime</hi> predominates, and forms a large proportion of
                    the thallus, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> 65 per cent, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">esculenta</hi> according to Goebel. <hi
                    rend="italic">Chlorophyll</hi> and its modification <hi rend="italic"
                    >phycochrome</hi> are found in lichens only in relatively small quantities, as
                    is also the case with most of the other principles they present. These are
                    enumerated by Nylander (in <hi rend="italic">Syn.,</hi> p. 51) according to the
                    affinities they bear, as follows:—(1) phosphate of lime, sea-salt, manganese,
                    iron; (2) picrolichenine, variolarine, orceine, cetrarine, inuline, erythrine,
                    roccelline, picroerythrine; (3) gyτophoric acid, parellic acid, usneic acid,
                    orceic acid, erythrinic acid; (4) sugar not crystallizable, oil, waxy matter,
                    resinous matter. Several others, especially phosphates and acids, have been
                    enumerated by authors, which in some instances have not been corroborated, and
                    in others are doubtfully distinct. In illustration of the manner in which
                    several of these principles enter into the composition of lichens, we may adduce
                    the analyses given in one or two species which have been more fully subjected to
                    experiment. In <hi rend="italic">Cetraria</hi><hi rend="italic">islandica</hi>
                    there have been detected <hi rend="italic">starch,</hi> including lichenine and
                    inuline, to the extent of 80 per cent.; <hi rend="italic">gummy</hi> and <hi

                    >Physcia</hi><hi rend="italic">parietina</hi> there have been found several
                    alimentary principles, as <hi rend="italic">gliadine, starch, sugar, gum</hi>;
                    several medicinal substances, as <hi rend="italic">resin, bitter matter, gallic
                    acid,</hi> and a peculiar ethereal <hi rend="italic">oil</hi>; a yellow
                    colouring matter called <hi rend="italic">chrysophanic acid</hi>; also <hi
                    rend="italic">wax, stearine,</hi> and some salts, as <hi rend="italic">carbonate
                    of lime.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">ash</hi> of lichens is said to constitute
                    from 8 to 10 per cent, of their bulk, and consists of various earthy bases, such
                    as potash, soda, lime, magnesia, alumina, silica, manganese, and peroxide of
                    iron, in combination with various acids, such as carbonic, phosphoric,
                    sulphuric, and hydrochloric. The whole subject, however, of the chemistry of
                    lichens requires to be investigated in a more extensive and methodical manner
                    than has hitherto been done either by chemists or lichenists.</p>

                    These have reference to the thallus and the apothecia, and in both respects
                    afford valuable assistance in the systematic study of lichens, (a) <hi
                    rend="italic">Thalline</hi> reactions depend upon the presence in the thallus of
                    certain colourable materials in the form of acids, and are manifested on the
                    application of hydrate of potash and the hypochlorite of lime either on the
                    tortical stratum or the medulla. Of these reagents, hydrate of potash (K),
                    composed of equal weights of caustic potash and water, and hypochlorite of lime
                    (CaCl), composed of chloride of lime and water of any strength, may give certain
                    reactions or none, according to the presence or absence of particular acids in
                    the thallus. If no reaction takes place, this is denoted by K -, CaCl -, and
                    similarly if there is reaction by K +, CaCl +. A very convenient mode of
                    symbolizing the positive and negative reactions of the cortical layer and the
                    medulla of the same species is to place the reaction of the former above the
                    latter, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> K±, CaClψ, denoting that with K the
                    cortical stratum shows reaction and the medulla none, while with CaCl the
                    cortical stratum gives none, but the medulla a distinct reaction. Again, there
                    is often no reaction produced by K alone, but if CaCl be added to it while still
                    moist, a decided reaction appears, for which K(CaCl) + is the symbol; or, on the
                    other hand, the reaction given by K may be neutralized by the immediate
                    application of CaCl, in which case it is expressed by K + (CaCl) -. The positive
                    reactions are due to the presence of particular acids in the thallus, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">erythrinic</hi> acid giving a crimson reaction with CaCl, <hi
                    rend="italic">chrysophanic</hi> acid giving a purple reaction with K, <hi
                    rend="italic">glaucinic</hi> acid giving a yellow reaction with CaCl, and <hi
                    rend="italic">lecaιwric</hi> acid giving a citrine reaction with K. In most
                    cases where the natural colour of the thallus (often also of the medulla) is
                    yellow or orange, chrysophanic acid is present, and with K gives a purple
                    reaction <hi rend="italic">∖e.g., Physcia lychnea),</hi> but in others
                    externally similar in colour and general appearance, where only <hi
                    rend="italic">lecithophanic</hi> acid is present <hi rend="italic">(p.g.,
                    Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">laciniosa),</hi> K gives no reaction whatever.
                    Sometimes K produces at first a yellow colour which immediately changes into a
                    red or purple, as in <hi rend="italic">Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cinerea,</hi> which at once enables us to distinguish it from the closely
                    allied species <hi rend="italic">L.</hi><hi rend="italic">gibbosa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">L. calcarea.</hi> A solution of iodine (I) is also in certain
                    cases useful as a test on the medulla, and in the discrimination of some species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Collenia.</hi> The value of these chemical tests in lichens
                    was first pointed out by Nylander in <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi> 1866, pp.
                    223, 224, was subsequently illustrated by him in <hi rend="italic">Flora,</hi>
                    1869, <hi rend="italic">passim,</hi> in the case of species belonging to various
                    genera, and has since been generally acknowledged by lichenists and employed by
                    them in all specific diagnoses. They are unquestionably most important, not only
                    in the discrimination of many difficult and closely allied species, but also in
                    enabling us to refer with certainty varieties to the species to which they
                    properly belong. Nay, even a small fragment of the thallus, whether sterile or
                    fertile, may by their aid be readily determined, while otherwise it would be
                    either quite indeterminable or doubtful. Generally they may be obtained on any
                    portion of the thallus, but they are frequently more vivid, as might be
                    expected, in the growing or circumferential portions. It is, however, only
                    immediate reactions which depend on the colouring matter contained in the
                    cortical stratum and the medulla that are to be attended to, and not secondary
                    or tardy reactions which may otherwise originιte, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    from the dissolution of the chlorophyll of the gonidia. At the same time it is
                    to be observed, in order to prevent a misconception which has occasionally been
                    entertained, that they do not <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> constitute a special
                    <hi rend="italic">specific</hi> character, but only an additional and
                    confirmatory specific character. As such their value is clearly apparent in
                    cases where the external characters are similar or approximate, and doubt
                    necessarily exists as to their specific value, (δ) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apothecial</hi> reactions for the most part take place either externally on the
                    epithecium or internally on the hymenial gelatin. The reactions of the
                    epithecium are generally produced by K on species which have yellow or orange
                    apothecia <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora auranliaca, Leeidea
                    leucoxantha),</hi> while others with concolorous apothecia <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g., Lecanora epanora, Lecidea</hi><hi rend="italic">lucida)</hi> give no
                    reaction whatever, owing to the presence or absence of chrysophanic acid. In
                    certain cases also the reaction with CaCl is very useful in enabling us to
                    separate closely allied species with similar apothecia, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    Lecanora subcarnea</hi> (epithecium CaCl-) from <hi rend="italic">L.
                    glaucoma</hi> (epithecium CaCl + yellow). Again, with respect to the reaction of
                    the hymenial gelatin, this, as already observed, depends on the application of a
                    solution of iodine. The formula by which the solution is to be prepared
                    is—iodine, gr. j.; iodide of potash, gr. iij; distilled water, ⅜ ounce. In most
                    lichens, where the spores are mature, this solution will tinge the hymenial
                    gelatin in some cases only blue, in others at first blue and then wine-red, and
                    in others wine-red or tawny wine-coloured only, without any preceding blue
                    tinge. In such instances the reaction obtained is often very useful as a
                    confirmatory specific character. Sometimes, however, the blue reaction takes
                    place only on the thecae <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Pertusaria, Cladonia,</hi>
                    &amp;c.), and at other times only on the epispore <hi rend="italic"
                    >(e.g.,</hi><hi rend="italic">Graphis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thelotrema,
                    kc.</hi>). In the case of some species belonging to the inferior genera the
                    reaction with I is especially valuable for the assistance it lends in
                    distinguishing them from certain pyrenomycetous fungi, to which otherwise they
                    might be supposed to belong. True, in some fungi <hi rend="italic">(c.g.,
                    Peziza)</hi> we obtain a reaction with I, and in some lichens we have no
                    reaction visible; but otherwise in such exceptional instances their respective
                    anatomical characters readily show to which class they belong.</p>
                <p>Economic Uses of Lichens.</p>
                <p>These are intimately connected with their chemical constituents, and are in some
                    respects very important. In the arts, as food and as medicine, many of them have
                    been highly esteemed, though others are not now employed for the same purposes
                    as formerly.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lichens Used in the Arts.—</hi> Of these the most important
                    are such as yield, by maceration in ammonia, the valuable dyes known iu commerce
                    as archil, cudbear, and litmus. These, however, may with propriety be regarded
                    as but different names for the same pigmentary substance, the variations in the
                    character of which are attributable to the different modes in which the pigments
                    are manufactured. Archil proper is derived from several species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Roccella (e.g., R. Moηtaguei, R. tiηctοriα),</hi> which yield a
                    rich purple dye and fetch a high price in the market. Of considerable value is
                    the “perelle” prepared from <hi rend="italic">Lecanora parella,</hi> and much
                    used in the preparation of a red or crimson dye. Inferior to this is “cudbear,”
                    derived from <hi rend="italic">Lecanora tartarea,</hi> which was formerly very
                    extensively employed by the peasantry’of north Europe for giving a scarlet or
                    purple colour to woollen cloths. By adding certain alkalies to the other
                    ingredients used in the preparation of these pigments, the colour becomes
                    indigoblue, in which case it is the litmus of the Dutch manufacturers. Amongst
                    other lichens affording red, purple, or brown dyes may be mentioned <hi
                    rend="italic">Ramalina</hi><hi rend="italic">scopulorum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Parmelia</hi><hi rend="italic">saxatilis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P.

                    scruposa,</hi> all of which are more or less employed as domestic dyes. Yellow
                    dyes, again, are derived from <hi rend="italic">Chlorea tηιlρina, Platysma
                    jτιηiperiηum, Parmelia caperata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">P. conspersa,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Physcia flavicαns, Ph.</hi><hi rend="italic">parietina,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Ph. lychnea,</hi> though like the preceding they do not form
                    articles of commerce, being merely used locally by the natives of the regions in
                    which they occur most plentifully. In addition to these, many exotic lichens,
                    belonging especially to <hi rend="italic">Parmelia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sticta (e.g., Parmelia</hi><hi rend="italic">tinctorum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sticta αrgyracea),</hi> are rich in colorific matter, and, if obtained in
                    sufficient quantity, would yield a dye in every way equal to archil. These
                    pigments primarily depend upon special acids contained in the thalli of lichens,
                    and their presence may readily be detected by means of the reagents already
                    noticed. In the process of manufacture, however, they undergo various changes,
                    of which the chemistry is still but little understood. At one time also some
                    species were used in the arts for supplying a gum as a substitute for

                    matter (of a much inferior quality, however, to gum-arabic), and were employed
                    in the process of calico-printing and in the making of parchment and cardboard.
                    In the 17th century some filamentose and fruticulose lichens, viz., species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Usnea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ramalina,</hi> also <hi

                    rangiferina,</hi> were used in the art of perfumery. From their supposed
                    aptitude to imbibe and retain odours, their powder was the basis of various
                    perfumes, such as the celebrated “Poudre de Cypre” of the hairdressers, but
                    their employment in this respect has long since been abandoned.</p>

                    capacity of many species for supplying food for man and beast. This results from

                    saccharine <pb break="no"

                    useful nutritious species is <hi rend="italic">Cetraria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >islandica,</hi> “Iceland moss,” which, after being deprived of its bitterness
                    by boiling in water, is reduced to a powder and made into cakes, or is boiled
                    and eaten with milk by the poor Icelander, whose sole food it often constitutes.
                    Similarly <hi rend="italic">Cladina rangi-feriηa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cl.
                    sylvatica,</hi> the familiar “reindeer moss,” are frequently eaten by man in
                    times of scarcity, after being powdered and mixed with flour. Their chief
                    importance, however, is that in Lapland and other northern countries they supply
                    the winter food of the reindeer and other animals, who scrape away the snow and
                    eagerly feed upon them. Another nutritious lichen is the “Tripe de Roche” of the
                    Arctic regions, consisting of several species of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gyrophorei,</hi> which when boiled is often eaten by the Canadian hunters and
                    Red Indians when pressed by hunger. But the most singular esculent lichen of all
                    is the “manna lichen,” which in times of drought and famine has served as food
                    for large numbers of men and cattle in the arid steppes of various countries
                    stretching from Algiers to Tartary. This is derived chiefly from <hi
                    rend="italic">Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">esculenta,</hi> which grows
                    unattached on the ground in layers from 3 to 6 inches thick over large tracts of
                    country in the form of small irregular lumps of a greyish or white colour.
                    Speaking of the distribution of these nutritive lichens, whose qualities depend
                    on the presence of amylaceous matter, Dr Lindsay (in <hi rend="italic">Pop.
                    Hist. Brit. Lich.,</hi> p. 82) very appropriately remarks that, “by a beautiful
                    provision of nature, they occur precisely under the circumstances where they are
                    most wanted—in northern or arctic countries, or. on arid steppes, where grain
                    stuffs are unknown, and food of a better kind is often scarce or deficient.” In
                    connexion with their use as food we may observe that of recent years in
                    Scandinavia and Russia an alcoholic spirit has been distilled from <hi
                    rend="italic">Cladina raηgiferiηa</hi> and extensively consumed, especially in
                    seasons when potatoes were scarce and dear. Formerly also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sticta</hi><hi rend="italic">pulmonaria</hi> was much employed in brewing
                    instead of hops, and it is said that a Siberian monastery was much celebrated
                    for its beer which was flavoured with the bitter principle of this species.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Medicinal Lichens.—</hi> During the Middle Ages, and even in
                    some quarters to a much later period, lichens were extensively used in medicine
                    in various European countries. Many species had a great repute as demulcents,
                    febrifuges, astringents, tonics, purgatives, and anthelmintics. The chief of
                    those employed for one or other, and in some cases for several, of these
                    purposes were <hi rend="italic">Cladonia pyxidata</hi><hi rend="italic

                    were believed to be endowed with specific virtues, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,
                    Peltigera canina,</hi> which formed the basis of the celebrated “pulvis
                    antilyssus” of Dr Mead, long regarded as a sovereign cure for hydrophobia <hi
                    rend="italic">; Platysma juniperinum,</hi> lauded as a specific in jaundice, no
                    doubt on the <hi rend="italic">similia similibus</hi> principle from a

                    rend="italic">Peltidea</hi><hi rend="italic">aphthosa,</hi> which on the same
                    principle was regarded by the Swedes, when boiled in milk, as an effectual
                    remedy for the <hi rend="italic">aphthae</hi> or rash on their children. Almost
                    all of these virtues, general or specific, were imaginary; and at the present
                    day, except perhaps in some remoter districts of northern Europe, only one of
                    them is employed as a remedial agent. This is the “Iceland moss” of the
                    druggists’ shops, which is undoubtedly an excellent demulcent in various
                    dyspeptic and chest complaints. Probably also <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pertusaria</hi><hi rend="italic">amara,</hi> from the intensely bitter
                    principle which it contains, might still with propriety be employed as a
                    febrifuge. No lichen is known to be possessed of any poisonous properties,
                    although <hi rend="italic">Chlorea νulpina</hi> is believed by the Swedes to be
                    destructive to wolves when powdered and “mixed with pounded glass.” Nor are
                    lichens, as has sometimes been alleged, injurious to the trees upon which they
                    grow, except to a very limited extent. Not being parasites properly so called,
                    the only injury they can inflict upon them is by slightly interfering with the
                    functions of respiration, or, when growing very crowdedly upon the branches of
                    orchard trees, by checking the development of buds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Classification of Lichens.</hi></p>
                <p>From the time of Acharius, the father of lichenological science, different
                    authors have proposed different classifications of lichens, according to the
                    degree of importance attached by them to one or other of their vegetative and
                    reproductive organs. Most of these classifications, however, whether proposed by
                    microscopical or pre-microscopical lichenists, have been too artificial and
                    arbitrary, and indeed less natural in various ways than that originally
                    propounded by Acharius. Of recent years they have been entirely superseded by
                    other two systems, viz., that of the Massalongo-Koerberian and that of the
                    Nylanderian school. With respect to the former of these, its characteristic
                    feature is the prominence which it assigns to the form and structure of the
                    spores not only in the differentiation of species but also in the foundation of
                    genera. Though it has been adopted, with various modifications, by many
                    Continental lichenists, yet essentially it also proceeds on an artificial
                    principle, and necessitates the adoption of far too many genera, distinguished
                    from each other merely by slight differences in the spores. The other
                    system—that of Nylander, which was first proposed by him in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essai</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">une</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelle</hi><hi rend="italic">Classification des Lichens</hi>
                    (1854-55),—has since then commended itself more and more to the acceptation of
                    lichenists, so that even the disciples of the opposite school (the sporologists)
                    have in many respects gradually approximated towards it in their most recent
                    writings. Not only is it the only complete system of classification yet wrought
                    out; it is also the most natural and philosophical of any hitherto propounded.
                    In its main outline it proceeds upon the principle of showing the near relation
                    of certain lichens to some genera of algae on the one hand, and of certain other
                    lichens to some genera of fungi on the other hand, and connects these three
                    great classes of cryptogams together by a sort of twofold chain, commencing with
                    those genera of lichens nearest allied to the algae, working up to those genera
                    best developed <hi rend="italic">(Stictei),</hi> and thence retrograding and
                    terminating with those nearest allied to the fungi. His genera also are
                    principally founded, not upon a single special character, but upon the combined
                    anatomical characters presented by the thallus, the apothecia, and the
                    spermogones. It may here be further observed that we are indebted to the same
                    accomplished lichenist for the succinct but comprehensive diagnoses, generic and
                    specific, of the different parts of a lichen, which have tended so much to
                    facilitate their systematic study. The following is a conspectus of the
                    Nylanderian classification of lichens, with the leading characters of the
                    different families and tribes, and an enumeration of all the principal genera of

                <p>These two subjects are intimately related and present many interesting features
                    which here we can only very generally notice without entering into details.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Habitats of Lichens.—</hi> These are extremely varied, and
                    comprehend a great number of very different substrata. Chiefly, however, they
                    are the bark of trees, rocks, the ground, mosses, and, rarely, perennial leaves.
                    (a) With respect to <hi rend="italic">corticole</hi> lichens, some prefer the
                    rugged bark of old trees <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Ramalina, Parmelia,
                    Stictei)</hi> and others the smooth bark of young trees and shrubs <hi

                    Many are found principally in large forests (e.y., <hi rend="italic">Esnea,
                    Λlectoria</hi><hi rend="italic">jubata)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while a few

                    former belong such as are found on calcareous and cretaceous rocks, and the

                    saxicole lichens may be regarded as belonging to the latter, whatever may be the
                    mineralogical character of the substratum. It is here worthy of notice that the
                    apothecia of several calcicole lichens <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Lecanora
                    Prevostii</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">Lecidea
                    calcivora)</hi> have the power (through the carbonic acid received from the
                    atmosphere) of forming minute faveoli in the rock, in which they are partially
                    buried, (c) With respect to <hi rend="italic">tcrricole</hi> species, some
                    prefer peaty soil <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Cladonia, Lecidea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">decolorans),</hi> others calcareous soil <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,

                    >;</hi> while many may be found growing on all kinds of soil, from the sands of
                    the sea-shore to the granitic detritus of lofty mountains, with the exception of
                    course of cultivated ground, there being no agrarian lichens, <hi rend="italic"
                    >{d) Muscicole</hi> lichens again are such as are most frequently met with on
                    decayed mosses and jungermannias, whether on the ground, trees, or rocks <hi
                    rend="italic">{e-g., Leptogium muscicola, Gomphillus calicioides). {e)</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">epiphyllous</hi> species are very peculiar as occurring upon
                    perennial leaves of certain trees and shrubs, whose vitality is not at all
                    affected by their presence as it is by that of fungi. In so far, however, as is
                    known, they are very limited in number (e.y., <hi rend="italic">Lecidea
                    Douteillei, Strigula).</hi> With the exceptions of these last, it is to be
                    observed that all the rest may, under different conditions of locality and
                    climate, be found growing for the most part indiscriminately on the substrata
                    mentioned, a normally saxicole species becoming corticole, a terricole one
                    becoming muscicole, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Amongst other
                    instances of this that might be adduced, the case of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lecidea</hi><hi rend="italic">geographica,</hi> a peculiarly saxicole species,
                    growing on the stems of <hi rend="italic">Rhododendron</hi> in the Tyrolese
                    Alps, and that of <hi rend="italic">Lecidea mvulosa,</hi> a like peculiarly
                    saxicole species, growing on the bark of trees in Germany, are especially
                    striking. Sometimes also various lichens occur abnormally in such unexpected
                    habitats as dried dung of sheep, bleached bones of reindeer and whales, old
                    leather, iron, and glass, in districts where the species are abundant.
                    Consequently it is apparent that in many cases lichens are quite indifferent to
                    the substrata on which they occur, whence we infer that the preference of
                    several for certain substrata depends upon the temperature of the locality or
                    that of the special habitat. Thus in the case of saxicole lichens the
                    mineralogical character of the rock has of itself little or no influence upon
                    lichen growth, which is influenced more especially and directly by their
                    physical properties, such as their aptitude for imbibing and retaining heat and
                    moisture. As a rule lichens have a propensity for open exposed habitats, though
                    some are found only or chiefly in shady situations; while, as already observed,
                    scarcely any occur where the atmosphere is impregnated with smoke. Many species
                    also prefer growing in moist places by streams, lakes, and the sea, though very
                    few are normally, and probably none entirely, <hi rend="italic">aquatic,</hi>
                    being always at certain seasons exposed for a longer or shorter period to the
                    atmosphere <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Lichina, Leptogium rivulare, Endocarpon
                    fluviatile, Verrucama maura).</hi> Some species are entirely parasitical on
                    other lichens <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> various <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lecideae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pyrenocarpei),</hi> and may be peculiar to
                    one <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Lecidea vitellinaria)</hi> or common to several
                    species (e.y., <hi rend="italic">Habrothallus ρarmeliarum).</hi> A few,
                    generally known as <hi rend="italic">erratic</hi> species, have been met with
                    growing unattached to any substratum <hi rend="italic">{e.g., Parmelia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">revoluta,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">concentrica,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lecanora</hi><hi rend="italic">esculenta)</hi>; but it seems
                    somewhat doubtful if these are really free <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi

                    with respect to exposure, moisture, &amp;c., that the variability observed in
                    many types of lichens is to be attributed. The fact also that in numerous
                    instances they are so indifferent to the nature of their habitats clearly shows
                    that they do not at all depend upon the substratum for their nourishment.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Distribution of Lichens.—</hi> From what has now been said
                    it will readily be inferred that the distribution of lichens over the surface of
                    the globe is regulated, not only by the presence of suitable substrata, but also
                    and more especially by atmospherical and climatal conditions. At the same time
                    it may safely be affirmed that their geographical range is more extended than
                    that of any other class of plants, occurring as they do in the coldest and
                    warmest regions—on the dreary shores of the palaeocrystic sea and in the torrid
                    valleys of tropical climes, as well as on <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n582/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0582-0563"/> the greatest mountain elevations yet attained by
                    man, on projecting rocks even far above the snow-line <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,
                    Lecidea</hi><hi rend="italic">geographica),</hi> where, as in many other
                    situations, fungusmycelium and gonidioid algal are unknown. Our knowledge of the
                    distribution of lichens in various countries, like that of other plants, is
                    derived from general and local floras, from special works on lichenology, from
                    the observations of scientific travellers and the collections made by them in
                    distant parts of the world. Most of these, however, of an earlier date, are to
                    be used with great caution, as the species recorded were, in the absence of
                    microscopical examination, not sufficiently discriminated, and in many cases are
                    <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic">facie</hi> entirely erroneous.
                    Amongst botanical travellers whose contributions are most trustworthy may be
                    mentioned pre-eminently Sir Joseph D. Hooker, whose remarks on this subject in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Flora Antarctica</hi> and in various papers in <hi
                    rend="italic">Trans. Linn. Sοc.,</hi> voL xiv., &lt;fcc., are most valuable and
                    suggestive. Again, in purely lichenological works, the general principles
                    regulating lichen distribution (with statistical tables) are admirably expounded
                    by Nylander in the introduction to his <hi rend="italic">Synopsis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Methodica Lichenum,</hi> while the only complete record of the
                    distribution of species is that given by the same author in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Enumeration</hi><hi rend="italic">generale</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Lichens.</hi> Since the date of this latter work (1858) our knowledge of
                    the range of lichens, both European and exotic, has been greatly extended, apart
                    from the discovery of numerous species previously unknown. No special treatise,
                    however, on the subject has been published, though there is now ample material,
                    very much scattered no doubt, available for the purpose. It may, however, be
                    observed that of the four thousand species (exclusive of numerous varieties and
                    forms) which have been described, the geographical distribution is known almost
                    as well as that of phanerogams and filices, as well, if not more so than that of
                    mosses and hepatics, and far better than that of algae and fungi. In arctic
                    regions lichens form by far the largest portion of the vegetation, occurring
                    everywhere on the ground and on rocks, and fruiting freely; while terricole
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Cladοnia</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stereocaulon</hi> are seen in the greatest luxuriance and abundance spreading
                    over extensive tracts almost to the entire <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    exclusion of other vegetation. The lichen flora of temperate regions again is
                    essentially distinguished from the preceding by the frequency of corticole
                    species belonging to <hi rend="italic">Lecanora, Lecidea,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Graphidei.</hi> In intertropical regions lichens attain their
                    maximum development (and beauty) in the foliaceous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stictei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Parmeliei,</hi> while they are especially
                    characterized by epiphyllous species, as <hi rend="italic">Strigula,</hi> and by
                    many peculiar corticole <hi rend="italic">Thelotremei, Graphidei,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyreηocarpei.</hi> Some lichens, especially saxicole ones, seem to
                    be cosmopolitan <hi rend="italic">(e.g., Lecanora subfusca, Cladοnia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">pyxidata)</hi>; and others, not strictly cosmopolitan, have been
                    observed in regions widely apart. A considerable number of species, European and
                    exotic, seem to be <hi rend="italic">endemic,</hi> but further research will no
                    doubt show that most of them occur in other climatal regions similar to those in
                    which they have hitherto alone been detected. To give any detailed account,
                    however, of the distribution of the different genera (not to speak of that of
                    individual species) of lichens would necessarily far exceed the limits at our
                    disposal. Suffice it to say that both in horizontal and vertical range, they
                    sufficiently correspond with the distribution of phanerogams in the several
                    regions of vegetation into which the surface of the globe has been divided. The
                    proportion of lichens to phanerogams in different regions increases in a regular
                    ratio from the equator to the poles, and from the base to the summit of lofty
                    mountains, till at length in more arctic and alt-alpine tracts lichens
                    constitute almost and sometimes entirely the sole vegetation. (j. <hi
