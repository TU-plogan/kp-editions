                    Lombard kingdom in Italy between 568 and 774; (3) the period of their
                    incorporation with the Italian population, and the history of Lombardy and its
                    cities as one of the great provinces of Italy—(a) from the restoration of the
                    empire under Charles the Great (800) to the peace of Constance with Frederick
                    Barbarossa (1183), and (6) from the declaration of independence to the time of
                    the tyrannies and, afterwards, of the French, Spanish, and Austrian rule.</p>
                <p>1. The name <hi rend="italic">Lombard</hi> is the Italianized form of the
                    national name of a Teutonic tribe, <hi rend="italic">Longobardi,</hi> itself an
                    Italian arrangement, based on a supposed etymology of the Teutonic <hi
                    rend="italic">Langbard,</hi><hi rend="italic">Langobardi,</hi> the form used
                    when they are first named by Roman writers—Velleius and Tacitus. The etymology
                    which made the name mean <hi rend="italic">Longbeard</hi> is too obvious not to
                    have suggested itself to Italians, and perhaps to themselves (see Zeuss,
                    95,109); it is accepted by their first native chronicler, Paul the Deacon, who
                    wrote in the time of Charles the Great. But the name has also been derived from
                    the region where they are first heard of. On the left bank of the Elbe, “where
                    Börde or Bord still signifies a fertile plain by the side of a river,” a
                    district near Magdeburg is still called the <hi rend="italic">Lange Borde;</hi>
                    and lower down the Elbe, on the same side, about Lüneburg, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bardengau,</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Bardewik,</hi> is still found; it is
                    here that Velleius, who accompanied Tiberius in his campaign in this part of
                    Germany, and who first mentions the name, places them. As late as the age of
                    their Italian settlement the Lombards are called <hi rend="italic">Bardi</hi> in
                    poetical epitaphs, though this may be for the convenience of metre.</p>
                <p>Their own legends bring the tribe as worshippers of Odin from Scandinavia to the
                    German shore of the Baltic, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Winili,</hi> a
                    name which was given to them in a loose way as late as the 12th century <hi
                    rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> by Ordericus Vitalis; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi>
                    Zeuss, 57). By the Roman and Greek writers of the first two centuries of our era
                    they are spoken of as occupying, with more or less extension at different times,
                    the region which is now Hanover and the Altmark of Prussia. To the Romans they
                    appeared a remarkable tribe: —“gens etiam Germana feritate ferocior,” says
                    Velleius, who had fought against them under Tiberius; and Tacitus describes them
                    as a race which, though few in numbers, more than held their own among numerous
                    powerful neighbours by their daring and love of war. In the quarrels of the
                    tribes they appear to have extended their borders; in Ptolemy’s account of
                    Germany, in the 2d century, they fill a large space among the races of the
                    northwest and north. But from the 2d century the name disappears,<note

                    found again at the end of the 5th century as that of a half Christian tribe on
                    the northern banks of the Danube. How they got there, and what relation these
                    Langobards bore to those who lived in the 1st and 2d centuries on the west bank
                    of the Elbe, we learn little from the vague stories preserved by their
                    traditions; but they are described <hi rend="italic">(B. C.,</hi> ii. 14, 15) by
                    Procopius, a contemporary, as subject to one of the most ferocious of the tribes
                    on the Danube, the Heruli, also a Teutonic tribe, by whose oppression they were
                    driven in despair to a resistance, which ended in the utter defeat and overthrow
                    of their tyrants. We know nothing of the way in which Christianity was
                    introduced among them, probably only among some of their noble families; but
                    they were Arians like their neighbours and predecessors in Italy, the Goths, and
                    like them they brought with them into Italy a hierarchy of bishops, priests, and
                    deacons; but, while the Gothic Bible of Ulfilas is partially preserved, whatever
                    religious literature the Langobards had in the shape of versions of the
                    Scriptures or liturgical forms has utterly perished. They were among the
                    Teutonic tribes which were generally on good terms with the empire, and were
                    encouraged by it in their wars with their more barbarous neighbours. After
                    defeating the Heruli and destroying their tribal organization, the Langobards
                    attacked the Gepidae with equal success, scattering the tribe or incorporating
                    its survivors in their own host. They thus became the most formidable of the
                    Teutonic tribes of the Danube. They had alliances with the distant Saxons,
                    probably a kindred stock, and with the Hunnish Avars of the Danube. Their kings
                    belonged to a royal line, and made marriages with the kings of the Franks and
                    the other German nations. Their wars led them westwards, and for forty years
                    they are said to have occupied Pannonia, the region between the Danube and the
                    valleys of the Drave and Save. Thus following the line of movement of the Goths,
                    they resolved at last to strike for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n837/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0837-0814"/> the great prize which the Goths had won and lost.
                    Through the eastern passes, and the border land of Friuli, they invaded Italy.
                    It is said that they were invited by Narses, the conqueror of the Goths, in
                    revenge for his ill treatment by the masters whom he had served.</p>
                <p>2. In 568 Alboin, king of the Langobards, with the women and children of the
                    tribe and all their possessions, with Saxon allies, with the subject tribe of
                    the Gepidae, and a mixed host of other barbarians, descended into Italy by the
                    great plain at the head of the Adriatic. There was little resistance to them.
                    The war which had ended in the downfall of the Goths had exhausted Italy; it was
                    followed by famine and pestilence; and the Government at Constantinople, away in
                    the East, made but faint efforts to retain the province which Belisarius and
                    Narses had recovered for it. Except in a few fortified places, such as Ticinum
                    or Pavia, the Italians did not venture to encounter the new invaders; and,
                    though Alboin was not without generosity, the Lombards, wherever resisted,
                    justified the opinion of their ferocity by the savage cruelty of the invasion.
                    In 572, according to the tragic tale of the Lombard chronicler, a tale which
                    recalls the story of Candaules in Herodotus, Alboin, the fierce conqueror, fell
                    a victim to the revenge of his wife Rosamond, the daughter of the king of the
                    Gepidae, whose skull Alboin had turned into a drinking cup, out of which he
                    forced Rosamond to drink; but the Langobards had already shown themselves in
                    ravaging bands all over Italy, and in the north had begun to take possession.
                    Military chiefs, whom, after the Latin writers, we call “dukes,” corresponding
                    to the German “Herzog,” were placed, or placed themselves, first in the border
                    cities, like Friuli and Trent, which commanded the north-eastern passes, and
                    then in other principal places in Italy; and this arrangement became
                    characteristic of the Lombard settlement. The principal seat of the settlement
                    was the rich plain watered by the Po and its affluents, which was in future to
                    receive its name from them; but their power extended across the Apennines into
                    Liguria and Tuscany, and then southwards to the outlying dukedoms of Spoleto and
                    Benevento. The invaders failed to secure any maritime ports such as Genoa, Pisa,
                    Naples, Salerno, Ravenna, or any territory that was conveniently commanded from
                    the sea. Pavia, or, as it was called, Ticinum, the one place which had
                    obstinately resisted Alboin, became the seat of their kings, as it had been one
                    of the seats of the Gothic kingdom.</p>
                <p>After the short and cruel reign of Cleph, the successor of Alboin, the Lombards
                    (as we may begin for convenience sake to call them) tried for ten years the
                    experiment of a national confederacy of their dukes, without any king at their
                    head. It was the rule of some thirty-five or thirty-six petty tyrants, under
                    whose oppression and private wars even the invaders suffered, while the Italians
                    were remorselessly trodden under foot. With anarchy among themselves and so
                    precarious a hold on the country, hated by the Italian population and by their
                    natural leaders the Catholic clergy, threatened also by an alliance of the Greek
                    empire with their natural and persistent rivals the Franks beyond the Alps, they
                    resolved to sacrifice their turbulent independence to the usual necessities of
                    the Teutonic invaders which led to the election of a king. In 584 they chose
                    Authari, the grandson of Alboin, and endowed the royal domain with a half of
                    their possessions. From this time till the fall of the Lombard power before the
                    arms of their rivals the Franks under Charles the Great, the kingly rule
                    continued. Authari, “the Longhaired,” with his Roman title of Flavius, marks the
                    change from the war-king of an invading host to the permanent representative of
                    the unity and law of the nation, and the increased power of the crown, by the
                    possession of a great domain, to enforce its will. The independence of the dukes
                    was surrendered to the king. The dukedoms in the neighbourhood of the seat of
                    power were gradually absorbed, and their holders transformed into royal
                    officers. Those of the northern marches, Trent and Friuli, with the important
                    dukedom of Turin, retained longer the kind of independence which marchlands
                    usually give where invasion is to be feared. The great dukedom of Benevento in
                    the south, with its neighbour Spoleto, threatened at one time to be a separate
                    principality, and even to the last resisted, with varying success, according to
                    the personal characters of its dukes, the fu∩ claims of the royal authority at
                    Pavia.</p>
                <p>The kingdom of the Lombards lasted more than two hundred years, from Alboin (568)
                    to the fall of Desiderius (774),—much longer than the preceding Teutonic kingdom
                    of Theodoric and the Goths. But it differed from the other Teutonic conquests in
                    Gaul, in Britain, in Spain. It was never complete in point of territory: there
                    were always two, and almost to the last three, capitals—the Lombard one, Pavia,
                    the Latin one, Rome, the Greek one,. Ravenna; and the Lombards never could get
                    access to the sea. And it never was complete over the subject race: it
                    profoundly affected the Italians of the north; in its turn it was entirely
                    transformed by contact with them; but the Lombards never overcame the natural
                    repulsion of the twσ races, and never amalgamated with the Italians till their
                    power as a ruling race was crushed by the victory given to the Roman element by
                    the restored empire of the Franks. The Langobards, German in their faults and in
                    their strength, but coarser, at least at first, than the Germans whom the
                    Italians had known, the Goths of Theodoric and Totila, found themselves
                    continually in the presence of a subject population very different from anything
                    which the other Teutonic conquerors met with among the provincials,—like them,
                    exhausted, dispirited, unwarlike, but with the remains and memory of a great
                    civilization round them, intelligent, subtle, sensitive, feeling themselves
                    infinitely superior in experience and knowledge to the rough barbarians whom
                    they could not fight, and capable of hatred such as only cultivated races can
                    nourish. The Lombards who came into Italy with the most cruel incidents of
                    conquest, and who, when they had occupied the lands and cities of Upper Italy,
                    still went on sending forth furious bands to plunder and destroy where they did
                    not care to stay, never were able to overcome the mingled fear and scorn and
                    loathing of the Italians. They adapted themselves very quickly indeed to many
                    Italian fashions. Within thirty years of the invasion, Authari took the fancy of
                    decking himself with the imperial title of Flavius, even while his bands were
                    leading Italian captives in leash like dogs under the walls of Rome, and under
                    the eyes of Pope Gregory; and it was retained by his successor. They soon became
                    Catholics; and then in all the usages of religion, in church building, in
                    founding monasteries, in their veneration for relics, they vied with Italians.
                    Authari’s queen, Theodelinda, solemnly placed the Lombard nation under the
                    patronage of St John the Baptist, and at Monza she built in his honour the first
                    Lombard church, and the royal palace near it. King Liutprand (712-744) bought
                    the relics of St Augustine for a large sum to be placed in his church at Pavia.
                    Their Teutonic speech disappeared; except in names and a few technical words all
                    traces of it are lost. But to the last they had the unpardonable crime of being
                    a ruling barbarian race or caste in Italy. To the end they are “nefandissimi,”
                    execrable, loathsome, filthy. So wrote Gregory the Great when they first
                    appeared. So wrote Pope Stephen IV., at the end of their rule, when stirring up
                    the kings of the Franks to destroy them. Authari⅛ short reign (584-591) was one
                    of renewed effort for conquest<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n838/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0838-0815"/>. It brought the Langobards face to face, not
                    merely with the emperors at Constantinople, but with the first of the great
                    statesmen popes, Gregory the Great (590-604). But Lombard conquest was bungling
                    and wasteful. It was ever ready to lapse into mere plunder and warfare; and when
                    they had spoiled a city they proceeded to tear down its walls and raze it to the
                    ground. But Authari’s chief connexion with the fortunes of his people was an
                    important, though an accidental one. The Lombard chronicler tells us a romantic
                    tale of the way in which Authari sought his bride from Garibald, duke of the
                    Bavarians, how he went incognito in the embassy to judge of her attractions, and
                    how she recognized her disguised suitor. The bride was the Christian
                    Theodelinda, and she became to the Langobards what Bertha was to the
                    Anglo-Saxons, and Clotilda to the Franks. She became the mediator between the
                    Lombards and the Catholic Church. Authari, who had brought her to Italy, died
                    shortly after his marriage. But Theodelinda had so won on the Lombard chiefs
                    that they bid her as queen choose the one among them whom she would have for her
                    husband and for king. She chose Agilulf, duke of Turin (592-615). He was not a
                    true Langobard, but a Thuringian. It was the beginning of peace between the
                    Lombards and the Catholic clergy. Agilulf could not abandon his traditional
                    Arianism, and he was a very uneasy neighbour, not only to the Greek exarch, but
                    to Rome itself. But he was favourably disposed both to peace and to the Catholic
                    Church. Gregory interfered to prevent a national conspiracy against the
                    Langobards, like that of St Brice’s day in England against the Danes, or that
                    later uprising against the French, the Sicilian Vespers. He was right both in
                    point of humanity and of policy. The Arian and Catholic bishops went on for a
                    time side by side; but the Lombard kings and clergy rapidly yielded to the
                    religious influences around them, even while the national antipathies continued
                    unabated and vehement. Gregory, who despaired of any serious effort on the part
                    of the Greek emperors to expel the Lombards, endeavoured to promote peace
                    between the Italians and Agilulf; and, in spite of the feeble hostility of the
                    exarchs of Ravenna, the pope and the king of the Lombards became the two real
                    powers in the north and centre of Italy. Agilulf was followed, after two
                    unimportant reigns, by his son-in-law, the husband of Theodelinda’s daughter,
                    King Rothari (636-652), the Lombard legislator, still an Arian though he
                    favoured the Catholics. He was the first of their kings who did for the Lombards
                    what was done by all the Teutonic conquerors as soon as they felt themselves a
                    nation on Roman soil ,∙ he collected their customs under the name of laws,—and
                    he did this, not in their own Teutonic dialect, but in Latin. The use of Latin
                    implies the use of Latin scribes or notaries, and implies that the laws were a
                    notice to the Italians of the usages and rules of their conquerors, which, so
                    far as they applied, were to be not merely the personal law of the Lombards, but
                    the law of the land, and binding on Lombards and Romans alike. But such rude
                    legislation could not provide for all questions arising even in the shattered
                    and decayed state of Roman civilization. It is probable that among themselves
                    the Italians kept to their old usages and legal precedents where they were not
                    overridden by the conquerors’ law, and by degrees a good many of the Roman civil
                    arrangements made their way into thejLombard code, while all ecclesiastical
                    ones, and they were a large class, were untouched by it.</p>
                <p>The precise nature of the relations, legal and political, of the Lombards, as a
                    conquering race, or a military caste, to the Italians is still a subject of
                    controversy, owing to the prevailing mixture of clearness and obscurity in the
                    documents of the time. There must have been, of course, much change of property;
                    but appearances are conflicting as to the terms on which land generally was held
                    by he old possessors or the new comers, and as to the relative legal position of
                    the two. Savigny held that, making allowance for the anomalies and usurpation of
                    conquest, the Roman population held the bulk of the land as they had held it
                    before, and were governed by an uninternιpted and acknowledged exercise of Roman
                    law in their old municipal organization. Later inquirers, Leo, Troya, and more
                    recently Hegel, have found that the supposition does not tally with a whole
                    series of facts, which point to a Lombard territorial law ignoring completely
                    any parallel Roman and personal law, to a great restriction of full civil rights
                    among the Romans, analogous to the condition of the rayah under the Turks, and
                    to a reduction of the Roman occupiers to a class of half-free “aldii,” holding
                    immovable tenancies under lords of superior race and privilege, and subject to
                    the sacrifice either of the third part of their holdings or the third part of
                    the produce. Probably something like this, with exceptions and anomalies,
                    represents the state of things, at least at first; but it must be remembered
                    that regular and consistent arrangements were very unlikely to have been thought
                    of early in such a conquest as that of the Lombards, that the Romans suffered
                    probably rather from the insolence of barbarians than from the rules of a
                    constitutional settlement, and that a conquered race always and naturally
                    exaggerates its own humiliations and grievances, and in this case has the chief
                    telling of the story. It might also be expected that the tribal customs of
                    Teutonic conquerors would be more modified in Italy than elsewhere, by the
                    deeply-rooted traditions and customs of the old Roman rule. The Lombards were
                    rough and harsh, and the Italians never ceased to hate them; but we know by
                    experience how two portions of a population possessed of equal civil rights can
                    hate one another, where they differ in blood and history. The Roman losses, both
                    of property and rights, were likely to be great at first; how far they continued
                    permanent during the two centuries of the Lombard kingdom, or how far the legal
                    distinctions between Rome and Lombard gradually passed into desuetude, is a
                    further question. The legislation of the Lombard kings, in form <hi
                    rend="subscript"> f</hi> a territorial and not a personal law, shows no signs of
                    a disposition either to depress or to favour the Romans, but only the purpose
                    to, maintain, in a rough fashion, strict order and discipline impartially among
                    all their subjects.</p>
                <p>From Rothari (oδ. 652) to Liutprand (712-744) the Lombard kings, succeeding one
                    another in the irregular fashion of the time, sometimes by descent, sometimes by
                    election, sometimes by conspiracy and violence, strove fitfully to enlarge their
                    boundaries, and contended with the aristocracy of dukes inherent in the original
                    organization of the nation, an element which, though much weakened, always
                    embarrassed the power of the crown, and checked the unity of the nation. Their
                    old enemies the Franks on the west, and the Slavs or Huns, ever ready to break
                    in on the north-east, and sometimes called in by mutinous and traitorous dukes
                    of Friuli and Trent, were constant and serious dangers. By the popes, who
                    represented Italian interests, they were always looked upon with dislike and
                    jealousy, even when they had become zealous Catholics, the founders of churches
                    and monasteries; with the Greek empire there was chronic war. From time to time
                    they made raids into the unsubdued parts of Italy, and added a city or two to
                    their dominions. But there was no sustained effort for the complete subjugation
                    of Italy till Liutprand, the most powerful of the line. He tried it, and failed.
                    He broke up the independence of the great southern duchies, Benevento and
                    Spoleto. For a time, in the heat of the dispute about images, he won the pope to
                    his side against the Greeks. For a time, but only for a time, he deprived the
                    Greeks of Ravenna. Aistulf, his successor, carried on the same policy. He even
                    threatened Rome itself, and claimed a capitation tax. But the popes, thoroughly
                    irritated and alarmed, and hopeless of aid from the East, turned to the family
                    which was rising into power among the Franks of the West, the mayors of the
                    palace of Austrasia. Pope Gregory III. applied in vain to Charles Martel. But
                    with his successors Pippin and Charles the popes were more successful. In return
                    for the transfer by the pope of the Frank crown from the decayed line of Clovis
                    to his own, Pippin crossed the Alps, defeated Aistulf, and gave to the pope the
                    lands which Aistulf had torn from the empire, Ravenna and the Pentapolis
                    (754-756). But the angry quarrels still went on between the popes and <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0839-0816"/> the Lombards. The Lombards were still to the
                    Italians a “foul and horrid” race. At length, invited by Pope Adrian I.,
                    Pippin’s son Charles once more descended into Italy. As the Lombard kingdom
                    began, so it ended, with a siege of Pavia. Desiderius, the last king, became
                    Charles’s prisoner (774), and the Lombard power perished. Charles, with the
                    title of king of the Franks and Lombards, became master of Italy, and in 800 the
                    pope, who had crowned Pippin king of the Franks, claimed to bestow the Roman
                    empire, and crowned his greater son emperor of the Romans (800).</p>
                <p>3. To Italy the overthrow of the Lombard kings was the loss of its last chance of
                    independence and unity. To the Lombards the conquest was the destruction of
                    their legal and social supremacy. Henceforth they were equally with the Italians
                    the subjects of the French king. Charles, the Carolingian king, expressly
                    recognized the Roman law, and allowed all who would be counted Romans to
                    “profess” it. Latin influences were not strong enough to extinguish the Lombard
                    name and destroy altogether the recollections and habits of the Lombard rule;
                    Lombard law was still recognized, and survived in the schools of Pavia. Lombardy
                    remained the name of the finest province of Italy, and indeed for a time was the
                    name for Italy itself. But what was specially Lombard could not stand in the
                    long run against the Italian atmosphere which surrounded it, with its countless
                    and subtle forces, social, political, and religious. Generation after generation
                    passed more and more into real Italians. Antipathies, indeed, survived, and men
                    even in the 10th century called each other Roman or Langobard as terms of
                    reproach. But the altered name of Lombard also denoted henceforth some of the
                    proudest of Italians; and, though the Lombard speech had utterly perished, their
                    most common names still kept up the remembrance that their fathers had come from
                    beyond the Alps.</p>
                <p>But the establishment of the Frank kingdom, and still more the re-establishment
                    of the Christian empire as the source of law and jurisdiction in Christendom,
                    had momentous influence on the history of the Italianized Lombards. The empire
                    was the counterweight to the local tyrannies into which the local authorities
                    established by the empire itself, the feudal powers, judicial and military,
                    necessary for the purposes of government, invariably tended to degenerate. When
                    they became intolerable, from the empire were sought the exemptions, privileges,
                    immunities from that local authority, which, anomalous and anarchical as they
                    were in theory, yet in fact were the foundations of all the liberties of the
                    Middle Ages in the Swiss cantons, in the free towns of Germany and the Low
                    Countries, in the Lombard cities of Italy. Italy was and ever has been a land of
                    cities; and, ever since the downfall of Rome and the decay of the municipal
                    system, the bishops of the cities had really been at the head of the peaceful
                    and industrial part of their population, and were a natural refuge for the
                    oppressed, and sometimes for the mutinous and the evil doers, from the military
                    and civil power of the duke or count or judge, too often a rule of cruelty or
                    fraud. Under the Carolingian empire, a vast system grew up in the North Italian
                    cities of episcopal “immunities,” by which a city with its surrounding district
                    was removed, more or less completely, from the jurisdiction of the ordinary
                    authority, military or civil, and placed under that of the bishop. These
                    “immunities” led to the temporal sovereignty of the bishops; under it the spirit
                    of liberty grew more readily than under the military chief. Municipal
                    organization, never quite forgotten, naturally revived under new forms, and with
                    its “consuls” at the head of the citizens, with its “arts” and “crafts” anl
                    “guilds,” grew up secure under the shadow of the church. In due time the city
                    populations, free from the feudal yoke, and safe within the walls which in many
                    instances the bishops had built for them, became impatient also of the bishop’s
                    government. The cities which the bishops had made thus independent of the dukes
                    and counts next sought to be free from the bishops; in due time they too gained
                    their charters of privilege and liberty. Left to take care of themselves,
                    islands in a sea of turbulence, they grew in the sense of self-reliance and
                    independence; they grew also to be aggressive, quarrelsome, and ambitious. Thus,
                    by the ll·th century, the Lombard cities had become “communes,” commonalties,
                    republics, managing their own affairs, and ready for attack or defence. Milan
                    had recovered its greatness, ecclesiastically as well as politically; it
                    scarcely bowed to Rome, and it aspired to the position of a sovereign city,
                    mistress over its neighbours. At length, in the 12th century, the inevitable
                    conflict came between the republicanism of the Lombard cities and the German
                    feudalism which still claimed their allegiance in the name of the empire.
                    Leagues and counter-leagues were formed; and a confederacy of cities, with Milan
                    at its head, challenged the strength of Germany under one of its sternest
                    emperors, Frederick Barbarossa. The struggle was terrible. At first Frederick
                    was victorious; Milan, except its churches, was utterly destroyed; everything
                    that marked municipal independence was abolished in the “rebel” cities; and they
                    had to receive an imperial magistrate instead of their own (1158-62). But the
                    Lombard league was again formed. Milan was rebuilt, with the help even of its
                    jealous rivals, and at Legnano (1176) Frederick was utterly defeated. The
                    Lombard cities had regained their independence; and at the peace of Constance
                    (1183) Frederick found himself compelled to confirm it.</p>
                <p>From the peace of Constance the history of the Lombards is merely part of the
                    history of Italy. Their cities went through the ordinary fortunes of most
                    Italian cities. They quarrelled and fought with one another. They took opposite
                    sides in the great strife of the time between pope and emperor, and were Guelf
                    and Ghibelline by old tradition, or as one or other faction prevailed in them.
                    They swayed backwards and forwards between the power of the people and the power
                    of the few; but democracy and oligarchy passed sooner or later into the hands of
                    a master who veiled his lordship under various titles, and generally at last
                    into the hands of a family. Then, in the larger political straggles and changes
                    of Europe, they were incorporated into a kingdom, or principality, or duchy,
                    carved out to suit the interest of a foreigner, or to make a heritage for the
                    nephew of a pope. But in two ways especially the energetic race which grew out
                    of the fusion of Langobards and Italians between the 9th and the 12th centuries
                    has left the memory of itself. In England, at least, the enterprising traders
                    and bankers who found their way to the West, from the 13 th to the 16th
                    centuries, though they certainly did not all come from Lombardy, bore the name
                    of Lombards. In the next place, the Lombards, or the Italian builders whom they
                    employed or followed, the “masters of Como,” of whom so much is said in the
                    early Lombard laws, introduced a manner of building, stately, solemn, and
                    elastic, to which their name has been attached, and which gives a character of
                    its own to some of the most interesting churches in Italy. (R∙ W. C.)</p>
