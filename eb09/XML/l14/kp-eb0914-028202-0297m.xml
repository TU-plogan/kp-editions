                    Theophilus Lane, a prebendary of Hereford. He lost his father in boyhood, and
                    his character was mainly formed by the influence of his mother, a woman of
                    strong and beautiful nature He was designed for Cambridge and the church, and
                    became proficient in mathematics, but, abandoning the purpose of proceeding to
                    the university, gave himself for some time to the study of engraving. Weak
                    health, aggravated by intense application to Eastern study, compelled him to
                    throw aside the burin, and in 1825 he started for Egypt, where he spent three
                    years, twice ascended the Nile, proceeding as far as the second cataract, and
                    composed a complete description of Egypt, with a portfolio of one hundred and
                    one drawings. This work was never published, but the account of the modern
                    Egyptians, which formed a part of it, was accepted for separate publication by
                    the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. To perfect this work Lane
                    again visited Egypt in 1833-35, residing mainly in Cairo, but retiring to Luxor
                    during the plague of 1835. An interesting journal of this visit to Egypt is
                    included in the memoir by his grand-nephew prefixed to the sixth part of his
                    great <hi rend="italic">Lexicon.</hi> Perfected by the additional observations
                    collected during these years, the <hi rend="italic">Modern Egyptians</hi>
                    appeared in 1836, and at once took the place which it has never lost as the best
                    description of Eastern life and an Eastern country ever written. In accuracy,
                    completeness, and graphic simplicity of description the book approaches ideal
                    perfection. It was followed from 1838 to 1840 by a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> with a mass of valuable notes and
                    illustrations, designed to make the book a sort of encyclopaedia of Eastern
                    manners, and rivalling the merit of his first work. The translation itself is an
                    admirable proof of scholarship, but is characterized by a somewhat stilted
                    mannerism, which is not equally appropriate to all parts of the motley-coloured
                    original. The character of some of the tales, and the tedious repetitions of the
                    same theme which are found in the Arabic collection, induced Lane to leave
                    considerable parts of the work untranslated. In 1840 Lane married a Greek lady.
                    A useful volume of <hi rend="italic">Selectionsfrom the Kur-dn</hi> was
                    published in 1843, but before it passed through the press the indefatigable
                    author was again in Egypt, where he spent seven years (1842-49) collecting
                    materials for a great Arabic lexicon, which the munificence of Lord Prudhoe
                    (afterwards duke of Northumberland) enabled him to undertake. The most important
                    of the materials amassed during this sojourn (in which he was accompanied by his
                    wife and by his sister, Mrs Poole, authoress of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Englishwoman in Egypt,</hi> with her two sons, afterwards well known in Eastern
                    letters) was a copy in 24 thick quarto volumes of Sheikh Murtadâ’s great
                    lexicon, the <hi rend="italic">Taj</hi><hi rend="italic">et ‘Artes,</hi> which,
                    though itself a compilation, is so extensive and exact that it formed the main
                    basis of Lane’s subsequent work. The author, who lived in Egypt in last century,
                    used more than a hundred sources, interweaving what he learned from them with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Kdmus</hi> of Firuzabâdy in the form of a commentary. By
                    far the larger part of this commentary was derived from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lisän</hi><hi rend="italic">el ‘Arab</hi> of Ibn Mokarram, a work of the 13th
                    century, which Lane was also able to use while in Cairo.</p>
                <p>Returning to England in the year 1849, Lane devoted the whole remainder of his
                    life to the task of digesting and translating his Arabic material in the form of
                    a great thesaurus of the lexicographical knowledge of the Arabs. In spite of
                    weak health he continued this arduous task with unflagging diligence till a few
                    days before his death, which took place at Worthing 10th August 1876. The work
                    remains unfinished; five parts appeared during his lifetime (1863-1874), and two
                    smaller parts have since been published from his papers. Even in its imperfect
                    state the <hi rend="italic">Lexicon</hi> is an enduring monument, the
                    completeness and finished scholarship with which it is executed making each
                    article an exhaustive monograph. All Lane’s work has the stamp of masterly
                    perfection. He produced no occasional writings, and two essays contributed to
                    the magazine of the German Oriental Society complete the record of his
                    publications. Lane was not an original mind; his powers were those of
                    observation, industry, and sound judgment. He had singular tact in accommodating
                    himself to the Eastern character; he lived in the East as an Oriental; and his
                    familiarity with Eastern life and ways of thought was unique. His personal
                    character was elevated and pure, his strong sense of religious and moral duty
                    being of the type that characterized the best circles of English evangelicalism
                    in the early part of this century.</p>
