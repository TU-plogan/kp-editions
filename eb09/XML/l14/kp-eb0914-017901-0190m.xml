                    Switzerland, southern Germany, northern Italy, &amp;c., has long been cultivated
                    as an ornamental tree throughout Europe, and was introduced into north-east
                    America by the European colonists. Gerard records it as growing in his garden in
                    1596 under the names of anagyris, laburnum, or beane trefoyle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Historie</hi><hi rend="italic">of Plants,</hi> p. 1239), but the date of its
                    introduction into England appears to be unknown. In France it is called
                    1’aubour—a corruption from laburnum according to Du Hamel—as also arbois, <hi
                    rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> arc-bois, “the wood having been used by the ancient
                    Gauls for bows. It is still so employed in some parts of the Mâconnois, where
                    the bows are found to preserve their strength and elasticity for half a century”
                    (Loudon, <hi rend="italic">Arboretum,</hi> ii. p. 590).</p>
                <p>Several varieties of this well-known tree are cultivated, differing in the size
                    of the flowers, in the form of the foliage, &lt;fcc., such as the “oak-leafed”
                    <hi rend="italic">(quercifolvum), pendulum,</hi><hi rend="italic">crispum,</hi>
                    &amp;c. One of the most remarkable forms is <hi rend="italic">C. Adami,</hi>
                    Poir. <hi rend="italic">(C. purpurascens,</hi> Hort.), which bears three kinds
                    of blossoms, viz., racemes of pure yellow flowers, others of a purple colour,
                    and others of an intermediate brick-red tint—all three kinds being borne by one
                    and the same tree. The last are hybrid blossoms, and are sterile, with malformed
                    ovules, though, curiously enough, the pollen appears to be good. The yellow and
                    purple “reversions” are fertile. It originated in Paris in 1828 by Μ. Adam, who
                    inserted a “shield” of the bark of <hi rend="italic">C. purpureus,</hi> Scop.,
                    into a stock of <hi rend="italic">C. Laburnum,</hi> L. A vigorous shoot from
                    this bud was subsequently propagated. Hence it would appear that the two
                    distinct species mentioned above became united by their cambium layers, and the
                    trees propagated therefrom subsequently reverted to their respective parentages
                    in bearing both yellow and purple flowers, but produce as well blossoms of an
                    intermediate or hybrid character. Such a result, Mr Darwin observes, may be
                    called a “graft-hybrid.” For full details see Darwin’s <hi rend="italic">Animals
                    and Plants under Domestication.</hi></p>
                <p>The laburnum has highly poisonous properties. A case is recorded of nearly fatal
                    results to several boys who masticated the roots on finding they tasted like
                    liquorice, which is a member of the same family as the laburnum. It has proved
                    fatal to cattle, though hares and rabbits eat the bark of it with avidity <hi
                    rend="italic">(Gardener's Chronicle,</hi> 1881, vol. xvi. p. 666). The seeds
                    also are highly poisonous, possessing emetic as well as narcotico-acrid
                    principles, especially in a green state. Gerard <hi rend="italic">(loc.
                    cit.)</hi> alludes to the powerful effect produced on the system by taking the
                    bruised leaves medicinally. Pliny records that bees will not visit the flowers
                    (W. <hi rend="italic">H.,</hi> xvi. 31), but this may be an error, for Mr Darwin
                    found by experiment that insects play an important part in the fertilization of
                    the laburnum.</p>
                <p>The heart wood of the laburnum is of a dark reddish-brown colour, hard and
                    durable, and takes, a good polish. Hence it is much prized by turners, and used
                    with other coloured woods for inlaying purposes. The laburnum has been called
                    false ebony from this character of its wood.</p>
                <p>The roots are subject to a peculiar disease, not at all uncommon in other members
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Leguminosae,</hi> the fine rootlets swelling into
                    minute club-shaped processes called exostoses, resembling coral-branches in
                    shape. Large masses of such, one or two inches in diameter, may be found at the
                    extremities of the roots of old laburnum trees. They are apparently caused by a
                    fungus which appears to be ubiquitous, as the disease is rarely, if ever, known
                    to be absent, though it does not seem to cause much if any injury to the health
                    of the plants it attacks. See <hi rend="italic">Studier</hi><hi rend="italic"
