                    less elevated mountains composed of volcanic rocks. The Shannon is navigable to
                    Limerick, above which are the rapids of Dυonas and Castleroy. The Maig, which
                    rises in the Galtees, and flows into the Shannon, is navigable as far as the
                    town of Adare. Limerick includes the greater part of the Golden Vale, the most
                    fertile district of Ireland, which stretches «across the centre of the county
                    from Cashel in Tipperary to near the town of Limerick. Along the banks of the
                    Shannon there are large tracts of flat meadow land formed of deposits of
                    calcareous and peaty matter, and possessing extraordinary fertility. The soil in
                    the mountainous districts is, for the most part, thin and poor, and incapable of
                    improvement. In 1880 there were 176,774 acres under tillage, 415,107 pasture,
                    8407 plantations, and 62,465 waste. The total number of holdings in 1880 was
                    16,286, of which 1937 were less than one acre, and 11,273 between 15 and 100
                    acres in extent, 1019 between 100 and 200 acres, 259 between 200 and 500 acres,
                    and 29 above 1000 acres. The large farms occupy the low grounds, and are almost
                    wholly devoted to grazing. The following table shows the area under the
                    principal crops in 1855 and 1881 :—</p>

                <p>The table shows a remarkable increase in the area under meadow, notwithstanding
                    which the total area under tillage has considerably decreased. The number of
                    horses his, since 1855, declined from 17,206 to 15,389, of which 10,228 were
                    used for agricultural purposes. Cattle have increased from 159,710 to 201,456,
                    an average of 28 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the average for Ireland
                    being 25 ’ 8. The number of cows was 95,225. Sheep have diminished from 80,914
                    to 50,599, and pigs from 61,733 to 48,801. The number of goats was 10,012, and
                    of poultry 428,398.</p>
                <p>According to the corrected return of 1878, the land, exclusive of that in the
                    county of the city of Limerick, was divided among 1676 proprietors, possessing
                    660,386 acres, of the annual value of .£461,213, or 13s. lid. per acre. Of the
                    owners nearly 40 per cent, possessed less than 1 acre, the average extent being
                    394. The following were the largest proprietors :—Earl of Devon, 33,026; Earl of
                    Dunraven, 14,298; Lord Ashton, 11,273; Archdeacon Goold, 10,966; Lady Louisa

                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The inhabitants are employed chiefly in
                    agriculture, but coarse woollens are manufactured, and also paper, and there are
                    a considerable number of meal and flour mills. At one time there were a number
                    of flaxspinning and weaving mills, but that industry is now almost wholly
                    extinct.</p>

                    baronies, 131 parishes, 2067 townlands, and the city and parliamentary borough
                    of Limerick. The number of members returned to the Irish parliament was eight,
                    two being returned for each of the boroughs of Askeaton and Kilιnallock, in
                    addition to the two returned as at present for the county, and the two returned
                    for the county of the city of Limerick. There are three poor-law unions wholly
                    withiιι the county, and portions of four others. Assizes are held at Limerick,
                    and quarter sessions at Bruff, Limerick, Newcastle, and Rathkeale. The county is
                    within the Cork military district, with a brigade dépôt at Tralee. The
                    population, estimated in 1760 at 92,376, had increased in 1821 to 277,477, and
                    in 1841 to 331,003, but since that period it has been gradually diminishing,
                    being 217,277 in 1861, and in 1881 only 177,203, of whom 86,541 were males and
                    90,662 females. The decrease since 1871 has been 7 ’ 7 per cent., the decrease
                    per cent, in Ireland being 4’7. Besides the city of Limerick, with a population
                    in 1881 of 48,246, only two other towns, Rathkeale and Newcastle, had a
                    population of over 2000. From 1st May 1851 to 31st December 1880 the number of
                    emigrants from the county was 130,333, a proportion of 60 per cent, of the
                    population in 1861.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Limerick, originally inhabited
                    by the Coriondi, was included in the kingdom of Thomond. Afterwards it had .a
                    separate existence under the name of Aine-Cliach. From the 8th to the 11th
                    century it was partly occupied by the Danes. By Henry II. it was granted to
                    Henry Fitzherbert, but his claim was afterwards resigned, and subsequently
                    various Anglo-Norman settlements were made. About 100,000 acres of the estates
                    of the earl of Desmond, which were forfeited in 1586, were situated in the
                    county, and other extensive confiscations took place after the Cromwellian wars.
                    In 1709 a German colony from the Palatinate was settled by Lord Southwell near
                    Bruff, Rathkeale, and Adare.</p>
                <p>There are only slight remains of the round tower at Ardpatrick, but that at
                    Carrigeen is much better preserved. There are important remains of stone
                    circles, pillar stones, and altars on Loch Gur. In several places there are
                    remains of old moats and tumuli. Besides the monasteries in the city of
                    Limerick, the most important monastic ruins are those of Adare Abbey, Askeaton
                    Abbey, Kil-shane Abbey, Galbally Friary, Kilflin Monastery, Kilmallock Abbey,
                    and Monaster-Nenagh Abbey. See the <hi rend="italic">History of Limerick</hi> by

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Limekick,</hi> a county of a city, parliamentary borough,
                    and the chief town of the county of Limerick, is situated on both sides of the
                    Shannon, at the head of its estuary, and on an island of the river, 120 miles
                    west-south-west of Dublin by rail. The western bank of the river is occupied by
                    Irish Town, the island by English Town, and the eastern bank by Newtown
                    Pery,—the two former divisions consisting chiefly of mean houses occupied by the
                    poorer classes, and Newtown Pery including the principal streets, shops, and
                    public buildings. The different parts of the town are connected by several
                    bridges, the most important of which is Wellesley bridge, erected in 1827 at a
                    cost of £85,000. The cathedral of St Mary, founded in 1180, and rebuilt in</p>
                <p>1490, is a cruciform structure in the Gothic style, with an embattled tower 120
                    feet in height. A Roman Catholic cathedral in the First Pointed style was
                    erected in 1860. The other principal public buildings are the court-house, the
                    custom-house, the exchange, the chamber of commerce, the town-hall, the county
                    jail, the city jail, the infirmary, and Barrington’s hospital. There are
                    barracks for cavalry, artillery, and infantry. Limerick as a port occupies the
                    fourth position in Ireland, and, while possessing secure and open communication
                    with the Atlantic, is included in a vast network of inland navigation. Vessels
                    of 1000 tons can unload at the floating dock, and vessels of 500 tons at the
                    quays. A graving dock, admitting vessels of 1500 tons for repair, has lately
                    been constructed. The value of the imports in 1880 was £837,269, the average for
                    the four years 1876-79 being £940,279, and, for 1872-75 <pb break="no"

                    exports was £26,569, £9552, and £12,516. The principal industries are flax
                    spinning and weaving, and the manufacture of lace and gloves. There are also
                    breweries, distilleries, tanneries, and flour-mills. The population in 1851 was
                    48,961, which in 1871 had increased to 49,980, but in 1881 had diminished to

                    There is a tradition that it was visited by St Patrick in the 5th century, but
                    it is first authentically known as a settlement of the Danes, who in the middle
                    of the 9th century made it one of their principal towns, but were expelled from
                    it in the 11th century by Brian Boroimhe. From 1106 till its conquest by the
                    English in 1174 it was the seat of the kings of Thomond or North Munster, and,
                    although in 1179 the kingdom of Limerick was given by Henry II. to Herbert
                    Fitzherbert, the city was frequently in the possession of the Irish chieftains
                    till 1195. By King John it was committed to the care of William de Burgo, who
                    founded English Town, and for its defence erected a strong castle. The city was
                    frequently besieged in the 13th and 14th centuries. In the 15th century its
                    fortifications were extended to include Irish Town, and until their demolition
                    in 1760 it was one of the strongest fortresses of the kingdom. In 1651 it was
                    taken by General Ireton, and after an unsuccessful siege by William III. in 1690
                    its resistance was terminated in October of the following year by the treaty of
                    Limerick. The town first obtained municipal privileges in 1199, and these were
                    confirmed and extended by Edward I. and other sovereigns. In 1609 it received a
                    charter constituting it a county of a city, and also incorporating a society of
                    merchants of the staple, with the same privileges as the merchants of the staple
                    of Dublin and Waterford. The powers of the corporation were remodelled by the
                    Limerick Regulation Act of 1823. The prosperity of the city dates chiefly from
                    the foundation of Newtown Pery by Mr Sexton Pery in 1769. It returns two members
                    to parliament. See the <hi rend="italic">History</hi> by Linahan, 1866.</p>
