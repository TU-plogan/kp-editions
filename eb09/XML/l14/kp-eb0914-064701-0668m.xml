                    construction of certain optical instruments. Of the varieties of massive or
                    crystalline carbonate of lime, those which, through the fineness of their grain
                    and other qualities, lend themselves for the purposes of the sculptor go by the
                    name of marble, while the remainder are embraced under the generic term of
                    limestone. This name, however, is understood to exclude chalk, a soft, amorphous
                    variety which, according to Ehrenberg, consists mainly of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Foraminifera</hi> shells. All limestones contain at least traces of magnesia.
                    When this foreign base is present in considerable proportion the rock is termed
                    “dolomite” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnesium).</hi> Among the native forms of
                    (hydrated) sulphate of lime the mineral “selenite” (glacies Mariae) corresponds
                    to Iceland spar among the carbonates. It forms colourless transparent
                    clino-rhombic prisms, generally united into “twins,” and flattened down into
                    plates readily cleavable along planes parallel to the surface. Hardness ranges
                    from 1 ’ 5 to 2; the specific gravity is 2 <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 3. Far
                    more common than selenite are the massive varieties known as <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Alabaster</hi> (see vol. i. p. 439) and ordinary <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gypsum</hi> (vol. xi. p. 337).</p>
                <p>Both sulphate and carbonate of lime, apart from their occurrence as independent
                    minerals, are almost universally diffused throughout the earth’s crust, and in
                    the waters of the ocean. Now the sulphate is appreciably soluble in even pure
                    water, while the carbonate, though practically insoluble in pure, is quite
                    decidedly soluble in carbonic acid water. As all atmospheric water must
                    necessarily hold carbonic acid gas in absorption, most natural waters, and
                    certainly all deep-well waters, are contaminated with more or less of
                    bicarbonate or sulphate of lime, or with both. When such a water is being
                    boiled, there is an escape of the free and the loosely combined carbonic acid,
                    and the carbonate of lime comes down as a loose precipitate or as a “crust”;
                    and, when the water is sufficiently concentrated by evaporation, the sulphate
                    likewise is partly deposited. The decomposition of the “bicarbonate” in fact
                    takes place, though slowly, even at ordinary temperatures, when the water in
                    which it is held in solution is exposed to the atmosphere. It is in this manner
                    that stalagmites and stalactites frequently seen within rock-caverns are
                    produced, and there is no difficulty in accounting for the grotesque and
                    fantastic forms which the latter often exhibit.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Quicklime.—</hi> The native carbonate always serves as the
                    starting-point in the preparation of calcium compounds. From it the oxide CaO,
                    known as quicklime or caustic lime, is produced industrially by heating
                    limestone or marble in kilns, between layers of fuel, which in the United
                    Kingdom is generally coal. The carbonic acid goes away with the gaseous products
                    of combustion, and the oxide remains in unfused lumps of the form of the
                    original stones. Lime, when pure, is an amorphous white solid, which is
                    absolutely infusible and non volatile; and on this account, when raised to high
                    temperatures, it emits a brilliant white light (“lime-light”). The commercial
                    article is generally grey or otherwise discoloured by the presence of foreign
                    metallic oxides.</p>
                <p>The decomposition that goes on in a limekiln is not brought about by the effect
                    of heat alone. Gay-Lussac found long ago that carbonate of lime, when heated to
                    intense redness in a closely covered crucible, loses its carbonic acid only very
                    slowly, while the acid goes off readily even at somewhat lower temperatures when
                    a current of steam is passed over the heated limestone. This may be accounted
                    for by assuming that the steam, in the first instance, produces hydrate—from the
                    carbonate—of lime, which latter then at once breaks up into its two components.
                    More probably, however, the steam acts only by producing a <hi rend="italic"
                    >quasi</hi> vacuum, that is, by clearing out the carbonic acid which, if allowed
                    to stagnate even at high temperatures, would react on the quicklime produced,
                    thus preventing the decomposition of a portion of the carbonate.</p>
                <p>Quicklime acts readily and energetically on water, with evolution of much heat
                    (269 units per unit weight of lime, Berthelot) and formation of a bulky white
                    powder of the hydrate CaOH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O or Ca(OH) <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ This powder readily mixes with water into a smooth
                    paste, which may be diluted to a milky liquid—milk of lime. This, when filtered
                    through paper, yields “lime-water,” a strongly alkaline liquid containing about
                    <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th of its weight of
                    lime (calculated as CaO). When boiled it deposits a part of its dissolved lime
                    as such, and when exposed to ordinary air it quickly draws a skin of carbonate
                    of lime. Hence its application as a reagent for carbonic acid, and the extensive
                    use of mille of lime (whitewash) as a cheap white pigment in wall-painting. Lime
                    paste, as every one knows, is most extensively used as a mortar or cement for
                    bricks and stones in building. For this purpose it is always mixed with a
                    certain proportion of sand. This admixture in all probability was originally
                    intended only to save lime and prevent shrinking. But it is now generally
                    assumed to have a chemical function, causing the formation of a hard silicate of
                    lime pervading and thus strengthening the mortar. Some chemists deny the
                    practical importance though not the occurrence of this silication; what admits
                    of no doubt is that the hardening of mortar involves the very gradual conversion
                    of the original hydrate into carbonate of lime. Under the name of plaster, a
                    fine smooth paste of lime and sand, with short hair to increase the tenacity of
                    the mixture, is a most important material for coating the internal walls and
                    roofs of ordinary buildings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hydraulic Cements.—</hi> Ordinary mortar, on account of the
                    solubility of lime in water, is unfit for aquatic mascnry; for this purpose
                    hydraulic cements must be used. Of these there are a great variety, which,
                    however, mostly agree in this that they consist of calcined mixtures of
                    limestone and clay (preferably alkaliferous clay) and other silicates. By
                    calcining such mixtures at temperatures short of that at which a glass would be
                    produced, the lime becomes caustic, and part of the caustic lime, by uniting
                    with the clay (and silicate generally), forms a silicate sufficiently basic to
                    be disintegrable by acids and even by water. When such cement, as a powder, is
                    mixed with water, the lime acts upon the silicate of alkali and the gelatinous
                    silica-hydrate transitorily produced, and with the silica and alumina and oxide
                    of iron unites into a hard, waterproof, very complex, silicate mixture.</p>
                <p>H. Ste Claire Deville having found that magnesia has hydraulic properties,
                    hydraulic cements have been made by calcining dolomites of the proper
                    composition so far as to decompose only the carbonate of magnesia (into MgO and
                    CO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>). See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cement,</hi> vol. v.

                <p>Lime, being the cheapest of powerful bases, is largely used in chemical
                    manufacturing. It serves for the causticizing of soda, for the preparation of
                    ammonia from ammonia salts, and for the manufacture of bleaching powder. It also
                    enters into the composition of certain kinds of glass, and is used (as lime or
                    as carbonate), in the making of soda ash.</p>

                    limewater. But a more convenient method is to decompose a solution of pure
                    chloride of calcium with excess of carbonate of ammonia, preferably at 70-80°
                    C., when the carbonate assumes the form of a crystalline precipitate which
                    settles readily and is easily washed with hot water. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >sulphate</hi> (artificial gypsum) appears as a voluminous white precipitate,
                    consisting of minute colourless needles, when sulphuric acid is added to a not
                    too dilute solution of chloride of calcium or other lime salt. The precipitate
                    CaSO <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.2H <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O is

                    hydrated sulphate at temperatures exceeding 110“ C. loses its water. The
                    anhydrous sulphate, if formed below about 200° C., readily recombines with water
                    into compact gypsum (plaster of Paris). By exposure to high temperatures (500°
                    C. and upwards) sulphate of lime loses its power of recombining with water; at
                    very high temperatures it fuses. A naturally anhydrous sulphate of lime
                    (anhydrite) occurs in association with rock salt, and otherwise, as a not very
                    common mineral.</p>
                <p>The well-known favourable action of gypsum as a manure, more especially for
                    clover (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture),</hi> has lately been explained by
                    Déherain on the strength of analyses and vegetation experiments of his own, by
                    assuming that it converts the carbonate of potash of the soil into sulphate,
                    which, being less obstinately retained by the soil, more readily finds its way
                    into the roots of the plants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chloride of Calcium</hi> (muriatie of lime), CaCl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, is prepared by dissolving marble or limestone in
                    aqueous muriatic acid. The iron and manganese generally present as impurities
                    can be eliminated, after peroxidation by chlorine water, by digestion with
                    hydrate of lime, which also, if allowed sufficient time, removes the magnesia.
                    The filtrate is acidified with hydrochloric acid and concentrated by
                    evaporation, so far that, on cooling, it deposits part of the dissolved salt as
                    crystals. These have the composition CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>.6H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. They are very easily soluble in water and alcohol,
                    and highly hygroscopic. Hence the salt is used occasionally to keep textile
                    fibres moist and in a fit state for being woven. The crystals when kept in a
                    basin at about 200° lose about two-thirds of their water, and leave that porous
                    kind of chloride of calcium which analytical chemi⅛ts prefer for the drying of
                    gases. This substance, when heated to redness— which must be done in platinum to
                    prevent contamination—loses the rest of the λvater and (at 723° C., Carnelley)
                    fuses into the anhydrous salt CaCl <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, which on
                    cooling hardens into a stone-like mass. In this final process of dehydration,
                    however, part of the chlorine goes off as hydrochloric acid, so that the product
                    obtained is contaminated with some oxychloride. This can be prevented by
                    igniting the salt with sal-ammoniac or—more surely—by effecting the dehydration
                    in a current of anhydrous hydrochloric acid gas. Anhydrous chloride of calcium
                    is much used in laboratories as a powerful dehydrating agent. It combines with
                    ammonia gas into a solid compound. It dissolves in methyl alcohol and in ethyl
                    alcohol, forming crystallizable “alcoholates” (Graham), compounds of CaCl <hi

                    affected visibly by sulphuretted hydrogen, sulphide of ammonium, or pure
                    ammonia. Carbonate of ammonia, even in the presence of sal-ammoniac,
                    precipitates the carbonate. So far calcium behaves like barium and strontium.
                    From the former it is distinguished by its not being precipitated by either
                    hydrofluosilicic acid or bichromate of potash, and from both by its spectrum and
                    the relatively large solubility of its sulphate in water. The latter is obtained
                    from any calcium solution by addition of sulphuric acid and alcohol. The
                    sulphate is washed with alcohol on a filter. When then boiled with water it
                    yields a solution which, dilute as it is, gives a very distinct precipitate with
                    oxalate of ammonia (barium and strontium sulphates in these circumstances give
                    negative results). Oxalate of ammonia is the most delicate precipitant for
                    calcium; the precipitate is insoluble in water, in ammonia and ammonia salts,
                    and in acetic acid. From solutions (in acids) of phosphate or oxalate of calcium
                    ammonia and likewise sulphide of ammonium precipitate the metal as phosphate or
                    oxalate. To detect it in such a precipitate, dissolve in hydrochloric acid and
                    add sulphuric acid and alcohol. The calcium is precipitated as sulphate, which
                    can be identified as just explained.</p>
