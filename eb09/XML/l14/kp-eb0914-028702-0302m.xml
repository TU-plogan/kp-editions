                    contained the important cities of Toulouse, Carcassonne, Narbonne, Montpellier,
                    Nismes, Cette, Viviers, Alby, and Foix. The south-western spurs of the Cevennes
                    run across the province from the north-east to meet the first slopes of the
                    Pyrenees. In spring and early summer no part of France possesses a more
                    delightful climate than Languedoc, while Montpellier and its neighbourhood, in
                    spite of the mistral, was up to recent times considered as an excellent retreat
                    for consumptive patients. The Roman remains of Nismes, the lagoons and decayed
                    towns of the Gulf of Lyons, the historical associations of Montpellier, the fine
                    mediaeval fortress of Carcassonne, the old towers and the hôtel de ville of
                    Narbonne, the little known scenery of the eastern Pyrenees, with the castles of
                    Foix and Tarascon, and Toulouse with its churches, fairs, floral games, and
                    winding streets, make the country one of the most interesting in the whole of
                    France. Here may still be heard the soft accents of the Langue d’Oc, a language
                    which has not, even yet, spoken its last word in the poetry of the world.</p>
                <p>Gallia Narbonensis, one of the seventeen provinces into which the empire was
                    divided at the death of Augustus, occupied nearly the same extent as the
                    province of Languedoc. It was rich and flourishing, crowded with great towns,
                    densely populated, with schools of rhetoric and poetry, theatres, amphitheatres,
                    and splendid temples. From Narbo Martius came the rhetorician and poet Montanus,
                    who was exiled by Tiberius to Majorca; from Nismes came Domitius Afer; and the
                    emperors Carinus and Numerianus were also natives of Narbonne. The planting of
                    Christianity, though doubtless the Greeks of Massilia heard of it before, was
                    accomplished, according to tradition, by St Trophimus of Arles, St Paul of
                    Beziers, and Saint Saturnin of Toulouse. It is characteristic of the country
                    that its ecclesiastical historians lament even in the earliest ages a tendency
                    to heresy among its people. At the break up of the Roman empire the Visigoths
                    founded the kingdom of Toulouse (412 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and in a
                    few years spread their conquests over Narbonensis, Novempopulana (Gascony), and
                    Aquitania in France, as well as over the whole of the Spanish peninsula. They
                    were driven out of France by Clovis, but retained “Septimania,” the country of
                    the seven cities—Narbonne, Carcassonne, Eine, Beziers, Maguelonne, Lodève, and
                    Agde—that is, very nearly the area occupied later by the province of Languedoc.
                    At the council of Narbonne (589) five sorts of people are mentioned as living in
                    the province:—the Visigoths, then the ruling race, Romans, Jews, of whom there
                    were a great many, Syrians, and Greeks. It was not until the year 759, when
                    Pippin took their chief town, Narbonne, that the Visigoths were forced across
                    the Pyrenees, and the country became part of the great empire bequeathed by
                    Pippin to his great son Charles. Septimania became part of the kingdom of
                    Aquitaine, but was separated from it and constituted a special duchy in the year
                    817. Two or more invasions of the Saracens took place in the 9th century, and
                    the Normans made a descent upon the coast in the year 859. Early in the 10th
                    century we find the whole province in the power of the counts of Toulouse, and
                    one of the great fiefs of the crown of France. While the Normans were ravaging
                    the north of France and laying siege to Paris, the Saracens from the mouths of
                    the Rhone were plundering and harrying the county of Toulouse. Neither in the
                    south nor in the north of the country was there during the terrible 10th and
                    11th centuries any peace or comfort. A frightful pestilence desolated Aquitaine
                    and Toulouse in the year 1000; and in 1032 a famine began which lasted for three
                    years. Yet the court of Toulouse was already remarkable for its “luxury,” as the
                    ecclesiastical writers call it,—rather for its love of art and literature,
                    combined with extravagance of dress and fashions. Constance, wife of King
                    Robert, and daughter of the count of Toulouse, gave great offence to the monks
                    by her following of gallant countrymen. They owed their tastes, not only to
                    their Roman blood and the survival of their old love for rhetoric and poetry,
                    but also to their intercourse with the Saracens, their neighbours and enemies,
                    and their friends when they were not fighting. On the preaching of the crusade,
                    no part of France responded with greater enthusiasm than the south. A hundred
                    thousand men followed Raymond de Saint Gilles. A century later their own country
                    was to be the scene of another crusade even more bloody than that against the
                    Saracen.</p>
                <p>The heresies which were the cause of so much bloodshed may, perhaps, be said to
                    have begun with Peter de Brueys, who preached in Languedoc for twenty years,
                    until he was silenced by the usual method. He denied <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n303/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0303-0288"/> infant baptism, respect for churches, the worship
                    of the cross, transubstantiation, and prayers for the dead. His follower, Henry
                    the Deacon, most eloquent of preachers, denied a great deal more. Wherever he
                    taught he left deserted churches and contempt for the clergy. Although Bernard
                    himself was invited to lend his persuasive powers to restore the cause of the
                    church, he succeeded for a time only. Toulouse, for instance, was brought back
                    to orthodoxy; yet when the great preacher went away the citizens relapsed.
                    Again, there.were the poor men of Lyons, the followers of Peter Waldo, of whom
                    there were many in Languedoc; and there were the Manichaeans, under the name of
                    Puritans, Paterines, or Populars. In Languedoc and Provence the ground was ready
                    for the seed of heresy. The towns were wealthy and free, the people had been in
                    continual intercourse with Saracens of Palestine and Moors in Spain; they had
                    never entirely rid themselves of pagan customs; their poetry taught the joys of
                    life rather than the fear of death; their restless inquiring minds prompted them
                    to ask whether there were any other solution of the problem of life than that
                    offered by the church. The whole province—the county of Toulouse, with its fiefs
                    of Narbonne, Beziers, Foix, Montpellier, and Quercy—was in open and scornful
                    secession. It seems incredible, but it is doubtless true, that the churches were
                    universally deserted, sacraments denied, and clergy despised. The history cf the
                    crusade, in the reign of Raymond VI., against the heretics of Languedoc contains
                    every element of cruelty and horror. The count made haste to submit, but it was
                    of no avail. Bishops, papal legates, and ecclesiastics of all ranks headed the
                    vast armies which were gathered·together against the freethinkers. All the
                    cities, one after the other, the castles, and the strongholds of Languedoc were
                    taken by the crusaders. Raymond was made to submit to the lowest abasement; the
                    country was wasted; the people were destroyed by fire and sword. When all was
                    over, when Raymond and Simon de Montfort were dead, and King Louis VIII. had led
                    a vast army of conquest through the country, the council of Toulouse was held,
                    in order to subject the people to total spiritual submission. They chose the
                    method, which seems so easy but is so difficult, of universal espionage and
                    delation. They succeeded in enforcing apparent submission; but the spirit of
                    religious freedom lingered among the people, and yet survives, for nearly half
                    the Protestants in France belong to the south. The pacification of Languedoc was
                    completed by the annexation of the county to the crown of France. In 1229 Count
                    Raymond VII. renounced his claim to seven provinces, and swore fealty to the
                    king.</p>
                <p>Languedoc had, for two centuries, no other history apart from that of France. The
                    long wars with the English affected the country little. The province,
                    comparatively safe from war, continued to increase and prosper in wealth. When
                    it begins again to have a history of its own, it appears to be the home of the
                    most bigoted orthodoxy. The university of Toulouse burns a professor, Caturce,
                    for supposed heresy, and exiles a scholar, Dolet, for daring to sympathize with
                    him. At the east of the province, however, Rabelais, who carries with him an
                    atmosphere of free thought, is lecturing and dissecting; and in the west of the
                    province Gerard Roussel is already preaching the doctrines of a purer faith. In
                    the wars of religion, the great recruiting ground of Coligny was in those
                    southern provinces against which Simon de Montfort had led his crusade. The
                    insurrection of the Camisards belongs to the history of Languedoc, but the
                    struggle was confined to the north part of the province. The pacification by
                    Villars and the duke of Berwick, the horrible cruelties practised upon the
                    people, and the singular story of Cavalier are noticed elsewhere</p>
                <p>A special interest attaches to the history of two towns, at least, of Languedoc.
                    Both Montpellier and Toulouse present very remarkable features of interest to
                    the student of municipal histories. The literature of the country is the
                    literature called after its neighbour <hi rend="smallcaps">Provence</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.u).</hi> Probably no great future remains for the literature of
                    a dialect slowly dying out, yet examples have not been wanting of late to prove
                    that there is still vitality in the language of the people. (w. <hi
