                <p>ABRAHAM LINCOLN (1809-1865), sixteenth president of the United States of America,
                    was born in Hardin county, Kentucky, on February 12, 1809. His father, Thomas
                    Lincoln, and his mother, Nancy Hanks, were both natives of Virginia, as was also
                    his paternal grandfather, whose ancestors came from Berks county, Pennsylvania.
                    When Lincoln was eight years of age his father moved to Indiana, in what is now
                    Spencer county. The region was still a wilderness, and the boy grew up in
                    pioneer life, dwelling in a rude log-cabin, and knowing but the primitive
                    manners, conversation, and ambitions of sparsely settled backwood
                    neighbourhoods. Schools were rare, and teachers only qualified to impart the
                    merest rudiments of instruction. “Of course when I came of age I did not know
                    much,” wrote the future president; “still somehow I could read, write, and
                    cipher to the rule of three, but that was all. I have not been to school since.
                    The little advance I now have upon this store of education I have picked up from
                    time to time linder the pressure of necessity.” In 1818 his mother died, and his
                    father a year afterwards married again. When nineteen years of age Lincoln made
                    a journey as a hired hand on a flatboat to New Orleans. In 1830 his father
                    emigrated to Macon county, Illinois, and Lincoln aided in building the cabin,
                    clearing a field, and splitting rails to fence it. The locality proved
                    unhealthy, and general sickness made them resolve to abandon it. Being now
                    twenty-one years of age, Lincoln hired himself to one Offutt, in Sangamon
                    county, assisting him to build a flatboat and float it down the Sangamon,
                    Illinois, and Mississippi rivers to New Orleans. Afterwards Offutt made him
                    clerk of his country store at New Salem; this gave’him moments of leisure to
                    begin self-education. He borrowed a grammar and other books, and sought
                    explanations from the village schoolmaster. Next year the Black Hawk Indian war
                    broke out; Lincoln volunteered in one of the Sangamon county companies, and was
                    elected captain. He was already a candidate for the Illinois legislature when
                    this occurred; his printed address “To the people of Sangamon county” bears date
                    March 9, 1832, and betokens talent and education far beyond mere ability to
                    “read, write, and cipher.” The Black Hawk campaign lasted about three months;
                    Lincoln shared the hardships of camp and march, but was in no battle. He was
                    defeated for the legislature that summer, being yet a comparative stranger in
                    the county, but received a flattering majority in his own election precinct,
                    where also, a little later, local friendship, disregarding politics, procured
                    his appointment as postmaster of New Salem. The purchase and failure of a small
                    country store having burdened him with debt, the county surveyor of Sangamon
                    opportunely offered to make him one of his deputies. He qualified himself by
                    study in all haste, and entered upon the practical duties of surveying farm
                    lines, roads, and town sites. “This,” to use his own words, “procured bread, and
                    kept body and soul together.”</p>
                <p>The year 1834 had now arrived, and Lincoln was chosen one of the members of the
                    Illinois legislature. He was re-elected successively in 1836, 1838, and 1840,
                    after which he declined further nomination. At the two latter terms he received
                    the complimentary vote of his party friends for speaker, they being in the
                    minority. During the canvass of 1834 his political friend and colleague John T.
                    Stuart, a lawyer in full practice, strongly encouraged him to study law, and
                    lent him text-books to begin his reading. Lincoln followed his advice, and,
                    working diligently, was admitted to the bar in the autumn of 1836. On April 15,
                    1837, he quitted New Salem, and removed to Springfield, which was then the
                    county seat, but soon after became the capital of the State, to begin practice
                    in partnership with his friend Stuart. His legislative experience was still
                    further enlarged by his service of one term as representative to the Congress of
                    the United States, to which he was elected in August 1846. He had become an
                    eloquent and influential public speaker, and in several campaigns was on his
                    party ticket as Whig candidate for presidential elector. Though to some extent
                    still mingling in politics, Lincoln now for a period of about five years devoted
                    himself more exclusively to the study and practice of law, his repeated
                    successes drawing him into the most important cases.</p>
                <p>In 1854 began the great slavery agitation by the repeal of the slavery
                    prohibition of 1820, called the Missouri Compromise. Aroused to new activity by
                    what he regarded a gross breach of political faith, Lincoln entered upon public
                    discussions with an earnestness and force that by common consent gave him
                    leadership of the opposition in Illinois, which that year elected a majority of
                    the legislature. This would have secured his election to the United States
                    senate, in the winter of 1854, to succeed Shields, a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n682/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0682-0659"/> Democrat; but four opposition members, of
                    Democratic antecedents, refused to vote for Lincoln, who was yet called a Whig,
                    and by their persistence compelled the election of Trumbull. The Republican
                    party of Illinois was formally organized in 1856; the campaign resulted
                    substantially in a drawn battle, the Democrats gaining a majority in the State
                    for president, while the Republicans elected the governor and State officers. In
                    1858 the senatorial term of Douglas, author of the repeal of the Missouri
                    compromise, was expiring, and he sought reelection. Lincoln, who had four years
                    before successfully met him in public debate, was now by unanimous resolution of
                    the Republican State convention designated as his rival and opponent. Yielding
                    to the wish of his party friends, Lincoln challenged Douglas to a joint public
                    discussion. The antagonists met in debate at seven designated points in the
                    State, while they also separately addressed audiences in nearly every one of the
                    hundred counties. At the November election the Republicans received a majority
                    in the popular vote, but the Democrats, through a favourable apportionment of
                    representative districts, secured a majority of the legislature, which
                    re-elected Douglas. This remarkable campaign excited the closest attention from
                    every part of the Union. Lincoln, addressing the convention which nominated him,
                    June 16,1858, opened the discussion with the following bold prophecy :—</p>
                <p>“A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this Government cannot
                    endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be
                    dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be
                    divided. It will become all one thing or all the other. Either the opponents of
                    slavery will arrest the further spread of it, and place it where the public mind
                    shall rest in the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction; or its
                    advocates will push it forward, till it shall become alike lawful in all the
                    States, old as well as new—North as well as South.”</p>
                <p>Lincoln’s speeches in this campaign won him a national fame, which was greatly
                    increased by several made in Ohio the following year, and especially by his
                    Cooper Institute address in New York city, February 27, 1860. More than any
                    contemporary statesman he had in the long six years’ agitation insisted that,
                    transcending the technical point of constitutional authority, or the problem of
                    public policy, the deeper question of human right and wrong lay at the bottom of
                    the slavery controversy.</p>
                <p>The Republican national convention, which made “No Extension of Slavery” its
                    principal tenet, met at Chicago, May 16, 1860. Seward was the leading candidate;
                    but the more conservative delegates opposed him as being too radical, and
                    uniting their forces nominated Lincoln, who was elected president of the United
                    States after an unusually animated political campaign, November 6, 1860,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The popular Vote cast for
                    electors stood:—Lincoln, 1,866,462; Douglas, 1,375,157; Breckinridge, 847,953;
                    Bell, 590,631. The official vote cast by the electors on December 5, 1860, and
                    counted and declared by Congress on February 13, 1861, was:—Lincoln, 180;
                    Breckinridge, 72; Bell, 39; Douglas, 12.</p></note> and inaugurated at
                    Washington, March 4, 1861. Meanwhile a formidable movement, begun by South
                    Carolina a month before the November election, and based on the slavery
                    agitation, had carried the slave States South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama,
                    Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas into secession. A provisional
                    government under the designation “The Confederate States of America,” with
                    Jefferson Davis as president, was organized by the seceding States, who seized
                    by force nearly all the forts, arsenals, and public buildings within their
                    limits. Great division of sentiment existed in the North, whether in this
                    emergency acquiescence or coercion was the preferable policy. Lincoln’s
                    inaugural address declared the Union perpetual and acts of secession void, and
                    announced the determination of the Government to defend its autho rity, and to
                    hold forts and places yet in its possession. On the other hand, he disclaimed
                    any intention to invade, subjugate, or oppress the seceding States. “You can
                    have no conflict,” he said, “without being yourselves the aggressors.” Fort
                    Sumter in Charleston harbour had been besieged by the secessionists since
                    January; and, it being now on the point of surrender through starvation, Lincoln
                    sent the besiegers official notice on April 8 that a fleet was on its way to
                    carry provisions to the fort, but that he would not attempt to reinforce it
                    unless this effort were resisted. The Confederates, however, immediately ordered
                    its reduction, and after a thirty-four hours’ bombardment the garrison
                    capitulated, April 13, 1861.</p>
                <p>With civil war thus provoked, Lincoln on April 15th by proclamation called 75,000
                    three months’ militia under arms, and on May 4th ordered the further enlistment
                    of 64,748 soldiers and 18,000 seamen for three years’ service. He instituted a
                    blockade of the Southern ports, took effective steps to extemporize a navy,
                    convened Congress in special session, and asked for legislation and authority to
                    make the war “short, sharp, and decisive.” The country responded with enthusiasm
                    to his summons and suggestions; and the South on its side was not less active.
                    The Sumter bombardment rapidly developed and increased the limits of
                    insurrection. Four additional slave States drifted into secession; the Unionists
                    maintained ascendency in Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri, and succeeded in
                    dividing Virginia. Minor engagements soon took place between the opposing
                    forces; and on July 21, 1861, the first important battle was fought at Bull Run,
                    and resulted in the defeat and panic of the Unionists.</p>
                <p>The slavery question presented vexatious difficulties in conducting the war.
                    Acute observers could not fail to note that its gigantic agencies were beginning
                    to work in the direction of practical abolition. Congress in August 1861 passed
                    an Act confiscating rights of slaveowners to slaves employed in hostile service
                    against the Union. On August 31st General Fremont by military order declared
                    martial law and confiscation against active enemies, with freedom to their
                    slaves, in the State of Missouri. Believing that under existing conditions such
                    a step was both detrimental in present policy and unauthorized in law, President
                    Lincoln directed him to modify the order to make it conform to the Confiscation
                    Act of Congress. Strong political factions were instantly formed for and against
                    military emancipation, and the Government was hotly beset by antagonistic
                    counsel. The Unionists of the border slave States were greatly alarmed, but
                    Lincoln by his moderate conservatism held them to the military support of the
                    Government. Meanwhile he sagaciously prepared the way for the supreme act of
                    statesmanship which the gathering national crisis already dimly foreshadowed. On
                    March 6, 1862, he sent a special message to Congress recommending the passage of
                    a resolution offering pecuniary aid from the general Government to induce States
                    to adopt gradual abolishment of slavery. Promptly passed by Congress, the
                    resolution produced no immediate result except in its influence on public
                    opinion. A practical step, however, soon followed. In April Congress passed and
                    the president approved an Act emancipating the slaves in the District of
                    Columbia, with compensation to owners—a measure which Lincoln had proposed when
                    in Congress in 1849. Meanwhile slaves of loyal masters were constantly escaping
                    to military camps. Some commanders excluded them altogether; others surrendered
                    them on demand; while still others sheltered and protected them against their
                    owners. Lincoln tolerated this latitude as falling properly within the military
                    discretion pertaining to local army operations. A new case, however, soon
                    demanded his official interference. On the 9th of May 1862 General <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0683-0660"/> Hunter, commanding in the limited areas gained
                    along the southern coast, issued a short order declaring his department under
                    martial law, and adding—“Slavery and martial law in a free country are
                    altogether incompatible. The persons in these three States—Georgia, Florida, and
                    South Carolina—heretofore held as slaves are, therefore, declared for ever
                    free.” As soon as this order, by the slow method of communication by sea,
                    reached the newspapers, Lincoln (May 19) published a proclamation declaring it
                    void; adding further, “Whether it be competent for me as commander-in-chief of
                    the army and navy to declare the slaves of any State or States free, and whether
                    at any time or in any case it shall have become a necessity indispensable to the
                    maintenance of the Government to exercise such supposed power, are questions
                    which under my responsibility I reserve to myself, and which I. cannot feel
                    justified in leaving to the decision of commanders in the field. These are
                    totally different questions from those of police regulations in armies or
                    camps.” But in the same prβclamation Lincoln recalled to the public his own
                    proposal and the assent of Congress to compensate States which would adopt
                    voluntary and gradual abolishment. “To the people of these States now,” he
                    added, “I most earnestly appeal. I do not argue. I beseech you to make the
                    argument for yourselves. You cannot, if you would, be blind to the signs of the
                    times.” Meanwhile the antislavery sentiment of the North constantly increased.
                    During June Congress by express Act prohibited the existence of slavery in all
                    territories outside of States. On July 12th the president called the
                    representsftives of the border slave States to the executive mansion, and once
                    more urged upon them his proposal of compensated emancipation. “If the war
                    continues long,” he said, “as it must if the object be not sooner attained, the
                    institution in your States will be extinguished by mere friction and abrasion—by
                    the mere incidents of the war. It will be gone, and you will have nothing
                    valuable in lieu of it.” While Lincoln’s appeal brought the border States to no
                    practical decision, it served to prepare public opinion for his final act.
                    During the month of July his own mind reached the virtual determination to give

                    his cabinet the draft of an emancipation proclamation substantially as afterward
                    issued. Serious military reverses constrained him for the present to withhold
                    it, while on the other hand they served to increase the pressure upon him from
                    antislavery men. Horace Greeley having addressed a public letter to him
                    complaining of “the policy you seem to be pursuing with regard to the slaves of
                    the rebels,” the president replied August 22, saying, “My paramount object is to
                    save the Union, and not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the
                    Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; if I could save it by freeing
                    all the slaves, I would do it; and, if I could do it by freeing some and leaving
                    others alone, I would also do that.” Thus still holding back violent reformers
                    with one hand, and leading up halting conservatives with the other, he on
                    September 13 replied among other things to an address from a delegation: “I do
                    not want to issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be
                    inoperative like the pope’s bull against the comet. . . . I view this matter as
                    a practical war measure, to be decided on according to the advantages or
                    disadvantages it may offer to the suppression of the rebellion. . . . I have not
                    decided against a proclamation of liberty to the slaves, but hold the matter
                    under advisement.”</p>
                <p>The year 1862 had opened with important Union victories. Grant captured Forts
                    Henry and Donelson, and won the battle of Shiloh. Burnside took possession of
                    Roanoke island on the North Carolina coast. The famous contest between the new
                    ironclads “Monitor” and “Merrimac” ended in the Confederate vessel being beaten
                    back, crippled, and ultimately destroyed. Farragut with a wooden fleet ran past
                    the twin forts St Philip and Jackson, compelled the surrender of New Orleans,
                    and gained control of the lower Mississippi. These successes extended from
                    January to April. The succeeding three months brought disaster and discouragment
                    to the Union army. M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Clellan <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s campaign against Richmond was made abortive by his
                    bad generalship, and compelled the withdrawal of his army. Pope’s army,
                    advancing against the same city by another line, was beaten back upon Washington
                    in defeat. The tide of war, however, once more turned in the defeat of Lee’s
                    invading army at South Mountain and Antietam in Maryland on the 14th and 17th of
                    September, compelling him to retreat.</p>
                <p>With public opinion thus ripened by alternate defeat and victory, President
                    Lincoln on September 22, 1862, issued his preliminary proclamation of
                    emancipation, giving notice that on the 1st of January 1863, “all persons held
                    as slaves within any State or designated part of a State the people whereof
                    shall then be in rebellion against the United States shall be then,
                    thenceforward, and forever free.” In his message to Congress on the 1st of
                    December following, he again urged his plan of gradual, compensated emancipation
                    “as a means, not in exclusion of, but additional to, all others for restoring
                    and preserving the national authority throughout the Union.” On the 1st day of
                    January 1863 the final proclamation of emancipation was duly issued, designating
                    the States of Arkansas, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, South
                    Carolina, North Carolina, and certain portions of Louisiana and Virginia, as
                    “this day in rebellion against the United States,” and proclaiming that, in
                    virtue of his authority as commander-in-chief, and as a necessary war measure
                    for suppressing rebellion, “I do order and declare that all persons held as
                    slaves within said designated States and parts of States are and henceforward
                    shall be free,” and pledging the executive and military power of the Government
                    to maintain such freedom. The legal validity of these proclamations was never
                    pronounced upon by the national courts; but their decrees gradually enforced by
                    the march of armies were soon recognized by public opinion to be practically
                    irreversible. Such dissatisfaction as they caused in the border slave States
                    died out in the stress of war. The systematic enlistment of negroes and their
                    incorporation into the army by regiments, hitherto only tried as exceptional
                    experiments, were now pushed with vigour, and, being followed by several
                    conspicuous instances of their gallantry on the battlefield, added another
                    strong impulse to the sweeping change of popular sentiment. To put the finality
                    of emancipation beyond all question, Lincoln in the winter session of 1863-64
                    strongly supported à movement in Congress to abolish slavery by constitutional
                    amendment, but the necessary two-thirds vote of the House could not then be
                    obtained. In his annual message of December 6, 1864, he urged the immediate
                    passage of the measure. Congress now acted promptly: on January 31, 1865, that
                    body by joint resolution proposed to the States the 13th amendment of the
                    federal constitution, providing that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude,
                    except as a punishment for crime, whereof the party shall have been duly
                    convicted, shall exist within the United States or any place subject to their
                    jurisdiction.” Before the end of that year twenty-seven out of the thirty-six
                    States of the Union (being the required three-fourths) had ratified the
                    amendment, and official proclamation made December 18, 1865, declared it duly
                    adopted.</p>
                <p>The foreign policy of President Lincoln, while subordinate in importance to the
                    great questions of the civil war, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0684-0661"/> nevertheless presented several difficult and
                    critical problems for his decision. Towards the close of 1861 the arrest by
                    Captain Wilkes of two Confederate envoys proceeding to Europe in the British
                    steamer “Trent” seriously threatened peace with England. Public opinion in
                    America almost unanimously sustained the act; but Lincoln, convinced that the
                    proceeding had been unlawful, promptly, upon the suggestion of England, ordered
                    the liberation of the prisoners. A still broader foreign question grew out of
                    Mexican affairs, when events culminating in the setting up of Maximilian of
                    Austria as emperor under protection of French troops demanded the constant
                    watchfulness of the United States. Lincoln’s course was one of prudent
                    moderation. France voluntarily declared that she sought in Mexico only to
                    satisfy injuries done her and not to overthrow or establish local government or
                    to appropriate territory. The United States Government replied that, relying on
                    these assurances, it would maintain strict non-intervention, at the same time
                    openly avowing the general sympathy of its people with a Mexican republic, and
                    that “their own safety and the cheerful destiny to which they aspire are
                    intimately dependent on the continuance of free republican institutions
                    throughout America.” In the early part of 1863 the French Government proposed a
                    mediation between the North and the South. This offer President Lincoln declined
                    to consider, Seward replying for him that it would only be entering into
                    diplomatic discussion with the rebels whether the authority of the Government
                    should be renounced, and the country delivered over to disunion and anarchy.</p>
                <p>The civil war gradually grew to dimensions beyond all expectation. By January
                    1863 the Union armies numbered near a million men, and were kept up to this
                    strength till the end of the struggle. The Federal war debt eventually reached
                    the sum of $2,700,000,000. The fortunes of battle were somewhat fluctuating
                    during the first half of 1863, but the beginning of July brought the Union
                    forces decisive victories. The reduction of Vicksburg and Port Hudson, with
                    other operations, restored complete control of the Mississippi, severing the
                    Southern Confederacy. In the east Lee had the second time marched his army into
                    Pennsylvania to suffer a disastrous defeat at Gettysburg, on July 1st to 3d,
                    though he was able to withdraw his shattered forces south of the Potomac. At the
                    dedication of this battlefield as a soldiers’ cemetery in November, President
                    Lincoln made the following oration, which has taken permanent place as a classic
                    in American literature :—</p>
                <p>“Fourscore'and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new
                    nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
                    created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war testing whether that
                    nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met
                    on a great battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
                    field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that that
                    nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
                    But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot
                    hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here have
                    consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
                    note nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did
                    here. It is for us the living rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work
                    which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us
                    to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us—that from these
                    honoured dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
                    last full measure of devotion—that we here highly resolve that these dead shall
                    not have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new birth of
                    freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall
                    not perish from the earth.”</p>
                <p>In the unexpected prolongation of the war, volunteer enlistments became too slow
                    to replenish the waste of armies, and in 1863 the Government was forced to
                    resort to a draft. The enforcement of the conscription created much opposition
                    in various parts of the country, and led to a serious riot in the city of New
                    York on July 13. President Lincoln executed the draft with all possible justice
                    and forbearance, but refused every importunity to postpone it. It was made a
                    special subject of criticism by the Democratic party of the North, which was now
                    organizing itself on the basis of a discontinuance of the war, to endeavour to
                    win the presidential election of the following year. Mr Vallandigham of Ohio,
                    having made a violent public speech against the war and military proceedings,
                    was arrested by General Burnside, tried by military commission, and sentenced to
                    imprisonment; a writ of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus</hi> was refused, and
                    the sentence was changed by the president to transportation beyond the military
                    lines. By way of political defiance the Democrats of Ohio nominated Vallandigham
                    for governor. Prominent Democrats and a committee of the Convention having
                    appealed for his release, Lincoln wrote two long letters in reply discussing the
                    constitutional question, and declaring that in his judgment the president as
                    commander-in-chief in time of rebellion or invasion holds the power and
                    responsibility of suspending the privilege of the writ of <hi rend="italic"
                    >habeas corpus,</hi> but offering to release Vallandigham if the committee would
                    sign a declaration that rebellion exists, that an army and navy are
                    constitutional means to suppress it, and that each of them would use his
                    personal power and influence to prosecute the war. This liberal offer and their
                    refusal to accept it counteracted all the political capital they hoped to make
                    out of the case; and public opinion was still more powerfully influenced in
                    behalf of the president’s action, by the pathos of the query which he propounded
                    in one of his letters :—“Must I shoot the simple-minded soldier boy who deserts,
                    while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert ?”
                    When the election took place in Ohio, Vallandigham was defeated by a majority of
                    more than a hundred thousand.</p>
                <p>Many unfounded rumours of a willingness on the part of the Confederate States to
                    make peace were circulated from time to time to weaken the Union war spirit. To
                    all such suggestions, up to the time of issuing his emancipation proclamation,
                    Lincoln announced his readiness to stop fighting and grant amnesty, whenever
                    they would submit to and maintain the national authority under the constitution
                    of the United States. Certain agents in Canada having in 1864 intimated that
                    they were empowered to treat for peace, Lincoln, through Greeley, tendered them
                    safe conduct to Washington. They were by this forced to confess that they
                    possessed no authority to negotiate. The president thereupon sent them, and made
                    public, the following standing offer :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ To whom it may concern:</p>
                <p>“Any proposition which embraces the restoration of peace, the integrity of the
                    whole Union, and the abandonment of slavery, and which comes by and with an
                    authority that can control the armies now at war against the United States, will
                    be received and considered by the Executive Government of the United States, and
                    will be met by liberal terms on substantial and collateral points, and the
                    bearer or bearers thereof shall have safe conduct both ways.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Abraham Lincoln.”</hi></p>
                <p>“July 18, 1864.”</p>
                <p>A noteworthy conference on this question took place near the close of the civil
                    war, when the strength of the rebellion was almost exhausted. F. P. Blair,
                    senior, a personal friend of Jefferson Davis, acting solely on his own
                    responsibility, was permitted to go from "Washington to Richmond, where, after a
                    private and unofficial interview, Davis in writing declared his willingness to
                    enter a conference “to secure peace to the two countries.” Report being duly
                    made to President Lincoln, he wrote a note consenting to receive any agent sent
                    informally “with <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n685/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0685-0662"/> a view of securing peace to the people of our
                    common country.” Upon the basis of this latter proposition three Confederate
                    commissioners finally came to Hampton Roads, where President Lincoln and
                    Secretary Seward met them, and on February 3, 1865, an informal conference of
                    four hours’ duration was held. Private reports of the interview agree
                    substantially in the statement that the Confederates proposed a cessation of the
                    civil war, and postponement of its issues for future adjustment, while for the
                    present the belligerents should unite in a campaign to expel the French from
                    Mexico, and to enforce the Monroe doctrine. President Lincoln, however, declined
                    the ensnaring alliance, and adhered to the instructions he had given Seward
                    before deciding to personally accompany him. These formulated three
                    indispensable conditions to adjustment :—first, the restoration of the national
                    authority throughout all the States; second, no receding by the executive of the
                    United States on the slavery question; third, no cessation of hostilities short
                    of an end of the war, and the disbanding of all forces hostile to the
                    Government. These terms the commissioners were not authorized to accept, and the
                    interview ended without result.</p>
                <p>As Lincoln’s first presidential term of four years neared its end, the Democratic
                    party gathered itself for a supreme effort to regain the ascendency lost in
                    1860. The slow progress of the war, the severe sacrifice of life in campaign and
                    battle, the enormous accumulation of public debt, arbitrary arrests and
                    suspension of <hi rend="italic">habeas corpus,</hi> the rigour of the draft, and
                    the proclamation of military emancipation furnished ample subjects of bitter and
                    vindictive campaign oratory. A partisan coterie which surrounded M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> t</hi> Clellan loudly charged the failure of his Richmond
                    campaign to official interference in his plans. Vallandigham had returned to his
                    home in defiance of his banishment beyond military lines, and was leniently
                    suffered to remain. The aggressive spirit of the party, however, pushed it to a
                    fatal extreme. The Democratic National Convention adopted (August 29, 1864) a
                    resolution declaring the war a failure, and demanding a cessation of
                    hostilities; it nominated M <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> Clellan for
                    president, and instead of adjourning <hi rend="italic">sine die</hi> as usual,
                    remained organized, and subject to be convened at any time and place by the
                    executive national committee. This threatening attitude, in conjunction with
                    alarming indications of a conspiracy to resist the draft, had the effect to
                    thoroughly consolidate the war party, which had on June 8 unanimously
                    renominated Lincoln. At the election held November 8, 1864, Lincoln received
                    2,216,076 of the popular votes, and M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clellan but
                    1,808,725; while of the presidential electors 212 voted for Lincoln and 21 for M
                    <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Clellan. Lincoln’s second term of office began
                    March 4, 1865.</p>
                <p>While this political contest was going on the civil war was being brought to a
                    decisive close. Grant, at the head of the army of the Potomac, followed Lee from
                    before Washington to Richmond and Petersburg, and held him in siege to within a
                    few days of final surrender, Sherman, commanding the bulk of the Union forces in
                    the Mississippi valley, swept in a victorious march through the heart of the
                    confederacy to Savannah on the coast, and thence northward to North Carolina.
                    Lee evacuated Richmond April 2, and was overtaken by Grant and compelled to
                    surrender his entire army April 9, 1865. Sherman pushed Johnston to a surrender
                    April 26. This ended the war, the submission of scattering detachments following
                    soon after.</p>
                <p>Lincoln being at the time on a visit to the army, entered Richmond the day after
                    its surrender. Returning to Washington, he made his last public address on the
                    evening of April 11, devoted mainly to the question of reconstructing loyal
                    governments in the conquered States. On the evening of April 14 he attended
                    Ford’s theatre in Washington. While seated with his family and friends absorbed
                    in the play, John Wilkes Booth, an actor, who with others had prepared a plot to
                    assassinate the several heads of government, went into the little corridor
                    leading to the upper stage-box, and secured it against ingress by a wooden bar.
                    Then stealthily entering the box, he discharged a pistol at the head of the
                    president from behind, the ball penetrating the brain. Brandishing a huge knife,
                    with which he wounded Colonel Rathbone who attempted to hold him, the assassin
                    rushed through the stage-box to the front and leaped down upon the stage,
                    escaping behind the scenes and from the rear of the building, but was pursued,
                    and twelve days afterwards shot in a barn where he had concealed himself. The
                    wounded president was borne to a house across the street, where he breathed his
                    last at 7 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.m.,</hi> April 15, 1865.</p>
                <p>In 1842 he had married Mary Todd, also of Kentucky, who bore him four children.
                    Only one son, Robert T; Lincoln, survives, who is at this date (1882) secretary
                    of war of the United States.</p>
                <p>President Lincoln was of unusual stature, 6 feet 4 inches, and of spare but
                    muscular build; he had been in youth remarkably strong and skilful in the
                    athletic games of the frontier, where, however, his popularity and recognized
                    impartiality offener made him an umpire than a champion. He had regular and
                    prepossessing features, dark complexion, broad high forehead, prominent cheek
                    bones, grey deep-set eyes, and bushy black hair, turning to grey at the time of
                    his death. Abstemious in his habits, he possessed great physical endurance. He
                    was almost as tender-hearted as a woman. “I have not willingly planted a thorn
                    in any man’s bosom,” he was able to say. His patience was inexhaustible. He had
                    naturally a most cheerful and sunny temper, was highly social and sympathetic,
                    loved pleasant conversation, wit, anecdote, and laughter. Beneath this, however,
                    ran an undercurrent of sadness; he was occasionally subject to hours of deep
                    silence and introspection that approached a condition of trance. In manner he
                    wag simple, direct, void of the least affectation, and entirely free from
                    awkwardness, oddity, or eccentricity. His mental qualities were —a quick
                    analytic perception, strong logical powers, a tenacious memory, a liberal
                    estimate and tolerance of the opinions of others, ready intuition of human
                    nature; and perhaps his most valuable faculty was rare ability to divest himself
                    of all feeling or passion in weighing motives of persons or problems of state.
                    His speech and diction were plain, terse, forcible. Relating anecdotes with
                    appreciative humour and fascinating dramatic skill, he used them freely and
                    effectively in conversation and argument. He loved manliness, truth, and
                    justice. He despised all trickery and selfish greed. In arguments at the bar he
                    was so fair to his opponent that he frequently appeared to concede away his
                    client’s case. He was ever ready to take blame on himself and bestow praise on
                    others. “I claim not to have controlled events,” he said, “but confess plainly
                    that events have controlled me.” The Declaration of Independence was his
                    political chart and inspiration. He acknowledged a universal equality of human
                    rights. ‘ ‘ Certainly the negro is not our equal in colour,” he said, “perhaps
                    not in many other respects; still, in the right to put into his mouth the bread
                    that his own hands have earned, he is the equal of every other man white or
                    black.” He had unchanging faith in self-government. “The people,” he said, “are
                    the rightful masters of both congresses and courts, not to overthrow the
                    constitution, but to overthrow the men who pervert the constitution.” Yielding
                    and accommodating in non-essentials, he was inflexibly firm in a principle or
                    position deliberately taken. “Let us have faith that right makes might,” he
                    said, “and in that faith let us to the end dare to do our duty as we understand
                    it.” The emancipation proclamation once issued, he reiterated his purpose never
                    to retract or modify it. ‘ ‘ There have been men base enough,” he said, “to
                    propose to me to return to slavery our black warriors of Port Hudson and
                    Olustee, and thus win the respect of the masters they fought. Should I do so, I
                    should deserve to be damned in time and eternity. Come what will, I will keep my
                    faith with friend and foe.” Benevolence and forgiveness were the very basis of
                    his character; his world-wide humanity is aptly embodied in a phrase of his
                    second inaugural: “With malice toward none, with charity for all.” His nature
                    was deeply religious, but he belonged to no denomination; he had faith in the
                    eternal justice and boundless mercy of Providence, and made the golden rule of
                    Christ his practical creed. History <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> must accord
                    him a rare sagacity in guiding a great people through the perils of a mighty
                    revolution, an admirable singleness of aim, a skilful discernment and courageous

                    adherence to law and conscientious moderation in the use of power, a shining
                    personal example of honesty and purity, and finally the possession of that
                    subtle and indefinable magnetism by which he subordinated and directed
                    dangerously disturbed and perverted moral and political forces to the
                    restoration of peace and constitutional authority to his country, and the gift
                    of liberty to four millions of human beings. Architect of his own fortunes,
                    rising with every opportunity, mastering every emergency, fulfilling every duty,
                    he not only proved himself pre-eminently the man for the hour, but the signal
                    benefactor of posterity. As statesman, ruler, and liberator civilization will
                    hold his name in perpetual honour. (J. G. N.)</p>
