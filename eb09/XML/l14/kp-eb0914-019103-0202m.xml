                    powerful blows it had received since Pascal, and undoubtedly contributed largely
                    to secure the edict of suppression in 1764. In the friends of the Jesuits La
                    Chalotais had thus prepared for himself bitter enemies, and he was to feel their
                    power in the events of the quarrel between the court and the parliaments. The
                    breach between the estates of Brittany and the king, in which La Chalotais was
                    more immediately concerned, originated in an order passed by Government that the
                    voices of two of the three estates should bind the other, that is, that the
                    clergy and citizens should control the landed proprietors. To this order,
                    designed to secure the registration of certain fiscal edicts in spite of the
                    proprietors, who formed a majority in the estates, and upon whom the taxes would
                    fall most heavily, the opposition was marked by all the obstinacy of the Breton
                    character. La Chalotais endeavoured to carry through a compromise, but at the
                    same time animadverted somewhat acrimoniously upon the coercive efforts of the
                    Due d’Aiguillon, governor of Brittany, who already, as a supporter of the
                    Jesuits, regarded the procureur with animosity. When the estates, therefore,
                    absolutely refused t ) register the edicts, the court chose to regard La
                    Chalotais as the moving spirit in the opposition; and in November 1765 he was
                    arrested on a charge of. having written certain anonymous and seditious letters
                    to the king. No attention was paid to his protestations of innocence; and, when
                    the parliament of Rennes tried to force matters to a crisis by resigning in a
                    body, Louis merely appointed commissioners to sit as a new parliament and to try
                    La Chalotais, with his son and some other magistrates who had been arrested at
                    the same time. But the question had spread beyond Brittany; other provincial
                    parliaments, and even the parliament of Paris, took it up; and the strife began
                    to assume the ominous significance of one between the people and the crown. No
                    lower tribunal ventured to pass sentence upon La Chalotais, and in 1769 the
                    king, calling the case before himself in council, attempted to settle it in his
                    own autocratic way: silence was imposed as to the future, oblivion as to the
                    past; the innocence of the accused was acknowledged, but they were exiled from
                    their province. Such a decision was no settlement. The parliament, now restored,
                    accused the Due d’Aiguillon of having suborned witnesses against La Chalotais,
                    and, when he published memoirs retorting the charge, caused them to be burned by
                    the hand of the common hangman. Maupeou, minister of the king, after vainly
                    endeavouring to enforce the royal edict of silence, summoned the case before the
                    parliament of Paris in 1770. That body, however, gave such unequivocal signs of
                    favour to La Chalotais, that the king interfered and quashed the whole
                    proceedings by a “bed of justice.” The entire matter thus lay over so far as it
                    affected the procureur, till the death of the king in 1774 allowed him to return
                    to his official duties. La Chalotais died at Rennes, July 12, 1785.</p>

                    (three parts, 1766-67), written in prison, La Chalotais was the author of an
                    Essai d'Education Nationals (1763), a work extravagantly praised by Voltaire. It
                    was written in view of the disorganization in matters educational that would
                    follow the expected expulsion of the Jesuits from France.</p>
