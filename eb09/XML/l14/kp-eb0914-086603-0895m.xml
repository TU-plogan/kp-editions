                    he was reluctantly compelled to return home to work in the fields. By improving
                    every opportunity which his laborious life now permitted, he was still enabled
                    to pursue, to some extent, his favourite studies. This state of matters
                    continued for some time; but his intense thirst for knowledge, and the
                    uncalled-for jealousy of his friends, led him in 1577 to steal away from home,
                    to try his fortune in the world. Accordingly, at the age of fifteen, he went to
                    Wiborg, a town about 12 miles distant from his native village. There he spent
                    eleven years, dividing his time between attending the lectures of the professors
                    in the college of that town, and working in the fields. By this means he was
                    able not only to earn a sufficient livelihood, but also to defray the expenses
                    of his education; and his close application to study soon enabled him to acquire
                    considerable knowledge of literature and of the sciences. In 1588, at the age of
                    twenty-six, he removed to Copenhagen, where his great abilities speedily secured
                    for him the esteem and admiration of the professors in the university of that
                    town. By this means he was brought under the notice of the eminent astronomer
                    Tycho Brahe, who received him very kindly, and ultimately appointed him his
                    assistant He remained with Tycho Brahe for eight years in the island of Hoene,
                    and during that time rendered him such valuable services in his astronomical
                    observations and calculations, that, when Tycho Brahe settled in Germany, he
                    invited Longomontanus to accompany him. This offer he accepted; but having
                    shortly afterwards expressed to Tycho Brahe his desire to return to his native
                    country, the latter at once furnished him, not only with excellent testimonials,
                    but also with money for his journey. On his return to Denmark he made a long
                    detour in order to visit the places whence Copernicus <pb break="no"

                    observations. On his arrival at Copenhagen, he found a patron in the person of
                    Christian Friis, chancellor of Denmark, who gave him employment in his
                    household. He continued in this situation till 1603, when he received the
                    appointment of rector of the college of Wiborg. Two years later (1605) he was
                    elected to the chair of mathematics in the university of Copenhagen. This
                    appointment he held till his death, on the 8th of October 1647. Longomontanus,
                    although one of the best astronomers of his age, inherited some of its worst
                    prejudices. A firm believer in astrology, he held, among other things, that
                    comets were messengers of evil. He also imagined that he had squared the circle.
                    He found that the circle whose diameter is 43 has for its circumference the
                    square root of 18252,—which gives 344185 for the value of τr. Pell and others
                    endeavoured to prove that he was mistaken, but they failed to convince him of
                    his error. He refers to his imagined discovery in almost all his published
                    works, and defends his position with great zeal.</p>
