                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0494-0475"/> along with the Tchetchenians (about 165,000) the
                    East Caucasus group, and spreading southward over the borders of Daghestan, the
                    country which they have occupied from time immemorial, into the Transcaucasian
                    circles Kuba, Shemakha, Nukha, and Sakataly. They are mentioned as Λτ)χαι by
                    Strabo and Plutarch along with the Γi}λαι (perhaps the modern Galgai, a
                    Tchetchenian tribe), and their name occurs with great frequency in the old
                    chronicles of the Georgians, whose territory was exposed to their raids for
                    centuries, until through the fall of Shamyl they were brought under subjection
                    to Russia. Moses of Chorene mentions a battle in the reign of the Armenian King
                    Baba (370-377 A.D.), in which Shagir, king of the Lekiaus, was slain. Among the
                    Lesghians the chief place, both on account of numbers and importance, is due to
                    the Avars (155,194) and the closely related Andians (35,511), to whom may be
                    attached the Dido (9074) and a number of small tribes, confined to a few
                    villages or even to one, and speaking different though intimately connected
                    languages. The Avars, extending from the Sulak and the Kumyk steppe right
                    through Daghestan to the Alasan in the Sakataly circle, were once the dominant
                    people as their language is still the dominant language of all this district.
                    Their neighbours the Kasimukhians (35,139), who call themselves Lakians, have a
                    language of their own, and are well known as traders not only through all
                    Transcaucasia but also in European Russia; beside them a small fragment of
                    another race occupies the village Artchi (592 inhabitants) in a separate
                    mountain valley. Towards the Caspian Sea the Lakians are bordered by the
                    Darginians (88,045) and the Tabassaranians (16,350), who in the matter of
                    dialect are strongly marked off from each other. To the north and south of the
                    basin of the Samur (which consequently bears the native name Kulan-uaz or
                    “middle river”) lives another of the leading tribes of Daghestan, the Kurinians
                    or Lesghians <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> who by themselves alone
                    occupy the circles of Kuri and Samur, as well as the greatest part of Kuba, and
                    parts of Shemakha, Nukha, &amp;c. Their language (investigated like other
                    Caucasian tongues by Baron Uslar) is there spoken by 130,873 individuals; and
                    closely related to it apparently are the languages of the neighbouring Aguliaus
                    (5357), Rutulians (11,803), Zakhurians (4561). According to the specimens
                    collected by Von Seidlitz in 1880 during a visit to their country, which lies
                    round the snowy peak of the Shakh Dagh in the Kuba circle, the Djekians,
                    Haputlians, and Krysians speak what seem to be dialects of Kurinian; but he
                    cannot connect with any other tongue the language spoken by the peculiar-looking
                    inhabitants of the neighbouring village of Khimlugh (2196). The Udinians (9668)
                    are another Lesghian tribe, which, though at present it only occupies a few
                    villages in the Nukha circle, was formerly widely distributed over the plain of
                    the Kura, and may possibly be the wretched remnant of the Albanians, mentioned
                    by Strabo and others as a people of similar importance with the Grusinians and
                    Armenians.</p>
                <p>All these Lesghians are more or less tall, good-looking and powerful, sometimes
                    fair sometimes dark, bold, enduring, and intelligent—in one word, excellent
                    material for the work of civilization as soon as their country is opened up by
                    roads and the railway just projected from Vladikavkas by Petrovsk to Baku.
                    Smith-work and cutlery are skilfully wrought among the Lesghians in general; the
                    women weave excellent shawls (which vary in style according to locality); and
                    the felt cloaks of Andi are known throughout the Caucasus.</p>
