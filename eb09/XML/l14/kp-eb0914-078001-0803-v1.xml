                <p><label type="entry">LOGIC</label></p>
                <p>1. LOGIC, in the most general acceptation of the term, may be regarded as the
                    systematic study of thought. So wide a definition is certainly sufficient to
                    comprehend all that may have been at various times included within the scope of
                    logical doctrine, but in other respects it is of small value. It does not serve
                    to mark off logic from philosophy as a whole, which is unquestionably the
                    systematic exposition of thought, nor from psychology, which includes within its
                    wider range what may well be described as the study of thought. Without some
                    more accurate discrimination of the province and method of logic, neither the
                    extent of matter to be included within the study nor the peculiarity of the
                    method by which such matter is treated can be determined.</p>
                <p>Preliminary queries of a similar kind are naturally encountered in the case of
                    all other branches of human knowledge, and are generally answered by two
                    methods. We may refer either to the distinct characteristics of the matter to be
                    treated, or to the essential features of the method of treatment. We may
                    determine the province of a science either by external division, by
                    classification of objects according to their prevailing resemblances and
                    differences, or by internal definition, by exposition of the fundamental
                    characters of the method employed. By neither process, unfortunately, can an
                    unambiguous answêr be supplied, at least without much art, in the case of
                    logic.</p>
                <p>2. The reasons for the manifold difficulties encountered in the attempt to
                    determine accurately the province of logic, whether by reference to a division
                    of the sciences or by precise definition of the essential features of logical
                    analysis, are not far to seek. The systematic classification of the sciences
                    involves not only consideration of the contents of the sciences as empirically
                    presented, but also certain leading principles or fundamental views, which are
                    in essence of a philosophical character. According to the general conception of
                    knowledge which in various kinds is manifested in the special sciences, there
                    will be radically divergent methods of classification, and the province assigned
                    to each member of the ensemble will, for the most part, have its limits
                    determined according to the character of the general view adopted. Moreover, if
                    any of the more prominent specimens of classification of the sciences be
                    critically inspected, they will be found to presuppose a certain body of
                    principles, of scope wider than any of the special disciplines, and to which no
                    place in the ensemble can be assigned. In short, a systematic distribution of
                    human knowledge into its distinctly marked varieties rests upon and presupposes
                    a general philosophy, the character of which affects the place and function of
                    each part of the distribution. Logic, as may readily be imagined, has therefore
                    experienced a variety of treatment at the hands of systematizers of scientific
                    knowledge. It has appeared as one of the abstract sciences, in opposition to
                    those disciplines in which the character of the concrete material is the
                    essential fact; as a subordinate branch of a particular concrete science, the
                    investigation of mental phenomena; as a nondescript receptacle for the
                    formulation in generalized fashion of the method and logical precepts
                    exemplified in the special sciences. By such processes no more has been effected
                    than to bring into light, more or less clearly, some of the characteristics of
                    the supposed science, without in any way supplying an exhaustive and
                    comprehensive survey of its boundaries and relations to other branches of
                    knowledge. Thus, when logic is marked off from . the concrete sciences and
                    associated with mathematics in the most general sense, as the treatment of
                    formal relations,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As,

                    what one would willingly allow to be a commonplace respecting all logical
                    analysis, namely, that its principles are coextensive with human knowledge, and
                    that all objects as matters of conscious experience have an aspect in which they
                    are susceptible of logical treatment. But no more is effected. It is still left
                    to a wider consideration to determine what the specific aspect of things may be
                    which shall be called the <hi rend="italic">formal</hi> and be recognized as the
                    peculiarly logical element in them. There may be selected for this purpose
                    either the general relations of coincidence and succession in space and time, or
                    the fundamental properties of identity and difference, or the existences of
                    classes, but in any case such selection depends upon and refers to a theory of
                    the nature of knowledge and of the constitution of things as known. In truth,
                    the notions of <hi rend="italic">form</hi> and <hi rend="italic">formal

                    their aid one can at once solve a complicated problem of philosophic
                    arrangement. To lay stress upon <hi rend="italic">form</hi> as the special

                    principles w hich are to be employed in evolving a science of form, and
                    therefore leaves the logical problem untouched.</p>
                <p>Still less satisfactory are the results when logic is regarded as in some way a

                    Neither the grounds on which such a classification rests, nor the conclusions
                    deduced from it, seem beyond criticism. The simple facts that certain mental
                    processes are analysed in logic, and that psychology is generally the treatment
                    of all mental processes, by no means necessitate the view that logic is
                    therefore the outgrowth from and a subordinate part of psychology. For it is
                    clear, on the one hand, that logic has a scope wider than psychology, since in
                    any sense of the term it has to deal with all the processes (or with some aspect
                    of all the processes) by which on any subject knowledge is formed out of
                    disjointed or disconnected experiences. And, on the other hand, since the
                    subordination of one science to another, as species to genus, is fallacious,
                    unless the two agree in fundamental characteristics, the position so assigned to
                    logic would imply that in aim and method it shall be essentially one with
                    psychology, a position equivalent to the negation of logic as a separate and
                    independent discipline. It is not surprising therefore to find that so soon as
                    logic has been distinguished as arising from psychology, and so dependent on it,
                    the peculiarity of its position and functions compels the recognition of its
                    more general scope and the reduction of its connexion with psychology to an
                    amount small enough to be compatible with absolute independence. Strong <pb

                    that logic is entirely to be separated from psychology, as differing from it in
                    aim, method, and principle, that logical analysis is generically distinct from
                    psychological, and that the two disciplines, while connected as parts of the
                    general body of philosophical reflexion, hold to one another a relation the

                <p>As to the endeavour to collect from consideration of the sciences in detail a
                    body of precepts, the rules of scientific method, and to assign the systematic
                    arrangement of such rules to one special discipline, called logic, it seems to
                    stand on the same footing and to be open to the same criticism as the allied
                    attempt to treat general philosophy as the receptacle for the most abstract
                    propositions reached in scientific knowledge. There is a peculiar assumption
                    underlying the supposed possibility of distinguishing between scientific method
                    and its concrete exemplifications in the special sciences, and only on the
                    ground of this assumption could there be rested the independence of logic as the
                    systematic treatment of method. It is taken for granted, without examination,
                    that the characteristic features of correct and well-founded thinking are
                    palpable and general, and that we thus possess a criterion for marking off what
                    is common to all scientific procedure from that which is special and peculiar to
                    the individual sciences. An elaborate philosophic doctrine lies at the root of
                    this assumption, and the position assigned to logic may easily be seen to
                    depend, not on what is apparent in the argument, namely, comparison of the
                    sciences with one another, but on what lies implicit in the background, the
                    philosophic conception of the nature of scientific knowledge in general. Without
                    reference to the ultimate philosophic view, no definite content could be
                    assigned to logic, and it would remain impossible to distinguish logic from the
                    sciences in detail·<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See,

                <p>3. Thus the various attempts to define the province and functions of logic from
                    general classification of the sciences, to define, in short, by the method of
                    division, yield no satisfactory answer, and refer ultimately to the philosophic
                    view on which classification and division must be based. A similar result
                    becomes apparent when we consider the various descriptions of logic that have
                    been presented as following from more precise and accurate determination of the
                    essential features of logical analysis and method.</p>
                <p>“The philosophical deduction or construction of the notion of logic presupposes a

                    treatment, or of the problems and objects of philosophy in general, from among
                    which in due order may be distinguished the particular problem of logic.”<note

                    the ordinary exposition of logic, progress is effected towards an accurate
                    determination of the province of the science, not only refer to some such
                    ultimate philosophic view, but lead to the most diverse results, according to
                    the peculiarity of the views on which they are based. Of these elementary
                    distinctions the following are at once the more usual and the more important
                    :—the distinction between the province of logic and the province of the special
                    sciences, as that between general and special; the distinction between natural
                    growth of knowledge, with its natural laws, and the normal procedure whereby
                    grounded knowledge is obtained, with its normal or regulative principles; the
                    distinction between knowledge as a whole and its several parts, immediate and
                    mediate, with restriction of logic to the treatment of all or portion of mediate
                    knowledge; the distinction between the constituents of knowledge as on the one
                    hand given from without (in experience), and on the other hand due to the
                    elaborative action of intellect itself. To one or other of these may be traced
                    the common definitions of logic, and a brief consideration of their contents
                    will be sufficient to show that they severally rest upon more or less developed
                    general philosophic doctrines, and that their significance for accurate
                    determination of the field of logic depends not so much on what is explicitly
                    stated in them as on what is implied in the general doctrines from which they
                    have taken their rise.</p>
                <p>The distinction of logic from the sciences, as dealing in the abstract with that
                    which is concretely exemplified in each of them, is certainly a first step in
                    the process of determination about which there can be little or no doubt. But if
                    the distinction remain vague, it is not sufficient to differentiate logic from
                    many other disciplines, philosophical or philological, and if it be made more
                    precise, the new characteristics will be found to involve some special view as
                    to what constitutes the common feature in the sciences, and to vary with the
                    possible varieties of view. As a rule, too, the added characteristics do not
                    serve by themselves to mark off logical treatment as an independent kind of
                    investigation. They are most frequently obtained by a general survey of
                    scientific procedure. Thus it may be said that in all sciences there are implied
                    clearly defined notions, general statements or judgments, and methodical proofs;
                    logic therefore, as the theory of the general element in science, will appear as
                    the treatment of notions, judgments, and proofs generally, or in the abstract.
                    If so, then, unless some implied principle further determine the course of
                    procedure, logic would be regarded as a merely descriptive account of the parts
                    making up scientific knowledge, and it would be not only impossible to assign to
                    it an independent position, but hard to discriminate it from psychology, which
                    likewise deals with the parts of knowledge. If it be understood, however, or
                    explicitly stated, that in all scientific knowledge there is community of
                    method, resting on common principles or laws of knowledge as such, then clearly
                    not only the province of logic, as now made identical with the treatment of the
                    essence of knowledge, but the special nature of the theorems making up the body
                    of logic, must depend upon the general conception of knowledge with which the
                    thinker starts. In the view of logic taken, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by
                    Mill, the fundamental idea is that of <hi rend="italic">evidence,</hi> under
                    which must be included all the grounds for any judgment not resting on immediate
                    perception. So far as verbal statement is concerned, the adoption of this as the
                    root idea would not distinguish in any special way the treatment of logical
                    problems resting on it, but in fact each problem is dealt with in accordance
                    with the particular theory of what, from the nature of human knowledge,
                    constitutes evidence. Logic thus involves, or in truth becomes, a theory of
                    knowledge, and in the end, for general spirit and details of doctrine, refers to
                    an ultimate philosophic view. There seems no escape from this conclusion. Start
                    as we may, with popular, current distinctions, no sooner do logical problems
                    present themselves than it becomes apparent that, for adequate treatment of
                    them, reference to the principles of ultimate philosophy is requisite, and
                    logic, as the systematic handling of such problems, ceases to be an independent
                    discipline, and becomes a subordinate special branch of general philosophy.</p>

                    these elements must be ordered, if our subjective consciousness is to represent
                    accurately and faithfully the relations of things. The laws of knowledge, there
                    being understood by knowledge the whole sum of mental determinations in and
                    through which the world of external and internal experience is realized for us,
                    are of two distinct kinds, natural and normal. For the treatment of the natural
                    laws the most appropriate title is psychology; for that of the normal or
                    regulative laws the title logic is peculiarly appropriate. By the one science
                    knowledge is regarded in its relation to the subjective consciousness, as so
                    much of what enters into and constitutes the world of inner experience; by the
                    other knowledge is regarded in its relation to truth, to the objective system,
                    as the means whereby, for theoretical or practical purposes, an orderly and
                    verifiable conception of this system is realized. A definite place seems thus
                    secured for logic, but, if one may judge merely from the various attempts to
                    expound the body of logical doctrines from this point of view, the
                    characteristic feature is not yet sufficient to determine the boundaries of the
                    science or the specific nature of its problems. In fact, the feature selected
                    might be accepted as the distinguishing mark of logical science by writers who
                    would include under that common title the most diverse matters, and who would
                    differ fundamentally in respect to the treatment of isolated problems. The
                    metaphysical logic of Hegel, the empirical logic of Mill, the formal logic of
                    Kant, might all claim to be developments of this one view of the essence of
                    logic. So wide a divergence is clear evidence that the criterion selected,
                    though possibly accurate, is not sufficiently specific, and that the
                    interpretation of it, which in truth determines for each the nature and
                    boundaries of the science, depends upon the view taken respecting knowledge as a
                    whole in its relation to the objective order of experience, respecting the
                    import of the so-called normal laws, and respecting the subjective elements
                    supposed to constitute knowledge.</p>
                <p>On all sides this particular definition of logic is beset with difficulties,
                    which it cannot afford to dismiss by means of the simple demand that knowledge
                    shall be accepted as somehow given. For, apart altogether from the danger that
                    under so wide a term as knowledge many differences may be accommodated, it then
                    becomes impossible to do more than treat in a quasi-empirical fashion mental
                    facts, the nature and peculiarities of which are to be learned from some
                    external source. In the later, more detailed examination of the view of logic
                    here briefly described, it will be pointed out that the usual formula by which
                    the several logical notions are introduced, viz., that their nature as mental
                    facts is dealt with in psychology, from which logic borrows, is in fact much
                    more than a formula. The logical peculiarities will be found to rest mainly upon
                    the psychological characteristics as borrowed, while it is evident that no
                    substantive, independent existence can be vindicated for a doctrine, the
                    succession of whose parts, and their essential nature, are given externally.</p>
                <p>(2) Some of the perplexities that arise when logic is treated as the theory of
                    the normal laws of knowledge may be obviated by the current distinction between
                    immediate and mediate knowledge. The normal laws of knowledge might be said to
                    apply solely to the process of mediate cognition, and their final aim would be
                    defined as harmony between mediate knowledge and immediate experience. But it is
                    difficult to distinguish with perfect accuracy between the two kinds of
                    knowledge in question; it is impossible that the treatment of the logical
                    problem should not depend entirely on the view taken as to the nature of that
                    which differentiates mediate from immediate knowledge. Whether we express this
                    as thought or as belief, its nature then becomes the all-important factor in
                    determining the course of logical treatment, and further progress will manifest
                    divergencies according as stress is laid on the subjective characteristics of
                    thought, the laws to which, from its essential nature, all its products must
                    conform, or on the limitations imposed by principles which have reference to the
                    most general relations of the things thought about. In the one case a formal
                    logic, of the type commonly known as the Kantian, would be developed, in the
                    other either an empirical logic, like that of Mill, wherein the nature of
                    notions, propositions, and reasonings is considered from the point of view of
                    the empirical conception of experience, or a transcendental logic, like that
                    involved in the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason,</hi> or a
                    metaphysical logic, like that of Hegel, or a mixed doctrine, like that of
                    Trendelenburg, Lotze, and Ueberweg. In short, the general philosophic view of
                    thought is that upon which the character of logic as a science rests.</p>
                <p>(3) There has above appeared, incidentally, one of the most current methods of
                    solving the logical problem, by procedure from the distinction between that
                    which is given to the mind in knowledge, and that which is supplied by the mind
                    itself. No distinction seems more simple; none is in reality more complex. The
                    opposition on which, in its popular acceptation, it rests is that between the
                    individual concrete thinking subject and the world of objective facts, existing,
                    as it were, to be cognized. The full significance of such an opposition, the
                    forms in which it presents itself in conscious experience, the qualifications
                    which must be introduced into the statement of it that it may have even a
                    semblance of reality,—these are problems not solved by a simple reference to the
                    distinction as existing. It may well be held that knowledge is, for the
                    individual, the mode (or one of the modes) in which his relation to the universe
                    of fact is subjectively seized, but it is not therefore rendered possible to
                    effect an accurate and mechanical separation of knowledge into its matter and
                    form. Even on lower grounds it may be held that by the employment of this
                    criterion little or no light is thrown upon the logical question. For no
                    determination is supplied by it of the universal characteristic of form as
                    opposed to matter in knowledge, and a comparison of various expositions will
                    show the most startling diversity of view respecting the nature and boundaries
                    of the formal element in knowledge. It is of course true that in one sense any
                    scientific treatment of knowledge is formal. Our analysis extends only to the
                    general or abstract aspect of cognition, not to its actual details. But we are
                    not, on that account, dealing with the form of knowledge. So soon as it is
                    attempted to define more accurately what shall be understood by form then it is
                    found that various views of logic arise, corresponding to the variety of
                    principles supposed to be applied in the treatment of form. Thus the stricter
                    followers of the Kantian logical idea, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Mansel and
                    Spalding, recognize, as sole principles which can be said to be involved
                    universally in thé action of thought, the laws of identity, non-contradiction,
                    and excluded middle, and in their hands logic becomes merely the systematic
                    statement of these laws, and the exposition of the conditions which they impose
                    upon notions, judgments, and reasonings. Analytical consistency, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> absence of contradiction, is on this view the one
                    aspect of knowledge which is susceptible of logical treatment. On the other
                    hand, the idea of a contribution furnished by the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0806-0783"/> mind itself to knowledge may lead to a more
                    concrete and yet not less exact system of the forms of knowledge, if there be
                    taken into account the real character of the operation by which such
                    contribution is made. Thus in the logic of Ulrici, from the view of thought as
                    essentially the distinguishing faculty, by which definiteness is given to the
                    elements entering into knowledge, there follows not simply an iteration of the
                    principle that thought must not contradict itself, but a systematic evolution of
                    the fundamental relations involved in the action of thought, in which the more
                    specifically logical products, the notion, judgment, and reasoning, have a
                    determinate place assigned to them.</p>
                <p>Not only, then, may quite distinct provinces be assigned to logic by thinkers who
                    start with the same idea of thought as contributing to knowledge, but, as may
                    well be imagined, the treatment of special logical problems presents a most
                    bewildering variety. The nature of judgment, the principle of reasoning, the
                    characteristics of thought which is in accordance with logical rule, will be
                    viewed differently according to the special interpretation put upon the
                    functions of the subjective factor in knowledge. Here again we find that the
                    really influential fact in the determination of the province and method of
                    logical science is a general philosophic conception of knowledge or
                        thought.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                            Rosenkranz, <hi rend="italic">Die Modificαtionen</hi><hi rend="italic"

                            similar conclusion is illustrated by an elaborate classification of
                            possible modifications of the view of logic. Compare also Braniss, <hi

                <p>4. There remains yet one method by which a clear and sufficient definition of the
                    province and function of logic may be attainable. It may be that the separation
                    of logic from other philosophic disciplines has come about historically, and
                    that the assignment to logic of a special body of problems and a special kind of
                    treatment is due to the accidents of its development. We might therefore hope to
                    gain from a comparative survey of the field of logic, as that has been
                    historically marked out, some definite view not only respecting the specific
                    problems of logical theory, but also regarding the grounds for the isolated
                    treatment of them. That in the history of logic there should be found a certain
                    continuity of doctrine and development may, however, be compatible with entire
                    absence of a common body of received logical matter, and the result of an
                    historical research may be little more than a statement of distinct conceptions
                    regarding the nature and province of the science, leading to the inclusion of
                    very distinct materials within its scope. It requires but a superficial
                    investigation of that which at various intervals has presented itself as logical
                    theory to arrive at the conclusion that the differences in general spirit and in
                    the mass of details far outbalance any agreement as to a few detaehed doctrines
                    and technical symbols. If the survey were limited even to the period preceding
                    the attempts at radical reformation of philosophy in general, and of logic as
                    included therein, to the period in which the Aristotelian doctrines, as they may
                    be called, formed the common basis of logical treatment, we should be able to
                    detect differences of such a kind as to indicate radically distinct fundamental
                    views. The scholastic logic, which, even by itself, cannot be regarded as one
                    theory with unimportant modifications, is most falsely described as
                    Aristotelian. The technical terminology, the general idea and plan, and some of
                    the formal details are certainly due to the Aristotelian analysis of reasoned
                    knowledge, but in spirit, in ruling principles, and in the mass of details the
                    method of the scholastic logic is alien to that of Aristotle. It will be shown
                    later that the Aristotelian analysis is saturated with the notions and aims of
                    the Aristotelian metaphysics and general theory of knowledge, and that on this
                    account alone, apart from the introduction of many foreign ingredients, from
                    Stoic, Arab, and Byzantine sources, into the scholastic system, an important
                    difference must subsist between the original doctrine and that which presents
                    itself as but its historical development. Even more radical is the divergence of
                    modern logic from the Aristotelian ideal and method. The thinker who claimed for
                    logic a special pre-eminence among sciences because “since Aristotle it has not
                    had to retrace a single step, and to the present day has not been able to make
                    one step in advance,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Kant, <hi rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> Vorrede, p. 13.</p></note> has
                    himself, in his general modification of all philosophy, placed logic on so new a
                    basis that the only point of connexion retained by it in his system with the
                    Aristotelian may be not unfairly described as the community of subject. Both
                    deal in some way with the principles and methods of human thinking, but as their
                    general views of the constitution of thought are diverse, little agreement is to
                    be found in the special treatment of its logical aspect. So when a later writer
                    prefaces his examination of logical principles with the declaration that “logic
                    is common ground on which the partisans of Hartley and of Reid, of Locke and of
                    Kant, may meet and join hands,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not unprepared for the result that, with a few unimportant exceptions, his views
                    of logical principle coincide with those of no recognized predecessor in the
                    same field, diverge widely from either the currently received or the genuine
                    Aristotelian doctrines, and lead to a totally new distribution, in mass and
                    detail, of the body of logical theorems and discussions. Such divergence is,
                    indeed, most intelligible. If one reflects on the significance which would be
                    attached in any one of these logical systems, of Aristotle, of Kant, of Mill, to
                    the <hi rend="italic">universal</hi> or universalizing element of thought, and
                    on the fact that such universal must manifest itself as the characteristic
                    feature in all the important products of thinking, the notion, the judgment, the
                    syllogism, the conclusion is inevitable that difference of view in respect to
                    the essence must make itself felt in difference of treatment of details. The
                    ultimate aim of proof, and the general nature of the methods of proof, must
                    appear differently according as the accepted ground is the Aristotelian
                    conception of nature and thought, the Kantian theory of cognition, or subjective
                    empiricism.</p>
                <p>If, adopting a simpler method, one were to inspect a fair proportion of the more
                    extensive recent works on logic, the conclusion drawn would be probably the
                    same,—that, while the matters treated show a slight similarity, no more than
                    would naturally result from the fact that thought is the subject analysed, the
                    diversity in mode of treatment is so great that it would be impossible to select
                    by comparison and criticism a certain body of theorems and methods, and assign
                    to them the title of logic. That such works as those of Trendelenburg, Ueberweg,
                    Ulrici, Lotze, Sigwart, Wundt, Bergmann, Schuppe, De Morgan, Boole, Jevons, and
                    these are but a selection from the most recent, treat of notions, judgments, and
                    methods of reasoning, gives to them indeed a certain common character; but what
                    other feature do they possess in common? In tone, in method, in aim, in
                    fundamental principles, in extent of field, they diverge so widely as to appear,
                    not so many different expositions of the same science, but so many different
                    sciences. In short, looking to the chaotic state of logical text-books at the
                    present time, one would be inclined to say that there does not exist anywhere a
                    recognized, currently received body of speculations to which the title logic can
                    be unambiguously assigned, and that we must therefore resign the hope of
                    attaining by any empirical consideration of the received doctrine a precise
                    determination of the nature and limits of logical theory.</p>

                <p>5. In order to make clear the reasons for this astonishing diversity of opinion
                    regarding the province and method of logic, and so make some advance towards a
                    solution of what may well be called the logical problem, it seems necessary to
                    consider some of the leading conceptions of logic, with such reference to
                    details as will suffice to show how difference of fundamental view determines
                    the treatment of special logical problems. In this consideration the order must
                    be historical rather than systematic. Not, indeed, that it is needful, nor is it
                    proposed, to present an historical account of philosophy at large, or even of
                    logic in particular; our purpose is merely to disentangle and bring clearly
                    forward the nature of the principles respecting logical theory which have served
                    as basis for the most characteristic logical systems. Such an inquiry will not
                    only assist in explaining the divergencies of logical systems, but throw light
                    upon the essence of logic itself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In this historico-critical survey, the first section must naturally be devoted to
                    a consideration of the Aristotelian logic. The records of Oriental attempts at

                <p>6. In a remarkable passage at the close of the tract called by us the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sophistical Refutations,</hi> Aristotle claims for himself
                    distinct originality in the conception of subjecting to analysis the forms or
                    types of argument. “The system I have expounded had not been partially, though
                    imperfectly, elaborated by others; its very foundations had to be laid The
                    teachers of rhetoric in herited many principles that had long been ascertained;
                    dialectic had absolutely no traditional doctrines. Our researches were long,
                    tentative, and troublesome. If, then, starting from nothing, it bears a
                    comparison with others that have been developed by division of labour in
                    successive generations, candid criticism will be readier to commend it for the
                    degree of completeness to which it has attained than to find fault with it for
                    falling short of perfection.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in regard to the more extensive analysis of the forms of reasoning in general
                    which makes up the substance of the other books of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Organon.</hi> There had been, prior to Aristotle, much discussion of
                    problems that would under any view be included under the head of logic, but no
                    systematic attempt had been made to analyse knowledge as a whole in its formal
                    aspect, to throw under general heads or classes the types of reasoning, whether
                    dialectical or scientific, and to exhibit the general relations in which the
                    elements of all reasoning stand to one another. After Aristotle, it became
                    possible to refer all such discussions to a common head, and to view them as
                    component parts of one systematic doctrine. In a peculiar sense, then, Aristotle
                    may be described as the founder of logical science.</p>
                <p>The precise nature of the inquiries falling within the scope of the Aristotelian
                    logic may receive some preliminary explanation supplementary to that which can
                    only be given by a careful study of the chief theorems of the system, if there
                    be taken into account (a) the advances towards a theory of logical method
                    contained in the speculations of earlier Greek thinkers, (δ) the classification
                    of philosophic discipline which underlies the body of Aristotle’s writings, and
                    (c) the general conception of the matter of logical analysis which may be
                    deduced from any special or incidental treatment of the question in Aristotle.
                    Of these in order.</p>
                <p>7. (a) Logical discussions prior to Aristotle.</p>
                <p>The inquiries which find a place in the Aristotelian logic are all, in a large
                    sense, problems of the theory of knowledge. They arise, therefore, only in
                    connexion with critical reflexion on the nature, grounds, and method of
                    knowledge. The earliest forms of Greek speculation, turning rather upon
                    explanation of natural fact, being in essence attempts to reduce the
                    multiplicity of known fact to unity of principle, contain, as a consequence,
                    problems of a metaphysical character, which might involve problems of strictly
                    logical character, but were logical only in potentiality. Of all these
                    metaphysical questions the most important centre round the tundamental
                    opposition between unity of principle and multi-P⅛c u ° <hi rend="subscript">
                        1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> lac</hi> h between the one and the many, an
                    opposition which under varied forms presents itself at every stage in the
                    history of philosophic speculation. In the first period of Greek speculation,
                    the problem presented' itself jn its simplest, most direct aspect, and, after a
                    few rough attempts at a quasi-physical explanation of the genesis of many out of
                    one, there come forward, as reasoned, ultimate solutions, the Eleatic doctrine
                    that only unity has real being, the Heraclitic counter-doctrine that only in
                    change, in the many, is truth to be found, and the Pythagorean notion of number,
                    harmony, as containing <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">abstracto</hi>
                    the union of the opposites, one and many. No one of these philosophic treatments
                    can be said to contain specifically logical elements, but they raise questions
                    of a logical kind, and, especially in the records of the Eleatic views, one can
                    trace a close approximation to the critical reflexion which marks the transition
                    to a new order of ideas. Results which in these systems are stared with
                    metaphysical reference only, reappear with new aspect among the sophists and the
                    Socratic schools. The transition stage, indeed, partly aided by the atomic
                    separation of objective fact from subjective sense experience, is mainly the
                    effect of the sophistic and Socratic teaching. Socrates and the sophists have
                    this in common that both treat the fundamental problem of philosophy as it hàd
                    been handed down with special reference to the subjective experience of the
                    individual. In the teaching of the sophists generally is to be discerned the
                    opposition between subjective reflexion and objective fact; in that of
                    Protagoras and Gorgias in particular there appear as problems of the theory of
                    knowledge difficulties for the older metaphysic of Heraclitus and the Eleatics
                    respectively. The Heraclitic principle of change is the general foundation for
                    the doctrine that the momentary perception is the only fact of cognition, and
                    upon it may be based the conclusions that all truth is relative to the
                    individual state of the individual subject, and that judgment, as a mode of
                    expressing truth, is a contradiction in itself. Thus the extreme Heracliteans,
                    as Cratylus, rejected the proposition, or combination of words, as expressing a
                    unity and permanence not to be found in things, and reduced speech to the
                    symbolism of pointing with the finger. .Less developed but not less clear is the
                    connexion between the brief scèptical theses of Gorgias and the Eleatic doctrine
                    of unity. As knowledge was impossible on the Heraclitean view, since it implied
                    a synthesis not discoverable amidst incessant change, so for Gorgias knowledge
                    was impossible, since in the synthesis was involved an element of difference,
                    multiplicity, not reconcilable with the all-embracing unity of things. It is
                    evident from the treatment of such views in Plato and in Aristotle, how many of
                    the illustrations used in support of the general thesis depended for their
                    apparent strength on neglect of some of the elementary conditions of thought,
                    and how inevitably reflexion upon these difficulties led to the construction of
                    a theory of thought. The first outlines of such a theory are to be found in the
                    Socratic principle of the notion (or concept, as we may call it, for the notion
                    as viewed by Socrates is certainly the concrete class notion, the simple result
                    of generalization and abstraction), and to Socrates is assigned by Aristotle the
                    first statement of two important logical processes—induction, or the collection
                    of particulars from which by critical comparison a generalized result might be
                    drawn, and definition, or the explicit statement of the general elements
                    disclosed by critical comparison of instances.<note anchored="true"

                            27-29.</p></note> In the Socratic teaching, so far as records go, no
                    explicit reference was made to the problems in connexion with which those
                    processes are of greatest significance, but in the lesser Socratic schools on
                    the one hand, and in Plato on the other, we find the new principle either
                    brought to bear upon the old difficulties, or developed into a comprehensive
                    method.</p>
                <p>The Socratic concept contains in itself the union of one and many, but it is in
                    nature subjective; it is a mode of knowledge. If, then, it be regarded as only
                    subjective, the old difficulties reappear. How is it possible to reconcile, even
                    in thought, an opposition so fundamental as that between unity and plurality?
                    Must there not be a like irreconcilable opposition between the subjective
                    counterparts of these objective relations, between the individual notion, the
                    atom of knowledge, and the proposition or definition? How, indeed, can there be
                    a combination in thought of that which is in essence uncombinable? Whether we
                    take Aristippus, who draws mainly for theory of knowledge on the
                    Heraclitic-Protagorqan sources, or Antisthenes, who leans towards the Eleatic,
                    or the Megarics, who also, in accordance with the Eleatic thoughts, devoted
                    chief attention to the polemical aspect of the theory, we find a set of problems
                    appearing, the solution of which imperatively called for a theory of knowledge
                    as the combination of one and many. Perhaps the most interesting of these early
                    thinkers, so far as the history of logic is concerned, is Antisthenes, whose
                    extreme nominalism presents the most curious analogies to some recent logical
                        work.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On

                    irreducible elements denoted by the simplest elements of speech, names. The name
                    is the mark for the sense-impression by which each <hi rend="italic">πρώτον</hi>
                    is communicated to us, for they are only known by sense, and are strictly
                    individual. A composite thing is known through the combination of names of its
                    parts, and such a combination <hi rend="italic">(συμπλοκή)</hi> is a proposition
                    or definition <hi rend="italic">(λ6yos).</hi> Each thing has its specific λJγos

                    expression of this. There is therefore no distinction of subject and predicate
                    possible; even identical propositions, the only possible forms under this
                    theory, are mere repetitions of the complex name. Predication is either
                    impossible or reduces itself to naming in the predicate what is named in the
                    subject. It is the simple result of so consistent a nominalism that all truth is
                    arbitrary or relative; there is no possibility of contradiction, not even of
                    one’s self.</p>
                <p>The theory of Antisthenes, strange as it may at first sight appear, rested on
                    certain metaphysical difficulties, which lie at the root of all the perplexity
                    regarding the import of propositions, and it is not too much to say that these
                    difficulties were kept continually in mind by Plato and Aristotle in their
                    several attempts to explain the nature of knowledge. Both thinkers find
                    themselves confronted with the ultimate question, What is the ground of unity in
                    things known, and in what way does thought unite the detached attributes of
                    things into a subjective whole? What is the nature of the unity which binds
                    things, themselves in a sense units, into classes or wholes, and how comes it
                    that in the judgment subject and predicate are, in a sense, set at one?</p>
                <p>In Plato, for whom the solution was found in the participation in or imitation of
                    ideas by things, we find more distinctly conceived the series of logical
                    processes involved obscurely in the Socratic method. So far as positive
                    statements regarding the ideas can carry one, it may be said that in essence
                    these processes concern only the formation of or deduction from the concrete
                    universal concept or general notion. The ideas, in the Platonic system, at least
                    in reference to the thought which apprehends them, resemble most closely class
                    notions. A deeper significance often appears to attach to the relative processes
                    of <hi rend="italic">induction,</hi> whereby the resemblances of things, the
                    idea in them, is disclosed, <hi rend="italic">definition,</hi> whereby the
                    content of the idea is made explicit, and <hi rend="italic">division,</hi>
                    whereby the external connexion of ideas with one another, their system, is
                    deduced, but such significance attaches to the more purely metaphysical aspects
                    of the theory, and had no particular bearing on the Aristotelian treatment of
                    the same problems. Not much is given in Plato towards a theory of the
                    proposition, though sometimes an analysis of its elements is sketched; and the
                    method of division could yield only a few of the types of deductive reasoning.
                    But, over and above these more definite contributions towards the construction
                    of a theory of knowledge, there are general aspects of the Platonic work of not
                    secondary importance for the Aristotelian logic. In Plato the fundamental
                    differences of earlier philosophic views appear in a new phase, and are elevated
                    to a higher stage. Sophistic method is analysed, not as in forms actually
                    existing, but in its essential features, and the opposition between sophist and
                    philosopher is viewed as the opposition between opinion and knowledge.
                    Heraclitic principle of change and Eleatic doctrine of unity are resolved into
                    the more comprehensive opposition of the universal and the particular, while
                    hints of an ultimate solution, of a universal which is at once and <hi
                        rend="italic">perse</hi> particular, are not wanting. The Socratic method of
                    thought appears as that by which alone a solution of philosophic difficulties is
                    to be obtained, and the consideration of thought in its relation to facts is
                    marked out for special investigation. A deeper view of thought was thus made at
                    once possible and necessary.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi> Much, then, had been effected by Aristotle’s
                    predecessors in the way of preparing a definite body of problems and a method of
                    dealing with them, problems and method which might fairly be said to belong to a
                    theory of knowledge as such, and from the occasional references in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Organon</hi> to opinions of contemporaries it is evident that
                    many isolated attempts at solution of such questions were being carried on. In
                    Aristotle we find a systematic examination of many of these problems, but it is
                    left by him doubtful what place in the general scheme of philosophic sciences
                    should be assigned to it. The distribution into physics, mathematics, and first
                    philosophy, or the wider classification of doctrines as poetic, practical, or
                    theoretical, in no way enables us to class logic or the body of speculations
                    making up the <hi rend="italic">Organon.</hi> That the forms of proof analysed
                    in these writings are of universal scope is unambiguously declared; that the
                    first principles assumed in all proof are dealt with in first philosophy is also
                    made clear; but the relations between the two doctrines so reciprocally related
                    cannot be determined from any statement made by Aristotle himself. That he
                    should have regarded the inquiries of the analytics as propaedeutic in
                    character, and should have held that those who assume to discuss problems of
                    first philosophy ought to have made themselves acquainted with the general
                    theory of proof, is intelligible, and more than this significance cannot, we
                    think, be assigned to the passage in the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics,</hi> on
                    the ground of which the logical inquiries have been classed as the general,

                            intends to indicate the place occupied by the analytics in his general
                            scheme of philosophy.</p></note> For the close connexion between the

                    separation of these as forming distinct and independent sciences. To metaphysics
                    is assigned the consideration of the principles of proof, and the kind of
                    inquiry making up first philosophy is described by Aristotle in a fashion which
                    assimilates it most closely to the researches of the analytics. That which is
                    left undecided by the Aristotelian classification is the relation of the logical
                    inquiries to the organic whole of which first philosophy is the main or sole
                        part.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On Aristotle’s

                    obtain any fresh light we must turn to the consideration of indications supplied

                <p>9. (c) Such indications are unfortunately most scanty. As we probably have not
                    the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysics</hi> in its full extent, actual or
                    contemplated, the want of a clear separation between the inquiries belonging
                    specially to first philosophy and those appropriate to the analytical researches
                    may be due in part to the deficiency of our materials. There are, however, two
                    lines of separation discernible, from which some useful inferences may be drawn.
                    What we call the logic of Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the treatises
                    making up the <hi rend="italic">Organon,</hi> is roughly divisible into three
                    parts :—(1) the formal analysis of syllogism and its allied types of reasoning,
                    with the more particular discussion of the elementary parts of reasoning—the
                    proposition;</p>
                <p>(2) the theory of scientific proof and definition (apodictic); (3) the theory of
                    probable arguments, or of reasoning based on currently received opinions and
                    leading to conclusions more or less probable (dialectic). Certainly for
                    Aristotle there was no such distinction between the first and the remaining two
                    parts as would in any way correspond to the modern separation of general or
                    formal logic from the theory of knowledge, or material logic; the three parts in
                    conjunction make up one body of doctrine. Now dialectic is very specially
                    indicated as being of a formal character, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as
                    dealing with no special matter, but with <hi rend="italic">κοινά,</hi> opinions,
                    or types of opinions common to all sciences.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    like manner the formal study of what constitutes knowledge strictly so-called,
                    the nature of the principles on which knowledge rests, the special marks
                    distinguishing it, and the method by which knowledge is framed. But in every
                    body of doctrine we may distinguish, according to Aristotle, three things,—the
                    genus or class of objects with which the demonstration is concerned, the
                    essential or fundamental attributes, qualities of these objects, which are to be
                    demonstrated of them, and, thirdly, certain common axioms or principles of
                    demonstration, not themselves demonstrable, and not entering as integral parts
                    into the demonstration, but lying in the background as security for the
                    reasoning carried out by thought employing them. Can anything corresponding to
                    these three facts be discovered, if we assume for the moment, what certainly is
                    not explicitly stated by Aristotle, that analytic constitutes a special body of
                    doctrine? The genus or class about which the doctrine is concerned can only be
                    reasoning itself, either as apodictic or dialectic, and the latter for a special
                    reason may be left out of account; <hi rend="italic">aπ6δeιξιs,</hi> then, is
                    the matter concerning which the doctrine is put forward. But <hi rend="italic"
                        >aπoδeιξιs</hi> is a form of knowledge, that is to say, is subjective. The
                    properties, therefore, of apodictic science can only be made clear if we
                    consider on the one hand the objective counterparts of necessity and
                    universality in thought, and on the other hand the nature of universality and
                    necessity of thought itself. The common principles or axioms, finally, can only
                    be such presuppositions as are made in apodictic or reasoning generally
                    respecting thought in its relation to fact, as grasping or apprehending reality.
                    The consideration of such axioms, it has been already seen, pertains to first
                    philosophy. Analytics then would appear as an independent doctrine, holding of
                    first philosophy on the one hand, both in regard of the common axioms and in
                    regard of the attributes of being, by which it is a possible object of science,
                    and on the other hand referring to the subjective treatment of thought, whether·
                    in relation to principles or to fact generally.</p>

                    for more detailed treatment. A comparatively clear account, however, of what is
                    understood by him under the head of being as truth and non-being as falsity may
                    be extracted from the various passages referred to, and little doubt can remain
                    that being so regarded is in a peculiar sense the matter of analytical (i,e.,
                    logical) researches.</p>
                <p>Being as truth and non-being as falsity refer to and rest upon combination and
                    division of the elementary parts of thought. For truth and falsity have no
                    significance when applied to things, but only to the connexion of thought which
                    is dominated by the one principle of non-contradiction. Nay, thinking has not
                    even immediate and direct reference to being as such, but only to being as the
                    existent, as qualified, or quantified, or modified in some other way (i.e,,
                    according to the categories), and it is in its very essence the conjunction or
                    unifying of elements. What cannot be conjoined, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    the notions of elementary facts themselves, are not either true or false, and
                    are not matters of thought. Thought thus moves in a definite sphere, that of the
                    combinable or separable, the correspondence of conceptions with real relations,
                    and has its limits on the one hand in the elementary data apprehended by
                    intellect (vois=reason), and on the other handin the infinite sea of particular,
                    accidental qualifications of things <hi rend="italic">(συμβeβηκ0ra).</hi> The
                    possibility of contradictory assertions (for true and false judgments together
                    make up the contradiction, τδ δe <hi rend="italic">σύνολον</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >πeρl μepισμbv avτιφa&lt;rιωs)</hi> is the distinguishing mark of thought.
                    Now it is this very possibility that lies at the root of all the analytical
                    researches. Not, indeed, that one can assume for Aristotle a view which has
                    appeared in later logical works, that all forms of logical reasoning are to be
                    deduced from the principle of contradiction. Quite the reverse. The common
                    axioms underlie all processes of proof, direct or indirect, but they do not
                    enter into or form part of proof. Nothing can be deduced from them; but their
                    authority can be appealed to against any one who refuses to allow a conclusion
                    reached by a correct syllogism from true premisses.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> generally <hi
                                rend="italic">Anal. Post.,</hi> i. 14.</p></note> (The nerve of
                    logical proof would thus lie in the disjunctive proposition; either this
                    conclusion is to be granted or the principle of contradiction is denied. ) Now
                    the analytical researches are in especial the treatment of combination and
                    separation in thought. For even the syllogism may be regarded as only a complex
                    judgment or synthesis, and in the exposition of the forms of combination and
                    separation we shall find a complete system extending from the unproved
                    principles and exhibiting the methods according to which thought proceeds
                    towards the determination of the essential properties of things or the
                    discrimination of various heads under which the transitory and accidental
                    attributes may be advantageously classed.</p>
                <p>So far then as one can judge, the matter of Aristotle’s analytical researches may
                    be expressed as the concrete nature of thought, characterized by its fundamental
                    attribute, the possibility of contradiction, correlated with the real system of
                    things, and having as its end the realization of systematic knowledge, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the adequate subjective interpretation of
                    being.</p>
                <p>10. The indication that the analytics have to do with being as conceived by
                    thought, conducted under the general axiom of noncontradiction and expressed in
                    language, requires to be filled up by a more detailed treatment of the
                    Aristotelian theory of thought in relation to being. Upon the characteristics
                    assigned to thought or knowledge in this special relation, must depend the
                    general nature of the Aristotelian logic, the determination of the scope of
                    logical treatment, and the essence of logical method. For from a quite similar
                    statement regarding the province within which logic moves totally diverse
                    conclusions might be drawn respecting the precise function of logical method.
                    One might have either a formal doctrine or <hi rend="italic">technic,</hi> or a
                    real methodology, either an attempt to evolve logical principles from the axiom
                    of contradiction, or a development of the laws according to which thought,
                    necessarily acting under the said axiom, proceeds towards the construction of
                    knowledge. The history of logic clearly shows how differently the matter of the
                    analytics may be viewed. For one of the possible conclusions, that logic is a
                    technic or quasi-mathematical exposition of formal relations, has been accepted
                    as the undoubted result of Aristotle’s teaching, and has so prevailed as to make
                    itself the current conception.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    The other, the view of logic as theory of the method of scientific thought, has
                    been cast entirely into the background, so far as logical doctrines are
                    concerned, and, if allowed at all, has been regarded as foundation for a species

                <p>The opposition between apodictic and dialectic is in the Aristotelian system the
                    development of that which had already played so important a part in Plato and
                    Socrates, the distinction between science and opinion. Knowledge in the strict
                    sense had there presented itself as the generalized notion referring to being in
                    its very essence, and resting on thought or reason. Opinion is the
                    quasiknowledge of the particular, referring to that which is not being but only
                    accident, and resting on sense or imagination. In the Platonic method this
                    distinction had come forward as the underlying basis for the opposition of
                    philosophy and sophistical rhetoric; in Aristotle a much more precise
                    formulation is given of the characteristics of the two opposed forms of thought,
                    and the connexion between opinion or dialectic and rhetorico-sophistical
                    discussion is made more concrete and profound. Dialectic, with Aristotle, is the
                    system resulting from the attempt to reduce to rule or generalize modes of
                    argument which rest upon current received doctrines as principles, which move
                    within the region of interests about which current opinions <hi rend="italic"
                        >pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con</hi> are to be found, and which
                    terminate not in the decisive solution of a problem but in clearing the way for
                    a more profound research or at least in the establishment of the thesis as
                    against an opponent. Dialectic, then, has no special province; it deals with <hi
                        rend="italic">κοινά</hi> or erδoξα, and its methods are perfectly general.
                    On the one hand, as being the application of reasoning, it refers to and employs
                    the specific types of reasoning, syllogism and induction; on the other hand, as
                    being applied to matters of opinion, and borrowing its principles from current
                    floating dicta about matters of common interest, the types of reasoning tend in
                    it to assume special forms resembling those employed in rhetoric (which is a
                    kind of offshoot from dialectic—the application of dialectic to political
                    principles). The province of dialectic being thus essentially vague, the matters
                    about which dialectic reasoning is concerned being of the most fluctuating
                    character, there must be, for Aristotle, the greatest difficulty in determining,
                        <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> and apart from the opposition to apodictic,
                    what is the character of dialectic syllogism and induction. Nor can it be said
                    that the interpreter of Aristotle has an easy task in the endeavour to discover
                    what precisely is dialectical reasoning and in what way the forms which are
                    assumed to be common both to apodictic and dialectic come to have any
                    application to the fluctuating mass of current opinions. It is comparatively
                    simple to say apodictic and dialectic differ in this, that the one rests on
                    principles essential, necessary, seen to be true, while the other proceeds from
                    data which are merely received as credible and as containing probable, received
                    opinions on a subject about which there may be difference of view; and it may be
                    added that in the one we reach conclusions which are essential, in which the
                    predicate is necessarily and universally true of the subject, while in the other
                    the conclusion remains, like the data, credible merely, and is, at best, only
                    one of the probable answers to a question. But there remains the difficulty,
                    which is certainly not cleared up by any direct statement from Aristotle—of what
                    nature is the syllogistic inference that applies to material of this kind? what
                    is the <hi rend="italic">nervus probandi</hi> in a dialectic syllogism? There
                    are two possible views— either that the principle of syllogistic inference is
                    purely formal, deducible from the characteristic of thought as either affirming
                    or denying in reference to a particular subject, and therefore capable of
                    application either to probable or to necessary matter, or that the syllogism is
                    explicable only as a form in which knowledge is established and is applicable
                    but <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">accidens,</hi> as one may
                    express it, to probable matters. Under this second view, the possibility and
                    reality of syllogistic inference would be traced to the correlative
                    peculiarities of human thought and of the nature of the objects of thought, and
                    it would follow that in strictness there is no dialectic syllogism. Such a
                    conclusion at first sight appears to stand in sharp opposition to quite emphatic
                    utteτances^of Aristotle, but if we suppose, for the sake of example, that a
                    dialectic syllogism were framed, we should readily discern that the link of
                    connexion between data and conclusion, the <hi rend="italic">nervus
                        probandi,</hi> as it may be called, does not in fact differ from that
                    involved in the apodictic syllogism. The merely probable character of the data
                    prevents the conclusion <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n810/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0810-0787"/> from having a higher value than mere
                    likelihood, but does not affect the chain of inference, which proceeds on
                    assumptions identical with these involved in apodictic. Aristotle is chary of
                    any examples of dialectic syllogism, and indeed, if one considers that all forms
                    of modality are investigated in the general analysis of syllogism, it becomes
                    difficult to see what specially distinguishes dialectic inference. It is not to
                    be denied, however, that the investigation of the grounds for the coexistence of
                    dialectic and apodictic is incomplete in Aristotle, as it confessedly is in
                    Plato.</p>
                <p>Unless, then, it can be shown beyond possibility of question that Aristotle does
                    lay down purely formal rules for syllogism, rules deducible simply from the
                    fundamental axiom of thought—and the evidence on which such a view is based will
                    be examined later—we do not obtain much light from the opposition between
                    dialectic and apodictic. More important results, however, are gained when we
                    consider the Aristotelian doctrine of genuine knowledge, of <hi rend="italic"
                        >άπόδειξις,</hi> for, among the numerous elements that here fall to be
                    noted, some are of quite general import, and apply to the whole process of the
                    formation of knowledge.</p>
                <p>13. Apodictic knowledge generally is definable through the special marks of its
                    content. It deals with the universal and necessary, that which is now and
                    always, that which cannot be other than it is, that which is what it is simply
                    through its own nature. It is the expression of the true universal in thought
                    and things, τδ <hi rend="italic">καθόλου.</hi> Further, as a method, <hi
                        rend="italic">άπόδειξις</hi> is characterized by the nature of its starting
                    point, and of the connecting link involved, as well as by the peculiarity of its
                    result. It rests upon the first, simplest, best known, unprovable elements of
                    thought, the <hi rend="italic">πρώτα και άμεσα,</hi> which are not themselves in
                    the strict sense matters of apodictic science, which are <hi rend="italic"
                        >αναπόδεικτα.</hi> In all the intermediate processes of scientific proof
                    there is involved generally this dependence upon previously established
                    principles, and, when apodictic is taken in its ultimate abstraction, these
                    previously established principles are seen to be the prior, ultimate elements,
                    assumptions in thought about things, as one may provisionally describe them. The
                    peculiar connexion involved is simply what we understand by the principle, of
                    syllogism. No syllogism is possible without the universalizing element, the <hi
                        rend="italic">καθόλου,</hi> and knowledge in its essence is
                        syllogistic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                            including both the two in conscious juxtaposition. The third implies
                            both the first and the second.” The connexion between this and the
                            Aristotelian doctrines of vous in its relation to αiσ0nσις will not
                            escape attention.</p></note></p>
                <p>The fuller explanation of apodictic thus refers us to three points of extreme
                    importance in the Aristotelian theory of knowledge, the precise nature of the
                        <hi rend="italic">καθόλου,</hi> which presents itself as the characteristic
                    feature of <hi rend="italic">aπoδειξιs,</hi> the relation of fundamental and
                    universal in things on which the possibility of <hi rend="italic">aπoδειζιs</hi>
                    is founded, and the forms of thought through which the universal and particular
                    factors are subjectively realized. The three are most closely connected, and as
                    they involve the main difficulties of the Aristotelian philosophy as a whole, a
                    general treatment of them is indispensable. First then of <hi rend="italic"

                    characteristic term in the explanation of knowledge. This notion is essentially
                    double-sided. On the one side it is the universal of empirical knowledge, the
                    generic or class universal—it is <hi rend="italic">τb</hi><hi rend="italic">κατά
                        παντός</hi>; on the other hand, it is the root or ground of the empirical

                    function of thought (of apodictic) is the exposition with reference to a
                    determined class of objects of all that necessarily inheres in them, on account
                    of the elementary factors which determine their existence and nature. Real
                    things, individual objects, are the basis of all knowledge, but in these
                    individuals the elementary parts, causally connected, and leading to ulterior
                    consequences, form the general element about which there may be demonstrative
                    science. Thought which operates upon them does so, as we have already seen,
                    under the peculiar restriction of its very nature, as the subjective reali
                    zation of the notion of things, and the principles expressing this restriction,
                    the logical axioms, maybe appealed to if demonstration be opposed groundlessly,
                    but these axioms do not enter into the process of demonstration. “When the
                    apodictic process has attained its end, that is, when all the universal

                <p>14. Probably the example of apodictic which Aristotle bears chiefly in mind is
                    mathematical science, and in his treatment of the characteristic marks of this
                    doctrine most of the peculiarities of apodictic occur. In mathematical science
                    abstraction is made of the material qualities of the things considered, of those
                    qualities which give to them a place as physical facts, but the abstracta are
                    not to be conceived as entities, self-existing. They are not even to be
                    conceived as existing only in mind, as ideal types; they truly exist in things,
                    but are considered separately (^ξ <hi rend="italic">aφ&gt;aιρεσεωs).</hi> The
                    first principles of mathematical science are few and definite, and the procedure
                    is continuously from the simple and absolutely more known to the concrete and
                    relatively more known. As in proof generally, so in mathematical demonstration,
                    an essential quality <hi rend="italic">(συμβεβτηκ6s κa(f al&gt;τb)</hi> may be
                    proved of a subject, and yet such quality may be still accidental, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> not predicated of the subject on account of its
                    generic constituent marks, but capable of being deduced from the constituent
                    mark of that which enters into the subject, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a
                    given figure’s exterior angles are equal to four right angles. Why? Because it
                    is an isosceles triangle. Why has an isosceles this property? Because it is a
                    triangle. Why has a triangle? Because it is a rectilineal figure. If this reason
                    is ultimate, it completes our knowledge, <hi rend="italic">και καθόλου δε
                        τότε.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="italic">Anal. Post.,</hi> i. 24, 86a, 2.</p></note> Thus the
                    range of mathematical proof extends from the <hi rend="italic">πρώτα,</hi> the
                    original definitions, which at the same time assume the existence of the things
                    defined, through the determinations <hi rend="italic">καθ' αυτά</hi> to the
                    qualities <hi rend="italic">(συμβεβi]κoτa),</hi> which can be shown to attach to
                    their subjects, to be in a sense <hi rend="italic">καθ' αυτά,</hi> while a
                    continuous series of middle notions, concerning which there cannot be much
                    ambiguity, effects the transition. Moreover, in mathematical science, one can
                    see with the utmost evidence the correlation of reason and sense, which will
                    presently appear as a fundamental factor in Aristotle’s general theory of
                    knowledge. The <hi rend="italic">πρώτα</hi> are not to be conceived as innate or
                    as possessed before experience. They are seen or envisaged, intuited in
                    perception by <hi rend="italic">voυs,</hi> and induction here as elsewhere is
                    the process by which perceptions are gathered together for the reflective and
                    intuiting action of <hi rend="italic">νους.</hi> In the mathematical individual,
                    more evidently than in any other case, is visible the union of thought and
                    sense. The demonstration which employs a diagram does not turn upon any
                    properties of the diagram which are there for sense only, not for reason, but
                    upon the general elementary relations contemplated in thought.<note

                    demonstration in particular has brought into clear light the prominent
                    characteristic of knowledge according to the Aristotelian view. Knowledge must
                    always be regarded from two sides, as having relation to the universal, and as
                    bearing upon the particular.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                >Anal. Pr.,</hi> ii. 21.</p></note> It is in itself the union of the
                    general and the particular, of the universal and the individual. This
                    fundamental notion of knowledge is not only the integral element in the
                    Aristotelian theory of science, but also the guiding principle in his scientific
                        method.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This is
                            excellently put by Eucken, <hi rend="italic">op. rit.,</hi> pp.

                    Universals as such are of no avail either as explanations of knowledge or as
                    grounds of existence. Particulars as such are infinite, indefinite, <pb

                    the combination of the data of sense, imagination, and intuitive faculty of
                    reason, is knowledge possible. And the methods by which knowledge is formed in
                    us regarding things exhibit the same twofold aspect. Syllogism as the form of
                    the process from generalia to the determination of attributes of the individual
                    subject, induction as the method of procedure from the vaguely apprehended
                    individuals to the generalia or principles, alike, when analysed, exhibit the
                    conjunction of the universal and particular.</p>
                <p>16. In each branch of knowledge there are involved the specific genus or class,
                    the attributes concerning which there is to be demonstration, and the common
                    axioms or principles. Each branch, moreover, implies special principles, <hi
                        rend="italic">ϊδιαι</hi><hi rend="italic">apχal</hi>; there is no
                    all-comprehensive science from which truths are to be deduced, and from the
                    common maxims alone nothing can be inferred. <hi rend="italic">'Aτroδeιξιs</hi>
                    involves principles, and starts therefore of necessity with what maybe called
                    definitions. Yet definitions are at the same time the final result of apodictic
                    demonstration, and the original assumptions may be pushed farther and farther
                    back till they appear as the <hi rend="italic">πpωτaι κdl ⅛μeσoι πpoτaσeιs</hi>
                    which are only apprehended by <hi rend="italic">vaυs.</hi> From this distinction
                    between knowledge as completed and knowledge as in process of formation, as from
                    the distinction between sciences of the same genus as more or less general <hi
                        rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> geometry and optics), there follow the
                    distinctions between propositions necessary and propositions true <hi

                    and proof of essence, between deduction and induction, between syllogism as
                    generic form of all proof, and the special type of syllogism in which completed
                    knowledge is expressed. We are thus enabled to reconcile what seem at first
                    sight discrepancies in the Aristotelian doctrine,—as, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> the insistance upon induction as furnishing the principles of
                    reasoning (τά <hi rend="italic">καθόλου)</hi> coupled with the attempt to show
                    that induction too is a kind of syllogism; the explanation of proof as involving
                    essence, coupled with the admission of syllogisms of fact; the treatment of
                    propositions as necessary and contingent in themselves, coupled with the
                    distinction between <hi rend="italic">eπιστ⅛μη</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    which turns upon the essential connexions, and that which refers to the isolated
                    facts wherein such connexions make their appearance. Syllogistic as formal
                    analysis of what is common in all knowledge is one part of the all-comprehensive
                    theory of knowledge, an integral but not a self-existing part.<note

                <p>17. The general idea of the Aristotelian analytic thus obtained does not require
                    to be supplemented by any detailed survey of the logical system into which it is
                    evolved, but a brief summary of the most important points and indication of the
                    relation in which the parts stand to the whole may be of advantage.</p>
                <p>The simplest form of knowledge, that in which being as true or false is
                    apprehended, is the judgment. The consideration of the judgment is therefore the
                    first part of the analytical researches. Here Aristotle distinguishes more
                    accurately than any of his predecessors (indeed for the first time with
                    accuracy) between subject and predicate as integral parts, symbolized by the
                    noun and verb, and signifying the relations for us of things as appearing under
                    the schemata of the categories. The material basis of the judgment, as one may
                    call it, is the thing as an object of possible knowledge, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> the thing as individual (and therefore as involving matter and
                    form, the particular and the general), as qualified, specifically, in time,
                    space, quantity, and relation, and existing as one mode in the universal nexus
                    of potentiality and actuality. These metaphysical forms, and, specially, the
                    deep-lying modes of potentiality and actuality, reflect themselves in the forms
                    whereby subjectively knowledge is realized in us, and the resulting knowledge is
                    conditioned partly by them, partly by the modes in which intellect as a reality
                    is developed in us. The proposition has necessarily a reference to them, and
                    thus alongside of formal distinctions between universal, particular, singular,
                    and indefinite judgments we have the distinctions between necessary, contingent,
                    and possible, which appear partly as given qualities of the judgment, partly as
                    representing differences in the conditions of knowledge, partly as referring to
                    differences of subjective apprehension.</p>
                <p>The essence of the judgment as the apprehension of truth or falsehood consists in
                    its twofold aspect as affirmative and negative, the former of these in a sense
                    prior and better known, but the latter no less necessary, and both referring to
                    objective relations of things. The affirmative and negative character of
                    judgments, the essential <hi rend="italic">aυτiφaσtς</hi> of human thought, is
                    further defined in reference to (a) the quantitative distinctions already
                    recognized (the doctrine of logical opposition), (δ) the distinctions of
                    necessary, contingent, and possible, which are rightly regarded as real matters

                            not either “it is necessary-not-to-be,” or “it is

                <p>Propositions as integral parts of knowledge turn upon the ultimate relations of
                    things known. The distinctions between first principles and deduced truths, out
                    of which the theory of proof is developed, themselves rest upon those
                    distinctions which have been already noted in treating of apodictic. Syllogism
                    as the form by which the general and particular elements are mediated and
                    conjoined is therefore of universal application, and may be analysed
                        formally.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In this
                            sense only can we recognize the distinction between Aristotle's <hi

                            Aristotle's treatment must never be thrown out of account.</p></note>
                    The various modes in which syllogistic inference, pure or modal, the main types
                    to which these modes may be reduced, their relations to one another, and the
                    general laws implied in them are worked out in a fashion which does not admit of
                    any brief statement. The conclusion unites the elements which in isolation
                    appear in the premisses, and is, in a sense, the complex or organic whole
                    unfolded in the syllogistic form. To every syllogism three things are necessary,
                    the presence of a positive element, universality in one of the premisses
                    (resting, as above shown, on the recognized property of all proof as involving a
                    general fact), and <hi rend="italic">consequence,</hi> or necessary connexion
                    between conclusion and premisses. Now from this third element there follow
                    certain interesting deductions. The necessity of consequence rests on the very
                    nature of syllogistic thought, and if each syllogism be taken as it stands, as a
                    simple unit, no further inquiry is needful. But the character of the premisses
                    in themselves may be taken into account, and we then discover that syllogism
                    proceeds continuously on the assumption that the general law of syllogistic
                    proof is in the special case realized. It need not be in fact realized. We may
                    have premisses in themselves false, from which a tnιe conclusion is reached, and
                    the falsity of the premisses only becomes apparent when they are themselves
                    treated as conclusions of a possible syllogism, and so the regress made towards
                    ultimate principles. Syllogistic form, in short, is the hypothetical application
                    of the general rule of necessary connexion between ground and consequent. If A
                    (the premisses), then B (the conclusion). Quite possibly, then, we may have, in
                    syllogistic form, conclusions drawn from premisses not <hi rend="italic"
                        >αναγκαία</hi> but only &lt;υs e ’ πl τδ πολύ. Science and opinion <hi
                        rend="italic">{δόξα)</hi> are equally sources of propositions or premisses.
                    If formal consequences be united with real uncertainty of matter, there arises a
                    syllogism in character dialectical. Were the real uncertainty overlooked, the
                    syllogism would be sophistic in character. Dialectical reasoning, then, dealing
                    with the stage beneath science, may be of service, not only for practice in
                    distinguishing true and false, but as bringing the particulars of each branch of
                    knowledge into closer relation with the first principles special to that
                        branch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    particular element as such, the transitory and material, is present, there room
                    is left for opinion, and reasoning is possible, not of the particular as such,
                    but in so far as the particular manifests an underlying universal.<note

                    thus resemble very closely those modes by which the empirical detail, the region
                    of given fact, is treated, viz., induction, example, use of signs and probable
                    indications. For the universal has always its empirical side, and the complete
                    process of scientific proof is a final result for which the way may be prepared
                    by treatment, according to scientific form, of the empirical fact. There are
                    syllogisms of fact as well as syllogisms of reason or ground, and the reason or
                    ground becomes apparent through knowledge of the fact. Occasionally indeed the
                    fact and ground are so immediately connected that transition from one to the
                    other may be at once effected, but generally this is not the case.</p>

                    difficulties of varied kinds. An opposition is indicated between syllogism and
                    induction, yet induction is treated as a kind of syllogism; that is, freely
                    interpreted, induction is so analysed as to show that in it, also, there is the
                    union of general assumption and particular detail which is characteristic of
                    syllogistic reasoning. Further, Aristotle seems to waver between induction as a
                    kind of inference, through which we arrive at general principles, and as a
                    species of proof, and his teaching is therefore perplexed by the want of some
                    clear statement regarding a difficulty in the theory of induction, which is
                    still far from perfect solution. For, according to Aristotle, induction as such,
                    starting from the particulars of sense, and proceeding by comparison of similar
                    cases and enumeration of all the similarly constituted members, never, even when
                    the enumeration is complete, attains to probative force.<note anchored="true"

                    between the characteristics of the class and its deduced properties.<note

                    interpret according to more modern phraseology, this peculiarity may be
                    expressed as the distinctive feature of inductive research based on facts or
                    effects. We do’not regard the inquiry as terminating in the establishment of a
                    law until it is possible to reverse the process and show that from the surmised
                    cause the effects do actually follow. Otherwise we have a conclusion of
                    “coexistence” merely—an empirical rule or generalization. If, bearing in mind
                    these sources of difficulty, and also the correlation which for Aristotle always
                    obtains between empirical details and grounds of reason, we consider the example

                    these, reference is desirable only to bring out the fact that causal nexus is
                    the <hi rend="italic">καθόλου</hi> in question; the second is of the utmost
                    importance as clearing up what has always seemed an obscurity in the account of
                    the inductive syllogism. Iu the chapters 16-18 of <hi rend="italic">Anal.
                        Post.,</hi> ii., Aristotle considers the relation of cause and effect as the
                    essential basis of proof, and he points out with much clearness the difference
                    between the fact as cause of knowledge and the cause as ground of existence and
                    proof. In some cases cause and effect are so united, so reciprocate, that we may
                    infer from one to the other. But the doubt arises, may there not be more than
                    one cause for any given attribute, iu which case all such inferences from effect
                    must become problematical. Aristotle’s solution is remarkable, both in itself
                    and in its bearing on the inductive syllogism. Suppose the attribute 3 is found
                    in all individuals of a class A, and also in individuals of class B, C, &amp;c.
                    Iu order to discover the cause, investigations must be carried on until we have
                    a defined number of classes A,B,C, &amp;c., in all of which <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi> is found, and which comprehend all cases of the presence of <hi
                        rend="italic">β.</hi> Then that which is also common to A,B,C, &amp;c., may
                    be regarded as the cause of <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> say, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> an attribute <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> If this attribute <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> be really the cause of <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> it
                    will enter into its definition; it will be its definition. There might, however,
                    be a connexion of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β</hi> of this
                    universal and reciprocating kind, and yet <hi rend="italic">a</hi> might not be
                    the cause in question; it might be only a fact from which <hi rend="italic"
                        >β</hi> could be inferred; the real cause <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> which
                    gives rise to α, lies in the background. Characteristic of causation, then, is
                    constant reciprocal conjunction of facts. Even if it be admitted, then, that
                    there may be more causes for a phenomenon than one, it will yet be true that
                    each of these causes will be manifested in one class of phenomena where there
                    will be the universal reciprocating coexistence that is characteristic of the
                    relation in question. Thus the attribute longevity observable in quadruped
                    animals and in birds may be due to different causes, <hi rend="italic"
                        >c.g.,</hi> to absence of gall in the one case, to predominance of solid,
                    dry matter in the other. But in each case there will be a definite species
                    characterized by the constant conjunction of the cause and the causatum; the
                    whole class long-lived animals and the class gall-less animals will
                    coincide.</p>
                <p>Turning now to the chapter on inductive syllogism, we find induction defined as
                    inference through the minor that the major belongs to the middle. Here evidently
                    major and middle are regarded not as determined by form only but naturally
                    distinct, and we must assume that by middle term is to be understood the ground
                    or reason of the attribute (major term) characteristic of a defined species or
                    group (the middle term). Were our knowledge complete and scientific, we should
                    be able to express this in apodιi - tic form :—whatever animal has no gall is
                    long-lived; man, horse, mule, &amp;c., are animals having no gall; therefore
                    they are long-lived. The progress of knowledge, however, may be from the
                    empirical details. We may have given to us the fact of the attribute,
                    long-livedness, in the group of animals, man, horse, &lt;fec., and discover that
                    these long-lived animals are also wanting in gall. If then, in accordance with
                    the rules above sketched, there can be discovered a reciprocating relation
                    between want of gall in animals and long-livedness, if we can constitute a class
                    distinguished by conjoint presence of gall-lessness and longevity, we have the
                    basis for an inductive proof. We may infer therefrom that gall-lessness is, <hi
                        rend="italic">in this species,</hi> the cause of longevity. Such a reasoning
                    is founded on particulars given, and as the coexistence is given, the conclusion
                    seems to be immediately drawn; there does not appear to be mediation or use of a
                    middle term; nevertheless the middle term is implied, not in the supposition
                    that the two classes reciprocate, but in the transference from empirical
                    coexistence to causal nexus.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s mode of stating this argument has presented so many difficulties of
                    interpretation that various emendations have been proposed. Grote, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> who has not apprehended why the class longlived
                    animals should be taken universally,—“we are,”he says, “in no way concerned with
                    the totality of long-lived animals,”—suggests an emendation, which makes the
                    essence of the inductive reasoning turn upon the extension of what we know
                    regarding some gall-less animals to all of that class. But this is not the
                    inductive step according to Aristotle. Induction has not to prove or assume that
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β,</hi> found coexisting in
                    some members of a species, coexist in all of them; Aristotle takes this
                    universal coexistence for granted as the basis of the argument. The inductive
                    step is the transference from this universal coexistence to causal nexus.
                    Apodictically, we should say, if α is the cause of <hi rend="italic">β,</hi>
                    then all A which possesses <hi rend="italic">a</hi> possesses <hi rend="italic"
                        >β;</hi> thus reasoning from cause to causatum. Inductively we say, all A
                    which possesses <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has <hi rend="italic">β</hi>; therefore
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the cause of j3.<note anchored="true"

                            induction and syllogism through induction is the process of concluding
                            by means of the minor term that the major term is predicable of the
                            middle " (that is to say, of concluding from given facts that an
                            attribute found in all of them is the effect of some other attribute
                            also found in all of them). “For example, if B be the middle term, A and
                            C the extremes, we show, by means of C, that A is predicable of B; for
                            this is the inductive process. Thus,’ let A be longlived; B, those
                            wanting gall; C, individual long-lived, as man. horse, mule. Then A is
                            predicated universally of C” (that is to say, the attribute A is found
                            in all the examples before us), “for also that which wants gall is
                            long-lived " (that is to say, as a given fact, gall-lessness and
                            longevity in the species, group, before us coexist). “B, wanting gall,
                            thus is predicated universally of C. If then B and C be reciprocating,
                            if C do not extend beyond the middle term ’ ' (that is, if we do not
                            find other animals than the long-lived animals enumerated which also are
                            devoid of gall), "it is necessary that A should be predicated of B. For
                            it has been shown previously that if two terms are predicable of the
                            same third, and if the extreme reciprocate with one of these, then the
                            other of those predicates will be predicable of that with which the
                            first reciprocated; but it is necessaιy to know that C is the complex of
                            all the individual cases.” The last sentence is extremely hard to
                            interpret. The expression το άκρον occurring in it is generally the
                            technical word for major term, but as in the syllogism before us the
                            major term is one of the predicates, this signification would seem to
                            contradict the words wpôç <hi rend="italic">θάτιρον αυτών.</hi> Hamilton
                            reads τδ <hi rend="italic">μiσoυ,</hi> which makes the argument
                            intelligible and coherent with the passage apparently referred to in
                            δeδeικται πpoτepov, viz., <hi rend="italic">Anal. Pr..</hi> ii. 21, p.
                            68a, 21-25. Probably Aristotle uses τ&lt;&gt; <hi rend="italic"
                                >άκρου</hi> here as equivalent to C. the <hi rend="italic"
                                >άκρου</hi> through which the induction proceeds. According to the
                            view taken above, the essence of the Aristotelian induction does not at
                            all lie in the universalizing of C, but in connecting in one proposition
                            the attributes B and A found to coexist in the group C. There is thus in
                            one sense no middle, for cause is not reached; in another sense there
                            is, for C is the material link connecting A and B. Aristotle then might
                            naturally use <hi rend="italic">άκρου</hi> for C. and assimilate the
                            procιss of induction to a syllogism in which there was reciprocation of
                            terms. In fact, however, induction regarded after his fashion results
                            merely in the constitution of_a group or class characterized as
                            possessing two attributes in common.</p></note></p>
                <p>Induction, as dealing with particulars, starting with the sense data, and resting
                    upon the more evident fact in order to point towards the essential ground or
                    reason, is therefore more persuasive, more palpable, more adapted for popular
                    inquiries, and relatively more apparent. Syllogistic proof, on the other hand,
                    is more stringent, and more efficacious in establishing a scientific conclusion
                    or position.</p>
                <p>Aristotle’s mode of dealing with induction, in so far at least as any specific
                    process is designated by that term, seems on the surface to diverge widely from
                    modern logical theory, and we look in vain in his analytical researches for
                    consideration of the methods of observation and experiment which has come to be
                    recognized as the essential portion of a doctrine of inductive reasoning. Y et
                    it may fairly be argued that in modern theories the term induction is used with
                    great laxity, so as to cover either all processes connected with scientific
                    method or some one special feature of scientific reasoning, and that the

                    modern views, we shall find that it consists mainly in the increased fulness and
                    complexity of our fundamental scientific notions, a fulness and complexity
                    resulting from long-continued scientific research. Our modern logic of induction
                    has profited mainly by the general advance of scientific method, and tends to
                    increase as these methods, by constant contact with facts, become more refined
                    and accurate. The additional cautions or limitations which we now introduce into
                    our statement of the principles of inductive research concern not so much the
                    form of inductive proof as the character and modes of obtaining evidence which
                    is to satisfy the canons or rules of proof. Such limitations become apparent
                    only through actual scientific progress, not by analysis of the form of
                    scientific proof.</p>
                <p>18. To Aristotle, as has been above said, proof is essentially syllogistic or
                    deductive in character. Not every syllogism is an apodictic proof, but all proof
                    is syllogistic. For proof or adequate knowledge is reference of effects to their
                    causes, and the cause is the general element, <hi rend="italic">τb</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">καθόλου,</hi> which forms the middle term in apodictic proof.
                    Now proof by means of the cause or reason implies the existence of the cause;
                    the inquiry why a thing is is useless unless we know or assume that the thing
                    is. If it exists, then the cause or reason of its so existing is that which
                    gives it a definite character or position; it is, in technical phraseology, the
                    form of the thing. But the form of the thing, regarded apart from the material,
                    accidental element essential to its concrete existence, is that which we express
                    in a definition. Proof and definition are thus most closely connected. The <hi
                        rend="italic">terminus</hi> to which proof tends, not realized in all cases
                    of proof but certainly in the most perfect, is the definition, and, besides, if
                    we closely examine proof, and find that ultimately we can force back the chain
                    of middle terms up to certain ultimate, primary universals, disclosed by <hi
                        rend="italic">vous,</hi> and that the nature of these primary universals is
                    stated in their definition, we see further that definition is connected with
                    proof as the <hi rend="italic">terminιιs</hi> from which proof starts. The
                    exposition of definition is thus the crowning portion of Aristotle’s theory of
                    apodictic method.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It

                    merely nominal definition or explanation of what a name signifies is but a
                    preparatory stadium in the progress towards real, genetic definition.</p>
                <p>Definition, then, like demonstration, rests on the essential or rational ground,
                    the notion of the thing. The rational ground or notion has its empirical aspect;
                    it determines a class, and thus, just as in demonstration we may have forms of
                    reasoning based primarily on the empirical details, so in framing definitions we
                    may proceed from the empirical class, and may formulate rules for defining which
                    bear special reference to the genus or body of individuals. In such procedure
                    there is always involved the general idea of the essence or notion as the
                    determining universal, and without this general idea the subsidiary methods,
                    induction and division, do not yield scientific definition.</p>
                <p>To frame a definition, then, t.e., to discover the elements whose combination as
                    an essential unity makes up the notion of the things defined, we select the
                    predicates belonging to the things in question, but also attaching to other
                    species of the same genus. The combination of such predicates which is not found
                    in any other species, which is, therefore, reciprocable with the essence or form
                    of the species, is its definition. The definition, therefore, contains the genus
                    and the specific attribute (or combination of attributes). Of these elements,
                    the genus is the least important; the truly essential factor is the specific
                    difference, and, in order that our definition should be ultimate, we must follow
                    out the line of specific difference by which a genus may be divided until we
                    reach a final, irreducible characteristic or group of characteristics,
                    constituting a lowest species (or natural kind, if one were to employ a term
                    made current by J. S. Mill). The systematic following out of the specific
                    differences is logical division; the critical comparison of points of similarity
                    in species of the same genus, so as to obtain a higher generality, has no
                    special title accorded to it, but it resembles the Socratic and Platonic
                    induction <hi rend="italic">(συναγωγή).</hi> Division proceeds on the
                    oppositions actually found in nature; and, though, doubtless, the division by
                    dichotomy has formal advantages, it has not, as a process of real cognition, any
                    supreme value. The negative as such is the inconceivable, and presents nothing
                    for cognition.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Just as

                            proposition has significance only in regard to the corresponding
                            positive.</p></note> And division is not dependent on exhaustive
                    knowledge; it is not necessary that, in order to recognize A as distinct from B,
                    we should know the whole universe of possible objects of cognition. A and B may
                    be recognized as identical or distinct in essence, even though they at the same
                    time possess distinct or identical accidental marks. Knowledge, in other words,
                    turns upon the essential, not upon the numerical universal.<note anchored="true"

                            Speusippus; see Prantl, i. 85. Aristotle here touches on a logical
                            problem whicn has troubled many logicians. It is the same difficulty
                            that arises when the question of plurality of causes
                        is-considered.</p></note> It is only needful, then, that in the systematic
                    process of indicating the elements of definition, all must be included that
                    concern the essence, that the order must be strictly from determining to
                    determined (or from more abstract or general to more concrete or special), and
                    finally that the enumeration be complete. The final division or species reached
                    is the notion of the thing, and its expression is the definition.</p>
                <p>19. The analytical researches thus manifest themselves as a real theory of
                    knowledge and as forming an integral part of the Aristotelian system. Logical
                    relations are throughout conditioned by the characteristics of the Aristotelian
                    metaphysical conception, and the distinction of the formal or technical from the
                    real in cognition has no place in them. No point is more frequently insisted on
                    by Aristotle than the impossibility of deducing any scientific principles or
                    results from the fundamental axiom of thought, the law of non-contradiction. In
                    the Aristotelian system this axiom appears simply as the generalized expression
                    for the peculiar characteristic of thought, its potentiality of truth or
                    falsehood. Such potentiality accompanies thought throughout, and is the mark of
                    its subjective character, but the actuality of thought is something quite
                    distinct, and is only realized through the various processes whereby the world
                    of fact is apprehended. Beyond a doubt knowledge has a general aspect; and there
                    is thus possible a general theory of knowledge, but this is not to be regarded
                    as merely a development from the fundamental axiom of thought. It is the general
                    statement of what constitutes actual cognition, and thus refers on the one hand
                    to the ultimate properties of that which is to be known, on the other hand to
                    the qualities of knowledge as a subjective, though not the less real, fact. '
                    For to Aristotle subjective has not the sense which it may be said to have
                    assumed in modern logic, mainly through the Kantian analysis. The activity of
                    thought which realizes itself in the consciousness of the individual is not a
                    mere formal process of apprehension, mirroring or depicting reality that is
                    totally distinct from it. It is a reality, one aspect or phase of the total sum
                    of things, and its development is a real proces» correlative with the
                    development inherent in things as a whole.</p>
                <p>At the same time it is impossible to overlook the difficulties which attach to
                    the Aristotelian conception, and the consequent obscurities or perplexities in
                    his logical researches. To remain always true to the fundamental conception of
                    thought as one factor or phase in things, to trace its forms in such a mode, as
                    never to lose sight of its essential correlation to the development of reality,
                    is in itself the hardest task for any thinker, and presupposes a more completed
                    metaphysic than is to be found in Aristotle. Some of these difficulties may be
                    briefly noted, as they form the turning points of certain later doctrines. The
                    judgment or proposition is taken as the initial, the simplest phase of the
                    activity of thought, and so as having the simplest relation to things. But the
                    distinctions of things which are subjectively seized.in the judgment are too
                    much regarded as given facts, and Aristotle is thus involved in a difficulty
                    respecting the import, the truth or falsity, of the judgment. The presence of
                    this difficulty is specially discernible when he attempts to deal with the
                    temporal reference in the judgment, with the doctrine of opposition, and with
                    the nature of modality. Thus, he notes that the verb, the essential part of the
                    predicate, has a <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n814/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0814-0791"/> temporal significance, but he also notes that
                    in universal judgments there is no reference to any specific time, and also that
                    the copula, the verb <hi rend="italic">is,</hi> has no existential meaning. He
                    is thus driven to the enunciation of a view, common among recent logicians, that
                    the judgment is a reflective or critical act, pronouncing on the truth or
                    falsity of a contemplated separation or conjunction of facts, while, on the
                    other hand, the very contemplation of conjunction or separation has appeared as
                    the essence of the judgment. So, in dealing with opposition, he distinguishes
                    contradictories from contraries, and is inclined to refer the second to the
                    given nature of facts, wherein extreme oppositions of members falling under the
                    same genus are presented. Modality, likewise, he treats confusedly, for the
                    assignment of the modal relations to the predicate does not sufficiently
                    determine their place in a theory of judgment, nor explain the relation in which
                    they stand to the judgment as the simplest activity of thought.</p>
                <p>Further, in dealing with the quantity of judgments, Aristotle is perplexed by his
                    own theory of what constitutes generality. He is compelled to throw together
                    universal judgments of a totally distinct kind,—empirical and rational, as one
                    may call them,—and though the underlying view that empirical universality is the
                    expression of, and is dependent on, rational connexion is made sufficiently
                    clear in the doctrine of proof, it is not carried out to its consequences in the
                    doctrine of judgment. Finally, to note only the crowning difficulty, the theory
                    of proof and of definition turns upon the nature of the essential connexion of
                    attributes in a subject, but the explanation of essence is precisely the lacuna
                    in the system. Indications of a theory of essence are not wanting, but it does
                    not seem possible so to unite them as to form a consistent whole. The greatest
                    obscurity still hangs over the fundamental part of the system, the nature of the

                <p>20. The long history of philosophic thought from Aristotle to the beginning of
                    the modern period furnishes no new conception of logic so complete and
                    methodical as to require detailed treatment, but exhibits alterations in special
                    doctrines, additions, and new points of view numerous enough to account for a
                    certain radical change in the mode of regarding logic which is, for our present
                    purpose, the only interesting feature. This change may perhaps be expressed not
                    inaccurately as the tendency towards formalizing logic. Gradually logical
                    researches came to have their boundaries extended in one way by the introduction
                    of new matter, and narrowed in another by restriction of logical consideration
                    to one special aspect of knowledge. Much in the history of this movement still
                    remains in obscurity, but the general result is sufficiently clear. The periods
                    into which the historical development of logic throughout this long interval may
                    be naturally divided, with their main characteristics, are the following.! (1)
                        <hi rend="italic">The Peripatetic School,</hi> represented by Theophrastus
                    and Eudernus, following in the main the Aristotelian tradition, but deviating in
                    certain fundamental respects, and on the whole treating the matter of logical
                    research as though it were separate from and independent of the theory of
                    knowledge as a whole. To this school is due the distinct recognition of the
                    hypothetical and disjunctive proposition and syllogism, and the more complete
                    enumeration of the possible valid modes of categorical reasoning. In both cases
                    the additions are made to turn upon purely formal considerations. The
                    hypothetical and disjunctive judgments are treated as given varieties, to be
                    discerned in ordinary language and expression, not as resting upon any
                    fundamentally distinct principle or activity of thought.<note anchored="true"

                    The addition of five indirect moods to those recognized by Aristotle as
                    belonging to the first figure proceeds on the purely formal ground of difference
                    in position of the middle term in the two premisses. (2) <hi rend="italic">The
                        Epicurean and Stoic Logics.</hi> Of these the Epicurean presents no points
                    of interest. The Stoic logic, on the other hand, is the first example of a
                    purely formal doctrine based on and associated with a thoroughly empirical
                    theory of cognition. In essence the Stoic doctrine is identical with that of
                    Antisthenes, above noted, and it is interesting to observe that, under the
                    purely nominalist theory, logic becomes almost identical with the doctrine of
                    expression, or rhetoric. The theory of naming, and that of the conjunction of
                    names in propositions, are the fundamental portions of the body of logic.
                    Naturally the Stoic logicians tended to increase the bulk of logic by
                    introducing numerous distinctions of language, and by signalizing varieties of
                    judgment dependent on varieties of verbal expression. (3) <hi rend="italic">The
                        acceptation of Logic among the Romans.</hi> Here there must be distinguished
                    the quasi-rhetorical logic, such as is found in Cicero, which is altogether
                    Stoic in character, and the Aristotelian logic, as developed by Boetius with the
                    additions of the later commentators. In Boetius one notes specially the
                    technical or formal character of the treatment, which was of special importance
                    historically, from the fact that the earlier scholastic writers derived their
                    main knowledge of logic from certain of the treatises of Boetius. (4) <hi
                        rend="italic">The Scholastic Logic.</hi> On the details of the scholastic
                    logic it is not necessary to enter, but there must be noted the following points
                    as of interest in determining what may well be called the current conception of
                    the Aristotelian logic in modern times. The earlier scholastics, in possession
                    of but few of Aristotle’s writings, added nothing of importance to the body of
                    logical researches, and the permanent subject of discussion, the nature of
                    universals, did not, through any of its solutions, affect the treatment of
                    logical doctrines. The introduction of the body of the Aristotelian writings was
                    contemporaneous with the introduction of the Arab writings and commentaries into
                    western Europe, and there grew up therewith a more developed treatment of what
                    may be called the psychological element of logic. The logic of the later
                    scholastics is characterized by two points of interest, historically
                    unconnected, but having a natural affinity,—the one, the introduction of an
                    immense mass of subtle distinctions, mainly verbal, making up the body of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Parva</hi><hi rend="italic">Logicalia,</hi> the other, the
                    influence of the nominalist conception of thought.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first of these is no doubt, as Prantl
                            has laboured to prove, Byzantine in origin, but it still remains
                            doubtful whence the Eastern logicians draw. The most probable source is
                            the Stoic writings.</p></note> The peculiarity of the nominalist view is
                    the severance of immediate apprehension from discursive thought, the assignment
                    of all matter of knowledge to the one, and of all form to the other. But form,
                    under this conception of discursive thought, can be found only in the
                    generalizing function of signs or names; accordingly the fundamental processes
                    of logical thought are regarded as so many modes of application of names. The
                    later nominalist logicians were thus naturally led to the expenditure of immense
                    subtlety and diligence on the thorny problems of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Parva</hi><hi rend="italic">Logicalia,</hi> while at the same time the
                    peculiar inner difficulty of the theory became apparent as its consequences were
                    worked out. (5) <hi rend="italic">The Reaction against Aristotelianisrn and the

                    theory is offered by the numerous works representing this stage of historical
                    development. Valla, Agricola, and Vives, with much good criticism in general
                    spirit and detail, present a rhetorico-grammatical logic that resembles most
                    closely Cicero’s eclectic reproduction of Stoicism. Ramus, the only logician of
                    the period with historic renown, contributes really nothing to the history of
                    logic, his innovations consisting mainly in the omission of the most valuable
                    portions of the genuine Aristotelic logic, the insertion of practical and
                    interesting examples, and finally rearrangement or redistribution of the heads
                    under which logical doctrine was expounded. The Ramist school, most numerous and
                    flourishing, produced no logical work of the first importance.·<note

                <p>The net result of this whole period was the severance of a certain body of
                    doctrine, formal in character (the theory of second intentions), from theory of
                    knowledge generally, and from all the concrete sciences. The boundaries and even
                    the functions of this doctrine remained unfixed, for difference regarding
                    fundamental points of extra-logical theory led to difference in mode of
                    treatment, as well as to difference in conceptions of the end and value of
                    logic.</p>

                <p>21. Modern reform of logic, by which may be understood the attempt to place
                    logical theory in a more close and living relation to actual scientific method,
                    begins with Bacon and Descartes. To both the scholastic logic presented itself
                    as the essence of a thoroughly false and futile method of knowledge. Neither had
                    the acquaintance with the genuine Aristotelian system requisite in order to
                    distinguish the elements of permanent value from the worthless accretions under
                    which these had been buried, and, as a natural consequence, the views of both
                    have a far closer resemblance to the Aristotelian doctrine than might be
                    imagined from the attitude of opposition common to them. Both thinkers were
                    animated by the spirit of reformation in science, and both emphasize the
                    practical end of all speculation. For both, therefore, logic, which to neither
                    is of high value, appeared to be a species of practical science, a generalized
                    statement of the mode in which intellect acquires new knowledge, in which the
                    mind proceeds from known to unknown.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    logic is, if the expression be permitted, formal; that is to say, the actual

                    and the ultimate constitution of that which is to be known. When this point is
                    reached, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> radical divergence presents itself between the
                    views of Descartes and Bacon, consequent on which appears a radically divergent
                    statement of the main processes and methods of logical theory.</p>
                <p>To Descartes the ideal of cognition is the mathematical, that in which from
                    assured and distinct data we proceed by strict sequence of proof to determine
                    accurately and completely the nature of complex phenomena. Such an ideal,
                    extended so as to embrace knowledge as a whole, dominates the whole of the
                    Cartesian speculation, and, as in the case of the Socratic doctrine of
                    knowledge, is the ground of the Cartesian doubt. Perfect certainty, <hi

                    consecutiyeness of deduction from them, and exhaustive enumeration of
                    details—such are the characteristics of completed knowledge. There follow
                    naturally therefrom the main processes of knowledge <hi rend="italic"

                    enter, and the text-books of the Cartesian school, even the celebrated Port
                    Royal logic, do little more than expound with some freshness such of the older
                    material as seemed capable of harmonizing with the new conception.</p>
                <p>Two things only require note in respect to the Cartesian logic, apart from its
                    freshness and completeness; the one is the obscurity which hangs over the nature
                    of intuition; the other is the step in advance of the scholastic logic effected
                    in the assimilation of deduction to synthesis. As regards the first, the
                    criteria laid down by Descartes, viz., clearness and distinctness, are
                    unsatisfactory and ambiguous. It is evident that he implied under these clear
                    and distinct recognition of <hi rend="italic">necessity</hi> in the data or
                    principles, but the nature of this necessity is never made clear.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His ultimate standard is,

                            for Descartes the fundamental difficulty of his philosophy.</p></note>
                    As regards the second, it was of importance to signalize, as against the
                    scholastic view, that the universal in thought or reasoning was not only of the
                    nature of the class notion, that genera and species were not the ultimate
                    universals, but were themselves secondary products, formed by reasoning, and
                    based upon essential connexion of facts. In this Descartes was but returning to
                    the genuine Aristotelian doctrine, but his view has all the advantage derived
                    from a truer and more scientific conception of what these connexions in nature
                    really are.</p>
                <p>22. What is peculiar in the logic of Bacon springs likewise from the
                    peculiarities of the underlying conception of nature. The inductive method,
                    expounded in the <hi rend="italic">Novum</hi><hi rend="italic">Organum,</hi> is,
                    however, only part of the Baconian logic, and, since it is commonly regarded as
                    being the whole, a brief statement of what Bacon included under logic may here
                    be given.</p>
                <p>Viewing logic as the doctrine which deals with the use and object of the
                    intellectual faculties, Bacon divides it (in this approximating somewhat to the
                    extended division of the Stoic logicians) into (1) the art of inquiry or
                    invention, (2) the art of examination or judgment, (3) the art of memory, and
                    (4) the art of elocution or tradition. The third and fourth divisions are
                    unimportant; the first and second might be called respectively the theory of the
                    acquisition of knowledge and the theory of evidence or proof. The art of inquiry
                    is subdivided into the art of the discovery of arts and the art of the discovery
                    of arguments. The second of these Bacon regards as identical with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Topics</hi> of the Greek and Roman dialectic, and therefore as
                    of comparatively slight value. Of the first there are two main branches :—(A)
                        <hi rend="italic">Experientia</hi><hi rend="italic">Literata</hi> and (B)
                        <hi rend="italic">Interpretatio</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae.</hi> The art
                    of judgment has two subdivisions :—the examination of methods of
                    reasoning—induction and syllogism—which resembles the older analytic; and the
                    examination of errors of reasoning—whether these be sophistical, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the logical fallacies of the older doctrine, or
                    errors of interpretation to be removed by careful criticism of scientific terms,
                    or arising from erroneous tendences of the mind (the doctrine of <hi
                        rend="italic">idola)</hi> —which resembles the older treatment of <hi
                        rend="italic">Elenchi.</hi></p>
                <p>The peculiarity of the Baconian logic, then, must be sought in the processes
                    included under the art of discovering arts or knowledge. Among these the
                    syllogism is not included. It is a process with no practical utility; it
                    involves premisses of which the truth is simply assumed, and consequently its
                    conclusions can have no validity beyond that of the premisses; it affects to
                    determine the particular from the general, but in fact nature is much more
                    subtle than intellect, and our generalizations, which are but partial
                    abstractions, are quite inadequate to afford exhaustive knowledge of the
                    particular; it throws no light upon the essential part of cognition as a process
                    in formation, viz., the method by which we are to obtain accurate notions of
                    things, and judgments based on these notions. Moreover, the deductive or
                    syllogistic procedure favours and encourages the tendency to rash
                    generalization, to the formulation of a universal axiom from few particulars,
                    and to the uncritical acceptance of experience. If syllogism exist at all, there
                    must be a prior process, that of generalizing by rigid and accurate methods from
                    experience itself. Syllogism is not entirely worthless. It is of particular
                    service in some branches of science <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the
                    mathematical), and generally may be employed so soon as the principles of a
                    science are well established; but it is a subordinate and secondary method.</p>
                <p>The art of discovery, then, is the method of generalizing from experience. What
                    this method shall be depends entirely on the thinker’s conception of experience.
                    Now Bacon’s conception is perfectly definite. Observation presents to us complex
                    natures which are the results of simpler, more general forms or causes. From the
                    complex phenomena these forms are to be sifted out by a methodical process of
                    analysis and experiment. A general proposition is one stating the connexion
                    between complex natures and their simple forms or causes; it is, therefore, the
                    result of a graduated process. No doubt there may be generalizations based only
                    on an ingenious comparison of the complex phenomena as they are presented to us;
                    such a process Bacon calls <hi rend="italic">Experientia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Literata,</hi> and the maxims recommended for it much resemble the ordinary
                    methods of experiment, but truly scientific knowledge is only to be obtained by
                    the complete inductive method. The characteristics of this inductive method
                    follow at once from the nature of the object in view. The form which is sought
                    can be detected only by examination of cases in which the given complex effect
                    is present, in which it is absent, and in which it appeal's in different degrees
                    or amounts. By a critical comparison of these cases we may be able to detect,
                    and, were the enumeration exhaustive, we must infallibly detect, by process of
                    exclusion or elimination, a phenomenon constantly present when the effect is
                    present, absent whenever the effect is absent, and varying in degree with the
                    effect. Such a phenomenon would be the <hi rend="italic">form</hi> in
                    question,—the cause of the given fact or attribute. Exhaustive enumeration is,
                    of course, an ideal, and therefore the method of exclusion can never be
                    perfectly carried out, but all additional aids have significance only as
                    supplying in part the place of exhaustive enumeration. We may, on the basis of a
                    wide examination, frame a first generalization <hi rend="italic">(first
                        vintage</hi> as Bacon metaphorically calls it), and proceed to test its
                    correctness by carrying out the critical comparison with it in view. Or we may,
                    under the guidance of our leading principle, take advantage of certain typical
                    cases presented by nature, or force cases by experiment in such a way as to
                    supersede the enumeration. There are <hi rend="italic">prerogative</hi>
                    instances, critical phenomena, helpful in discovery of the cause of a

                    only the titles are given by Bacon, and it would be hazardous to conjecture as

                <p>The Baconian logic, then, or at least what is peculiar to it, is thoroughly
                    conditioned by the peculiarities of the Baconian metaphysic or conception of
                    nature and natural processes. As to the novelty of the logic, this to us does
                    not appear to lie in the mere fact that stress is laid upon induction, nor do we
                    think it correct to assign to Bacon the introduction of the theory of induction
                    as an integral portion of logic. But it consists in the new view taken of rvhat
                    constitutes the universal in thought, a view which may be inadequate, but which
                    colours and affects every process of thought, and therefore every portion of
                    logical theory. It is but a consequence of Bacon’s narrow view of the essence of
                    syllogism that he should set induction in opposition to deduction, and regard
                    syllogism as of service only for communication of knowledge. His inductive
                    methods are throughout syllogistic in this respect, that they like all processes
                    of thought involve the combination of universal and particular. Experience is
                    interpreted, that is to say, viewed under the light of a general idea or
                    notion.</p>

                    received from him no special treatment. His theory of the nature of knowledge
                    offered no explanation of the origin, significance, and validity of the notions

                    argument), but of more importance than these detached and direct portions is the
                    general principle which underlies the whole view of human knowledge. This
                    principle is briefly that of psychological genesis. All the complex tacts of
                    knowledge are regarded as mechanical compounds due to the coherence of simple
                    data, the facts of inner and outer sense. The method of Locke is that which
                    underlies and determines all the logical work of one very important school of
                    logicians.</p>
                <p>It is not needful to enter into details of Locke’s own contributions to the
                    foundation of logic. But it may be pointed out that from his position there were
                    two possible lines of development. In his view the primitive impressions, the
                    facts of inner and outer sense, w’ere in themselves primitive facts of
                    cognition; they were cognitions (it is the very essence of Locke’s method to
                    identify a simple impression of sense with the knowledge of a simple sense
                    fact). The processes of abstraction, comparison, f.e., judging and reasoning,
                    were exercised upon their data, and these products were, in consequence, of a
                    secondary and, so to speak, artificial character. It was natural that a thinker
                    who identified impression of sense with knowledge of a sense fact should
                    maintain that the secondary formations of thought (general ideas, general
                    propositions, syllogism) were not indispensable for cognition; that we could and
                    did reason from particulars to particulars. At the same time Locke admitted the
                    secondary processes as having actual existence, and in one important case (that
                    of the judgment of coexistence, with which may be taken the idea of substance
                    and of real relation) seemed to allow that in judgment something was added to
                    the primitive data. It was possible, then, for development from Locke’s position
                    to proceed either by offering an explanation of the added elements, which should
                    be in stricter harmony with the fundamental doctrine of psychological genesis,
                    or by throwing them entirely out of account ana concentrating attention on the
                    primitive data as the only materials of cognition. The first is the line taken
                    by Hume, which finds its logical completion in Mill; the second is the line
                    taken by Condillac.</p>
                <p>Hume has an easy task so long as he merely subjects Locke’s position to negative
                    criticism; for the added elements, the ideas of substance, relation, cause,
                    &amp;c., are clearly inept and defenceless when the facts to be linked by them
                    are already contemplated as so many completed, isolated cognitions. But where
                    connectedness of cognition is in question, and where some explanation is
                    demanded of the relations which seem to supply the universal rule in thinking,
                    Hume’s task is not so simple, and his final answer that these relations are
                    psychological growths or products of association is neither satisfactory in
                    itself nor quite in keeping with other portions of his doctrine. In Hume,
                    however, we find the first thoroughgoing attempt to construct a theory of
                    knowledge on the basis of psychological empiricism or individualism, and the
                    first contributions to a doctrine of inductive proof as portion of this more
                    comprehensive theory. Briefly, so far as logic is concerned, Hume offers as
                    explanation of the universal in thought association of ideas, but does not treat
                    of logic specially or in detail.</p>
                <p>The complete statement of the theory of knowledge from the psychological point of
                    view is that contained in Mill’s <hi rend="italic">System of Logic.</hi></p>
                <p>The aim of that work is the exposition of the theory of knowledge. Now knowledge,
                    the term being taken in a wide sense, is characterized by one quality mainly,
                    viz., evidentiary force. For every item entering into the sum of our beliefs at
                    any moment, immediate perception being discounted, there may be reasons
                    advanced, adequate or inadequate. The exposition of the relations between
                    beliefs and their evidence or ground is logic, and logic is thus in one sense
                    formal, inasmuch as the relations of evidence and belief are general, not
                    dependent on the special nature of the facts believed, and in another sense
                    real, in that knowledge is conceivable only in strictest relation to the things
                    known.</p>
                <p>Now, the exposition of the general nature of grounds of belief is in fact
                    identical with a theory of the universal element in thought or cognition, and
                    this theory is the essential portion of Mill’s logic. It being assumed that the
                    facts with which knowledge is concerned are minds, bodies, states of
                    consciousness, and the relations (coexistence, sequence, similarity) among these
                    states, and that propositions express, therefore, existence, coexistence,
                    sequence, or resemblance, on what is based any inference going beyond a present
                    perception? The propositions which make up cognition, strictly so calleα, are
                    not mere expressions of momentary states; they are expressions of belief
                    regarding the more or less constant relations of facts. They are, in fact,
                    conclusions. The theory of proposition and of reasoning is one. On what, then,
                    do such conclusions rest?</p>
                <p>The warrant for any conclusion based upon experience, and referring to experience
                    itself, can be found only in experience or in some principle furnished by
                    experience. It may be shown that evidence for a conclusion is adequate, if we
                    can compare this evidence with the kind of evidence on which a wider conclusion,
                    frequently or constantly verified, rests. This comparison of particular evidence
                    with more general evidence is the preliminary answer furnished by Mill. But what
                    is the general evidence referred to, and what is the principle founded on it?
                    The general evidence is the repeated experience of constancy of connexion among
                    groups of phenomena, and the principle founded on it is that of the existence of
                    uniformity or rather of uniformities in nature. The evidence and the principle
                    are purely psychological in character; that is to say, repeated experience,
                    beginning with familiar cases and extending itself as time goes on, produces, by
                    the natural laws of association, an assured belief that phenomena as a whole, or
                    at least in the main, are connected together in constant, uniform, invariable
                    modes. Such a belief, once established, serves as an ultimate criterion of
                    proof, and as an index for research. We proceed in our investigations in the
                    light of this principle, and the tests by which we estimate the validity of
                    evidence for any particular inference as to uniformity are generalized
                    statements deducible from it. So soon as our evidence is of such a character
                    that, in the case before us, either the inference of uniformity is warranted or
                    the general principle must be held not to apply to this particular case, we have
                    proof as cogent as experience can afford.</p>
                <p>The universal in knowledge, then, is this naturally formed assumption regarding
                    the course of nature. The logic of knowledge is the exposition of the modes in
                    which evidence is obtained, of the tests by which its validity is estimated, and
                    of the forms in which evidence and conclusion are connected.</p>
                <p>The characteristic features of the subordinate processes of proof are at once
                    deducible from this fundamental view. For if the simplest form of inference be,
                    psychologically, the transition effected by association from one particular case
                    to another resembling it, and if the essence of proof consist in comparison of
                    the evidence for any one conclusion with the type of evidence for the general
                    assumption regarding nature (or at least a wider portion of nature), it is
                    evident that syllogism, in the ordinary acceptation of the term (in which it
                    implies a concrete general proposition, a particular subsumed thereunder, and a
                    conclusion), is neither a primitive form of inference nor a valid mode of proof.
                    Doubtless we do in reasoning employ general propositions in order to express the
                    determination of some particulars belonging to the same class, but the general
                    proposition is itself a conclusion, resting on evidence of the kind above
                    described, and the essence of syllogistic reasoning is not the subsumption of a
                    particular under a general in which it is included, but the expression of belief
                    that the evidence for the general proposition is adequate to cover all the
                    particular cases, including those which have not been taken into account in
                    formulating it. The major premiss of a syllogism is the record of a previous
                    induction, and the syllogistic process, bringing forward a new case, is a
                    valuable method tor testing the adequacy of the previous generalization. As to
                    generalization itself, the basis is evidently to be sought in experience,
                    apprehended by observation and experiment. Did experience present to us isolated
                    phenomena, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> phenomena so arranged that enumeration
                    of the elementary constituents, whether antecedents or consequents, were
                    possible, then our inductive procedure must be regulated by those canons or
                    axioms which express the kind of evidence already referred to as establishing
                    uniformity. These canons or axioms, however, are, like the Baconian method of
                    exclusion, tests for an ideally perfect experience, and they, therefore, only
                    lie in the background of actual scientific procedure, which has to employ other
                    processes, both of inference and of proof. For, if we can in no way obtain more
                    than a knowledge of the coexistence of facts, we are unable to bring our
                    evidence into conformity with the inductive canons, save in the ideal instance
                    in which absolutely exhaustive experience both of positive and negative cases is
                    possible. Inferences as to law or uniformity of coexistence must here be based
                    on numerical calculation of probability, and the conclusions present themselves
                    in the peculiar numerical form appropriate to propositions of probability.
                    Further, if the phenomena under investigation be complex, so that the canons of
                    neither observation nor experiment are immediately applicable, the process of
                    investigation must of necessity be the combined method of analysis and
                    synthesis: analysis, aided by hypothetical conjecture, formulating such general
                    laws of elementary factors as are known or presumed to exist in the case in
                    question; synthesis, combining these laws and calculating with greater or less
                    numerical exactness, according to the nature of the matter, the probable
                    combined effect,—the whole tested by critical comparison of the calculated
                    result with the actual phenomena. Here, as one can see, syllogistic procedure
                    appears in its true scientific aspect as the form of thought by which we pass
                    from the simple to the more complex, from the elementary essence or cause to the
                    complex accident or effect. The elementary causes, no doubt, have no more cogent
                    evidence than that which can be afforded by experience viewed in the light of
                    our psychological assumption of uniformities; nevertheless the whole procedure
                    of scientific investigation is recognized as being essentially of the type
                    sketched in somewhat imperfect outline by Aristotle.</p>
                <p>So far, then, as the logic of Mill is concerned, and apart from the undeniable
                    richness and completeness of knowledge with which the various processes are
                    treated, we note but one fundamentally new feature, namely, the explanation
                    offered of the universal element <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n817/mode/1up"

                    into cognitions, through which alone reasoned knowledge is possible. It is the
                    only explanation possible on the basis of psychological individualism; its
                    value, and therefore the value of the systematic deductions from it, must depend
                    on the accuracy and coherence of the psychological or metaphysical theory on
                    which it is founded.</p>
                <p>24. It was possible, however, to proceed by another route from the position taken
                    up by Locke. If it be held that the elementary impressions, mechanically
                    regarded as somehow arising in mind, are in themselves cognitions, then it is
                    possible to view them as containing in themselves all possible cognition. In
                    other words, we may confusedly identify the proposition that knowledge does not
                    extend beyond the field of experience with the very different proposition that
                    the only items of knowledge are the isolated impressions which appear to make up
                    experience. If this identification be accepted (and the conception involved is
                    precisely that underlying all consistent nominalism from Antisthenes downwards),
                    then the only processes requiring to be taken into account are those whereby
                    clearness and distinctness are introduced into our (possibly) vague perceptions.
                    For these processes analysis is an adequate title. All knowledge, t.e., whatever
                    is characterized by clearness, definiteness, consequence, is the analysis of
                    what is given in isolated perceptions. Each perception is itself and is only
                    itself; no judgment is possible save that of identity. In other words, if there
                    be judgment at all, it can consist only in the assertion that, the unanalysed
                    perception is identical with that into which it is analysed, and as each
                    perception and each analytic portion of a perception may be signified by an
                    arbitrary sign (name or other hieroglyphic), judgment is essentially an affair
                    of naming, a declaration that different names are identical or belong to the
                    same perception. Reasoning is simply the transition from one identity to
                    another, —a more developed result of analysis. Scientific or real knowledge is
                    an accurately framed system of signs, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a collocation
                    of signs which expresses precisely the results of the analysis of complex
                    perceptions. Logic, under this doctrine of knowledge, is merely a statement of
                    the various modes in which analysis is carried out, of the ways in which names
                    are applied, and of the forms in which names are combined. Such is the theory of
                    logic presented by Condillac.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    formalism, which if carried out consistently must needs assume the aspect of a
                    numerical or mechanical system of computation.<note anchored="true"

                    remarkable that a very similar result was reached by Leibnitz, a thinker who
                    proceeded from a quite opposed psychological conception. The similarity is due
                    to the presence in both theories of a certain abstract principle, intimately
                    though not necessarily connected with the respective psychologies. In place of
                    the single perception which in Condillac’s logic is the element to be analysed,
                    there appears in Leibnitz’s view the single consciousness of the monad (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Leibnitz,</hi> t&gt;. 424); in both cases, however,
                    knowledge is assumed to exist there implicitly and to stand in need only of
                    evolution. The methods by which this evolution is to proceed form for Leibnitz
                    the substance of a new and all-comprehensive science, “Scientia Generalis,” of
                    which the older logic is but a part.</p>
                <p>The characteristics of Scientia Generalis are at once deducible from the two
                    general principles which in Leibnitz’s view dominate all our thinking,—the law
                    of sufficient reason and the law of noncontradiction. It must contain a complete
                    account of the modes in which from data conclusions are drawn, and in which from
                    given facts data are inferred, and since the only logical relations are those of
                    identity and non-contradiction, the forms of inference from or to data must be
                    the general modes of combination of simple elementary facts which are possible
                    under the law of non-contradiction. The statement of tne data of any logical
                    problem, and the description of the processes involved in combining them or in
                    arriving at them, are much assisted by, if not dependent on, the employment of a
                    general <hi rend="italic">characteristic</hi> or symbolic art.</p>
                <p>The fundamental divisions then of Scientia Generalis, so far at least as its
                    groundwork are concerned (for Leibnitz sometimes includes under the one head all
                    possible applications of the theory), are (1) the synthetical or combinatorial
                    art, the theory of the processes by which from given facts complex results may
                    be obtained (of these processes, which make up general <hi rend="italic"
                        >mathesis,</hi> syllogistic and mathematical demonstration are special
                    varieties); (2) the analytic oι i egressive art, which starting from a complex
                    fact endeavours to attain knowledge of the data from whose combination it
                        arose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Leibnitz
                            sometimes includes these two under the head of “Ars Inveniendi," and

                            Judicandi,” a division resembling that appearing in Bacon; but the “Ars
                            Judicandi” may be tlιrown out of account.</p></note></p>
                <p>Of the nature of the second portion only a few brief indications are contained in
                    the logical tracts and in detached utterances in the larger works of Leibnitz.
                    When complex combinations are presented, or, in the most general form, when the
                    investigation has to start from experience, from truths of fact, the work of
                    analysis is endless; the regress to conditions is practically infinite.
                    Determination of the necessary data cannot in such a case possess more than
                    probable value, but the probabilities may be estimated according to the rules
                    laid down in the progressive or synthetic art.<note anchored="true"

                    of combination, (4) the employment of a definite set of symbols, both of data
                    and of modes of combination, subject to symbolic laws arising from the laws
                    under which combination is possible. In the <hi rend="italic">Fundamenta

                    is effected towards filling up the first, second, and fourth of these rubrics,
                    but in no case is the treatment exhaustive. The simple data, called characters
                    or formulae, are symbolized by letters, relations of data by a somewhat
                    complicated and varying system of algebraic signs; for the calculus, or set of
                    operations exercised upon relations given so as to produce new formulae, no
                    comprehensive system of symbols is adopted. Formulae, relations, and operations
                    take the place of notions, judgments, and syllogism. The general laws of
                    combination of data are stated without much precision. Leibnitz recognizes the
                    law of substitution, notes also what have been called the laws of reduplication
                    and commutativeness, but, in actual realization of his method, employs
                    indifferently the relation of containing and contained or the relation of
                    identical substitution (aequipollence). No attempt is made to develop a complete
                    scheme of possible modes of combination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>It is interesting to note that Leibnitz signalizes the
                            distinction between the logical and mathematical senses of a whole, and
                            between the distributive and the collective meaning of quantity; that he
                            emphasizes the function of the particular judgment as the negation of
                            its opposed universal; and that he approximales to some modem modes of
                            formulating the judgment <hi rend="italic">(a</hi> is <hi rend="italic"

                <p>At the root of Leibnitz’s universal calculus, as of Condillac’s method of
                    analysis, and generally of nominalist logic, there lies a peculiar acceptation
                    of the abstract law of identity. That a thing is what it is,—that knowledge of a
                    thing is a single, indivisible, mechanical fact, susceptible only of explication
                    or of expanded statement,—this is the principle dominating logical theories
                    which in other respects may differ widely. Insistance upon this aspect of
                    knowledge or of the object known is the ground for assigning to thought a
                    function purely analytic, which is the very keynote of nominalism. It is not
                    hard to see, however, that so to view the law of identity is to abstract from
                    all the conditions of actual thinking and knowing, and to throw into the assumed
                    simple fact all the complexity which is afterwards to be discovered in it by
                    analysis. The knowledge of a thing is not to be explained in this abstract or
                    mechanical fashion. Truth does not consist in the empty recognition that <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> is <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and in the repetition of
                    this unimportant fact, but in the knowledge of the nature of <hi rend="italic"
                        >a,</hi> a knowledge which essentially consists in relating <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> to its intellectual conditions, in assigning to it a
                    place in the intelligible world. The identity of the tiling with itself is a
                    mere aspect of the complex process whereby the thing is cognized. It hardly
                    requires to be pointed out that the minor forms of the same fundamental view,
                    the various attempts to express the essence of a judgment as the assertion of
                    identity, are open to the same objection. They take an abstract view of the
                    judgment, and regard as the essential fact that which is but an accessory or
                    adjunct or consequence. Difference, to put it in the briefest fashion, is no
                    less essential to a judgment than identity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Much of the confusion which reigns supreme in many modem
                            works on logic is doubtless attributable to a confusion between the
                            nature of the judgment and the result of a judgment. The result of a
                            judgment is always an increased richness of the subject notion; the
                            subject unqualified and the subject qualified by the predicate are
                            doubtless identical; but it would be absurd to say, therefore, that the
                            function of the judgment is the assertion of this
                    identity.</p></note></p>
                <p>26. The view of logic put forward by Herbart, from a metaphysico-psychological
                    basis resembling that of Leibnitz, agrees in so many respects with that of
                    Leibnitz, although containing no reference to the idea of a logical calculus,
                    that it may be placed under the same head. Logic, according to Herbart, is a
                    purely formal doctrine; it has to do only with the modes by which clearness,
                    distinctness, and system are introduced among our ideas. Logical forms, then,
                    the notion, judgment, and syllogism, are not to be regarded as having any
                    metaphysical reference; they are not even to be explained psychologically; they
                    stand on their own footing as explanatory processes exercised about the
                    representations which under their own natural laws fill up consciousness, coming
                    and going within the <pb break="no"

                    view the whole province of knowledge is excluded from logic, and it is assumed
                    that knowledge is somehow given, mechanically, without the co-operation of
                    processes, if not identical with, yet strongly resembling, those recognized as
                    logical. Herbart does not succeed in vindicating an independent place for a
                    purely formal logic.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Kantian Logic.</hi></p>
                <p>27. The critical method, which has so influenced general philosophy that all
                    later speculation refers more or less directly to it, has at the same time
                    profoundly modified all later conceptions of the sphere and method of logic.
                    From the Kantian philosophy there spring directly the three most important
                    modern doctrines of logical theory, —that which, with many variations in detail,
                    regards logic as a purely formal science, the science of the laws of thought or
                    of the laws under which thought as such operates, and of the forms into which
                    thought as such develops; that which, likewise with many variations, unites
                    logical doctrines with a more general theory of knowledge; and finally that
                    which identifies both logic in the narrower sense and theory of knowledge with
                    an all-comprehensive metaphysic.</p>
                <p>It is matter of history that the critical system was developed mainly from the
                    basis of the Leibnitzian logical and metaphysical theories, and it is likewise
                    matter of history that Kant, even in the speculative work which was to so large
                    an extent antagonistic to these theories, remained under the influence of some
                    of their cardinal positions.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Sec article <hi rend="smallcaps">Kant,</hi> vol. xiii.
                            pp. 849, 852.</p></note> In particular the view of logical thought as
                    purely discursive, analytic in character, a view never by Kant harmonized with
                    his general system, is a relic, most significant for the development of his
                    logic, from the Wolffian reproduction of Leibnitz’s philosophy. This historic
                    basis is not to be lost sight of in attempting to acquire a clear idea of the
                    special place and function assigned by Kant to logical theory.</p>
                <p>But a brief reference to the general result of the critical philosophy will
                    suffice to introduce the more special treatment of the Kantian logic. Knowledge,
                    or real cognition, which is analysed in the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi> in
                    reference to its origin and validity, appears, when subjectively regarded, as a
                    compound of intuition and thought, of sense and understanding. The isolated data
                    of sense experience do not in themselves form parts of cognition, but are only
                    cognized when related to the unity of the conscious subject, when the subject,
                    as it may be put, has consciousness of them. This reflex act, resembling in some
                    respects Leibnitz’s apperception, or process of uniting in consciousness, is an
                    act <hi rend="italic">sui generis,</hi> not to be mechanically conceived or
                    explained. Only through its means do representations become cognitions. The
                    forms in which the synthetic act of understanding is carried out are, as opposed
                    to the intuitive data on which they are exercised, discursive or logical in
                    character. Essentially they are judgments: all acts of understanding are
                    judgments, and, as judgments, they imply a general element with which the
                    particular of sense is combined, and in the light of which the particular
                    becomes intelligible. In ultimate analysis it appears that no particular,
                    whatever be its empirical character, can become an intelligible fact, save when
                    determined through some specific act of understanding, through combination with
                    some specific notion or general element. Combination of particular and general
                    is thus the very essence of understanding, the mark of knowledge as such. In
                    every item of cognition the same elements may be discerned as necessarily
                    present. The consideration of the ultimate modes of intellectualization, of the
                    series of acts by which understanding subsumes the particular, draws the
                    particular into the unity of cognition, may be called in a large sense logic. If
                    the consideration be specially directed to the mode in which, by means of this
                    combination, knowledge arises, and therefore include discussion of the wide
                    problem regarding the relation between understanding and objectivity in general
                    (the matter of knowledge taken generally), the special title transcendental
                    logic may be used. But if, concentrating attention solely on the kind of
                    operation implied in understanding, we endeavour to lay out fully the modes in
                    which understanding proceeds in the construction of knowledge, making
                    abstraction of all inquiries regarding the origin, worth, significance of
                    knowledge itself, the consideration is of a more general character, and may
                    receive the title of general logic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The understanding, then, like everything else, works according to laws, the laws
                    of its own nature. If we abstract from all that may characterize the matter
                    considered, and take into account solely the laws according to which
                    understanding must act, we may construct a purely formal doctrine, a theory
                    which is rational both in matter and in form, for the matter consists of the
                    laws of reason, and the form is prescribed by the very nature of reason,—a
                    demonstrative theory, for nothing can enter therein which cannot be shown to
                    have its ground in reason,—a completed theory, for although the matter of
                    thought is infinite and infinitely varied, the modes in which the understanding
                    must operate if unity of cognition is to result, are finite and capable of
                    exhaustive statement, —and a theory developed from its own basis, standing in no
                    need of psychology or metaphysics, but deducible from the mere idea of
                    understanding as that which introduces unity into representations, whether given
                    (empirical) or <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> (pure).</p>
                <p>Were this the only determination of the province of logic given by Kant, the
                    question which at once arises as to the possibility of any such independent
                    doctrine would receive an easy solution. For it is evident that logic, as a
                    theory of the form of thought, could consist only of a portion of the more
                    general doctrine, by whatever title that be known, in which the nature of
                    understanding as synthetic activity is unfolded. The distinction on which Kant
                    lays stress between matter and form, a distinction employed by all subsequent
                    writers of his school, is ambiguous and misleading. If by matter be meant the
                    particular characteristics of the things thought about, in which sense we might
                    speak of judgments of physical, chemical, grammatical matter, and so on, then to
                    say that logic does not take this into account is perfectly inept. If logic be a
                    philosophic discipline at all, a theory in any way concerned with thinking, it
                    is at once evident that it can in no way deal with the specialities of any
                    particular science. But this distinction between matter and form is by no means
                    identical with another, lying in the background, and too frequently confused
                    with the first,—the distinction of understanding as a faculty <hi rend="italic"
                        >per se</hi> with its own laws, deducible from its mere notion, and
                    understanding as the concrete real act of thinking. What Kant calls the mere
                    idea of understanding, and what in other writers of his school appears as a
                    definition of thought, is really nothing but a reference to what has presented
                    itself in the wider inquiries of the <hi rend="italic">Kritik</hi> as the
                    complex nature of the synthetic activity of understanding. Kant himself never
                    attempts to deduce from the notion of understanding the varied characteristics
                    of logical forms, and his followers,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    Hamilton,—when they are consistent, start from concepts as expressing the bare
                    notion of thought, and regard all other forms of thought as combinations of
                    concepts.</p>
                <p>But Kant does introduce another element into his treatment of the province of
                    logic, one not original to him, but of the utmost importance for later
                    developments from his point of view. He inquires- what kind of relations among
                    the elements of thought can form the matter of logical treatment, and defines
                    these as two in number— (1) formal consequence, (2) non-contradictoriness. By
                    formal consequence we are to understand the relation between a conclusion and
                    its premisses, no inquiry being raised as to the truth or validity of the
                    premisses. By non-contradictoriness we are to understand that, logically,
                    notions, judgments, or reasonings can be subjected to treatment only in regard
                    to the absence of explicit contradiction among the factors entering into them.
                    Thought, which introduces unity and system into experience, must certainly
                    introduce formal consequence and preserve analytic truth or correctness. Formal
                    logic, then, treats only of these formal qualities of all products of
                        thought,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Two at

                            Mansel recognizing the distinction between the two modes of determining
                            foιτnal logic, adopts the second, and is therefore led, in consistency,
                            to define logic, not as the science of the laws and forms of thought,
                            but as the science treating of formal thought, or of the formal element
                            in the forms of thought. In other words, he recognizes that the
                            statement of the forms of thought must be introduced into logic <hi
                                rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra,</hi> from psychology
                            or what not, and that logic, accepting these, has to consider the formal
                            element (non-contradictoriness) in them. It is well to have the doctrine
                            brought thus to its ultimate issue, for it is thence apparent that there
                            is no independent science called logic, but simply one comprehensive
                            precept, which may be called logical, viz., avoid contradictoriness in
                            thought. Illustrations of the ways in which contradictoriness manifests
                            itself may be offered, and a useful logical praxis may thus be afforded,
                            but these do not make up a science or theory.</p></note><hi

                <p>The detailed treatment of logic, so far as that can be gathered from the very
                    brief summary <hi rend="italic">{Logik, Werke,</hi> iii. 269-340), shows with
                    the utmost clearness how impossible it was for Kant to deduce the forms and
                    relations of thought from the mere notion of understanding, even when coupled
                    with the principles of formal consistency and consequence. Assuming that
                    understanding is the discursive faculty, the faculty of cognizing the many
                    particulars through the one concept or notion, Kant deals first with concepts
                    (Begriffe) as general or discursive representations. He is careful to avoid an
                    error into which many of his followers have fallen, that of regarding Begriffe
                    in a mechanical fashion as a specific kind of Vorstellung, distinguished only by
                    containing a few of the marks making up the single intuitions. He rightly notes
                    that cognition proceeds by subsuming the particulars under the common element
                    contained in them, and that the generality of the concept thus rests upon the
                    relation in which it stands, as reflective ground of cognition, to the
                    particulars. The characteristics of concepts, as possessing extent and content,
                    are treated briefly, after the fashion familiar in the more detailed logics of
                    his school. It is, however, when the doctrine of judgment is reached that the
                    difficulties of his position appear with greatest distinctness. Judgment is
                    defined “as the representation of unity in the consciousness of distinct
                    representations, or the representation of the relation of <pb break="no"

                                rend="italic">Logii,</hi> § 17.</p></note> But the essential element
                    in the definition—the unity of consciousness or unification of differences in a
                    notion—is thus left so vague and undetermined that it is impossible to deduce
                    from it any classification or any peculiarities of judgments, and possible
                    indeed to proceed on two quite distinct lines of research. The expression,
                    indeed, refers to that which is the fundamental fact in the critical system, the
                    existence of conditions under which only it is possible for detached data of
                    experience to become objects of knowledge for the single conscious subject; and,
                    had Kant been true to the principles of his system, it would then have been
                    necessary to base any classification and treatment of judgment on the
                    enumeration of the functions of unity in conscious experience. In the <hi

                    emphasis is laid upon the function of unity as the essence of the judgment, but
                    it is a well-known historic fact that Kant makes no attempt to justify in its
                    details the enumeration of such functions on which his divisions rest. His

                            here be remarked that Hamilton’s mode of translating the relative

                            authorities for the details of the Kantian logic, clearly shows that he
                            did not attach any special significance to the phrase, unity of
                            consciousness. In his view, the unity implied in the judgment A is B was
                            the union of A and B in the notion of a given totality or whole—A being
                            part of B in one aspect, B being part of A in another. This relation of
                            whole and part is quite un-Kantian. <hi rend="superscript"> r
                        h</hi></p></note> There is here involved a twofold error, which has
                    exercised a most pernicious influence on the fortunes of logical theory. For, in
                    the first place, so to view judgment is implicitly to proceed from the
                    assumption of notions as given elements of knowledge, the relations of which are
                    to be discovered by comparison or analysis of what is contained in them. The
                    notion as empirically given thus becomes the fundamental fact; all other forms
                    of thought, judgment, and syllogism are regarded as merely the mechanism by
                    which the content of notions is evolved. Such a doctrine puts out of sight the
                    peculiarities of the notion as the product of thought only, inevitably compels a
                    distinction between what we may call the real processes of thinking whereby
                    notions are formed and the elaborative processes by which notions when formed
                    may be treated, and, by regarding notions as simplest data, leads back to the
                    old nominalist doctrine according to which all thinking is but the compounding
                    and separating of simple elements.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the underlying prejudice, which it was the very business of the critical system
                    to destroy, the attempt to treat knowledge, and thought, which is an integral
                    part of knowledge, in a purely mechanical fashion. The Kantian analysis for the
                    first time in the history of philosophy brought into clear light the essential
                    peculiarity of knowledge, the reference of all the manifold details of
                    experience to the unity of the thinking subject. Such reference, and the modes
                    in which it expresses itself, are not to be conceived, mechanically, nor can we
                    regard the products of thought, the notion, judgment, and reasoning, in the same
                    fashion in which, with but partial success, we treat, in psychology, the
                    representations or reproductions in idea of actual fact. The essence of thought,
                    the unity in difference of objects known and subject cognizing, is that which
                    constitutes in its several modes the peculiarity of notions, judgments, and
                    reasonings. The notion is simply the work of thought, looked at, if the
                    expression be allowed, statically. There is no single psychical product, to be
                    treated by the method of observation which is applied in psychology to
                    sensations and ideas, which can be called the notion. Mental facts, which
                    rightly or wrongly psychology deals with after its mechanical fashion, present
                    themselves in a new aspect when they are regarded as parts, or rather as organic
                    elements, in cognition. If we endeavour to apply the abstracting, isolating
                    method of observation <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">extra</hi> to
                    them, doubtless only mechanical, abstract, and external relations will manifest
                    themselves as obtaining among them, and there may thus be deduced a mass of
                    abstract formulae expressing relations of agreement and disagreement, total or
                    partial coincidence, confliction, intersection, or coexistence and sequence,
                    which have abstract truth, but are in no way adequate to express the genuine
                    nature of thought.</p>
                <p>Kant himself proceeds, as was said, by simply assuming, as somehow given, the
                    cardinal forms of unity in consciousness, and, distinguishing form of judgment
                    from matter by the apparently simple difference between matters united and form
                    of uniting, draws out the types of judgment under the familiar rubrics of
                    quality, quantity, relation, and modality. The same assumption of distinctions
                    only to be given by the higher researches of transcendental logic is manifested
                    in his treatment of reasoning, the deduction of one judgment from others. Three
                    main types of such deduction are signalized (1) deductions of the understanding,
                    in which the conclusion follows simply from change in the form of the given
                    judgment; (2) deductions of reason, in which the necessity of the deduced
                    proposition is shown by reference to a general rule under which it falls; (3)
                    deductions of judgment, in which the conclusion is reached by the treatment of
                    given experience in reference to a general rule of reflexion upon experience.
                    Under the first of these fall the familiar forms of immediate inference; under
                    the second, syllogism in its three varieties, categorical, hypothetical, and
                    disjunctive; under the third, inductive and analogical reasoning. The
                    understanding, if one may interpret Kant freely, is the process by which the
                    worth of what is given is fixed and determined; it moves not beyond the given
                    fact, and can therefore subject the fact to no other than formal transformation.
                    The determining judgment or reason is the expression of the fundamental fact in
                    knowledge that all experience is subject to general rules or conditions; there
                    must therefore be a determination of the particular by the general; there must
                    be ground for subsuming the particular and the universal. The forms of such
                    subsumption and determination of the particular by the general are syllogisms.
                    Syllogism therefore is the mode in which the essence of cognition is made
                    explicit. The reflective judgment is the expression of the tendency to treat the
                    contingent details of this or that given experience after the analogy of the
                    general rule that all experience is subject to intellectual determinations. This
                    analogy does not necessitate the specific determination of the particular by any
                    specific universal, but serves as general directrix in experiential researches.
                    It is sufficiently evident that a remodelling of the older logical doctrine such
                    as this rests upon a wider and more comprehensive philosophical view of
                    knowledge as a whole, that such distinctions cannot flow from either of the
                    principles previously indicated as those on which the formal conception of logic
                    rested, and, finally, that the logical aspect of these distinctions is formal in
                    the only true sense of that word, viz., in that the treatment is of necessity
                    general, applicable to all or any thinking.</p>
                <p>28. As in the Kantian system there were placed, side by side, two diverse
                    conceptions of logical system, that of transcendental logic, and that of formal
                    logic, without any adequate link of connexion between them, so from the Kantian
                    position there diverged two quite distinct schools of logic, the transcendental
                    or metaphysical, and the formal. As regards the second of these, but little
                    requires to be said. The great body of logical treatises written from the
                    Kantian formal point of view contain nothing of interest. In them the
                    traditional logic is handled under the rubrics supplied by the Kantian general
                    philosophy, with more or less of purifications from needless detail, according
                    to the acuteness or insight of the writers, with more or less of deviation from
                    the Kantian lines. In but few cases did the real difficulty, that of assigning
                    to formal logic an independent plan and method, lead to a radically fresh
                        treatment.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Generally, the formal logician is compelled simply to take the
                            processes of thought as determined in psychology or metaphysics or what
                            not, and to consider certain aspects of them. His science has,
                            therefore, no independent place, and no method of development.
                            Independence may be striven after, either by attempting to develop all
                            processes of thought and their logical peculiarities from an initial
                            definition of thought solely, or by combining with this definition the
                            view that non-contradictoriness is the one logical quality, and thus
                            assigning to logic the discussion of the conditions of non-contradiction
                            In thought. Of the first, Hamilton may be taken as the type; of the

                <p>The Kantian transcendental logic, being an analysis of the conditions under which
                    objectivity in general becomes possible material for cognition, is in a special
                    sense a new theory of thought. For thoughtis the process mediating the unity of
                    the ego and the multifarious detail of actual experience; and only through
                    thought, the universal, are objects so determined that they are possible matters
                    of knowledge for a conscious subject. As determinations of objects, the pure
                    elements of thought may be called notions, while the realization of notions in
                    conscious experience is the judgment, wherein the universal of thought and the
                    particular of sense are synthetically united, and the systematization of
                    experience is the syllogism. Notion, judgment, and syllogism are thus, in the
                    transcendental logic, no bare, abstract forms, but have as their content the
                    pure determinations of objectivity in general. They cannot be conceived
                    mechanically, as mere products differing only in degree of generality and
                    abstractness from the ideas, and connexions of association which appear as due
                    merely to the psychological mechanism of the human consciousness. They are the
                    essential forms of the ultimate synthesis through which knowledge becomes
                    possible, and thus express in their organic system the very nature of thought,
                        <hi rend="italic">i e.,</hi> of the thinking subject. In the Kantian
                    doctrine, however, as it developed itself historically, there are various points
                    of view which disturb the harmony of the system as thus sketched. Two in
                    particular require special notice, as from these the later attempts at a
                    complete revision of logical theory have taken their origin. (1) <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0820-0797"/> Throughout the Kantian work there appears a
                    constant tendency to regard the ego, or central unity of self-consciousness, as
                    merely abstract, as related mechanically, not organically, to the complex of
                    experience in which its inner nature is unfolded. This tendency finds expression
                    in various ways. Thus the synthesis, which has been shown to be the essential
                    feature of cognition, is regarded as on its subjective side a union of
                    intellectual function and receptivity of sense, and the contributions from
                    either side are viewed as somehow complete in themselves.<note anchored="true"

                    Knowledge, in accordance with this, might be considered to be the mechanical
                    result of the combination or coherence of the two, a combination which in the
                    last resort must appear to the conscious subject as contingent or accidental.
                    (2) Knowledge, the systematic union of universal and particular in experience,
                    is thought as containing in some obscure fashion a reference to the most real
                    world, the realm of things in themselves, and therefore as being, in antithesis
                    thereto, strictly subjective. The processes of thought, by which unity is given
                    to experience, thus manifest themselves as limited in scope, and as being the
                    very ground or reason of the restriction of knowledge to phenomenal in
                    opposition to noumenal reality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>It is unnecessary to consider what exactly was Kant’s
                            teaching on either of these points, or what the significance of the
                            relative doctrine may be in ills system. It is sufficient, for the
                            historical purpose in hand, to indicate the apparent tendency of his
                            work, for from this the later developments take their
                    rise.</p></note></p>
                <p>The presence of these two difficulties or perplexities in the Kantian system,
                    which are, indeed, at bottom but one, led to revision of transcendental logic in
                    two directions. The one line proceeded from the analysis of knowledge as the
                    product of intellectual function and receptivity, and, uniting therewith
                    metaphysical conceptions of varied kinds, culminated in a doctrine of cognition
                    which, retaining the distinction between real and ideal as ultimate, endeavoured
                    to show that the forms of the ideal, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of thought,
                    and the forms of reality were parallel. Logic, under this new conception,
                    appeared as a comprehensive theory of knowledge, the systematic treatment of the
                    modes in which thought, conditioned by its own nature and by the nature of the
                    reality upon which it is exercised, develops into knowledge, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> of the modes in which a representation of things characterized
                    by universality and evidential force is obtained. On the whole this is the
                    position assigned to logic by Schleiermacher, whose view is followed in
                    essentials, though with many variations in detail, by a large and important
                    school of logical writers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>See, for an enumeration of the more prominent members, Ueberweg’s
                                <hi rend="italic">Logik,</hi> § 34, a work which itself is an
                            admirable exposition from the same point of view.</p></note></p>
                <p>The second direction may be characterized generally as the attempt to develop
                    fully what is involved in Kant’s conception of thought as the essential factor
                    of cognition. Any opposition between metaphysic as dealing with the real and
                    logic as dealing with the ideal element in knowledge appears, in this view, as a
                    mere effort of false abstraction. The very nature of reality is its nature in
                    and for thought. The system of pure determinations of objectivity, which Kant
                    had imperfectly sketched, is not to be regarded as a piece of subjective
                    machinery, because it expresses the inmost conditions of intelligence as such.
                    Nothing is more real than the ego, than intelligence or thought. Transcendental
                    logic, or logic which is at the same time metaphysic, is the only discipline to
                    which the title logic by right belongs. For it contains the complete system of
                    the forms in and through which intelligence is realized. The notion, judgment,
                    and syllogism are doubtless forms of thought, but they have their definite
                    content. They are the modes in which the forms of objectivity are realized for
                    intelligence, and are thus at once abstract and concrete. The so-called formal
                    logic is a mere <hi rend="italic">caput</hi><hi rend="italic">mortuum,</hi> a
                    descriptive study of some few types of the application of thought to matters of
                    experience. On the whole this is the view of logic developed through Fichte (and
                    in part Schelling) by Hegel, ana the Hegelian system shall here be regarded as
                    its complete and only representative.</p>

                <p>29. The position assigned to logic as theory of knowledge and the range of
                    problems included in it are determined by the general philosophic view of the
                    distinction between the reality to be apprehended by thought and the subjective
                    nature of thought itself. There may be, therefore, numberless variations in the
                    mode of treating logic with general adherence to the one point of view.<note

                            historic error to identify the point of view here referred to with the
                            Aristotelian. The notion of a parallelism between the forms of reality
                            and the forms of knowledge is too definite to be covered by the mere
                            expression, whether in Aristotle or in Plato, of the doctrine that
                            knowledge is knowledge of being.</p></note> In the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dialektik</hi> of Schleiermacher, for example, the fundamental
                    characteristic is the attempt to unite some portions of the Kantian analysis of
                    cognition with Spinozistic metaphysic. Knowledge is regarded as the complex
                    combination of intellect, the formative, unifying, idealizing faculty, and
                    organization or receptivity of sense. The generality or common validity of
                    cognition rests on the uniform nature of organization and on the identity of all
                    ideas in the one ideal system. The objective worth of cognition is referred on
                    the one hand to the determined connexion between the real universe and the
                    organization through which the individual is part of the real order of things,
                    on the other hand to the ultimate metaphysical J parallelism between the system
                    of ideas and reality. The primary orms of knowledge, notion, and judgment,
                    distinct from one another only as being knowledge viewed now as stable now as in
                    process, correspond to the ultimate elements of the real, the permanent force or
                    substance and its variable manifestations. Syllogism and induction, with the
                    subordinate processes of definition and division, analysis and synthesis, are
                    technical modes of the development of notions and judgments, modes by which
                    inchoate notions are rendered definite, by which incomplete judgments are
                    rendered complete.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Perhaps the most complete treatment of logic from this point of view
                            is that of George, <hi rend="italic">Logik als Wissenschaftslehre,</hi>
                            1868. Ueberweg, dissenting from Schleiermacher’s view of syllogism and
                            the systematic processes of reasoning, lays out more fully what in his
                            view are the aspects of reality corresponding to the typical forms of
                            knowledge. Trendelenburg endeavours to fill up the gap between real and
                            ideal by emphasizing the community of character between motion, as the
                            ultimate reality, and constructiveness in knowledge, the central
                            activity of the ideal.</p></note> ®</p>
                <p>That there is much valuable and suggestive material in this mode of regarding
                    logic is undoubted, and in the discussion of isolated forms of knowledge, such
                    as judgment, it is always desirable that there should be kept in mind the
                    reference to the ultimate character of objectivity. But the whole point of view
                    seems imperfect and open to such objections as will always present themselves
                    when a principle is not carried out to its full extent. It may, for propaedeutic
                    purposes, be desirable to separate the handling of logical forms from
                    metaphysic, but such separation cannot be ultimate. The system of forms of
                    reality to which the forms of knowledge are assumed to correspond must in some
                    way enter into knowledge, and they cannot enter in as an absolutely foreign
                    ingredient, to which knowledge has simply to conform itself. For, if so, these
                    metaphysical categories would be discoverable only by an analysis of’ concrete
                    knowledge, and they would remain as inferences from the nature of cognition, not
                    as data directly known. The cardinal difficulty which appears in all treatments
                    of logic from this point of view is that of explaining how there comes to be
                    known an objective system of things with characteristic forms or aspects, and it
                    is not hard to see that the acceptance of a reality so formed is but a relic of
                    the pernicious abstraction which gave rise to the Kantian severance of knowledge
                    from noumenal reality.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Thus we find in Schleiermacher <hi rend="italic">(.Dial.,</hi> §§
                            132-34) that the ultimate difference of ideal and real is accepted as
                            simple datum. In Ueberweg <hi rend="italic">(Logik,</hi> § 8 and <hi
                                rend="italic">passim)</hi> there is continuous reference to an inner
                            order of things, the forms of which are the metaphysical categories, but
                            the actual treatment is altogether independent of these forms, and we
                            may conjecture that, in the last resort, Ueberweg would have explained
                            the characterisι ics of logical thinking by reference rather to the
                            psychological mechanism than to a supposed nature of things (see <hi

                    In short the position taken by Schleiermacher and his school, as final standing
                    ground, is but an intermediate stage in the development of that which lay
                    implicit in the critical philosophy.</p>

                    fall back into that mechanical view of knowledge from which Kant had endeavoured
                    to free philosophy. If there be assumed the severance between real and ideal, it
                    is hardly possible to avoid deduction of all that is characteristic of the ideal
                    order from the observed or conjectured psychological peculiarities of inner
                    experience. The real appears only as ultimate point of reference, but in no
                    other way determines the form of knowledge. The characteristic relations which
                    give content to notions, judgments, and syllogisms are deduced

                            note a precis ly similar result in the logical theory of Mr H. Spencer.
                            Mr Spencer supposes himself to be throughout referring to the nature of
                            reality, but in fact all that is specific in the forms of reasoning
                            developed by him is of psychological origin (sec <hi rend="italic">Pr.

                    no doubt be found that the real key to the position is the belief, more or less
                    expressed, that the systematic view of thought as comprehending and evolving the
                    forms of reality is an unattainable ideal,—that metaphysic, to put it briefly,
                    is impossible. To some extent this is the position taken by Lotze, whose
                    cautious and ever thoughtful expositions are invariably directed to the
                    elucidation of the real <hi rend="italic">nodi,</hi> the real roots of
                    perplexity or incompleteness of doctrine. In his view logical forms are the
                    modes in which thought works up the material, supplied in inner experience by
                    the psychological mechanism of the soul, in conformity to the ultimate
                    presuppositions with the aid of which alone can harmony, or ethical and
                    aesthetic completeness, be gained for our conceptions of things. But with this
                    doctrine, which approaches more clearly than any other of the type to the
                    metaphysical logic, there is coupled the reserve that any actual point of view
                    from which the development of these presuppositions, their rational explanation,
                    might become possible is unattainable. Our confidence in them is finally of an
                    ethical character, and depends upon our conviction of the ethical end or purpose
                    of all the surroundings within which human life and <pb break="no"

                    metaphysic we must content ourselves with more or less fragmentary

                <p>30. To understand the peculiarities of this, the final conception of logic, we
                    must take into account the ultimate view of knowledge as that in which thought
                    and reality are united, and of philosophy generally as the attempt to develop
                    the whole system of these abstract determinations of thought by which coherence
                    and intelligibility are given to knowledge. In it there is carried out to the
                    full extent Kant’s idea of thought as the ultimate germ of intelligibility.</p>
                <p>In the critical system, as we have seen, the fundamental idea was continuously
                    disturbed by the intrusion of doctrines which possessed significance only when
                    the problems were treated from a quite opposed point of view. Thus the abstract
                    separation of conscious experience, regulated according to the conditions of the
                    unity of thought, from a supposed realm of reality involved the consideration of
                    the subject as one portion or item of a mechanical whole. In other words, the
                    Kantian system proved itself unable to unite in a comprehensive fashion the two
                    ideas of thought as the universal in experience and of thought as the activity
                    or mode of realization of the individual subject. The central point of view,
                    that which refers all in experience to the unity of thought, was continuously
                    departed from, and as a natural consequence the various forms or modes of
                    thought were treated, not in relation to their ultimate unity, but as isolated
                    facts, to be dealt with by principles resting on a totally opposed doctrine. It
                    is the essence of the Hegelian method to keep continuously in view the concrete
                    unity and totality of thought, to treat each special aspect or determination as
                    an integral portion of an organic whole, a portion which must prove itself
                    unintelligible and contradictory if regarded apart from its relations to the
                    whole, and so to avoid these mechanical separations and abstractions which had
                    proved fatal to the Kantian doctrine. In the development of a method which rests
                    upon and endeavours to retain so comprehensive a point of view, there must of
                    necessity be much that is tentative and «imperfect. Differences of opinion
                    regarding the main stages in the development, regarding the particular content
                    of any one stage, are quite compatible with adhesion to the general principle of
                    the whole.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>. Hegel

                    view only can justice be done to those forms of thought which have always been
                    regarded as the special material of logical treatment; from any other, the
                    treatment must be partial, fragmentary, and, so to speak, external. Thus,
                    notion, judgment, and syllogism are not, in this view, treated as merely
                    subjective modes in which the individual consciousness apprehends and works up
                    the material of experience, but as higher, more developed, and therefore richer
                    forms of the determinations of thought in and through which intelligibility of
                    experience is acquired. The whole system of these determinations of thought, the
                    categories, is the matter of logic; the realization of them in subjective
                    experience, or the treatment of the successive phases of consciousness in which
                    abstract thought comes to be recognized in and by the individual, is the matter
                    of the philosophy of spirit, of which psychology is one portion. Doubtless the
                    logical treatment may be led up to by tracing the modes in which the full
                    consciousness of the determinations of thought as the essence of reality is
                    attained, but such introduction is propaedeutic merely, and within the logical
                    system itself the starting-point must be the simplest, least definite of those
                    categories whereby for spirit the realm of fact becomes intelligible.</p>
                <p>The nature of the opposition between this view and that of the ordinary logic,
                    which in the main rests upon the principle of individualist psychology, that the
                    content of knowledge is derived <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >extra,</hi> from an entirely foreign world of fact, will become more clear
                    if there be considered specially the treatment which under the two methods is
                    given to the notion. Notions, in ordinary logic, are regarded as products formed
                    from the data supplied by presentative and representative experience, and the
                    mode of formation as generally conceived is a continuous process of critical
                    comparison, recognition of differences, similarities, and grouping of like
                    facts. Not only then does the notion present itself as relatively poor and
                    meagre in content, a kind of attenuated individual, not only are the only
                    characteristics presented to the operation of thought mechanical and external,
                    but the final product appears as a mere subjective abbreviation of what is given
                    in experience. In the process, however, even as it is ordinarily conceived,
                    there is more involved than is apparent on the surface. The individuals
                    subjected to the abstracting and generalizing activity of thought are <hi
                        rend="italic">qualified</hi> individuals, <hi rend="italic">ke.,</hi>
                    individuals viewed as determined in their own nature and in respect of thought
                    by a whole network of relations, which when stated abstractly are really of the
                    nature of categories. They are individuals only for a unifying intelligence
                    which views them under diverse aspects, and these aspects are the blank forms of
                    intelligibility, which it is the very function of logic to consider in system.
                    Moreover, the purely formal acceptation of the notion as a mere mental
                    hieroglyphic or sign stands in sharp contradiction to the view which as a rule
                    accompanies it, and which, for the most part, receives explicit statement in a
                    so-called applied logic or doctrine of method, that in the notion is contained
                    the representation of the essence or tnιth of reality. It is impossible to
                    retain with any consistency the merely arithmetical or numerical doctrine of the
                    notion, as containing fewer marks than the individual, of the genus.as
                    characterized by a less number of attributes than the species, and so on.
                    Underlying all genuine knowledge, all classification, and therefore all
                    formation of notions, is the tendency towards the subordination of parts to a
                    law which determines them. The generic attributes are not simply the points of
                    agreement, but the determining characteristics, and the notion of a thing is the
                    explicit recognition of its nature as a particular manifestation of a universal
                    law.</p>
                <p>-Thus even within the limits of the ordinary logic there are problems which force
                    upon it the reconsideration of the view which regards the notion as merely a
                    mechanically formed psychical fact. Knowledge, no doubt, is only realized
                    subjectively, in and through psychical facts, but the treatment of it in its
                    nature as knowledge, and the treatment of its psychical aspect, are <hi
                        rend="italic">toto genere</hi> distinct, The metaphysical doctrine which
                    keeps consistently in view thought as the essence of knowledge in its own nature
                    has therefore to contemplate the notion in strictest relation to thought, as one
                    mode in which objectivity as such is apprehended, made intelligible, and, in a
                    very special sense, as the mode in which the nature of thought is made explicit.
                    Thus the notion can only appear as uniting and comprehending under a new aspect
                    these intellectual determinations whereby things are related to one another in a
                    cognizable system.</p>
                <p>The special characteristic of the Hegelian logic, the methodical principle of
                    development of the determinations of thought, requires for its full elucidation
                    a longer treatment than is compatible with the scope of a general sketch. But it
                    seems necessary to add a word respecting certain difficulties or objections
                    which apply, not specially to the methodical principle of Hegel’s logic, but
                    generally to the idea of a logic which is at the same time metaphysic or a
                    treatment of ultimate notions. These objections may be variously put, according
                    to the special point of view assumed by the critic, but they are in the long run
                    dependent on one mode of interpretation of the fundamental antithesis between
                    being, or reality, and thought. For whether we say that it is confusion to
                    identify thought-forms with relations of fact, that it is unphilosophical to
                    assume that being of necessity conforms to thought, that thought is purely
                    subjective and knowledge the system of forms in and through which the subjective
                    is brought after its own nature to an adequate representation of objective fact,
                    or point to phenomena of perception as showing that even adequate
                    correspondence, not to speak of identity, between subjective and objective must
                    be matter of discussion, or lay stress upon the procedure of science as
                    negativing the preliminary assumption of the logico-metaphysical assumption, we
                    but express in varied ways a fundamental interpretation of the opposition
                    between reality and knowledge. We assume an initial distinction, the grounds and
                    precise nature of which are never made clear. For the antithesis between thought
                    and reality is an antithesis in and by means of conscious experience, and is not
                    to be comprehended save through conscious experience. If, indeed, we start with
                    conscious experience as a mechanically formed <hi rend="italic">tertium
                        quid,</hi> something which arises out of the correlation of an unknown
                    subject and an unknown object, we may certainly retain, as an ever-recurring and
                    insoluble problem, the possibility of cognizing either factor <hi rend="italic"
                        >per sc.</hi> But the problem arises not from the antithesis but from our
                    way of reading or interpreting it. Opposition between subjective thinking and
                    the real world of fact, slow, tentative, and imperfect development in individual
                    consciousness of knowledge which contains in essential relation the opposed
                    elements, distinction therefore of the metaphysical or real categories which
                    determine the nature of object as knowable from the ideal or logical categories
                    which express more specifically the fashion in which the knowable object is
                    reduced to the subjective form of cognition, are not only perfectly compatible
                    with, but are strictly reasoned conclusions from, the ultimate doctrine that in
                    thought alone is to be found the secret both of knowing and of being. To bring
                    against this doctrine the continuous complaint that it assumes an identity
                    which, if it can be proved at all, at least demands proof, is to misunderstand
                    the very notion of identity which plays so important a part in the objection.
                    Not even in the most judicious and thoughtful critics of metaphysical logic, in
                    Lotze for example,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                            his <hi rend="italic">Logik</hi> (1843), pp. 10, 11, and <hi

                    does one find a sufficiently careful distinction between a mere question of
                    nomenclature (z.c., whether we shall restrict the title <hi rend="italic"
                        >logic</hi> to the portion of general system which deals with notions,
                    judgments, and syllogism, while reserving for metaphysics all the other
                    inquiries) and the question of theoretical <pb break="no"

                    above the difference between the more immediate determinations of thought and
                    its more complex or reflective modesan essential difference in knowledge between
                    thought and reality. In less careful critics the oversight simply leads to the
                    contention that we shall always repeat the problem of knowing and being as
                    insoluble, and shall view knowledge as a mechanical, subjective product.</p>
                <p>Many of these objections doubtless result from a very simple fact, more than once
                    alluded to in this article. Particular distinctions, apparently the most
                    elementary, frequently involve and are unintelligible apart from a developed,
                    though not necessarily consistent or well grounded, conception of things in
                    general. Thus the emphasis laid upon thought as essentially subjective, as being
                    merely the system of operations whereby the individual brings into order and
                    coherence in his own experience what is furnished <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">extra</hi> through the natural connexion in which he is placed
                    to the objective world, seems at first sight the most simple and direct
                    consequence of the actually given distinction between the individual as one
                    natural unit and the sum of things comprehending him and all others. But, on
                    analysing more closely the title for applying to philosophical problems a view
                    which is that of practical life, and doubtless legitimate and necessary within
                    that sphere, we readily become aware of a whole series of speculative
                    assumptions implicit in that view, and possibly without any adequate
                    justification. At all events, whether or not the view be ultimately defensible,
                    and in the same form in which it is at first assumed, it is unphilosophical to
                    start in the treatment of a difficult and important discussion from principles
                    so ambiguous and undetermined. The practical difference between the individual
                    agent and the external sphere within which his individual operations are
                    realized and which is therefore treated by him, from his point of view, as
                    external, throws no light <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> on the nature of the
                    ultimate relation between the individual thinker as such and the world within
                    which his thought is exercised. The confusion between ultimate distinctions and
                    practical points of view is productive of most pernicious consequences not only
                    in logic specially but in philosophy at large.</p>

                <p>31. It will probably be now apparent that determination of the nature, province,
                    and method of logic is, and has always been, dependent on the conception formed
                    as to the nature of knowledge. Discussions regarding the precise definition of
                    logic are not mere analytical disputes regarding the best mode of expressing in
                    terms the nature of a subject sufficiently agreed upon; variations in the
                    treatment of particular portions of logical discipline do not arise from more or
                    less accurate discrimination of the nature and relations of given material; nor
                    are differences in respect to the amount of logical matter to be considered mere
                    expressions of difference as to the range of the same fundamental principles.
                    The grounds for divergence are much more deeply seated, and, looking back upon
                    the historical survey of the main conceptions of logical science, it seems quite
                    impossible to hope that by comparison and selection certain common points of
                    view or methods may be extracted, to which the title of logical might beyond
                    dispute be applied. The logic, as one may call it, of each philosophical theory
                    of knowledge is an integral part or necessary consequence of such theory; and
                    its validity, whether in whole or in part, depends upon the completeness and
                    coherence of the explanation of knowledge in general which forms the essence of
                    that theory. Any criticism of a general conception of logic or special
                    application thereof, which does not rest upon criticism of the theory of
                    knowledge implied in it, must be inept and useless. It is not possible to
                    include such expanded criticism in an article like the present; there remains
                    therefore only one aspect of these various logical schemes which may be
                    subjected to special and isolated examination, viz., the inner coherence of each
                    scheme as presented by its author. Naturally such an examination can be applied
                    only to views which imply the separate existence of logic as a body of doctrine
                    developing into system from its own, peculiar principles. When it is a
                    fundamental position that logic as such has no separate existence, but is one
                    with the all-comprehensive doctrine or theory of the ultimate nature of
                    cognition, it is not possible to criticize such conception of logic separately;
                    criticism of logic then becomes criticism of the whole philosophical system. In
                    most of the views brought before us, however, a special place has been assigned
                    to logic; it is therefore possible to apply internal criticism to the more
                    important of these general views, and to consider how far the pretensions of
                    logic to an Independent position and method are substantiated.</p>
                <p>From the foregoing remarks it will also have become apparent that a general
                    classification of logical schools, as opposed to the reference of these to
                    ultimate distinctions of philosophical theory, is impossible. A distribution
                    into formal (subjective), real (empirical, or, as certain German authorities
                    designate it, <hi rend="italic">Erkenntniss-theoretisch),</hi> and metaphysical
                    conceptions of logic is rather confusing than helpful. For the formal logics of
                    the Kantian writers, of Hamilton, and of Mansel are distinct, not only from one
                    another, but from such equally formal logics as those of Hobbes, Condillac,
                    Leibnitz, Herbart, Ulrici, Boole, De Morgan, and Jevons. Logicas theory of
                    knowledge presents quite special features when handled by Mill, or by
                    Schleiermacher, Ueberweg, Beneke, and Wundt. And it cannot even be admitted that
                    the threefold classification affords room, without violence, for the
                    Aristotelian logical researches. There are no points of agreement and difference
                    so unambiguous that by their aid a division can be effected.<note

                    logic is a pure science, having as its special material the form of thought,

                    the elementary principles contained in the very notion of form as opposed to
                    matter of thought. But, when one comes to the examination of the system itself,
                    one finds (a) that the notions of form and matter are much too stubborn to lend
                    themselves readily to analysis, and that explanations of what exactly
                    constitutes form fluctuate between a merely negative definition (whatever is not
                    treated in any other science, philosophical or otherwise) and a psychological
                    deduction from the assumed nature of thought;<note anchored="true"

                    determining the contents of logical science is psychology, from which much more
                    is borrowed than the mere preliminary definition of thought; (c) that
                    demonstrative character rests entirely on an abstract interpretation of the laws
                    of identity and non-contradiction , <hi rend="italic">{d)</hi> that throughout
                    the whole system there is not a trace of development, but merely the reiterated

                    distinction between form and matter, to logical products, the notion, judgment,
                    and syllogism, whose nature, characteristics, and distribution are arbitrarily
                    accepted from psychology or general criticism or what not. Thus, in the majority
                    of cases, logicians who simply followed the lines indicated by Kant introduced
                    into their system, without any criticism, the fundamental distinctions contained

                    were accepted as being categorical, hypothetical, and disjunctive in kind,
                    though the differences are altogether foreign to the logical principle applied;
                    and generally no attempt was made to do more than treat, in an abstract fashion,
                    some aspects of a procedure of thought determined in all its phases by
                    extra-logical considerations. The inevitable result of such a treatment was the
                    undue preponderance given to the doctrine of notions, which, being viewed after
                    the fashion of Kant as given, completed products, appeared as the ultimate units
                    of thought, to be combined, separated, and grouped together in all the higher
                    processes. The peculiarities of the logical system which is commonly associated
                    with the name of Sir W. Hamilton spring entirely from this view of notions. For,
                    if notions be regarded as the elements of thought, then the judgment which
                    elaborates them can only present itself as the explicit statement of immediate
                    relations discernible among notions. These immediate relations reduce
                    themselves, for Hamilton, to one,—the quantitative relation of whole and
                    part,—and, attention being concentrated on the extensive reference of concepts,
                    the eightfold scheme of propositional forms is the natural consequence. To such
                    a scheme the objections are manifold. It is neither coherent in itself, nor
                    expressive of the nature of thinking, nor deduced truly from the general
                    principle of the Hamiltonian logic. For it ought to have been kept in mind that
                    extension is but an aspect of the notion, not a separable fact upon which the
                    logical processes of elaboration are to be directed. It is, moreover,
                    sufficiently clear that the relation of whole and part is far from exhausting or
                    even adequately representing the relations in which things become for
                    intelligence matters of cognition, and it is further evident that the procedure
                    by which types of judgment are distinguished according to the total or partial
                    reference to extension contained in them assumes a stage and amount of knowledge
                    which is really the completed result of cognition, not that witn which it
                    starts, or by which it proceeds.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The extension of a notion has no numerical or
                            quantitative definiteness. To formulate the judgment as expressing

                            survey of what, by its very essence, remains incomplete. This is
                            specially noteworthy in the case of Hamilton's particular judgments. A
                            judgment such as <hi rend="italic">only some A is all B</hi> assumes
                            total and perfect knowledge of the whole spheres of A and B. It is in

                            Hamilton, it may be added, finds it completely impossible to work out a

                    psychology, as ordinarily conceived, has certainly close relations with logic,
                    but in aim and in point of view is distinctly opposed or at all events
                    subordinate to it. The psychological investigation of thought, if carried out
                    consistently, must take one of two forms, either that of description, in which
                    thought, like any other mental fact, is regarded <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">extra</hi> as that upon which attention and observation are to
                    be directed,—in which case therefore any relations of thoughts among themselves
                    must be of such an external nature as can be presented in the field of
                    observation; or that of genesis, development, in which the subjective processes
                    of mind are viewed as forms of the one great process whereby knowledge is
                    realized in the individual consciousness. Investigations from the first point of
                    view are diametrically opposed to the logical treatment of thought, for in the
                    latter the essential feature, the reference in the subject, with his mental
                    forms, to an objective order within his experience is entirely wanting. Such
                    investigation is abstract; it proceeds upon and remains within the limits of a
                    distinction drawn in and for conscious experience, a distinction the grounds,
                    significance, and modes of which require to be treated by a larger and more
                    comprehensive method. Investigations from the second point of view are
                    subordinate to logic in the wider sense, for the treatment of the subjective
                    processes therein is illuminated and determined by the general principles
                    regarding the nature and meaning of conscious experience which it is the sole
                    function of logic to bring forward and establish. The psychology which Hamilton
                    generally has in view is that commonly called empirical, and with his conception
                    of it the two sciences, logic and psychology, are really one.</p>
                <p>33. A possible exit from the difficulties or assumptions of the current Kantian
                    logic may be sought by following out and consistently applying the hint
                    contained in Kant’s distinction of analytic and synthetic thought, analytic and
                    synthetic truth. It may be said that all thinking involves the fundamental laws
                    of identity and non-contradiction; that in these laws only is to be found the
                    characteristic and most general feature of thought; that in them only is the
                    form, or element contributed by mind itself, to be-detected. Logic would thus be
                    regarded as the explicit statement of the conditions of non-contradictoriness in
                    thought, as the evolution of the formal element in thought, and, since in
                    analytic truth only can non-contradictoriness be discovered without material
                    aid, as the theory of analytic thought. Such is the position assigned to logic
                    by Twesten, Mansel, Spalding, and some others, and the consequences to which it
                    inevitably leads are sufficiently interesting to require that some special
                    examination should be given to it.</p>
                <p>In the first place, then, it seems evident that the fundamental distinction
                    implied, that between analytic and synthetic thought, is wrongly conceived. That
                    analysis and synthesis are methods of cognition, differing in many important
                    respects, is undoubted; but such difference lies in a sphere altogether alien to
                    that within which the present distinction is to be sought Analytic thought, as
                    here conceived, is only to be understood when taken in reference to the
                    judgment, and then also in reference to a peculiarity in the Kantian doctrine.
                    Kant, emphasizing the principle that judgment is essentially the form in which
                    the particular of experience is determined by the universal element of thought,
                    but identifying this universal with a formed concept (resembling, therefore, a
                    class notion), contemplated a class of judgments in which the predicate was
                    merely an explication of the subject notion. Such judgments, had the matter been
                    more fully considered, would have appeared as far from primary, and Kant has
                    himself, in the most unambiguous language, indicated the correct view that
                    analysis is consequent and dependent on synthesis,—that analytic judgments,
                    therefore, are merely special applications of abstracting thought within a
                    sphere already treated, handled, formed by thought. Mansel, too, whose views are
                    generally acute if not profound, has signalized as the primitive unit of
                    cognition the so-called psychological judgment, which is essentially synthetic
                    in character. The logical judgment, in fact, about which his conception of logic
                    centres, is recognized as a posterior act of reflexion, directed upon formed
                    notions, and is not in any way to be regarded as containing what is a common,
                    universal feature of all judgments.</p>
                <p>In the second place, even granting what cannot be maintained, that the process of
                    thought is mere explication of the content of previous knowledge, and that the
                    theory of logic has to do with a comparatively small and subordinate portion of
                    cognition, there is in such a principle no means of development. We may take up
                    in succession class-notions, judgments, reasonings, and in relation to each
                    reiterate, as the one axiom of logic, that the constituent elements shall be
                    non-contradictory; but such a treatment is only possible in relation to a
                    material already formed and organized. The utmost possible value being given to
                    such a view, logic, under it, could be but a partial and inchoate doctrine.</p>
                <p>Finally, there is involved in the doctrine of analytic thought and in the
                    consequences to which attention will next be drawn â peculiar and one-sided
                    conception of identity or of the principle of identity as an element in thought.
                    Historically this conception has played a most important part: it lies at the
                    root of all nominalist logic from Antisthenes downwards, and has found

                            interesting matter.</p></note> The representatives of things in our
                    subjective experience, the units of knowledge, may be called notions, and,
                    accordingly, that each notion should be what it is appears as the corresponding
                    logical axiom. The whole process of thought is therefore regarded as merely the
                    explicit statement of what each notion is, and the separation of it by direct or
                    indirect methods from all that it is not. The judgment, essentially the active
                    movement of thought, is reduced to the mere expression of the identity of a
                    notion, and in truth, were the doctrine consistently carried out, Antisthenes’s
                    conclusion that the judgment is a fallacious and inept form of thought would be
                    the necessary result. When such a conclusion is not drawn, its place is
                    generally taken by much vague declamation regarding the limited, imperfect, and
                    uncertain character of our knowledge, which is regarded as asymptotically
                    approaching to the adequate determination of truth.</p>
                <p>The conception which underlies this view is the abstract separation of thought
                    from things which has been already noted, but the proximate principle is a
                    deduction therefrom. Knowledge or thought is treated externally as a series of
                    isolated units or parts, and the results of cognition—notions, judgments, and
                    reasonings—are viewed as the constituent factors. Thus, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> when it is said that a judgment is the expression of an
                    identity, there are possible only two modes of explanation,—the one, that the
                    identity referred to is that between the original notion (subject) as
                    unqualified by its predicates and the same as qualified, in which case
                    manifestly the result of the judgment is taken as being its constituent essence;
                    the other, that the identity is that of the applicability of distinct names to
                    the same fact, in which case we accept without further inquiry and exclude from
                    logical consideration the processes of thought by which the application of names
                    is brought about, and assume as being the procedure of thought itself that which
                    is its consequence. Under all circumstances, difference is as important an
                    element as identity in the judgment, and to concentrate attention upon the
                    identity is to take a one-sided and imperfect view.<note anchored="true"

                <p>34. So soon, however, as the real nature of thought has been thrown out of
                    account as not concerned in the processes of logic, so soon as the law of
                    non-contradiction, in its manifold statement, has been formulated as the one
                    principle of logical or formal thinking, there appears the possibility of
                    evolving an exact system of the conditions of non-contradictoriness. The
                    ultimate units of knowledge, whatsoever we call them, whether notions or ideas
                    of classes or names, have at least one characteristic,—they are what they are,
                    and therefore exclude from themselves whatever is contradictory of their nature.
                    They are combined positions and negations, that which is posited or negated
                    being left undetermined,—referred, in fact, to matter as opposed to form. With
                    respect to any article of thought, therefore, the only logical requirement is
                    that it shall possess the characteristic of not being self-contradictory, and
                    the only logical question is, what exactly is posited and negated thereby.
                    Complex articles of thought viewed in like manner as complexes of positions and
                    negations may have the same condition demanded of them and the same question put
                    regarding them. A judgment and a syllogism, if narrowly investigated, will
                    appear to be merely complex articles of thought, complexes of positions and
                    negations. Proceeding from such a conception there may be treatments more or
                    less systematic and fruitful. In the hands of Kantian logicians, such as
                    Twesten, Mansel, Spalding, and the like, little is effected, for, as the forms
                    of thought are accepted as given and as having their characteristics otherwise
                    fixed (by psychology or critical theory of knowledge), the treatment resolves
                    itself either into repetition, in respect to each, of the fundamental logical
                    condition, or into the erection of a specific kind of thought (analytical) which
                    has no other feature save that of correspondence with the said condition. But it
                    is clear that restriction by any psychological or critical doctrine of thought
                    is an arbitrary limitation. It is needful only to regard the operation of
                    thought as establishment of positions and negations, and to develop, by whatever
                    method, the systematic results of such a view. Hobbes’s doctrine of thought as
                    dealing with names and as essentially addition and subtraction of nameable
                    features, Boole’s doctrine of thought as the determination of a class, Jevons’s
                    view of thought as simple apprehension of qualities,—any of these will serve as
                    starting point, for in all of them the fruitful element is the same. The further
                    step that the generalization of the system of thought must take a symbolic form
                    presents itself as an immediate and natural consequence.</p>
                <p>35. By the application of a symbolic method is not to be understood what has been
                    practised by many writers on logic—the illustration<pb break="no"

                    or algebraic signs or by diagrammatic schemata. The expression has the
                    signification which it bears in mathematical analysis, and implies that the
                    general relations of dependence among objects of thought, of whatsoever kind, in
                    correspondence with which operations of perfectly general character are carried
                    out, shall be represented by symbols, the laws of which are determined by the
                    nature of these relations or by the laws of the corresponding operations. The
                    mere use of abbreviations for the objects of treatment is not the application of
                    a symbolic method<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thus
                            one would not describe Aristotle's use of letters for the terms of his

                            like case as being, in any true sense of the word, symbolic. On the
                            subject generally the instructive work of Mr Venn <hi rend="italic"
                                >(Symbolic Logic,</hi> 1881) should be consulted' Mr Venn has not
                            only in this work expounded the foundations and main theorems of Boole’s
                            logic with a care and skill that leave nothing to be desh·ed, but he has
                            independently of many real contributions to logical analysis, put in its
                            true light the nature of symbolic method in logic. He has rendered it
                            impossible, even for the outsider, to complain that symbolic logic is an
                            arbitrary application of mathematical method to logical
                        material.</p></note>; but so soon as the general relations of, or general
                    operations with, these objects are represented by symbols, and the laws of such
                    symbols stated as deductions therefrom, there arises the possibility of a
                    symbolic development or method of treatment, which may lead to more or less
                    expanded results according as the significance of the symbolic laws is more or
                    less general. Thus &lt;[uantity, whether discrete or continuous, presents, as an
                    aspect of phenomena, relations of a highly general kind, offers itself as object
                    of operations of a highly general kind, and is therefore peculiarly the subject
                    of symbolic treatment. Currently, indeed, the treatment of quantity is assumed
                    to have the monopoly of symbolism, but such an assumption is not self-evidently
                    true, and it is permissible to inquire whether matters non-quantitative do not
                    present relations of such generality that they, too, can be symbolically dealt
                    with. It is, however, a further question whether the generality of the relations
                    and therefore the significance of the symbols in such cases, although subject to
                    some special conditions not necessarily involved in the nature of quantity, do
                    not spring from the fact that we treat the matters as quantities of a special
                    kind, and so insensibly find ourselves applying quantitative methods. In other
                    words, it remains to be investigated, after the preliminary definitions and.
                    axioms of any symbolic method have been laid down, whether the conception of
                    thought with which we start, or a special feature distinctly quantitative in
                    character, has been the truly fruitful element in after-development of the
                        system.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>An excellent

                <p>The first step in any symbolic logic must evidently be the determination of the
                    nature and laws of the symbols, and, as these follow from the nature of the
                    operations of thought, the first step is likewise a statement of the essential
                    characteristic of thinking. As above noted, there have been adopted various
                    modes of expressing this characteristic, and in some cases the mode adopted is
                    not one from which any generally applicable symbolic rules of procedure could
                    have followed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Some of

                    representing special views: first, that which proceeds from the idea of thought
                    as essentially the process of grouping, classing, determining a definite set of
                    objects by a mark or notion; and second, that which proceeds more generally from
                    the conception of thought as consisting of a series of self-identical units, to
                    be variously combined in obedience to the law of self-identity.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The first is the view
                            taken by Boole (and expounded with great fulness in V enn, as_above);
                            the second is that of the brothers Grassmann (in the <hi rend="italic"

                        Logik).</hi></p></note> Adopting the first view, we find that processes
                    capable of symbolic representation, by the customary algebraic signs of
                    addition, subtraction, equivalence, multiplication, and division, have a
                    perfectly general significance in reference to the combination, separation,
                    equalization of classes, to the imposition and removal of restriction on a
                    class; that to the symbols there can therefore be assigned a set of general
                    laws; and that any peculiarity of these symbolic laws which differentiates them
                    from the laws of like symbols in mathematical analysis is deducible from the
                    notion of thought with which we started, and is consequently to be carried along
                    with them in all the after development. Symbolic representation of relations of
                    classes follows with equal directness from the general notion that by any such
                    relation a new group is determined in reference to the original groups, or
                    rather that the position or negation of a new group (or series of groups) is
                    given, definitely or indefinitely, as the result of such a relation.</p>
                <p>With the aid of the symbolic laws so reached, the logical problem as such may
                    then be approached. Given any number of logical terms (t.e., classes, or, as it
                    may be better put, positions and negations) connected together by any relations,
                    to determine completely any one in reference to the others, or to express any
                    one in terms of the others. The symbolic procedure, expounded with marvellous
                    ingenuity and success by Boole, may take various forms, and may be simplified by
                    many analytical devices, but consists essentially in determining systematically
                    how given positions and negations, definite or indefinite, combine with or
                    neutralize one another. A more detailed account of these formal processes is
                    beyond our limits.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr

                        methods.</p></note></p>
                <p>The first question which suggests itself in connexion with Boole’s symbolic logic
                    is the necessity or advisability of retaining the reference to classes, or the
                    description of thought as classification. Do the symbolic laws really depend to
                    any extent on the logical peculiarities of class arrangement? Mr Venn, who
                    emphasizes this feature in Boole’s scheme, has, however, done good service in
                    leading up to a different explanation. The general reference to objects, which
                    is also noted as implied in all Boole’s formulae, has nothing to do with the
                    possible difference of conceptualist or materialist doctrines of the
                    proposition, and, in fact, as all distinctions of thing and quality, resemblance
                    and difference, higher and lower, subject and predicate vanish, or are absorbed
                    in the more general principle underlying the symbolic method, phrases such as
                    classification, extension, intension, and the like should be banished as not
                    pertinent. Nay, the usual distinctions of quantity and even of quality either
                    disappear or acquire a new significance when they are brought under the scope of
                    the new principle. “What symbolic logic works upon by preference is a system of
                    dichotomy, of <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and not z, <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and

                    quantitative differences require to find expression through some combination of
                    the positions and negations of the elements making up the objects dealt

                <p>The whole phraseology then of classification and its allied processes seems

                <p>Grassmann, as above stated, deduces logical relations as a particular class of
                    the determinations necessarily attaching to all quantities (t.e., determined
                    contents of thought). Abstraction being made of all peculiarities which may be
                    due to their special constitution, quantities exhibit certain formal relations
                    when they are combined (added, subtracted, &amp;c.). Each quantity is a unit of
                    thought, a definite <hi rend="italic">positum,</hi> and of such units there are
                    but two classes, elements and complexes. Units of thought, which are
                    self-identical, and therefore subject to the specific law that addition of each
                    to itself or multiplication of it by itself yields as result only the original
                    unit, are notions. The theory of notions, therefore, is the development of the
                    general formal relations of units under the special restrictions imposed by
                    their nature.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                <p>There appears very clearly in Grassmann’s treatment the essence of the principle
                    on which symbolic logic proceeds. Thought is viewed as simply the process of
                    positing and negating definite contents or units, and the operations of logic
                    become methods for rendering explicit that which is in each case posited or
                    negated. To apply symbolic methods, we require units as definite as those of
                    quantitative science, and the only laws we can employ are those which spring
                    from the nature of units as definite. Now it seems a profound error to reduce
                    the whole complex process of thinking to this reiterated position of
                    self-identical units. Undoubtedly if we start from any given fact of thought,
                    as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> a judgment, and inquire what can be exhibited
                    as involved in it, we have before us a problem of analysis, the solution of
                    which must take form in a series of positions and negations, but our thinking is
                    not therefore as a whole mere analysis. The synthetic process by which
                    connexions of thought among the objects of our conscious experience are
                    established is not the mechanical aggregation of elementary parts. The relations
                    which give intelligible significance to our experience are not simply those of
                    identity and non·identity. It is an altogether abstract and external view of
                    thought, resting in all probability on an obscure metaphysical principle,<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As above noted, p.
                            800.</p></note> that would treat it as in essence the composition and
                    decomposition of elementary atoms, of <hi rend="italic">ττρωra,</hi> as
                    Antisthenes would have called them. It has, indeed, been imagined that a
                    symbolic loric might be developed which should be independent in all its
                    fundamental axioms of any metaphysical or psychological assumptions, but this is
                    an illusion. No logical method can be developed save from a most definite
                    conception of the essential nature and <hi rend="italic">modus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">operandi</hi> of thinking, and any system of symbolic logic
                    finds it necessary, if it is to be complete and consistent, to adopt some such
                    view as that above criticized, to regard thought as purely analytic, as dealing
                    with compounds or <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n825/mode/1up"

                    products, only to be formed by a kind of thought not recognized among logical
                        processes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The same
                            fact has been noted in regard to formal logic of the Kantian school, <hi

                            logical judgments.</p></note></p>
                <p>36. Formal logic, then, in the ordinary acceptation of that term, does not appear
                    to furnish any adequate representation of the real process and method of
                    thought. Any logical theory must of necessity be formal, ι.e., abstract or
                    general, for it can consider only the general elements of thought, not specific
                    knowledge in which are involved the finite, limited relations of one fact or
                    class of facts to another. The distinction between logic and the sciences is
                    therefore precisely that between philosophy in general and the sciences.
                    Attempts have been made to include in logical analysis the treatment of
                    scientific method, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to discuss as matter of logic
                    the varied processes by which scientific results have been attained. It is true
                    that logical consideration must extend to the notions through which scientific
                    experience, like any other, becomes intelligible, and, in so far as scientific
                    method is but the application of the laws of knowledge as a whole, it is a
                    possible, nay necessary, object of logical treatment. But to include scientific
                    methodology in particular, the consideration of the mechanical devices by which
                    we strive to bring experience into conformity with our ideal of cognition, the
                    discussion of methods of experiment and observation, under the one head logic is
                    an error in principle, whether we view logic in its theoretical aspect or in
                    reference to a special propaedeutic aim. Generalizations on such topics are
                    well-nigh worthless; they can have vitality and importance only when drawn in
                    closest conjunction with actual scientific work. The theory of scientific method
                    is either doctrine of knowledge treated freely or else the application of
                    thought in connexion with actual research and the ascertainment of the
                    principles therein employed. In either case it is not susceptible of abstraction
                    and isolated treatment.</p>
                <p>37. There remains only, of the possible views noted, that which identified logic
                    with the theory of knowledge, but which so defined theory of knowledge as to
                    distinguish it from metaphysics. The designation of logic as theory of knowledge
                    is one to which in words there can be no possible objection. It brings into the
                    foreground what it has been the object of this article, by an historico-critical
                    survey, to establish, that so-called logical laws, forms, and problems are
                    hardly capable of statement, certainly incapable of satisfactory treatment,
                    except in the most intimate connexion with the principles of a theory of
                    knowledge. To include, however, in the signification of this latter term a
                    peculiar conception of the relation between thinking (knowing) and reality is at
                    once to restrict the scope of logic and to place an arbitrary and, one would
                    say, an ill-founded restriction on the kind of treatment to which logical
                    problems may be subjected. If it be really the function of logic to trace the
                    forms and laws of knowledge, that function is all-comprehensive, and must
                    embrace in its scope all the fundamental characteristics of experience as known.
                    But no characteristic of experience is more palpable than the distinction, drawn
                    within conscious experience, between knowledge and reality. It is impossible
                    then for a theory of knowledge to start with the assumption that these two exist
                    separately, constituted each after its special fashion, but with a certain
                    parallelism between them. In words one may refer for justification of the
                    assumption to metaphysics, or to psychology, but, in fact, the problem so
                    relegated to some other discipline is essentially a logical question, and the
                    method of its solution exactly that which must be applied in the treatment of
                    subordinate logical questions. Practical convenience alone can lead to any
                    separation of the problems which under this view are referred in part to theory
                    of knowledge and in part to metaphysics. Other and more serious difficulties of
                    the view have been already commented on.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>⅜Doyc, p. 7V7.</p></note></p>
                <p>38. In sum, then, the problems and the methods which compose logic in the
                    strictest sense of that term seem to be one with the problems and methods of the
                    critical theory of knowledge. No other title describes so appropriately as that
                    of “logical” the analysis of knowledge as. such, its significance and
                    constitution, in opposition to the quasi-historical or genetic account for which
                    the title psychological should be retained. The researches to which we would
                    here assign the title “logical” undoubtedly include all that can supply the
                    place of the older metaphysic, but in aim and method are so distinct that the
                    same title cannot be borne by both. To assign so extensive a range to logical
                    investigations enables us to see that the criteria by which at one time or
                    another a narrower province was determined for logic are but partial expressions
                    of the whole truth. The analysis of knowledge as such, the complete theory of
                    the intelligible elements in conscious experience, does hold <hi
                        rend="superscript"> a</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> P <hi
                        rend="superscript"> e</hi>. <hi rend="superscript"> cιa</hi> ^ relation to.
                    all other subordinate branches of human thinking, whether philosophic in the
                    ordinary sense of that term or scientific. According as one or other aspect of
                    this relation is made prominent, there comes forward one or other of the various
                    modes for settling the province of logic; but these partial concep tions prove
                    their inadequacy when development is attempted from them, and within the systems
                    constructed in accordance with them there is of necessity continuous reference
                    to inquiries lying beyond the prescribed limits.</p>
                <p>A certain analysis of some methods of ordinary thinking, based to a very large
                    extent on language, and resembling in many respects grammatical study, has long
                    been current in educational practice as logic, and to those whose conception of
                    the subject has been formed from acquaintance with this imperfect body of rules
                    and formulae it may appear a violent and unnecessary extension of the term to
                    apply it to the all-comprehensive theory of knowledge. The reasons, however, are
                    imperative; and, as these would lead one to deny the right of this elementary
                    practical discipline to the possession of the title, it is desirable to conclude
                    by offering a single remark on the place and function of this currently
                    designated logic.</p>
                <p>Not much trouble is required in order to see that the ordinary school or formal
                    logic can lay no claim to scientific completeness. Its principles are imperfect,
                    dubious, and most variously conceived; it possesses no method by which
                    development from these principles is possible; it has no criterion by which to
                    test the adequacy of its abstract forms as representations of the laws of
                    concrete thinking. Accordingly it is handled, in whole and in detail, in the
                    most distractingly various fashion, and were it indeed entitled to the
                    honourable designation of logic the prospects of that science might well be
                    despaired of. But in fact the school logic discharges a function for which
                    exhaustiveness of logical analysis is not a requisite. It has a <hi
                        rend="italic">raison</hi><hi rend="italic">dètrc</hi> in the circumstance
                    that training to abstract methods must needs be a graduated process, and that,
                    whether as a means towards the prosecution of philosophic study in especial, or
                    as instrument of general educational value, practice in dealing with abstract
                    thoughts must have value. Such elementary practice naturally bases itself on the
                    kinds of distinction apparent in the concrete thinking of those to whom it is
                    applied, and for this reason school logic not only connects itself with and is
                    in a sense the development of grammar and grammatical analysis and synthesis,
                    but may, to a limited extent, include reference to some of the simpler processes
                    of scientific method. In all probability the discord observable among the
                    ordinary treatises on school logic is due to the want of recognition of the true
                    place which can thus be assigned to the subject treated. The doctrine has a
                    propaedeutic but not a scientific value.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Hindu Systems of Logic.—</hi> In almost all the Hindu systems
                    of philosophy, as these are classified by the most recent authorities,
                    indications are to be found of a more or less developed analysis of the process
                    or method of reasoning, and therefore of a certain amount of logical theory. In
                    two systems in particular the logical element is the most prominent feature. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Nyâya,</hi> or logical doctrine of Gotama, is in a very
                    special sense the Hindu logic, while in the <hi rend="italic">Vaiseschika,</hi>
                    or Atomist system of Kanada, there are many expansions of or additions to the
                        <hi rend="italic">Nyâya,</hi> though the prevailing interest is not
                    logical.</p>
                <p>The most accessible sources of information regarding the Hindu logic,
                    Colebrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> and Professor Μ. Muller’s abstract
                    (in the appendix to Archbishop Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Laws of
                        Thought),</hi> tend to mingle in an undesirable fashion what is special to
                    the Nyâya doctrine, and what is added by Kanada and his followers. In order to
                    appreciate the extent to which thé analysis of reasoning has been carried in
                    these early systems, it is advisable to restrict attention to the original
                    exposition of the <hi rend="italic">Nyâya.</hi></p>
                <p>The aim of Nyâya is the attainment of perfection, of bliss, through knowledge. _
                    But, to have knowledge in a systematic and complete fashion, it is requisite
                    that the individual should know (or should be capable of organizing <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n826/mode/1up"

                    great topics or heads of discussion. These, as enumerated by Gotama are-(l)
                    proof; (2) the objects of proof; (3) doubt; (4) motive; (5) the iUustration or
                    example for discussion; (6) the final assertion; (7) the enumeration of the five
                    members of the final assertion; (8) confirmatory argument; (9) the conclusion,
                    the defined judgment; (10) the objection; (11) controversy; (12) deceptive
                    counter argument; (13) apparent reason or sophism; (14) fraud or wilfully
                    deceptive argument, ruse; (15) futile argument or self-contradictory counter
                    argument; (16) conclusive refutation. Inspection of these at once shows that
                    they represent stages in dialectic or in the process of clearing up knowledge by
                    discussion. The generalia, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the kinds of proof,
                    described as four in number—sense-perception inference (either from cause to
                    effect, from effect to cause, or from comm∣lnity of nature, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> in a wide sense, analogy), comparison (analogy in a stricter
                    significance), tradition,—and the things about which proof may be exercised,
                    under which a twelvefold division is given by Gotama, and enlarged in endless
                    detail by his commentators, who introduce thereunder much of Kanada’s system,
                    are first laid down as the basis for the whole. Then follows (Nos. 3-6) the
                    progress from doubt, which first calls for reasoning or proof, through motive,
                    to position of the problem in the form of an example or case, and to the general
                    assertion, as having valid grounds. The analysis of the grounds of assertion is
                    then given, and here we have what corresponds more particularly to the syllogism
                    as known to us. Five members are signalized (1) the thesis or proposition to be
                    proved; (2) the reason, or intermediate ground by which the subject of the
                    proposition is linked onto an explanatory principle; (3) the explanatory
                    principle; (4) the application of this explanatory principle; (5) the statement
                    of the conclusion as following from the application. Thus, in the example
                    usually given—(1) <hi rend="italic">thesis,</hi> this mountain is fiery; (2) <hi
                        rend="italic">intermediate ground,</hi> because it smokes; (3) <hi
                        rend="italic">explanatory principle,</hi> whatever smokes is fiery, as, for
                    instance, a hearth; (4) <hi rend="italic">application,</hi> therefore this
                    mountain is fiery; (5) <hi rend="italic">statement of conclusion,</hi> the
                    mountain, then, is fiery, because it smokes. There can be no doubt that in this
                    somewhat unsystematic arrangement we have the outlines of syllogistic argument.
                    Considerable obscurity, however, rests over the third member, and it is only
                    partially cleared up when we proceed to the next topic, which may perhaps be
                    translated confirmatory argument. Here the essence of the argument appears to be
                    a regress from the known mark to the fundamental quality from which it follows.
                    Thus, e.σ., if it were said <hi rend="italic">the mountain is not fiery,</hi>
                    then the argument would be adduced, but <hi rend="italic">the mountain
                        smokes,</hi> and what is not fiery does not smoke. Apparently there is
                    involved the assumption that the mark is a necessary consequence of the primary
                    quality, but the exposition is obscure, and, doubtless, connects itself with the
                    principles of causal connexion recognized by Hindu thinkers. (See williams, as
                    below, pp. 73-4).</p>
                <p>When the conclusion has thus been confirmed, when the negation of the ground has
                    been shown to fail in explaining the observed fact, the thesis may be stated in
                    an absolute and definitive form (topic 9). The remaining seven topics are then
                    concerned with the discussion which may arise when an opponent brings forward
                    objections to the conclusion. This he must do by positing his antithesis (10),
                    whereupon issue may be joined (11). Should the adversary be unable to establish
                    his antithesis, he may resort to deceit, bringing forward arguments, illogically
                    arranged and devoid of force (12), which soon leads to the employment of
                    sophisms (13) or merely apparent arguments, and even to deceitful ruses (14).
                    Under these topics the <hi rend="italic">Nydya</hi> signalizes and discusses
                    various well-known forms of faUacy. The destruction of all these fallacious
                    arguments reduces the opponent to the employment of futile, irrelevant
                    responses, which undermine his own position (15), and the exposure of which
                    completes his discomfiture and reduces him to silence (16).</p>
                <p>Expositions of this dialectic system are not yet available in such kind and
                    amount as would enable one to do full justice to it. Evidently much patience and
                    a very considerable knowledge of the current philosophical view would be
                    requisite in order to appreciate at their true worth many apparently formal, and
                    in some cases dubious, divisions. Of accounts which may be consulted the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Ramus.—</hi> The logical theories of Ramus acquired for a brief
                    period a factitious importance from ,their connexion with the general revolt
                    against Aristotelianism, and with the Protestant struggle against the Roman
                    Catholic authority. In themselves they have no particular value, nor indeed much
                    originality, and the exposition of them by their author, always rather literary
                    than philosophic, adds nothing of strength or interest. In comparison with the
                    Aristotelian analysis of the forms and methods of thinking, the few alterations
                    of statement, and genera∏y the thin residuum of logical theory, which
                    characterize Ramist work, appear as singularly insignificant. Nor have any of
                    the special peculiarities of the Ramist logic exercised influence on the history
                    of logical doctrines. The keenness of the controversy which raged in so many of
                    the centres of learning between the Aristotelians and the total or partial
                    Ramists is explicable only as having reference to differences which were merely
                    symbolized by the apparent difference in logical doctrine.</p>
                <p>In the Protestant universities and seminaries generally the Ramist logic
                    obtained, and for some time kept, a firm footing. In Scotland, through Melville,
                    Buchanan, and the earl of Murray, who had been a pupil of Ramus, his system was
                    installed as the orthodox staple of logical training, and such records as remain
                    of Scottish university education during the troubled 16th century would
                    undoubtedly exhibit the traces of this new movement. In England, Cambridge
                    alone, always disposed to reject the authority of Aristotle, and generally more
                    open to new ideas than the sister university, was a stronghold of Ramism, and,
                    apart from special works of Ramist tendency, the influence of the new doctrine
                    is discernible in the writings of more than one Cambridge alumnus. William
                    Temple, a friend of Sir Philip Sidney, and an official of the university,
                    published a volume of <hi rend="italic">Scholia in Rami</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Dialecticam,</hi> 1591; George Downam, praelector on logic, wrote

                        Bartholomew,</hi> show how familiar Ramist phraseology and the personality
                    of Ramus must have been to an alumnus of Cambridge, while Bacon, with
                    well-grounded objection to much of the Ramist method, expounds the system of
                    logic with unmistakable reference to the Ramist principles and method of
                    arrangement. There is a monograph on Ramus by Ch. Waddington with a good
