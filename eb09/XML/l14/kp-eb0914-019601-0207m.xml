                    originally invented to designate the particular acid contained in sour milk, has
                    now, through the discovery of other acids isomeric with and very similar to that
                    acid, acquired a generic, in addition to its original specific, meaning.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lactic Acid properly so called, Fermentation Lactic Acid,
                    Ethylidene Lactic Acid.—</hi> Scheele (<hi rend="italic">Transactions of
                    Stockholm Acad.,</hi> 1780) was the first to isolate this acid (from sour milk)
                    and establish its individuality. About twenty-four years later Bouillon
                    Lagrange, and, independently of him, also Fourcroy and Vauquelin maintained that
                    Scheele’s new acid was nothing but impure acetic. But this notion was combated
                    by Berzelius, and finally refuted (in 1832) by Liebig and Mitscherlich, who by
                    the elementary analyses of lactates proved the existence of this as a distinct
                    acid.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Fermentation</hi> (vol. ix. p. 97) it is
                    explained how lactic acid is produced from milk-sugar and from ordinary glucose
                    by “lactic fermentation.” The most convenient process for the preparation of the
                    acid is Bensch’s. A solution of “invert-sugar” (see vol. ix. p. 96) is produced
                    by dissolving 6 parts of cane-sugar and <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅛th part of
                    tartaric acid in 35 parts of boiling water and allowing to stand for two days.
                    There is then added <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    gth part of. foul cheese, 8 parts of sour milk, and 2⅜ parts of carbonate of
                    zinc, and the mixture kept at 40° to 45° C. for eight to ten days. The sugar, C

                    the carbonate present, is converted into lactate of zinc. But part of the
                    lactate is invariably lost through “butyric fermentation” with evolution of
                    hydrogen, which latter converts part of the sugar into mannite, C <hi

                    6</hi>. The fermented liquid is heated to boiling, strained clear, and allowed
                    to cool, when the lactate of zinc separates out in crystalline crusts, which are
                    purified by recrystallization from hot water. The free acid is obtained by
                    decomposing the hot aqueous solution of the salt with sulphuretted hydrogen and
                    filtering off the sulphide of zinc. The filtrate is evaporated on a water bath
                    to a syrup, which is treated with ether. Mannite and other impurities remain,
                    and the acid passes into the filtrate, from which the ether is easily expelled
                    by distillation,and subsequent evaporation in an open basin. What ultimately
                    remains is a thick colourless syrup, which, in ordinary chemical parlance, goes
                    as lactic acid, although it is at best only an approximation to the hydrate, C

                <p>The behaviour of lactic acid solution to basic reagents and of the acid itself to
                    alcohols (in the presence of dehydrators) is strictly that of a raonobasic acid

                    strictly equivalent to one molecule of acetic acid, and as the latter is proved
                    to be CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>.C00H, lactic acid must be assumed to be (C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> O) CO OH. But the

                    the CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> of acetic acid) still contains one hydrogen

                    iodine with formation of water. In a word, lactic acid, besides being an acid
                    analogous to, for instance, acetic acid, CH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> COOH,
                    is at the same time an alcohol analogous to ordinary spirit of wine, C <hi

                    This two fold character of our substance explains the readiness with which it
                    passes into anhydrides. Lactic acid the acid acts upon lactic acid the alcohol;
                    the replaceable H in the former unites with the OH of the latter, and the two
                    rests combine into an ether which is lactic anhydride. Thus :— (C <hi

                <p>The slanting lines show the mode of combination after the reaction. The
                    anhydride, as we see, still contains an OH and COOH, and a repetition of the
                    group within its molecule leads to lactide, C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>. This latter body could

                    vapour density determination proves the molecular weight to be in accordance
                    with the larger formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    8</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.</p>
                <p>Admitting, as well we may, that lactic acid is a compound of COOH and OH with C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, what is this C <hi

                    has been satisfactorily answered. When lactic acid is distilled rapidly, it
                    breaks up into formic acid, H.C00H, and aldehyde, (CH <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>)(CO)H. Conversely when aldehyde is treated with hydrocyanic acid and
                    muriatic acid it is converted into lactic acid, in two steps, thus: (1) the C =
                    O in the aldehyde combines with the (NC)H, the H going to the 0 and the (NC) by
                    its C to the C, to form the group (NC)—C—0—H; and (2) the NC of this group, by
                    the action of the water, gets converted into a COOH, with formation of NH <hi

                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O = NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> + C00H. The (CH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi>) and H in the original aldehyde retain their places, so
                    that what we obtain ultimately must be</p>

                    plane of polarized light, and also in this that the sarcolactates in general are
                    more readily soluble than ordinary lactates, and contain different proportions
