                    rend="italic">esculenta,</hi> Mönch, a small annual of the vetch tribe. The
                    plant varies from 6 to 18 inches in height, and has many long ascending
                    branches. The leaves are alternate, with six pairs of oblong-linear, obtuse,
                    mucronate leaflets. The flowers, two to four in number, are of a pale blue
                    colour, and are borne in the axils of the leaves, on a slender footstalk
                    equalling the leaves in length; they are produced in June or early in July. The
                    pods are about ∣ inch long, broadly oblong, slightly inflated, and contain two
                    seeds, which are of the shape of a doubly convex lens, and about ⅜ inch in
                    diameter. There are several cultivated varieties of the plant, differing in
                    size, hairiness, and colour of the leaves, flowers, and seeds. The last may be
                    more or less compressed in shape, and in colour may vary from yellow or grey to
                    dark brown; they are also sometimes mottled or speckled. In English commerce two
                    kinds only of lentils are principally met with, viz., the French and the
                    Egyptian. The former are usually vended entire, and are of an ash-grey colour
                    externally and of a yellow tint within; the latter are usually sold like split
                    peas, without the seed coat, and consist of the reddish-yellow cotyledons, which
                    are smaller and rounder than those of the French lentil; the seed coat when
                    present is of a dark brown colour. Egyptian lentils are chiefly imported from
                    Alexandria. In 1880 there were shipped from that port 25,000 ardebs, or 17,000
                    quarters, of red lentils, valued at £25,000, of which amount 80 per cent, was
                    taken by Great Britain. Considerable quantities of lentils are also imported
                    into the United States, but are chiefly consumed by the Germans, with whom
                    lentil soup is a favourite dish. The native country of the lentil is not known,
                    although it is supposed to be indigenous to the Himalayas. It was probably one
                    of the first plants brought under cultivation by mankind. The name <hi
                    rend="italic">'adas</hi> (Heb. e∏y) appears to be an original Semitic word, and
                    the red pottage of lentils for which Esau sold his birthright (Gen. xxv. 34) was
                    apparently made from the red Egyptian lentil. This lentil is cultivated in one
                    or other variety in India, Persia, Syria, ⅞ypt <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi>
                    Nubia, and North Africa, and in Europe, along the coast of the Mediterranean,
                    and as far north as Germany, Holland, and France. According to Shaw, <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in Barbary,</hi> lentils are dressed in that country in
                    the same manner as beans; and in Egypt and Syria the parched seeds are exposed
                    for sale in shops, and esteemed the best food to carry on long journeys. Lentils
                    form a chief ingredient in the Spanish <hi rend="italic">puchero,</hi> and are
                    used in a similar way in France and other countries. For this purpose they are
                    usually sold in the shelled state.</p>
                <p>The reddish variety of the lentil (“lentilion d’hiver ”) is the kind most
                    esteemed in Paris on account of the superior flavour of its smaller seeds. It is
                    sown in autumn either with a cereal crop or alone, and is cultivated chiefly in
                    the north and east of France. The large or common variety, “lentille large
                    blonde,” cultivated in Lorraine and at Gallardon (Eure-et-Loir), and largely in
                    Germany, is the most productive, but is less esteemed. This kind has very small
                    whitish flowers, two or rarely three on a footstalk, and the pods are generally
                    one-seeded, the seeds being of a whitish or cream colour, about f of an inch
                    broad and ∣ inch thick. A single plant produces from 100 to 150 pods, which are
                    flattened, about i inch long and ⅜ inch broad. Another variety, with seeds
                    similar in form and colour to the last, but of much smaller size, is known as
                    the “lentillon de Mars.” It is sown in spring. This variety and the “lentille
                    large” are both sometimes called the “lentille à la reine.” A small variety,
                    “lentille verte du Puy,” cultivated chiefly in the departments of Haute Loire
                    and Cantal, is also grown as a vegetable and for forage. The Egyptian lentil was
                    introduced into Britain in 1820. It has blue flowers. Another species of lentil,
                    <hi rend="italic">E. mοnαnthοs,</hi> L., is grown in France about Orleans and
                    elsewhere under the name of “jarosse” and “jarande.” It is, according to Μ.
                    Vilmorin, one of the best kinds of green food to grow on a poor dry sandy soil;
                    on calcareous soil it does not succeed so well. It is usually sown in autumn
                    with a little rye or winter oats, at the rate of a hectolitre to a hectare.</p>
                <p>The lentil also prefers a light warm sandy soil; on rich land it runs to leaf and
                    produces but few pods. The seeds are sown in March or April or early in May,
                    according to the climate of the country, as they cannot endure night frosts. If
                    for fodder they are sown broadcast, but in drills if the ripe seeds are
                    required. The pods are gathered in August or September, as soon as they begin to
                    turn brown,—the plants being pulled up like flax while the foliage is still
                    green, and on a dry day lest the pods split in drying and loss of seed takes
                    place. Lentils keep best in the husk so far as flavour is concerned, and will
                    keep good in this way for two years either for sowing or for food. An acre of
                    ground yields on an average about 11 cwt. of seed and 30 cwt. of straw. The
                    amount and character of the mineral matter requisite in the soil may be judged
                    from the analysis of the ash, which in the seeds has as its chief ingredients—
                    potash 34 ’ 6 per cent., soda 9’5, lime 6 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3,
                    phosphoric acid 36’2, chloride of sodium 7 '6, while in the straw the
                    percentages are— potash 10 ’ 8, lime 52 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3, silica
                    17 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6, phosphoric acid 12 ’ 3, chloride of sodium
                    2'1.</p>
                <p>Lentils have recently attracted some notice among vegetarians as a food material.
                    A Hindoo proverb says, “Bice is good, but lentils are my life.” But in England
                    they have been reputed difficult of digestion and apt to disorder the bowels and
                    injure the sight. The husk of the seed is certainly indigestible, and to cook
                    lentils properly requires at least two and a half hours, bur undoubtedly they
                    are richer in nutritious matter than almost any other kind of pulse, containing,
                    according to Payen ’ s analysis, 25‘2 per cent, of nitrogenous matter (legumin),
                    56 per cent, of starch, and 2’6 per cent, of fatty matter. Fresenius’s analysis
                    differs in giving only 35 per cent, of starch; Einhoff gives 32 ’ 81 of starch
                    and 37'82 per cent, of nitrogenous matter. Lentils are more properly the food of
                    the poor in all countries where they are grown, and have often been spurned when
                    better food could be obtained, hence the proverb “Dives factus jam desiit
                    gaudere lente.” The seeds are said to be good for pigeons, or mixed in a ground
                    state with potatoes or barley for fattening pigs. The herbage is highly esteemed
                    as green food for suckling ewes and all kinds of cattle (being said to increase
                    the yield of milk), also for calves and lambs. Haller says that lentils are so
                    flatulent as to kill horses. They were also believed to be the cause of severe
                    scrofulous disorders common in Egypt. This bad reputation may possibly be due to
                    the substitution of the seeds of the bitter vetch or tare lentil, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ervum Ervilia,</hi> L., a plant which closely resembles the true
                    lentil in height, habit, flower, and pod, but whose seeds are without doubt
                    possessed of deleterious properties—producing weakness, or, accord ing to
                    Lindley, even paralysis of the extremities in horses which have partaken of
                    them.</p>
                <p>A few years ago some cases of poisoning of pigs were traced by Mr W. Southall of
                    Birmingham to the use of the seed of this plant in their food; it had been
                    imported from Turkey under the name of <hi rend="italic">rοvi,</hi> and was sold
                    in England under the name of Egyptian pease. The chief symptom produced was
                    severe vomiting, followed by speedy death. The poisonous principle seems to
                    reside chiefly in the bitter seed coat, and can apparently be removed by
                    steeping in water, since Gerard, speaking of the “bitter vetch” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ervum Ervilia),</hi> says “kine in Asia and in most other
                    countries do eat thereof, being made sweet by steeping in water.” The seed of
                    <hi rend="italic">Ervum Ervilia</hi> is about the same size and almost exactly
                    of the same reddish-brown colour as that of the Egyptian lentil, and when the
                    seed coat is removed they are both of the same orange red hue, but the former is
                    not so bright as the latter. The shape is the best means of distinguishing the
                    two seeds, that of <hi rend="italic">E. Ervilia</hi> being obtusely
                    triangular.</p>
