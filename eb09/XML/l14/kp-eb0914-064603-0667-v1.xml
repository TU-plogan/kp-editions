                <p><label type="entry">LIMBUS</label>. The <hi rend="italic">Limbus Infantum</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">Puerorum</hi> in rnediaeval theology is the “margin” or
                    “border” (limbus) of hell to which human beings dying without actual sin, but
                    with their original sin unwashed away by baptism, were held to be consigned; the
                    category included, not unbaptized infants merely, but also idiots, cretins, and
                    the like. The word “limbus,” in the theological application, occurs first in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Summa</hi> of Thomas Aquinas; for its extensive currency
                    it is perhaps most indebted to the <hi rend="italic">Commedia</hi> of Dante
                    (Zn∕., c. 4). The question as to the destiny of infants dying unbaptized
                    presented itself to theologians at a comparatively early period, and received
                    very various answers. Generally speaking it may be said that the Greek fathers
                    inclined to a cheerful and the Latin to a gloomy view. Thus Gregory of Nazianzus
                        <hi rend="italic">{Orat.</hi> 40) says “that such children as die unbaptized
                    without their own fault shall neither be glorified nor punished by the righteous
                    Judge, as having done no wickedness, though they die unbaptized, and as rather
                    suffering loss than being the authors of it.” Similar opinions have been
                    expressed by Gregory of Nyssa, Severus of Antioch, and others,— opinions which
                    it is almost impossible to distinguish from the Pelagian view that children
                    dying unbaptized might be admitted to eternal life, though not to the kingdom of
                    God. In his recoil from Pelagian heresy, Augustine was compelled to sharpen the
                    antithesis between the state of the saved and that of the lost, and taught that
                    there are only two alternatives,—to be with Christ or with the devil, to be with
                    Him or against Him. Following up, as he thought, his master’s teaching,
                    Fulgentius declared that it is to be believed as an indubitable truth that, “not
                    only men who have come to the use of reason, but infants dying, whether in their
                    mother’s womb or after birth, without baptism in the name of the Father, Son,
                    and Holy Ghost, are punished with everlasting punishment in eternal fire.” Later
                    theologians and schoolmen followed Augustine in rejecting the notion of any
                    final position intermediate between heaven and hell, but otherwise inclined with
                    practical unanimity to take the mildest possible view of the destiny of the
                    irresponsible and unbaptized. Thus the proposition of Innocent III. that “the
                    punishment of original sin is deprivation of the vision of God” is practically
                    homologated by Thomas, Scotus, and all the other great theologians of the
                    scholastic period, the only outstanding exception being that of Gregory of
                    Rimini, who on this account was afterwards called “tortor infantum.” The first
                    authoritative declaration of the Latin Church upon this subject was that made by
                    the second council of Lyons (1274), and confirmed by the council of Florence
                    (1439), with the concurrence of the representatives of the Greek Church, to the
                    effect that “the souls of those who die in mortal sin or in original sin only
                    forthwith descend into hell, but to be punished with unequal punishments.”
                    Perrone remarks <hi rend="italic">(Prael.</hi><hi rend="italic">Theol.,</hi> pt.
                    iii. chap. 6, art. 4) that the damnation of infants and also the comparative
                    lightness of the punishment involved in this are thus <hi rend="italic">de
                        fide</hi>; but nothing is determined as to the place which they occupy in
                    hell, as to what constitutes the disparity of their punishment, or as to their
                    condition after the day of judgment. In the council of Trent there was
                    considerable difference of opinion as to what was implied in deprivation of the
                    vision of God, and no definition was attempted, the Dominicans maintaining the
                    severer view that the “limbus infantum” was a dark subterranean fireless
                    chamber, while the Franciscans placed it in a lightsome locality above the
                    earth. Some theologians continue to maintain with Bellarmine that the infants
                    “in limbo” are affected with some degree of sadness on account of a felt
                    privation; others, following Sfrondati, hold that they enjoy every kind of
                    natural felicity, as regards their souls now, and as regards their bodies after
                    the resurrection, just as if Adam had not sinned. In the condemnation (1794) of
                    the synod of Pistoia (1786), the twenty-sixth article declares it to be false,
                    rash, and injurious to treat as Pelagian the doctrine that those dying in
                    original sin are not punished with fire, as if that meant that there is an
                    intermediate place, free from fault and punishment, between the kingdom of God
                    and everlasting damnation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Limbus Patrzιm, Limbus</hi><hi rend="italic">Inferni,</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Abrahae</hi> is defined in
                    Roman Catholic theology as the place in the underworld where the saints of the
                    Old Testament were confined until liberated by Christ on his “descent into
                    hell.” Regarding the locality, and its pleasantness or painfulness, nothing has
                    been taught as <hi rend="italic">de fide,</hi> and opinions have been various.
                    It is sometimes regarded as having been closed and empty since Christ’s descent,
                    but other authors do not think of it as separate in place from the <hi
                        rend="italic">limbus infantum.</hi> The whole idea, in the Latin Church, has
                    been justly described as the mere caput mortuum of the old catholic doctrine of
                    hades, which was gradually superseded in the West by that of purgatory.</p>
