                    rend="smallcaps">Jean Joseph</hi> (1811-1877), one of the greatest astronomers
                    of modern times, was born at St Lô in Normandy, March 11, 1811. His father, who
                    held a small post under Government, made great efforts to send him to Paris,
                    where a brilliant examination gained him, in 1831, admittance to the École
                    Polytechnique. The distinction of his career there was rewarded with a free
                    choice amongst the departments of the public service open to pupils of the
                    school. He selected the administration of tobaccos, addressing himself
                    especially to chemical researches under the guidance of Gay-Lussac, and gave
                    striking proof of ability in two papers on the combinations of phosphorus with
                    hydrogen and oxygen, published in <hi rend="italic">Annales de Chimie et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Physique</hi> (1835 and 1837). His astronomical vocation, like
                    that of Kepler, came from without. The place of teacher of that science at the
                    École Polytechnique falling vacant in 1837, it was offered to and accepted by
                    Leverrier, who, “docile to circumstance,” instantly abandoned chemistry, and
                    directed the whole of his powers to celestial mechanics. The first fruits of his
                    arduous labours were contained in two memoirs presented to the Academy,
                    September 16 and October 14, 1839. Pursuing the investigations of Laplace, he
                    demonstrated with greater rigour the stability of the solar system, and
                    calculated the limits within which the eccentricities and inclinations of the
                    planetary orbits vary. This remarkable début excited much attention, and, on the
                    recommendation of Arago, he took in hand the theory of Mercury, producing, in
                    1843, tables of that planet far superior in accuracy to those hitherto
                    available. The perturbations of the comets discovered, the one by Faye in
                    November 1843, the other by De Vico a year later, were minutely investigated by
                    Leverrier, with the result of disproving the supposed identity of the first with
                    Lexell’s lost comet of 1770, and of the other with Tycho’s of 1585. On the other
                    hand, he made it appear all but certain that Vico’s comet was the same with one
                    seen by Lahire in 1678.</p>

                <p>He was once more, by the summons of Arago, recalled to planetary studies, and
                    this time it was to Uranus that his attention was directed. Step by step, with
                    sagacious and patient accuracy, he advanced to the great discovery which has
                    immortalized his name. Carefully sifting all the known causes of disturbance, he
                    showed that one hitherto unknown must be added to their number, and on the 23d
                    of September 1846 the planet Neptune was discerned by Calle at Berlin, within
                    one degree of the spot indicated by Leverrier. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Astronomy,</hi> p. 813.</p>
                <p>This memorable achievement was greeted with an outburst of public enthusiasm, and
                    requited with a shower of public distinctions. Academies vied with each other in
                    enrolling Leverrier among their members; the Royal Society awarded him the
                    Copley medal: the king of Denmark sent him the order of the Dannebrog; he was
                    named officer in the Legion of Honour, and preceptor to the Comte de Paris; a
                    chair of astronomy was created for his benefit at the Faculty of Sciences; he
                    was appointed adjunct astronomer to the Bureau of Longitudes. Returned to the
                    Legislative Assembly in 1849 by his native department of Manche, he voted with
                    the anti-republican party, but devoted his principal attention to subjects
                    connected with science and education. After the <hi rend="italic">coup
                    &lt;Tetat</hi> he became a senator and inspector-general of superior
                    instruction, sat upon the commission for the reform of the École Polytechnique
                    (1854), and, on January 30, 1854, succeeded Arago as director of the Paris
                    observatory. His official work in the latter capacity would alone have strained
                    the energies of an ordinary man. The institution had fallen into a state of
                    lamentable inefficiency. Leverrier placed it on a totally new footing, freed it
                    from the control of the Bureau of Longitudes, and raised it to its due rank
                    among the observatories of Europe. He did not, however, escape the common lot of
                    reformers. His uncompromising measures and unconciliatory manner of enforcing
                    them raised a storm only appeased by his removal, February 5, 1870. Three years
                    later, on the death of his successor Delaunay, he was reinstated by M. Thiers,
                    but with authority restricted by the supervision of a council. In the midst of
                    these disquietudes, he executed with unflinching resolution a task the gigantic
                    proportions of which cannot be contemplated without amazement. This was nothing
                    less than the complete revision of the planetary theories, together with a
                    laborious comparison of results with the most authentic observations, and the
                    construction of tables representing the movements thus corrected. It required
                    all his indomitable perseverance to carry through to the end a purpose which
                    failing health continually menaced with frustration. He had, however, the
                    happiness of living long enough to perfect his work. Three weeks after he had
                    affixed his signature to the printed sheets of the theory of Neptune he died at
                    Paris, in his sixty-seventh year, September 23, 1877. By his marriage with
                    Mademoiselle Choquet, who survived him little more than a month, he left a son
                    and daughter.</p>
                <p>The discovery with which the memory of this great man is popularly identified was
                    only an incident in his career. The elaboration of the scheme of the heavens
                    traced out by Laplace in the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste</hi> was its
                    larger aim, for the accomplishment of which forty years of unremitting industry
                    barely sufficed. The work once done, however, may almost be said to have been
                    done for all time, from the extraordinary care with which errors were guarded
                    against, and imperfections in the data allowed for. The organization of the
                    meteorological service in France is entirely due to Leverrier, and the present
                    system of international weather-warnings is the realization of a design which he
                    warmly promoted. He founded the Association Scientifique, and was active in
                    introducing a practical scientific element into public education. His inference
                    of the existence, between Mercury and the sun, of an appreciable quantity of
                    circulating matter <hi rend="italic">(Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1859, ii. p. 379),
                    though unquestionably sound, has not yet been satisfactorily verified by
                    observation. He was twice, in 1868 and 1876, the recipient of the gold medal of
                    the Royal Astronomical Society, London, and the university of Cambridge
                    conferred upon him, in 1875, the honorary degree of LL.D. All his planetary
                    tables have been adopted by the <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac,</hi> as well
                    as by the <hi rend="italic">Connaissance</hi><hi rend="italic">des
