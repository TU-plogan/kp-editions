                    S.W. by Warwickshire, and N.W. by Derbyshire. It lies between 52° 24' and 52°
                    59' N. lat., and between 0° 39' and 1° 37' W. long. It has the form of an
                    irregular hexagon, its greatest length being about 41 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth about 40 miles. The area comprehends 511,719 acres, or nearly 800 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The surface of the county is an undulating table-land, the highest eminences
                    being the rugged Charnwood hills in the north-west, one of which, Bardon Hill,
                    has an elevation of 902 feet. The county belongs chiefly to the basin of the
                    Trent, which forms for a short distance its boundary with Derbyshire. The
                    principal tributary of the Trent in Leicestershire is the Soar, from whose old
                    designation the <hi rend="italic">Leire</hi> the county is said to derive its
                    name, and which rises near Hinckley and flows beyond Kegworth. The Wreak, which
                    under the name of the Eye rises on the borders of Rutland, flows south-westward
                    to the Soar, and is connected with the canal navigation. Besides the Soar the
                    other tributaries of the Trent are the Anker, the Devon, and the Mease. The Avon
                    after receiving the Swift passes into Warwickshire to join the Severn, and the
                    Welland forms for some distance the boundary between Leicester and Northampton.
                    The principal canals are the Union and Grand Union, which with their various
                    branches are connected with the Grand Junction canal in Northamptonshire, and
                    the Ashby-de-la-Zouch canal, which crosses the western corner of the county to
                    Nuneaton, where it joins the Coventry canal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> An irregularly shaped district of country south
                    of the valley of the Trent and adjoining Derbyshire is occupied by Carboniferous
                    rocks, forming the Leicestershire coal-field. In the north-west Charnwood forest
                    is formed of crystalline and slaty rocks, of special interest to geologists,
                    since, as they contain no fossils and occupy an isolated position, it is
                    impossible to determine their age, although they have been variously classed as
                    Cambrian, Silurian, and Laurentian. Further south, the remainder of the county
                    to the west of the river Soar is occupied chiefly by red sandstone rocks of
                    Triassic age, while to the east a blue clay of the same age, mixed with marl,
                    predominates. In several districts, especially in the north-east, there are beds
                    of limestone of Oolite age, and drift deposits overlie all the other formations.
                    At Whitwick there is a remarkable vein of dolerite lying between the
                    Coal-measures and the New Red Sandstone. The Coal-measures, which underlie the
                    New Red Sandstone, are workable in the western and eastern districts of Moira
                    and Coleorton, the total area of productive coal extending to 15 square <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n443/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0443-0424"/> miles. The available coal in the Moira district
                    is estimated at over 450,000,000 tons, and in the Coleorton district at over
                    380,000,000 tons. In 1870 the amount of coal produced was 599,450 tons, but for
                    some years it has exceeded 1,000,000 tons, the number of collieries being about
                    thirty. At a depth of 593 feet in the Moira coal-field there is a spring of
                    salt-water, the brine of which is brought to Ashby-de-la-Zouch for use in
                    scorbutic and rheumatic affections. Limestone is worked in various portions of
                    the county, freestone is plentiful, gypsum is found, and a kind of granite,
                    which is extensively used for paving purposes, is obtained at Charnwood forest,
                    Mount-Sorrel, Sapcote, and Stoney-Stanton.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is mild, and, on account of the
                    inland position of the county, and the absence of any very high elevations, the
                    rainfall is very moderate. The soil is of a loamy character, the richest
                    district being that to the east of the Soar, which is occupied by pasture, while
                    the corn crops are grown chiefly on a lighter soil resting above the Red
                    Sandstone formation. The following table gives a classification of holdings
                    according to size, with the area under each class of holding :—</p>

                <p>A large number of the holdings between 100 and 300 acres are possessed by owners
                    who farm their own land. In 1881 the total area of arable land was 473,998
                    acres, of which 91,952 were under corn crop, 22,033 under green crop, 25,302
                    rotation grasses, 317,869 permanent pasture, and 16,842 fallow; 740 acres were
                    under orchards, 345 market gardens, 125 nursery grounds, and 11,252 woods. It
                    will be observed that the proportion of pasture is very great. The pasture land
                    is especially rich along the banks of the rivers. Of corn crops 33,675 acres
                    were under wheat, 27,724 barley, and 23,330 oats. The number of cows in 1881 was
                    33,863, the total number of cattle being 123,681, an average of 26 to every 100
                    acres under cultivation, the average for England being 16‘9. Th⅛re are many
                    dairy farms for the manufacture of cheese, the famous Stilton cheese being made
                    near Melton Mowbray. Horses numbered 18,085, the number used for agricultural
                    purposes being 12,243. The breed was much improved by the importation by the
                    well-known agriculturist Bakewell of mares from Flanders. As the county is famed
                    for fox-hunting, there are many excellent riding horses. The number of sheep in
                    1881 was 263,383, an average of 51 to every 100 acres under cultivation, the
                    average for England being 62 ’ 4. The famous New Leicesters, introduced by
                    Bakewell, are the most common, but the Old Leicesters are still bred, and there
                    is also a race of sheep peculiar to Charnwood forest. Pigs in 1881 numbered
                    21,765. According to the return of 1874, the land in 1872-73 was divided among
                    13,848 proprietors, possessing 519,524 acres, with an annual rental of
                    £1,493,378, 10s. Of the owners only 35 per cent, possessed more than 1 acre, and
                    the average value per acre all over was <hi rend="italic">£2,</hi> 16s. Among
                    the principal proprietors are the duke of Rutland, possessing 30,109 acres; Lord
                    Donington, 10,174; Earl Howe, 9755; the earl of Stamford and Warrington, 9012;
                    and the earl of Dysart, 8420.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> The staple manufacture of the county is
                    hosiery, for which the wool is obtained chiefly from home-bred sheep. Its
                    principal seats are Leicester, Hinckley, and Loughborough. Cotton hose are
                    likewise made, and the other industries include the manufacture of boots and
                    shoes, elastic webbing, silk plush for hats and lace, agricultural implements,
                    bricks and pottery, and artificial manures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Leicestershire comprises
                    six “hundreds,” the municipal and parliamentary borough of Leicester (122,351),
                    and five other towns with a population of over 5000, viz., Loughborough
                    (14,733), Hinckley, partly in Warwickshire (7673), Ashby-de-la-Zouch (7465),
                    Melton Mowbray (5766), and Market Harborough(5350). The population of thecounty,
                    which in 1801 was only 130,030, was 215,867 in 1841, 269,311 in 1871, and
                    321,018 (155,429 males and 165,589 females) in 1881, the increase within the
                    last ten years being 19 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 2 per cent.</p>
                <p>The county returns six members to Parliament,—two for North and two for South
                    Leicestershire, and two for the borough of Leicester. It has one court of
                    quarter sessions, and is separated into nine petty sessional divisions, with
                    which the police divisions are nearly identical. The borough of Leicester has a
                    commission of the peace, a separate court of quarter sessions, and also its own
                    police. The county is almost wholly in the diocese of Peterborough, and contains
                    331 civil parishes, townships, or places, as well as parts of other parishes. It
                    is included in the Midland circuit, and assizes and quarter sessions are held at
                    Leicester.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Before the Roman invasion
                    Leicestershire was inhabited by the Coritani, and under the Romans it formed
                    part of the province of <hi rend="italic">Flavia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Caesariensis.</hi> The principal Roman roads are the Watling Street, which
                    forms for 20 miles the south-west boundary of the county from Dovebridge near
                    the Avon to near Atherstone, where it enters Warwickshire; tire Fosse road from
                    Lincolnshire, which enters the county at Six Hills, and passes by Leicester to
                    Watling Street; the <hi rend="italic">Via I&gt;evana</hi> from Colchester, which
                    enters the county near Medbourne, and joins the Fosse at Leicester on its way to
                    Chester. The principal Roman stations were <hi rend="italic">Ratae</hi>
                    (Leicester), <hi rend="italic">Verometum</hi> (supposed to have been Borough

                    >Benoncs</hi> (High-cross). Roman coins, urns, tesselated pavements, military
                    weapons, and domestic utensils and other remains have been found in several
                    places, especially at Leicester, Rothley, Wanlip, Harby, Bottesford, Hinckley,
                    Sapcote, and Melton Mowbray. Two miles from Leicester a Roman milestone of the
                    time of the emperor Hadrian was discovered in 1771. Under the Heptarchy
                    Leicester was included in the kingdom of Mercia. Afterwards it was overrun by
                    the Danes, from whom it was recovered by Ethelfleda. The most noteworthy event
                    connected with the county was the battle ot Bosworth Field, where Richard III.
                    was slain 22d August 1485; but it was frequently the scene of contests in the
                    reigns of John and of Henry III. and during the Revolution period.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leicester,</hi> a municipal and parliamentary borough and
                    market-town of England, and the chief town of the county of Leicester, is
                    situated at the intersection of several railway lines, in a gentle hollow on the
                    river Soar, 97 miles north-north-west of London, and 27 south of Nottingham. The
                    town is well built, the streets are spacious <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n444/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0444-0425"/> and regular, and the sanitary and water
                    arrangements are very satisfactory. The most important of the churches are St
                    Martin’s, near the site of an old Franciscan convent, restored in 1881 at a cost
                    of £20,000; St Mary’s, Early English and Norman, originally built in the 12th
                    century, and restored in 1861 at a cost of £10,000; All Saints, an ancient
                    structure in the Early English style, restored in 1875; St Margaret’s, a
                    beautiful and spacious building erected in 1444, Early English and Decorated,
                    recently restored at a cost of £6000; and St Nicholas’s, in the Early Norman
                    style. Of the old castle two gateways are still standing, and also a portion of
                    the Norman Hall. The other principal buildings are the old town-hall, formerly
                    the guild-hall of Corpus Christi, the new town-hall erected in 1875, the town
                    museum, the school of art, and the public baths, erected in 1879 at a cost of
                    £11,000. One of the ornaments of the town is the memorial clock-tower erected in
                    1868 in honour of Simon de Montfort and three other less known persons connected
                    with the district. In the neighbourhood of the town are the remains of the abbey
                    of Black Canons, founded in 1143. On the site of St Margaret’s church was the
                    old Saxon cathedral, and in the adjoining abbey Cardinal Wolsey was buried.
                    Besides Trinity Hospital, founded in 1331 by Henry Plantagenet, earl of
                    Leicester, and Wyggeston’s Hospital, founded in 1513, there are a large number
                    of minor charities. There is a fine promenade from the town to the Victoria park
                    and racecourse, in addition to which the Abbey park of 40 acres has lately been
                    opened. The staple trade of Leicester is hosiery, including stockings and all
                    kinds of fancy goods. There are also iron-foundries, and manufactures of boots
                    and shoes, elastic webs, and sewing cotton. The population of the municipal and
                    parliamentary borough, 17,005 in 1801, had increased in 1871 to 95,220, and in
                    1881 to 122,351.</p>
                <p>Leicester was an ancient British town, and under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ratae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Raliscorion</hi> an important Roman station. It
                    was also one of the five old Danish burghs, and until 874 it was an
                    ecclesiastical see. Its charter of incorporation was obtained from King John,
                    and from the 23d of Edward I. it returned two members to parliament. Parliaments
                    were held in the town by Henry V. in 1414 and by Henry VI. in 1426. Richard
                    III., who passed anight in it on his way to the fatal battle of Bosworth, was
                    buried in the Franciscan convent. The town was stormed by Charles I., May 31,
                    1645, and recovered by Fairfax in the June following. See the <hi rend="italic"
