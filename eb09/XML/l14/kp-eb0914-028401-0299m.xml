                    (1828-1877), the historian who has done the most to destroy the Napoleonic
                    legend of M. Thiers, was born at Chambery, the capital of Savoy, on the 26th
                    October 1828. His father came of a warlike race, which had been noble for four
                    centuries, and had himself served in the army of Napoleon as a captain of
                    hussars. On the fall of Napoleon he had left the French army, and retired to
                    Chambéry, where he married a milliner. When young Pierre was but six years old,
                    his father died, cursing the priest who came to bring him consolation, and his
                    education was left to his mother. She sent him first to the Jesuit collçge of
                    Chambéry, from which he was expelled for writing an attack on the Jesuits, then
                    to another ecclesiastical seminary, which equally disgusted him, and at last to
                    the Lycée Bourbon at Paris. After completing his studies at Paris he went to
                    Grenoble in 1847 to study law, and while there took the keenest interest in the
                    Revolution of 1848 at Paris. Even at that age he shows in his letters the hatred
                    of democracy which was always to characterize his sincere love of liberty, and
                    above all his intense feeling that Paris should not always dominate the
                    provinces. His law studies finished at Grenoble, he went to Turin, and qualified
                    himself to act as <hi rend="italic">avocat</hi> in his native country; but, on
                    the news of the coup d’état, his passion to go to Paris and take his part in the
                    inevitable struggle which he saw must arise between the second empire and the
                    spirit of liberty was not to be restrained, and in 1853 he once more took up his
                    abode in Paris. He at first tried in vain to get work on various newspapers, and
                    then to get his first book, which had been sketched out for some years,
                    published. No publisher was to be found, and <hi rend="italic">HÉglise et les
                    Philosophes au XVIIIièrne Siècle</hi> was printed eventually at his own expense.
                    It appeared in 1855, and at once achieved a great success, and introduced its
                    author to some of the best literary society in Paris. It was followed in 1857 by
                    an <hi rend="italic">Essai sur la Dévolution française,</hi> and in 1860 by the
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire politique des Papes,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres TÉverard.</hi> The latter are a revelation of what Lanfrey thought and
                    felt at this time, of his despair that France would ever get free from the
                    enervating rule of the second empire, of his disgust at the literary sterility
                    of the time in confining itself to vague philosophy and vaguer criticism; and
                    through them he first became known outside the literary world. He had hitherto
                    been intimate with such choice spirits as Ary Scheffer, Gleyre, and the Comtesse
                    d’Agoult, better known as Daniel Stern, but the <hi rend="italic">Lettres
                    d’Êverard</hi> introduced him to the most fashionable Parisian society of the
                    time, and the position he held in it is best to be found in the description of
                    him contained in the souvenirs of his friend, Madame Clara Jaubert. In 1860 also
                    he was appointed by M. Charpentier editor of the new <hi rend="italic">Pevue
                    National,</hi> in which he wrote the fortnightly chronicle of affairs for four
                    years, besides various articles and reviews, collected in 1864 under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Études et Portraits politiques.</hi> After resigning his
                    editorship in 1864 he set to work on his great <hi rend="italic">Histoire de
                    Napoléon</hi><hi rend="italic">I.,</hi> in which he intended to overthrow the
                    monument M. Thiers had erected to Napoleon in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire du
                    Consulat et</hi><hi rend="italic">de UEmpire,</hi> and to show the demigod uncle
                    of Napoleon III. to have been but an immoral man and bad politician. The fourth
                    volume of his history had not been published three months when the war of 1870
                    broke out. At first Lanfrey knew not what view to take, but on the defeats of
                    the French, and the declaration of the republic, he enlisted as a simple
                    volunteer, and marched to Lyons with his battalion. While there he heard first
                    that his vigorous opposition in the press to the powerful influence of M.
                    Gambetta had lost him his election to the Constituent Assembly in his native
                    province, and next that he had been elected by the department of the Bouches du
                    Rhone, in which he had never set foot. In the Assembly he warmly supported the
                    Government of M. Thiers, and opposed the radical party as vehemently as he had
                    opposed the empire, saying that both savoured of tyranny. In 1871 M. Thiers
                    appointed him French minister in Switzerland, where he remained till 1874, when
                    he insisted on his resignation being accepted by the Duc de Broglie, and once
                    more took his seat as a moderate republican. In 1875 he published the fifth
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de Napoleon,</hi>
                    and in 1876 was elected a life senator; but his strength was fast failing, and,
                    before he could give his sixth volume the careful revision he considered
                    indispensable, he died at Pau on the 16th November 1877.</p>
                <p>The first predominant idea of Lanfrey, both as a politician and an historian, was
                    a love of liberty which was perpetually putting him in opposition to all parties
                    in turn. In his first book he attacked the church, not because of its doctrines
                    so much as because of its attempts to stifle liberty of thought. In his Essai
                    sur la Révolution, on the other hand, he assailed Robespierre and the democrats
                    because they defended attempts on individual liberty with the assertion that
                    they were necessary for liberty in general. His second leading idea was a belief
                    in strictest morality in politics; by this standard in his Études he condemns Μ.
                    Thiers for slurring over the political immorality of Napoleon, Daunou for giving
                    up his old Girondin standpoint to defend the concordat, and Carnot for putting
                    his name to measures of the committee of public safety which he abhorred, in
                    order to maintain himself in power. These two ideas, love of liberty, involving
                    a hatred alike of despotism and democracy, and a stern standard of political
                    morality, are to be seen throughout Lanfrey’s great work on Napoleon. No
                    military success ever to him seems to compensate for immoral means to gain an
                    end; no glamour is for him cast over evil actions by glory or fine words; no
                    sarcasm is too severe for the man who cared not for truth but only for effect.
                    Before such a judge Napoleon appears but a small man; and, if at times the
                    judgment seems almost too severe, it must be remembered that the author lived
                    through a time when an emperor ruled entirely owing to the influence that the
                    great deeds of his uncle had thrown over the minds of the French people, and
                    that he wrote with the intention of for ever breaking down that influence by
                    exhibiting the naked truth, and destroying for ever the Napoleonic legend.</p>
