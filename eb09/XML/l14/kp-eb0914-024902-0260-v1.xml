                <p><label type="entry">LAMPREY</label>, a fish belonging to the family <hi
                        rend="italic">Petromyzon-</hi><hi rend="italic">tidae</hi> (from τreτpoς and
                        <hi rend="italic">μυζω;</hi> literally, stone-suckers), which with the
                    hag-fishes or <hi rend="italic">Afyxinidae</hi> forms a distinct subclass of
                    fishes, the <hi rend="italic">Cyclοstomata,</hi> distinguished by the low
                    organization of their skeleton, which is cartilaginous, without vertebral
                    segmentation, without ribs or real jaws, and without limbs. The lampreys are
                    readily recognized by their long, eel-like, scaleless body, terminating
                    anteriorly in the circular, suctorial mouth which is characteristic of the whole
                    subclass. On each side, behind the head, there is a row of seven branchial
                    openings, through which the water is conveyed to and from the gills. By means of
                    their mouth they fasten themselves to stones, boats, &lt;fcc∙., as well as to
                    other fishes, their object being to obtain a resting place on the former, whilst
                    they attach themselves to the latter for the purpose of deriving nourishment
                    from them. The inner surface of their cup-shaped mouth is armed with pointed
                    teeth, with which they perforate the integuments of the fish attacked, scraping
                    off particles of the flesh and sucking the blood. Mackerel, cod, pollack, and
                    flat-fishes are the kinds most frequently attacked by them in the sea; of
                    river-fish the migratory <hi rend="italic">Salmonidae</hi> and the shad are
                    sometimes found with the marks of the teeth of the lamprey, or with the fish
                    actually attached to them. About ten species are known from the coasts and
                    rivers of the temperate regions of the northern and southern hemispheres. In
                    Great Britain and Europe generally, three species occur, of which the two
                    larger, if not all three, are met with also in North America, viz., the large
                    spotted Sealamprey <hi rend="italic">{Petromyzon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >marinus);</hi> the River-lamprey or Lampern (F. <hi rend="italic"
                        >fluviatilis)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the Small Lampern or “Pride”
                    or “Sand-Piper” (P. <hi rend="italic">branchialis).</hi> The first two are
                    migratory, entering rivers in the spring to spawn; of the river-lamprey,
                    however, specimens are met with in fresh water all the year round. Lampreys,
                    especially the sealamprey, are esteemed as food, and were formerly even more so
                    than at present; but their flesh is not easy of digestion. Henry I. is said to
                    have fallen a victim to this, his favourite dish. The species of greatest use is
                    the river-lamprey, which as bait is preferred to all others in the cod and
                    turbot fisheries of the North Sea. Yarrell states that formerly the Thames alone
                    supplied from 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 lamperns annually, but their number has so
                    much fallen off that, for instance, in 1876 only 40,000 were sold to the
                    cod-fishers. That year, however, was an unusually bad year: the lamperns, from
                    their scarcity, fetched £8, 10s. a thousand, whilst in ordinary years <hi
                        rend="italic">£5</hi> is considered a fair price. The season for catching
                    lamperns closes in the Thames about the middle of March. The origin of the name
                    lamprey is obscure; its Latinized form <hi rend="italic">Lampetra,</hi> which
                    occurs in all ichthyological works of the Middle Ages, was unknown in classical
                    times; and its derivation from <hi rend="italic">lambere petras</hi> is a
                    specimen of etymological ingenuity. The development of lampreys has received
                    much attention on the part of naturalists, since Aug. Müller discovered that
                    they undergo a metamorphosis, and that the minute worm-like lamperns previously
                    known under the name of <hi rend="italic">Ammοc&lt;xtes,</hi> and abundant in
                    the sand and mud of many streams, were nothing but the undeveloped young of the
                    river-lampreys and small lamperns. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
