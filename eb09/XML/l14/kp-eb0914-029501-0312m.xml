                <p><label type="entry">LÂO-TSZE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Laou-tsze</hi></label>, the
                    designation of the author of the celebrated treatise called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tao Teh Hing,</hi> and the reputed founder of the religion called <hi
                    rend="italic">Taoism.</hi> The Chinese characters composing the designation may
                    mean either “the Old Son,” which commonly assumes with foreigners the form of
                    “the Old Boy,” or “the Old Philosopher.” The latter significance is attached to
                    them by the Rev. Dr Chalmers in his translation of the treatise published in
                    1868 under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Speculations on Metaphysics,
                    Polity, and Morality of “the Old Philosopher,” Ldo-tsze.</hi> The former is
                    derived from a fabulous account of Lâo-tsze which appeared in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shän</hi><hi rend="italic">Hsien Chwan,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> il</hi> The Account of Spirits and Immortals,” of Ko Hung, in our
                    4th century. According to this, his mother, after a supernatural conception,
                    carried him in her womb sixty-two years (or seventy-two, or eighty-one—ten years
                    more or fewer are of little importance in such a case), so that, when he was
                    born at last, his hair was white as with age, and people might well call him
                    “the old boy.” The other meaning of the designation rests on better authority.
                    We find it in the <hi rend="italic">Kid</hi><hi rend="italic">Yü,</hi> or
                    “Narratives of the Confucian School,” compiled in our 3d century from documents
                    said to have been preserved among the descendants of Confucius, and also in the
                    brief history of Lao-tzse given in the historical records of Sze-ma Ch’ien
                    (about 100 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> In the latter instance the
                    designation is used by Confucius, and possibly it originated with him. It should
                    be regarded more as an epithet of respect than of years, and is equivalent to
                    “the Venerable Philosopher.”</p>
                <p>All that Ch’ien tells us about Lâo-tsze goes into small compass. His surname was
                    Li, and his name Urh. He was a native of the state of Ch’û, and was born in a
                    hamlet, which we must place not far from the present prefectural city of
                    Kwei-teh in Ho-nan province. What is of more importance, he was one of the
                    recorders or historiographers at the court of Châu, his special department being
                    the charge of the whole or a portion of the royal library. He must thus have
                    been able to make himself acquainted with all the history of his country and of
                    the men who had played the most distinguished part in its affairs. Ch’ien does
                    not mention the year of his birth, which is often said, though on what Chinese
                    authority does not appear, to have taken place in the third year of King Phing,
                    corresponding to 604 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> That date cannot be far from
                    the truth. That he was contemporary with Confucius is established by the
                    concurrent testimony of the <hi rend="italic">Lî Kî</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Kid Yii</hi> on the Confucian side, and of Chwang-tsze and Sze-ma
                    Ch’ien on the Tâoist. The two men whose influence has been so great on all the
                    subsequent generations of the Chinese people, and whose views are now more
                    attentively studied by thinking men of other nations than ever they were
                    before—Khung-tsze and Lâo-tsze—had at least one interview, in 517 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> when the former was "in his thirty-fifth year. The
                    conversation between them was interesting. Lâo was in a mocking mood; Khung
                    appears to the greater advantage.</p>
                <p>If it be true that Confucius, when he was fifty-one years old, visited Lâo-tsze,
                    as Chwang-tsze says (in the <hi rend="italic">Thien Yun,</hi> the fourteenth of
                    his treatises), to ask about the <hi rend="italic">Tdo,</hi> they must have had
                    more than one interview. Dr Chalmers, however, has pointed out that both
                    Chwang-tsze and Lieh-tsze (a still earlier Tâoist writer) produce Confucius in
                    their writings, as the lords of the Philistines did the captive Samson on their
                    festive occasions, “to make sport for them.” Their testimony is valueless as to
                    any matter of fact. There may have been several meetings between the two in 517
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> but we have no evidence that they were together
                    in the same place after that time. Ch’ien adds :—“Lâo-tsze cultivated the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tdo</hi> and virtue, his chief aim in his studies being how to
                    keep himself concealed and unknown. He resided at (the capital of) Châu; but
                    after a long time, seeing the decay of the dynasty, he left it, and went away to
                    the Gate (leading from the royal domain into the regions beyond,—at the entrance
                    of the pass of Han-kû, in the north-west of Ho-nan). Yin Hsî, the warden of the
                    gate, said to him, ‘You are about to withdraw yourself out of sight <hi
                    rend="italic">; I</hi> pray you to compose for me a book (before you go).’ On
                    this Lâo-tsze made a writing, setting forth his views on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tdo</hi> and virtue, in two sections, containing more than 5000 characters. He
                    then went away, and it is not known where he died.” The historian then mentions
                    the names of two other men whom some regarded as the true Lâo-tsze. One of them
                    was a Lâo Lâi, a contemporary of Confucius, who wrote fifteen treatises (or
                    sections) on the practices of the school of <hi rend="italic">Tdo.</hi>
                    Subjoined to the notice of him is the remark that Lâo-tsze was more than one
                    hundred and sixty years old, or, as some say, more than two hundred, because by
                    the cultivation of the <hi rend="italic">Tdo</hi> he nourished his longevity.
                    The other was “a grand historiographer” of Châu, called Tan, one hundred and
                    twenty-nine (1 one hundred and nineteen) years after the death of Confucius. The
                    introduction of these disjointed notices detracts from the verisimilitude of the
                    whole narrative in which they occur.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n313/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0313-0296"/>
                <p>Finally, Ch’ien makes the remark that “Lâo-tsze was a superior man, who liked to
                    keep in obscurity,” traces the line of his posterity down to the 2d century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and concludes with this important statement :—“Those
                    who attach themselves to the doctrine of Lâo-tsze condemn that of the literati,
                    and the literati on their part condemn Lâo-tsze, thus verifying the saying, ‘
                    Parties whose principles are different cannot take counsel together.’ Li Urh
                    taught that transformation follows, as a matter of course, the doing nothing (to
                    bring it about), and rectification ensues in the same way from being pure and
                    still.”</p>
                <p>Leaving these scanty historical notes, and accepting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tâo</hi><hi rend="italic">Teh King</hi> as the veritable work of Lâo-tsze, we
                    must now try to give the reader some idea of its contents. Consisting, it has
                    been seen, of not more than between five and six thousand characters, it is but
                    a short treatise,—not half the size of our Gospel of St Mark. The nature of the
                    subject, however, the want of any progress of thought or of logical connexion
                    between its different parts, and the condensed style, with the mystic tendencies
                    and poetical temperament of the author, make its meaning extraordinarily
                    obscure,—as native scholars and Sinologists have found to their cost. Divided at
                    first into two parts, it his subsequently and conveniently been subdivided into
                    chapters. One of the oldest, and the most common, of these arrangements makes
                    the chapters eighty-two.</p>
                <p>Some Roman Catholic missionaries, nearly two centuries ago, fancied that they
                    found a wonderful harmony between many passages and the teaching of our sacred
                    Scriptures. Montueci of Berlin, who had adopted their views, ventured to say in
                    1808:—“Many things’about a Triune God are so clearly expressed that no one who
                    has read this book can doubt that the mystery of the Holy Trinity was revealed
                    to the Chinese five centuries before the coming of Jesus Christ.” Even Remusat,
                    the first occupant of a Chinese chair in Europe, published at Paris in 1823 his
                    <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur la</hi><hi rend="italic">Vie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et les Opinions de Lâo-tsze,</hi> to vindicate the view that the Hebrew name
                    Jehovah was phonetically represented in the fourteenth chapter by Chinese
                    characters. These fancies were exploded by the late Stanislas Julien, when he
                    issued in 1842 his translation of the whole treatise as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Livre de</hi><hi rend="italic">la Voie et de la
                    Vertu.</hi></p>
                <p>The most important thing is to determine what we are to understand by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Teh</hi> is merely its outcome,
                    especially in man, and is rightly translated by our word “virtue.” Julien, we
                    have just seen, translated <hi rend="italic">Tao</hi> by ‘· la voie.” Chalmers
                    leaves it untranslated. “No English word,” he says (p. x∖), “is its exact
                    equivalent. Three terms suggest themselves—the way, reason, and the -word; but
                    they are all liable to objection. Were we guided by etymology, ‘ the way ’ would
                    come nearest the original, and in one or two passages the idea of a way seems to
                    be in the term; but this is too materialistic to serve the purpose of a
                    translation. ‘ Reason,’ again, seems to be more like a quality or attribute of
                    some conscious being than <hi rend="italic">Tao</hi> is. I would translate it by
                    ‘ the Word,’ in the sense of the Logos, but this would be like settling the
                    question w hich I wish to leave open, viz., what resemblance there is between
                    the Logos of the New Testament and this Chinese Tâo.” Latterly some Sinologues
                    in China have employed “nature” as our best analogue of the term. Thus Watters
                    <hi rend="italic">(Lâo-tsze,</hi><hi rend="italic">A Study in Chinese
                    Philosophy,</hi> p. 45) says :— “In the <hi rend="italic">Tao Teh King</hi> the
                    originator of the universe is referred to under the names Non-Existence,
                    Existence, Nature <hi rend="italic">(Tâo),</hi> and various designations,—all
                    which, however, represent one idea in various manifestations. It is in all cases
                    Nature <hi rend="italic">(Tâo)</hi> which is meant.” This view has been
                    skilfully worked out; but it only hides from us the scope of “the Venerable
                    Philosopher.” “Nature” cannot be accepted as a <hi rend="italic"
                    >translation</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Tâo.</hi> That character was, primarily,
                    the symbol of a way, road, or path; and then, figuratively, it was used, as we
                    also use <hi rend="italic">way,</hi> in the senses of means and method,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">course</hi> that we pursue in passing from one thing or concept to
                    another as its end or result. It is the name of a quality. Professor Douglas has
                    well said <hi rend="italic">(Confucianism and</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tâoisrn,</hi> p. 189):—“If we were compelled to adopt a single word to
                    represent the <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> of Lâo-tsze, we should prefer the sense
                    in which it is used by Confucius, ‘ the way,’ that is, ∕zε0oδoς.' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi></p>
                <p>What then was the quality which Lâo-tsze had in view, and which he thought of as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tâo,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> there in the library of
                    Châu, at the pass of the valley of Han, and where he met the end of his life
                    beyond the limits of the civilized state 1 It was the simplicity of spontaneity,
                    action (which might be called non-action) without motive, free from all selfish
                    purpose, resting in nothing but its own accomplishment. This is found in the
                    phenomena of the material world. “All things spring up without a word spoken,
                    and grow without a claim for their production. They go through their processes
                    without any display of pride in them; and the results are realized without any
                    assumption of ownership. It is owing to the absence of such assumption that the
                    results and their processes do not disappear” (chap. it). It only needs the same
                    quality in the arrangements and measures of government to make society beautiful
                    and happy. “A government conducted by sages would free the hearts of the people
                    from inordinate desires, fill their bellies, keep their ambitions feeble, and
                    strengthen their bones. They would constantly keep the people without knowledge
                    and free from desires; and, where there were those who had knowledge, they would
                    have them so that they would not dare to put it in practice” (chap, iii.). A
                    corresponding course observed by individual man in his government of himself
                    becoming again “as a little child” (chaps. X. and xxviii.) will have
                    corresponding results. “His constant virtue will be complete, and he will return
                    to the primitive simplicity” (chap, xxviii.).</p>
                <p>Such is the subject matter of the <hi rend="italic">Tao Teh King,—</hi> the
                    operation of this method or <hi rend="italic">Tao,</hi> “without striving or
                    crying,” in nature, in society, and in the individual. Much that is very
                    beautiful and practical is inculcated in connexion with its working in the
                    individual character. The writer seems to feel that he cannot say enough on the
                    virtue of humility (chap, viii., &lt;fcc,). There were three things which he
                    prized and held fast,—gentle compassion, economy, and the not presuming to take
                    precedence in the world (chap. Ixvii.). His teaching rises to its highest point
                    in chap. Ixiii. :—“It is the way of <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> not to act from
                    any personal motive, to conduct affairs without feeling the trouble of them, to
                    taste without being aware of the flavour, to account the great as small and the
                    small as great, to recompense injury with kindness.” This last and noblest
                    characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Tâo,</hi> the requiting “good for evil,”
                    is not touched on again in the treatise; but we know that it excited general
                    attention at the time, and was the subject of conversation between Confucius and
                    his disciples <hi rend="italic">(Confucian Analects,</hi> xiv. 36).</p>
                <p>What is said in the <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> on government is not, all of it,
                    so satisfactory. The writer shows, indeed, the benevolence of his heart. He
                    seems to condemn the infliction of capital punishment (chaps, lxxiii. and
                    lxxiv.), and he deplores the practice of war (chap, lxix.); but he had no
                    sympathy with the progress of society or with the culture and arts of life. He
                    says (chap, lxv.) :—“Those who anciently were skilful in practising the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo</hi> did not use it to enlighten the people; their object
                    rather was to keep them simple. The difficulty in governing the people arises
                    from their having too much knowledge, and therefore he who tries to govern a
                    state by wisdom is a scourge to it, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n314/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0314-0297"/> while he who does not try to govern thereby is a
                    blessing.” The last chapter but one is the following :—“In a small state with a
                    few inhabitants, I would so order it that the people, though supplied with all
                    kinds of implements, would not (care to) use them; I would give them cause to
                    look on death as a most grievous thing, while yet they would not go away to a
                    distance to escape from it. Though they had boats and carriages, they should
                    have no occasion to ride in them. Though they had buff-coats and sharp weapons,
                    they should not don or use them. I would make them return to the use of knotted
                    cords (instead of written characters). They should think their coarse food
                    sweet, their plain clothing beautiful, their poor houses places of rest, and
                    their common simple ways sources of enjoyment. There should be a neighbouring
                    state within sight, and the sound of the fowls and dogs should be heard from it
                    to us without interruption, but I would make the people to old age, even to
                    death, have no intercourse with it”</p>
                <p>On reading these sentiments, we must judge of Lâo-tsze that, with all his power
                    of thought, he was only a dreamer. But thus far there is no difficulty arising
                    from his language in regard to the <hi rend="italic">Tâo.</hi> It is simply a
                    quality, descriptive of the style of character and action, which the individual
                    should seek to attain in himself, and the ruler to impress on his
                    administration. The language about the <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> in nature is
                    by no means so clear. While Professor Douglas says that “the way” would be the
                    best translation of <hi rend="italic">Tao,</hi> he immediately adds :—“But <hi
                    rend="italic">Tao</hi> is more than the way. It is the way and the way-goer. It
                    is an eternal road; along it all beings and things walk; but no being made it,
                    for it is being itself; it is everything, and nothing, and the cause and effect
                    of all. All things originate from <hi rend="italic">Tao,</hi> conform to <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> at last they
                    return.”</p>
                <p>Some of these representations require modification; but no thoughtful reader of
                    the treatise can fail to be often puzzled by what is said on the point in hand.
                    Julien, indeed, says with truth (p. xiii.) that “it is impossible to take <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo</hi> for the primordial Reason, for the sublime Intelligence,
                    which has created and governs the world”; but the fact is that many of
                    Lâo-tsze’s statements are unthinkable if there be not behind the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo</hi> the unexpressed recognition of a personal creator and
                    ruler. Granted that he does not affirm positively the existence of such a Being,
                    yet certainly he does not deny it, and his language even implies it. It has been
                    said, indeed, that he denies it, and we are referred in proof to the fourth
                    chapter :—“<hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> is like the emptiness of a vessel; and the
                    use of it, we may say, must be free from all self-sufficiency. How deep and
                    mysterious it is, as if it were the author of all things! We should make our
                    sharpness blunt, and unravel the complications of things; we should attemper our
                    brightness, and assimilate ourselves to the obscurity caused by dust. How still
                    and clear is <hi rend="italic">Tâo,</hi> a phantasm with the semblance of
                    permanence! I do not know whose son it is. It might appear to have been before
                    God (TV).”</p>
                <p>The reader will not overlook the cautious and dubious manner in which the
                    predicates of Too are stated in this remarkable passage. The author does not say
                    that it was before God, but that “it might appear” to have been so. Nowhere else
                    in his treatise does the nature of <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi> as a method or
                    style of action come out more clearly. It has no positive existence of itself;
                    it is but like the emptiness of a vessel, and the manifestation of it by men
                    requires that they endeavour to free themselves from all self-sufficiency.
                    Whence came it? It does not shock Lâo-tsze to suppose that it had a father, but
                    he cannot tell whose son it is. And, as the feeling of its mysteriousness grows
                    on him, he ventures to say that “it might appear to have been before God.”</p>
                <p>There is here no denial but express recognition of the existence of God, so far
                    as it is implied in the name <hi rend="italic">TÎ,</hi> which is the personal
                    name for the concept of heaven as the ruling power, by means of which the
                    fathers of the Chinese people rose in prehistoric time to the idea of God. Again
                    and again Lâo-tsze speaks of heaven just as “we do when we mean thereby the
                    Deity who presides over heaven and earth.” These last words are taken from
                    Watters (p. 81); and, though he adds, “We must not forget that this heaven is
                    inferior and subsequent to the mysterious <hi rend="italic">Tâo,</hi> and was in
                    fact produced by it,” it has been shown how rash and unwarranted is the
                    ascription of such a sentiment to “the Venerable Philosopher.” He makes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tâo</hi> prior to heaven and earth, which is a phrase denoting
                    what we often call “nature,” but he does not make it prior to heaven in the
                    higher and immaterial usage of that name. The last sentence of his treatise is
                    :—“It is the <hi rend="italic">Tâo</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the way—of
                    Heaven to benefit and not injure; it is the <hi rend="italic">Tao—</hi> the
                    way—of the sage to do and not strive.”</p>
                <p>It is impossible to go, in the present article, into an exposition of the Τάο Τeh
                    King at greater length. Since Julien laid it fairly open to Western readers in
                    1842, there has been, it appears to the writer, a tendency to overestimate
                    rather than to underestimate its value as a scheme of thought and a discipline
                    for the individual and society. There are in it, indeed, lessons of unsurpassed
                    value, such as the inculcation of simplicity, humility, and self-abnegation, and
                    especially the brief enunciation of the divine duty of returning good for ill;
                    but there are on the other hand the regretful representations of a primitive
                    society when men were ignorant of the rudiments of culture, and the longings for
                    its return.</p>
                <p>When it was thought that the treatise made known the doctrine of the Trinity, and
                    even gave a phonetic representation of the Hebrew name Jehovah, it was natural,
                    even necessary, to believe that its author had had communication with more
                    western parts of Asia, and there was no end of speculation about visits to India
                    and Judaea, and even to Greece. The necessity for assuming such travels has
                    passed away, and they have ceased to be thought of. If we can receive Sze-mâ
                    Ch’ien’s histories as reliable, Lâo-tsze might have heard, in the states of Châu
                    and among the wild tribes adjacent to them, views about society and government
                    very like his own. Ch’ien relates how an envoy came in 624 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi> —twenty years, that is, before the date assigned to the birth of
                    Lâo-tsze—to the court of Duke Mu of Ch’in, sent by the king of some rude hordes
                    on the west. The duke told him of the histories, poems, codes of rites, music,
                    and laws which they had in the middle states, while yet rebellion and disorder
                    were of frequent occurrence, and asked how good order was secured at all among
                    the wild people, who had none of those appliances. The envoy smiled, and replied
                    that the troubles of China were occasioned by those very things of which the
                    duke vaunted, and that there had been a gradual degeneration in the condition of
                    its states, as their professed civilization had increased, ever since the days
                    of the ancients age, Hwang Ti, whereas in the land he came from, where there was
                    nothing but the primitive simplicity, their princes showed a pure virtue in
                    their treatment of the people, who responded to them with loyalty and good
                    faith. “The government of astate,” said he in conclusion, “is like a man’s
                    ruling his own single person. He rules it, and does not know how he does so; and
                    this was indeed the method of the sages.” Lâo-tsze did not need to go further
                    afield to find all that he has said about government.</p>
                <p>We have confined ourselves to the Tâoism of the TΛο Teh King without touching on
                    the religion Tâoism now existing in China, but which did not take shape until
                    more than five hundred years after the death of Lâo-tsze, though he now occupies
                    the second place in its trinity of “The three Pure or Holy Ones.” There is
                    hardly a word in his treatise that savours either of superstition or religion.
                    In the works of Lieh-tsze and Chwang-tsze, his earliest followers of note, we
                    find abundance of grotesque superstitions; but their beliefs (if indeed we can
                    say that they had beliefs) had not become embodied in any religious
                    institutions. When we come to the Ch’in dynasty (221- 206 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi>), we meet with a Tâoism in the shape of a search for the fairy
                    islands of the eastern sea, where the herb of immortality might be gathered. In
                    our first century a magician, called Chang Tâo-ling, comes before us as the
                    chief professor and controller of this Tâoism, preparing in retirement “the
                    pill” which renewed his youth, supreme over all spirits, and destroying millions
                    of demons by a stroke of his pencil. He left his books, talismans, and charms,
                    with his sword and seal, to his descendants, and one of them, professing to be
                    animated by his soul, dwells at this day on the Lung-hû mountain in Keang·se,
                    the acknowledged head or pope of Tâoism. But even then the system was not yet a
                    religion, with temples or monasteries, liturgies, and forms of public worship.
                    It borrowed all these from Buddhism, which first obtained public <pb break="no"

                    it could be said to have free course in the country.</p>
                <p>Even still, with the form of a religion, Taoism is in reality a conglomeration of
                    base and dangerous superstitions. Alchemy, geomancy, and spiritualism have dwelt
                    and dwell under its shadow. Each of its ‘ ’ three Holy Ones” has the title of
                    Thien Tsun, ‘ ’ the Heavenly and Honoured,” taken from Buddhism, and also of
                    Shang Ti or God, taken from the old religion of the country. The most popular
                    deity, however, is not one of them, but has the title of Yu JVang Shang TÎ,
                    “God, the Perfect King.” But it would take long to tell of all its “celestial
                    gods,” “great gods,” “divine rulers,” and others. It has been doubted, we have
                    said, whether Lâo-tsze acknowledged the existence of God at all, but the Tâoism
                    of the present day is a system of the wildest polytheism. The science and
                    religion of the West will meet from it a most determined opposition. The
                    “Venerable Philosopher” himself would not have welcomed them. The shrieking of
                    our steam-engines, the bustle of our commerce, and the onward march of our
                    various enterprises would have nearly driven him mad; but he ought not to bear
                    the obloquy of being the founder of the Tâoist religion. (J. LE. )</p>
