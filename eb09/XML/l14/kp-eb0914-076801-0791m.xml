                <p><label type="entry">LODI</label>, a city of Italy, in the province of Milan, lies
                    on the right bank of the Adda, in 45° 18' N. lat. and 9° 30' E. long. The site
                    of the city is an eminence rising very gradually from the Lombard plain, and the
                    surrounding country is one of the richest dairy districts in Italy. A rather
                    plain and ungainly cathedral (1158) with a huge lateral tower, the church delΓ
                    Incoronata erected by Bramante in 1476, the Palazzo Modegnani with a fine
                    gateway in the style of Bramante, the episcopal palace elating from 1202, and
                    the great hospital with its cloistered quadrangle, are the most noteworthy
                    buildings. Besides an extensive trade in cheese (Lodi making more Parmesan than
                    Parma itself) and other dairy produce, there are manufactures of linen, silk,
                    majolica, and chemicals. The population of the city in 1871 was 18,537.</p>
                <p>The ancient Laus Pompeia lay about 5 miles west of the present city, and the site
                    is still occupied by a considerable village, Lodi Vecchio. In the 11th century,
                    according to Landulphus Junior, Lodi was second to Milan among the cities of
                    northern Italy. A dispute with the archbishop of Milan about the investiture of
                    the bishop of Lodi (1024) proved the beginning of a bitter and protracted feud
                    between the two cities. In 1111 the Milanese laid the whole place in ruins and
                    forbade their rivals to restore what they had destroyed, and in 1158, when in
                    spite of this prohibition a fairly flourishing settlement had again been formed,
                    they repeated their work in a more thorough manner. A number of the Lodigians
                    had settled on Colle Eghezzone; and their village, the Borgo d’Isella, soon grew
                    up under the patronage of Frederick Barbarossa into a new city of Lodi. At first
                    subservient to the emperor, Lodi was before long compelled to enter the Lombard
                    League, and in 1198 it formed alliance offensive and defensive with Milan. The
                    strife between the Sommariva or aristocratic party and the Overgnaghi or
                    democratic party was so severe that the city broke into two distinct communes.
                    The Overgnaghi, expelled in 1226, were restored by Frederick II. who took the
                    city after three months’ siege. During the rest of the Guelf and Ghibelline
                    struggle, and down to the beginning of the 16th century, the annals of Lodi are
                    crowded with Stirling events, connected for the most part with the general
                    troubles of the country. In the main it was dependent on Milan. The duke of
                    Brunswick captured it in 1625 in the interests of Spain; and it was occupied by
                    the French (1701), by the Austrians (1706), by the king of Sardinia (1733), by
                    the Austrians (1736), by the Spaniards (1745), and again by the Austrians
                    (1746). On 10th May 1796 was fought the battle of Lodi between the Austrians and
                    Napoleon, which made the latter master of Lombardy.</p>
