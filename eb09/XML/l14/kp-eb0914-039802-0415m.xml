                    the house of Scarron at Fontenay-aux-Roses, on February 2, 1807, was educated at
                    Paris, and had just been entered at the Paris bar, when the revolution of July
                    1830 broke out. He soon made himself a great name as an advocate, and was
                    engaged on the republican side in all the great political trials of the next ten
                    years. He also wrote many political tracts, and edited more than one republican
                    newspaper, so that when he was elected as deputy for Le Mans in 1841 he was
                    expected to take up an advanced republican position in the chamber. From this
                    time to the outbreak of the revolution of February 1848 he was regarded as the
                    chosen leader of the working men of France, and spoke and wrote in favour of
                    liberty of labour and universal suffrage. It was in the speeches of himself and
                    his friends Lamartine and Louis Blanc at Lille, Dijon, and Chalons at working
                    men’s banquets during the latter months of 1847 that the revolution of 1848 was
                    most clearly foreshadowed and prepared. When it did actually break out, it was
                    Ledru-Rollin who overthrew the project of making the duchess of Orleans regent,
                    and obtained the nomination of a provisional government. In this provisional
                    government he was clearly pointed out by his influence among the working men for
                    the ministry of the interior. When he resigned on June 24, 1848, he found that
                    his four months of office had lost him his old leadership, as the conscientious
                    performance of such an office inevitably would, but he had the credit of having
                    for the first time established a working system of universal suffrage. He tried
                    to regain his old influence, but in vain, and at the election of president in
                    December had but 370,000 votes. The earlier months of 1849 he spent in
                    protesting against the policy, especially the Roman policy, of the president
                    Louis Napoleon Bonaparte and his ministry, which culminated in his moving their
                    impeachment. His motion being defeated on June 12 by 289 to 8, he on June 13
                    headed what he called a peaceful demonstration, and his enemies an appeal to
                    arms, which was soon dispersed. Ledru-Rollin himself escaped to London, where he
                    signed the manifestoes of the revolutionary committee of Europe with Kossuth,
                    Mazzini, Rüge, and sometimes Desatz. He also employed his leisure in writing a
                    work on the <hi rend="italic">Decadence el’</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Angleterre,</hi> in which he attempted to deduce the necessary fall of England
                    from its aristocratic form of government and the misery of the lower classes. In
                    1870 he returned to Paris, but though elected in three departments he refused to
                    sit in the national assembly of 1871. In 1874 he consented to sit for the
                    department of Var, and spoke at length on J une 3 on an electoral scheme,
                    upholding the one great aim and achievement of his life, universal suffrage. The
                    effort was too much for his health; he steadily grew weaker and weaker, and died
                    on December 31, 1874. Perhaps the best succinct description of his character and
                    political position in the sixteen short months of his real <pb break="no"

                    at the unveiling of his bust in Père La Chaise: “Louis Blanc was the apostle of
