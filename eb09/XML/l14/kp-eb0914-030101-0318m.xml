                    are said, singularly enough, to have been gained in theological controversy, but
                    at an early age he became mathematical teacher in the military school of
                    Beaumont, the classes of which he had attended as an extern. He was not more
                    than eighteen when, armed with letters of recommendation, he approached
                    D’Alembert, then at the height of his fame and influence, in the hope of finding
                    a career in Paris. The letters remained unnoticed, but Laplace was not a man to
                    be crushed by the first rebuff of fortune. He wrote to the great geometer a
                    letter on the principles of mechanics, which evoked an immediate and
                    enthusiastic response. “You,” said D’Alembert to him, “needed no introduction;
                    you have recommended yourself; my support is your due.” He accordingly obtained
                    for him an appointment as professor of mathematics in the Ecole Militaire of
                    Paris, and continued to forward his interests with zeal and constancy.</p>
                <p>The future of the young mathematician was now assured, and his scientific
                    vocation finally determined. He had not yet completed his twenty-fourth year
                    when he entered upon the course of discovery which has earned him the title of
                    “the Newton of France.” Having, in his first published paper,<note

                    intégral,” Mélanges de la Soc. Roy. de Turin, 1766-69.</p></note> shown his
                    mastery of analysis, he immediately proceeded to apply the powerful instrument
                    at his command to the great outstanding problems in the application of the law
                    of gravitation to the celestial motions. Of.these the most conspicuous was
                    offered by the opposite inequalities of Jupiter and Saturn, which the emulous
                    efforts of Euler and Lagrange had failed to bring within the bounds of theory.
                    The discordance of their results incited Laplace to a searching examination of
                    the whole subject of planetary perturbations, and his maiden effort was rewarded
                    with a discovery which constituted, when developed and completely demonstrated
                    by his own further labours and those of his illustrious rival Lagrange, the most
                    important advance made in physical astronomy since the time of Newton. In a
                    paper read before the Academy of Sciences, February 10, 1773 <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mém. présentes</hi><hi rend="italic">par divers Savaηs,</hi> tom. vii., 1776),
                    Laplace announced his celebrated conclusion of the invariability of planetary
                    mean motions, carrying the proof as far as the cubes of the eccentricities and
                    inclinations. This was the first and most important step in the establishment of
                    the stability of the solar system. It was followed up by a series of profound
                    investigations, in which Lagrange and Laplace alternately surpassed and
                    supplemented each other in assigning limits of variation to the several elements
                    of the planetary orbits. The analytical tournament closed with the communication
                    to the Academy by Laplace, in 1787, of an entire group of remarkable
                    discoveries. It would be difficult, in the whole range of scientific literature,
                    to point to a memoir of equal brilliancy with that published (divided into three
                    parts) in the volumes of the Academy for 1784, 1785, and 1786. The long-sought
                    cause of the “great inequality” of Jupiter and Saturn was found in the near
                    approach to commensurability of their mean motions; it was demonstrated in two
                    elegant theorems (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi> vol. ii. p. 781),
                    independently of any except the most general considerations as to mass, that the
                    mutual action of the planets could never largely affect the eccentricities and
                    inclinations of their orbits; and the singular peculiarities detected by him in
                    the Jovian system were expressed in the so-called “laws of Laplace” <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Astronomy,</hi> p. 810). He completed the theory of these
                    bodies in a treatise contained amongst the Paris <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    for 1788 and 1789; and the tables computed by Delambre from the data there
                    supplied served, by their striking superiority to those hitherto available, to
                    mark the profit derived from the investigation by practical astronomy.<note

                    Astronomy, p. 96.</p></note> The year 1787 was rendered further memorable by
                    Laplace’s announcement, November 19 <hi rend="italic">(Memoirs,</hi> 1786), of
                    the dependence of lunar acceleration upon the secular changes in the
                    eccentricity of the earth’s orbit. The last apparent anomaly, and the last
                    threat of instability, thus disappeared from the solar system.</p>
                <p>With these brilliant performances the first period of Laplace’s scientific career
                    may be said to have closed. I f he made no more striking discoveries in
                    celestial mechanics, it was rather their subject matter than his powers that
                    failed. The general working of the great machine was now laid bare, and it
                    needed a further advance of knowledge to render a fresh set of problems
                    accessible to investigation. The time had come when the results obtained in the
                    development and application of the law of gravitation by three generations of
                    illustrious mathematicians might be collected in a single work, and presented
                    from a single point of view. It was to this task that the second period of
                    Laplace’s activity was devoted. As a monument of mathematical genius applied to
                    the celestial revolutions the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celeste</hi> ranks second only to the <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> of
                    Newton.</p>
                <p>The declared aim of the author<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>“Plan de l’Ouvrage,” Oeuvres, torn. i. p. 1.</p></note> was
                    to offer a complete solution of the great mechanical problem presented by the
                    solar system, and to bring theory to coincide so closely with observation that
                    empirical equations should no longer find a place in astronomical tables. His
                    success in both respects fell but little short of his lofty ideal. The first
                    part of the work (2 vols. 4to, Paris, 1799) contains methods for calculating the
                    movements of translation and rotation of the heavenly bodies, for determining
                    their figures, and resolving tidal problems; the second, especially dedicated to
                    the improvement of tables, exhibits in the third and fourth volumes (1802 and
                    1805) the application of these formulae; while a fifth volume, published in
                    three instalments, 1823-25, comprises the results of Laplace’s latest
                    researches, together with a valuable history of progress in each separate branch
                    of his subject. In the delicate task of apportioning his own large share of
                    merit, he certainly does not err on <pb break="no"

                    difficult to produce an instance of injustice, as of generosity, in his estimate
                    of others. Far more serious blame attaches to his all but total suppression in
                    the body of the work—and the fault pervades the whole of his writings—of the
                    names of his predecessors and contemporaries. Theorems and formulae are
                    appropriated wholesale without acknowledgment, and a production which may be
                    described as the organized result of a century of patient toil presents itself
                    to the world as the offspring of a single brain. The Mécanique Céleste is, even
                    to those most conversant with analytical methods, by no means easy reading. The
                    late Μ. Biot, who had the privilege of assisting in the correction of its proof
                    sheets, remarks that it would have extended, had the demonstrations been fully
                    developed, to eight or ten instead of five volumes; and he saw at times the
                    author himself obliged to devote an hour’s labour to recovering the dropped
                    links in the chain of reasoning covered by the recurring formula, “Il est aisé à
                    voir.’’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Journal des

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Exposition du Système du Monde</hi> (Paris, 1796) has been
                    styled by Arago “the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Celeste</hi> disembarrassed of its analytical paraphernalia.” Not only the
                    conclusions reached by geometers are stated, but the methods followed by them
                    are indicated. The integuments, so to speak, of a popular dissertation clothe
                    and conceal the skeleton of an analytical treatise. The style is lucid and
                    masterly, and the summary of astronomical history with which it terminates has
                    been reckoned amongst the masterpieces of the language. To this linguistic
                    excellence the writer owed the place accorded to him in 1816 amongst the “forty”
                    of the French Academy, of which institution he became president in the following
                    year. The famous “nebular hypothesis” of Laplace makes its appearance in the <hi

                    a note (vii,), and propounded “Avec la défiance que doit inspirer tout ce qui
                    n’est point un résultat de l’observation ou du calcul,” it is plain, from the
                    complacency with which he recurs to it<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Méo. Cél., tom. V. p. 346.</p></note> at the lapse of above
                    a quarter of a century, that he regarded the speculation with considerable
                    interest. That it formed the starting-point, and has remained the model, of
                    thought on the subject of planetary origin is due to the simplicity of its
                    assumptions, and the clearness of the mechanical principles involved, rather
                    than to any cogent evidence of its truth. It is curious that Laplace, while
                    bestowing more attention than they deserved on the crude conjectures of Buffon,
                    seems to have been unaware that he had been, to some extent, anticipated by
                    Kant, who had put forward in 1755, in his <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturgeschichte</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> a true
                    nebular cosmogony, though one in which the primitive reign of chaos was little
                    likely to terminate.</p>
                <p>The career of Laplace was one of scarcely interrupted prosperity. Admitted to the
                    Academy of Sciences as an associate in 1773, he became a member in 1785, having,
                    about a year previously, succeeded Bezout as examiner to the royal artillery.
                    During a temporary access of revolutionary suspicion, he was removed from the
                    commission of weights and measures; but the slight was quickly effaced by new
                    honours. He was one of the first members, and became president, of the Bureau of
                    Longitudes, took a prominent place at the Institute (founded in 1796), professed
                    analysis at the École Normale, and aided in the organization of the decimal
                    system. The publication of the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste</hi> gained
                    him world-wide celebrity, and his name appeared on the lists of all the
                    principal scientific associations of Europe, including the Royal Society. But
                    merely scientific distinctions by no means satisfied his ambition. He aspired to
                    the rôle of a politician, and has left a memorable example of genius degraded to
                    servility for the sake of a riband and a title. The ardour of his republican
                    principles gave place, after the 18th Brumaire, to devotion towards the first
                    consul, a sentiment promptly rewarded with the post of minister of the interior.
                    His incapacity for affairs was, however, so flagrant that it became necessary to
                    supersede him at the end of six weeks, when Lucien Bonaparte became his
                    successor. “He brought into the administration,” according to the dictum of the
                    future emperor, “the spirit of the infinitesimals.” His failure was consoled by
                    elevation to the senate, of which body he became chancellor in September 1803.
                    He was at the same time named grand officer of the Legion of Honour, and
                    obtained in 1813 the same rank in the new order of Reunion. The title of count
                    he had previously acquired on the creation of the empire. Nevertheless he
                    cheerfully gave his voice in 1814 for the dethronement of his patron, and his
                    “suppleness” merited a seat in the chamber of peers, and, in 1817, the dignity
                    of a marquisate. The memory of these tergiversations is perpetuated in his
                    writings. The first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Système</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Monde</hi> was inscribed to the Council of Five Hundred; to the
                    third volume of the <hi rend="italic">Mécanique Céleste</hi> (1802) was prefixed
                    the declaration that, of all the truths contained in the work, that most
                    precious to the author was the expression of his gratitude and devotion towards
                    the “pacificator of Europe”; upon which noteworthy protestation the suppression,
                    in the editions of the <hi rend="italic">Théorie des Probabilités</hi>
                    subsequent to the restoration, of the original dedication to the emperor formed
                    a fitting commentary.</p>
                <p>During the later years of his life, Laplace lived much at Arcueil, where he had a
                    country-place adjoining that of his friend Berthollet. With his co-operation the
                    Société d’Arcueil was formed, and he occasionally contributed to its <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi> In this peaceful retirement he pursued his studies
                    with unabated ardour, and received with uniform courtesy distinguished visitors
                    from all parts of the world. Here, too, he died, attended to the last by his
                    physician Dr Majendie, and his mathematical coadjutor Bouvard, March 5, 1827,
                    having nearly completed his seventy-eighth year. His last words were: “Ce que
                    nous connaissons est peu de chose, ce que nous ignorons est immense.”</p>
                <p>Although commonly believed to have held atheistical opinions, Laplace refrained
                    from giving any direct expression to them in his writings. His character,
                    notwithstanding the vanity and egotism by which it was disfigured, had an
                    amiable and engaging side. Young men of science found in him an active
                    benefactor. His relations with these “adopted children of his thought” possessed
                    a singular charm of affectionate simplicity; their intellectual progress and
                    material interests were objects of equal solicitude to him, and he demanded in
                    return only diligence in the pursuit of knowledge. M. Biot relates that, when he
                    himself was beginning his career, Laplace introduced him at the Institute for
                    the purpose of explaining his supposed discovery of equations of mixed
                    differences, and afterwards showed him, under a strict pledge of secrecy, the
                    papers, then yellow with age, in which he had long before obtained the same
                    results, but which he had laid aside with a view to future development. This
                    instance of abnegation is the more worthy of record that it formed a marked
                    exception to Laplace’s usual course. Between him and Legendre there was a
                    feeling of “more than coldness,” owing to his appropriation, with scant
                    acknowledgment, of the fruits of the other’s labours; and our celebrated
                    countryman, Dr Thomas Young, counted himself, rightly or wrongly, amongst the
                    number of those similarly aggrieved by him. With Lagrange, on the other hand, he
                    always remained on the best of terms.</p>
                <p>The extreme abstemiousness of his life, joined to a naturally good constitution,
                    preserved Laplace from most of the infirmities incidental to old age. He was
                    indeed obliged to use his eyes with precaution; but his powerful memory remained
                    unimpaired, and it was not until within two years of his death that his health
                    began to <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n320/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0320-0303"/> suffer from his severe application. He married a
                    beautiful and amiable woman, and left a son, born in 1789, who succeeded to his
                    title, and rose to the rank of general in the artillery.</p>
                <p>It might be said that Laplace was a great mathematician by the original structure
                    of his mind, and became a great discoverer through the sentiment which animated
                    it. The regulated and persistent enthusiasm with which he regarded the system of
                    nature was with him from first to last. It can be traced in his earliest essay,
                    and it dictated the ravings of his final illness. By it his extraordinary
                    analytical powers became strictly subordinated to physical investigations. To
                    this lofty quality of mind he added a rare sagacity in perceiving analogies, and
                    in detecting the new truths that lay concealed in his formulae, and a tenacity
                    of mental grip, by which problems, once seized, were held fast, year after year,
                    until they yielded up their solutions. In every branch of physical astronomy,
                    accordingly, deep traces of his work are visible. “He would have completed the
                    science of the skies,” Fourier remarks, “had the science been capable of
                    completion.”</p>

                    be added that he first examined the conditions of stability of the system formed
                    by Saturn's rings, pointed out the necessity for their rotation, and fixed for

                    an invariable plane such that the sum of the products of the planetary masses by

                    of elasticity due to the heat of compression, would alone have sufficed to
                    illustrate a lesser name. Molecular physics also engaged a large share of his
                    attention, and he announced in 1824 his purpose of treating the subject in a
                    separate work. With Lavoisier he made an important series of experiments on
                    specific heat (1782-84), in the course of which the “ice calorimeter” was
                    discovered; and they contributed jointly to the Memoirs of the Academy (1781) a
                    paper on the development of electricity by evaporation. Laplace was, moreover,
                    the first to offer a complete analysis of capillary action based upon a definite
                    hypothesis—that of forces ‘ ‘ sensible only at insensible distances”; and he
                    made strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to explain the phenomena of light on an
                    identical principle. It was a favourite idea of his that chemical affinity and
                    capillary attraction would eventually be included under the same law, and it was
                    perhaps as much because it threatened an inroad on a cherished generalization as
                    because it seemed to him little capable of mathematical treatment that the
                    undulatory theory of light was distasteful to him.</p>
                <p>The investigation of the figure of equilibrium of a rotating fluid mass engaged
                    the attention of Laplace during the greater part of his long life. His first
                    memoir was communicated to the Academy in 1773, when he was only twenty-four
                    years of age, his last in 1817, when he was sixty-eight. The results of his many
                    papers on this subject—characterized by him as “un des points les plus
                    intéressans du système du monde ”—are embodied in the Mécanique Céleste, and
                    furnish one of the most remarkable proofs of his analytical genius. Maclaurin,
                    Legendre, and D’Alembert had furnished partial solutions of the problem,
                    confining their attention to the possible figures which would satisfy the
                    conditions of equilibrium. Laplace treated the subject from the point of view of
                    the gradual aggregation and cooling of a mass of matter, and demonstrated that
                    the form which such a mass would ultimately assume must be an ellipsoid of
                    revolution whose equator was determined by the primitive plane of maximum
                    areas.</p>
                <p>The honour of having brought almost to perfection the closely related problem of
                    the attraction of spheroids must also be accorded to him. All the powers of
                    analysis in the hands of its greatest masters replaced the old geometrical
                    methods, and their superiority was soon evidenced by a succession of remarkable
                    discoveries. Legendre, in 1783, extended Maclaurin’s theorem concerning
                    ellipsoids of revolution to the case of any spheroid of revolution where the
                    attracted point, instead of being limited to the axis or equator, occupied any
                    position in space; and Laplace, in his treatise Théorie du Mouvement et de la
                    Figure Elliptique des Planètes (pub lished in 1784), effected a still further
                    generalization by proving, what had been suspected by Legendre, that the theorem
                    was equally true for any confocal ellipsoids. Finally, in a celebrated memoir,
                    Théorie des Attractions des Sphéroïdes et de la Figure des Planètes, published
                    in 1785 among the Paris Memoirs for the year 1782, written, however, after the
                    treatise of 1784, Laplace treated exhaustively the general problem of the
                    attraction of any spheroid upon a particle situated outside or upon its
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The researches of Laplace and Legendre on the subject of attractions derive
                    additional interest and importance from having introduced two powerful engines
                    of analysis for the treatment of physical problems, Laplace’s Coefficients and
                    the Potential Function. The expressions for the attraction of an ellipsoid
                    involved integrations which presented insuperable difficulties; it was,
                    therefore, with pardonable exultation that Laplace announced his discovery that
                    the attracting force in any direction could be obtained by the direct process of
                    differentiating a single function. He thereby translated the forces of nature
                    into the language of analysis, and laid the foundations of the mathematical
                    sciences of heat, electricity, and magnetism. This function, V, which received
                    the name of potential from Green in 1828, and independently from Gauss in 1840,
                    is defined as the sum of the masses of the molecules of the attracting body
                    divided by their respective distances from the attracted point; or, in
                    mathematical language—</p>
                <p>V = ∕77Z pdxdydz</p>

                <p>p being the density of the body at the point x, y, z; a, β, γ, the coordinates of
                    the attracted point; and the limits of integration being determined by the form
                    of the attracting mass. V is thus a function of a, β, γ, that is to say, depends
                    for its value on the position of the point, and its several differentials with
                    respect to these coordinates furnish the components of the attractive force. The
                    integrations, however, could not in general be effected so as to express V in
                    finite terms; but Laplace showed that V satisfied the partial differential
                    equation d <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> V d <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> V d

                <p>which is still known as Laplace’s equation. It is worthy of remark that it was
                    not in this symmetrical form that the equation was discovered, but in the
                    complicated shape which it assumes when expressed in polar coordinates :—</p>

                    all Laplace’s researches in attractions, and makes its appearance in every
                    branch of physical science.</p>

                    modern analysis. They were first introduced in their generality by Laplace in
                    the memoir on attractions, 1785, above referred to, which is, to a great extent,
                    reprinted in the third book of the Mécanique Céleste; but Legendre, in a
                    celebrated paper entitled Recherches sur l’attraction des Sphéroïdes homogènes,
                    printed in the tenth volume of the Divers Savans, 1783, had previously made use
                    of them, and proved some of their properties, in the simplified form which they
                    assume with one instead of two variables. They may be defined as follows. If two

                    electricity and magnetism this powerful calculus o&lt;Scupies a prominent place.
                    Gauss in particular has employed it in the calculation of the magnetic potential
                    of the earth, and it has recently received new light from Professor Clerk
                    Maxwell’s interpretation of harmonics with reference to poles on the sphere.</p>
                <p>Laplace, always profound rather than elegant, nowhere displays the massiveness of
                    his genius so conspicuously as in the theory of probabilities. The science which
                    Pascal and Fermat had initiated he brought very nearly to perfection; but the
                    demonstrations are so involved, and the omissions in the chain of reasoning so
                    frequent, that the Théorie Analytique is to the best mathematicians a work
                    requiring the most arduous study. The theory of probabilities, which Laplace
                    describes as common sense expressed in mathematical language, first attracted
                    his attention from its importance in physics ami astronomy; and he applies his
                    theory, not only to the ordinary problems of chances, but also to the inquiry
                    into the causes of phenomena, vital statistics, and future events.</p>
                <p>The device known as the method of least squares, for reducing numerous equations
                    of condition to the number of unknown quantities to be determined, had been
                    adopted as a practically convenient rule by Gauss and Legendre; but Laplace
                    first treated it as a problem in probabilities, and proved by an intricate and
                    difficult course of reasoning that it was also the most advantageous, the mean
                    of the probabilities of error in the determination of the elements being thereby
                    reduced to a minimum.</p>
                <p>The method of generating functions, the foundation of his theory of
                    probabilities, Laplace published in 1779; and the first part of his Théorie
                    Analytique is devoted to the exposition of its principles, which in their
                    simplest form consist in treating the successive values of any function as the
                    coefficients in the expansion of another function with reference to a different
                    variable. The latter is therefore called the generating function of the former.
                    A direct and an inverse calculus is thus created, the object of the former being
                    to determine the coefficients from the generating function, of the latter to
                    discover the generating function from the coefficients. The one is a problem of
                    interpolation, the other a step towards the solution of an equation in finite
                    differences. The method, how ever, is now obsolete from the more extended
                    facilities afforded by the calculus of operations.</p>
                <p>The first formal proof of Lagrange’s theorem for the development in a series of
                    an implicit function was furnished by Laplace, who gave to it an extended
                    generality. He also showed that every equation of an even degree must have at
                    least one real quadratic factor, reduced the solution of linear differential
                    equations to definite integrals, and furnished an elegant method by which the
                    linear partial differential equation of the second order might be solved. He was
                    also the first to consider the difficult problems involved in equations of mixed
                    differences, and to prove that an equation in finite differences of the first
                    degree and the second order might always be converted into a continued
                    fraction.</p>
                <p>In 1842, the works of Lapl·ice being nearly out of print, his widow was about to
                    sell a farm in order to procure funds for a new impression, when the Government
                    of Louis Philippe took the matter in hand. A grant of 40,000 francs having been
                    obtained from the chamber, a national edition was issued in seven 4to vols.,
                    bearing the title Oeuvres de Laplace, 1843-47. The Mécanique Céleste with its
                    four supplements occupies the first 5 vols., the 6th contains the Système du
                    Monde, and the 7th the Th. des Probabilités, to which the more popular Essai
                    Philosophique forms an introduction. Of the four supplements added by the
                    author, 1816-25, he tells us that the problems in the last were contributed by
                    his son. An enumeration of Laplace’s memoirs and papers (about one hundred in
                    number) is rendered superfluous by their embodiment in his principal works. The
                    Th. des Prob, was first published in 1812, the Essai in 1814; and both works as
                    well as the Système dzι Monde went through repeated editions. Laplace’s first
                    separate work, Théorie du Mouvement et de la Figure Elliptique des Planètes,
                    1784, was published at the expense of President Bochard de Saron. The Précis de
                    V Histoire de l ’ Astronomie, 1821, formed the fifth book of the 5th edition of
                    the Système du Monde. An English translation, with copious elucidatory notes, of
                    the first 4 vols, of the Mécanique Céleste, by Dr Bowditch, was published at
                    Boston, U.S., 1829-39, in 4 vols. 4to; a compendium of certain portions of the
                    same work by Mrs Somerville appeared in 1831, and a German version of the first
                    2 vols, by Burckhardt at Berlin in 1801. English translations of the Système du
                    Monde by Mr Pond and Mr Harte were published, the first in 1809, the second in
                    1830. An edition entitled Les Oeuvres Complètes de Laplace, 1878, &amp;c., which
                    is to include the whole of his memoirs, is now in course of publication under
                    the auspices of the Academy of Sciences. The four 4to vols, which have already
                    appeared comprise the first ten books of the Mécanique Céleste.</p>
                <p>Scanty notices of Laplace’s life will be found in Fourier’s Éloge, June 15, 1829,
                    in the funeral oration of Poisson, and Arago’s Report, 1842, translated amongst
                    his Biographies by Admiral Smyth and Mr Grant. His astronomical work is treated
                    of in Gautier’s Problème des trois Corps and Grant’s Hist, of Astronomy. For
