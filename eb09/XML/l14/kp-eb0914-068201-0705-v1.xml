                <p><label type="entry">LIPARI ISLANDS</label>. These islands, which take their name
                    from the largest and most populous member of the group, are situated to the
                    north of the eastern half of Sicily, between 38° 20' and 38° <hi rend="italic"
                        >55'</hi> N. lat., and 14° 15' and 15° 15' E. long. The seven principal
                    islands are Lipari, Salina, Vulcano, Stromboli, Panaria, Filicudi, and Alicudi;
                    besides which there are ten islets, some of them mere rocks, the remains of a
                    great central volcano now submerged. The total population of the islands in 1871
                    was 18,400, and the area is less than 50 square miles. They were known to the
                    ancients as the <hi rend="italic">Hephsestiades</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vulcanise insulx,</hi> from their supposed connexion with Vulcan; the <hi
                        rend="italic">Liparenses,</hi> from their mythical king Lipara; and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Aeoliae insulae,</hi> from Aeolus, who was said to have
                    married the daughter of Lipara, and to have succeeded to the kingdom. Lipara,
                    the chief island, was colonized in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> by Cnidians and Rhodians, who rapidly spread to the adjacent
                    islands of Hiera and Didyme. The new settlers maintained their independence in
                    spite of the attacks of the Tyrrhenian pirates, but they later became subject
                    successively to the Athenians, Carthaginians, and Romans. In the Middle Ages the
                    Saracens took possession of the islands, but they were expelled by the Normans
                    in the 11th century. Finally Ferdinand the Catholic annexed them to Sicily.</p>
                <p>Lipari has an area of about 11 square miles, with a population of 12,000. It is
                    mountainous in character, and consists of tuffs and lavas, and of highly
                    siliceous volcanic products such as quartz-trachyte, pumice, and obsidian. The
                    great central cone, Monte Sant’ Angelo (1952 feet), is the ruin of an extinct
                    volcano, as is also Monte Chirica (1978 feet); while Campo Bianco or Monte
                    Pelato(1500 feet) is a mountain of white pumice, breached by an outflow of
                    vitreous lava. Hot springs exist in various parts of the island, the most
                    important being those of San Calogero, mentioned by Diodorus Siculus, and
                    situated about 6 miles from the town. The water, which possesses a temperature
                    of 198° Fahr., contains free carbonic acid and sulphuretted hydrogen, together
                    with carbonates of calcium and magnesium, and chlorides of calcium and sodium.
                    The chief town, which stands on the eastern point of the island, is quite
                    modern, and contains no objects of interest. The cathedral and several other
                    churches are within the precincts of the castle, and they are presided over by a
                    bishop and thirty-two canons. The castle is used as a prison for some four
                    hundred malefactors, sent from various parts of Italy. The island is governed by
                    a delegate, subject to the prefect of Messina. The soil is fertile; and a
                    considerable trade is carried on by a number of merchants who export currants,
                    figs, pumice stone, and malmsey wine. W <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> ater is
                    scarce owing to the great porosity of the soil.</p>
                <p>Six miles to the south of Lipari is the island of Vulcano, anciently known as <hi
                        rend="italic">Hiera, Vulcania,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Therusia.</hi> In
                    early times it was a very active volcano; and it is described by Thucydides,
                    Aristotle, and Callias as being frequently in a state of violent eruption. In
                    the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the smaller island of Vulcanello
                    was upheaved from the sea. The present crater was probably formed during the
                    eruption of 1786, from which time the volcano remained in a quiescent state till
                    the autumn of 1873, when it commenced to discharge clouds of vapour, showers of
                    sand, and large stones. Blue and green flames were also seen to issue from rifts
                    in the floor of the crater. When visited by the writer in 1879, the volcano had
                    again relapsed into the solfatara stage, and it had recently been purchased by a
                    Scotch firm for £8000, for the purpose of extracting alum, boracic <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0706-0683"/> acid, and sulphur from the numerous products
                    which line the sides and cover the floor of the crater. A number of volcanic
                    minerals have been obtained from Vulcano; the most remarkable perhaps was that
                    lately analysed by Professor Cossa of Turin, which was found to contain seven
                    non-metallic elements and eight metals, among them the rare bodies thallium,
                    caesium, and rubidium. The highest point of Vulcano—∙a portion of the old crater
                    ring—has an altitude of 1601 feet.</p>
                <p>A little more than 20 miles to the north-north-east of Lipari, the cone of
                    Stromboli rises from the sea to a height of 3022 feet. It is of special interest
                    to the vulcanologist from the fact that it is the only example in Europe of a
                    volcano in a state of constant activity, and also because, from an elevated
                    point above the crater (which is at the side of the cone below the summit), it
                    is possible, when the wind blows away from the observer, to sit for hours and
                    watch the operations going on within the crater. Such observations, carried out
                    in 1788 by Spallanzani, made him the father of modern vulcanology, and furnished
                    some of the most important data upon which the science is founded. The mountain
                    is mentioned as early as the 4th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
                <p>Between Stromboli and Lipari there is a group of islets representing portions of
                    the crater ring of a great volcano, the largest of which, Panaria <hi
                        rend="italic">{Hicesia),</hi> is 7 miles in circuit, and contains about 200
                    inhabitants. It produces wheat, oil, and wine. Salina <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Didyme),</hi> 3 miles to the north-west of Lipari, has an area of 10
                    square miles, and consists of two volcanic cones rising respectively to the
                    height of 3156 and 2821 feet. The island contains nearly 5000 inhabitants, who
                    are mainly employed in cultivating the vines, which produce a fine malmsey wine.
                    The cone of Filicudi rises to a height of 2598 feet, some 10 miles to the west
                    of Salina, λvhile at an equal distance further west is Alicudi, the most
                    westerly member of the Lipari group. It is partly cultivated, and is inhabited
                    by about 500 fishermen and shepherds.</p>
                <p>Good maps of the Lipari Islands have been published by the Italian Government.
                    The best general account of the islands is still that of Admiral Smyth <hi
                        rend="italic">{Sicily and its Islands,</hi> 1824), while Professor J. W.
                    Judd has exhaustively discussed their geology in the pages of the <hi
