                    an astrologer somewhat famous iu his day, was born in 1602, at Diseworth in
                    Leicestershire, his family having been settled as yeomen in the place for “many
                    ages.” He received a tolerably good classical education at the school of
                    Ashby-de-la-Zouche, but he naively tells us what may perhaps have some
                    significance iu reference to his after career, that his master “never taught
                    logic.” In his eighteenth year, in consequence of his father having fallen into
                    great poverty, he went to London, and was employed in a sort of menial situation
                    in attendance on an old citizen and his wife, with whom he so managed to
                    ingratiate himself that his master, at his death in 1627, left him an annuity of
                    £20; and, Lilly having soon afterwards married the widow, she, dying in 1633,
                    left him property to the value of about £1000. Having now a good deal of leisure
                    on his hands, he began to dabble in astrology, reading all the books on the
                    subject he could fall in with, and occasionally trying his hand at unravelling
                    mysteries by means of his art. The years 1642 and 1643 were devoted to a careful
                    revision of all his previous reading, and in particular having lighted on
                    Valentine Naibod’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Alchabitius,</hi> he
                    “seriously studied him and found him to be the profoundest author he ever met
                    with.” Him he “traversed over day and night,” and so “advanced his judgment and
                    knowledge” to the utmost height he ever arrived at. He characterizes him as “a
                    most rational author and the sharpest expositor of Ptolemy that hath yet
                    appeared.” About the same time he tells us that he “did carefully take notice of
                    every grand action betwixt king and parliament, and did first then incline to
                    believe that as all sublunary affairs depend on superior causes, so there was a
                    possibility of discovering them by the configurations of the superior bodies.”
                    And, having thereupon “made some essays,” he “found encouragement to proceed
                    further, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0664-0643"/> ultimately framed to himself that method which he
                    ever afterwards followed.” He then began to issue his prophetical almanacs and
                    other works, and it is a curious illustration of the state of intelligence even
                    among educated people at the time that trash of this kind really seems to have
                    met with serious attention from some of the most prominent members of the Long
                    Parliament. If we may believe himself, Lilly lived on friendly and almost
                    intimate terms with Bulstrode Whitlock, Lenthall the speaker, Sir Philip
                    Stapleton, Elias Ashmole, and others. Even Selden seems to have given him some
                    countenance, and probably the chief difference between him and the mass of the
                    community at the time was that, while others believed in the general truth of
                    astrology, he ventured to specify the future events to which its calculations
                    pointed. Even from his own account of himself, however, it is evident that he
                    did not trust implicitly to the indications given by the aspects of the heavens,
                    but like more vulgar fortune-tellers kept his eyes and ears open for any
                    information which might make his predictions safe. It appears that he had
                    correspondents both at home and in foreign parts to keep him conversant with the
                    probable current of affairs. He was evidently a proficient in all the
                    unscrupulous cunning, adroitness, and plausibility which go to make up the
                    successful quack and impostor, and not a few of his exploits indicate rather the
                    quality of a clever police detective than of a profound astrologer. After the
                    Restoration he very quickly fell into disrepute. His sympathy with the
                    parliament, which his predictions had generally shown, was not calculated to
                    bring him into royal favour, and the frivolous and sceptical character of the
                    age could scarcely be expected to fall in with transcendentalism either in the
                    shape of sense or nonsense. He came under the lash of Butler, who, making
                    allowance for some satiric exaggeration, has given in the character of Sidrophel
                    a probably not very incorrect picture of the man; and, having by this time
                    amassed a tolerable fortune, he bought a small estate at Hersham in Surrey, to
                    which he retired, and where he diverted the exercise of his peculiar talents to
                    the practice of medicine. He died in 1681, in the eightieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Lilly’s life of himself, published after his death, is still worth looking into
                    as a remarkable record of credulity and successful imposture. Superstition dies
                    hard; and it is a curious evidence of the inveteracy of popular delusions that
                    so lately as 1852 a prominent London publisher put forth a new edition of
                    Lilly’s <hi rend="italic">Introduction to Astrology,</hi> “with numerous
                    emendations adapted to the improved state of the science.”</p>
