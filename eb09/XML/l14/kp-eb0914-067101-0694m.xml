                <p><label type="entry">LINNAeUS</label> (1707-1778). Carl von Linné, better known
                    under his earlier name of Carolus Linnaeus, was born 13th May 1707 o.s., at
                    Râshult, in the parish of Stenbrohult, in the province of Smâland, Sweden.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The new style being then in
                    process of gradual adoption in Sweden, the year 1704 was regarded as a common
                    year in that country, consequently the true date of Linnaeus’s birth, according
                    to our present reckoning, was 23d May 1707, the commonly received date, 24th
                    May, being an error due to supposing the calendar in Sweden and Russia at that
                    time to be identical.</p></note> His parents were Nils Linnaeus, the
                    comminister, afterwards pastor, of the parish, and Christina, the daughter of
                    Brodersonius, the previous incumbent; Carl, the subject of our notice, being
                    their eldest child. When only four years old he was much impressed with his
                    father’s conversation with some of his people concerning the properties and
                    names of certain of the local plants of economic value; from that time he
                    constantly asked his father about the quality and nature of every plant he met
                    with, often asking more than his father could answer; at other times, having
                    forgotten the information previously given him, he was threatened with a refusal
                    to answer his queries unless he promised to remember what he was told. To this
                    early discipline Linnaeus afterwards ascribed his tenacious memory, which, added
                    to his extreme sharpness of sight, laid the foundations of his eminence as a
                    reforming naturalist.</p>
                <p>His formal education began in 1714, when he was put under the private tuition of
                    Telander, and three years later he entered the primary school at Wexiö. In 1719
                    he was committed to the care of Gabriel Hök, who afterwards married his pupil’s
                    sister Anna Maria; this preceptor had greater skill as a teacher than his
                    predecessors, and was less severe; still he was unable to overcome the distaste
                    the youth had acquired for ordinary scholastic studies. During his last years at
                    school Linnaeus took advantage of the greater liberty then allowed him to ramble
                    in search of plants.</p>
                <p>In 1724 he passed from the school to the gymnasium, carrying with him the same
                    dislike for all those studies which were considered necessary for admission to
                    holy orders, his father’s intention being to bring up his son in his own
                    profession. Botany, a science at that time entirely neglected, almost wholly
                    engrossed his attention; he formed a small library of the few Swedish writers
                    who had treated of plants, which he was constantly poring over, although unable
                    to comprehend all he found in their volumes.</p>
                <p>In 1726 his father came to Wexiö, hoping to hear a good report of the two years’
                    study of his son; but, whilst there was no complaint as regards his moral
                    deportment, his progress in the prescribed studies had been so unsatisfactory
                    that his father was recommended to apprentice him to a tailor or shoemaker, in
                    preference to giving him a learned education, for which he was evidently
                    unfitted. The old clergyman, deeply grieved at this poor return for his
                    struggles to keep his son at school during the previous twelve years, went to
                    visit Dr Rothman, a medical practitioner and lecturer on physics in the town, to
                    consult him regarding a bodily ailment from which he was suffering. In the
                    course of conversation he mentioned his mortification at his son’s dulness, when
                    Rothman expressed his confident belief that he could end the troubles of both
                    father and son, and that Carl, though extremely backward in theological studies,
                    would yet distinguish himself in medicine and natural history. Rothman further
                    offered to board and lodge Carl during the twelvemonth more which must be passed
                    in the gymnasium. A short time after this, Rothman gave his pupil a course of
                    private instruction in physiology with great success, the young man acquitting
                    himself excellently on examination. His tutor also gave <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0695-0672"/> him hints as to the proper manner of studying
                    plants, and directed his attention to Tournefort’s system of arrangement, which
                    was founded on the differences in the flowers.</p>
                <p>He proceeded to the university of Lund in 1727, bearing a dubiously worded
                    testimonium from Nils Krok, the rector of the gymnasium, to the effect that
                    shrubs in a garden may disappoint the cares of the gardener, but if transplanted
                    into different soil may prosper, therefore the bearer was sent to the
                    university, where, perchance, he might find a more propitious climate. His
                    former preceptor Hök kept back this doubtful recommendation, and presented
                    Linnaeus to the rector and dean as his own private pupil, thus procuring his
                    matriculation.</p>
                <p>Whilst studying here, Linnaeus lodged at the house of Dr Kilian Stobaeus,
                    afterwards professor of medicine, and physician to the king, who possessed an
                    excellent museum of minerals, shells, birds, and dried plants; the methods of
                    preservation here adopted were as a revelation to the young student, and taught
                    him how to prepare his own acquisitions. Stobaeus suffered greatly from
                    ill-health, he was also lame, and one-eyed; but he was an amiable and extremely
                    able man, having a large practice among the wealthier classes in the province of
                    Skâne. Linnaeus was sometimes called upon to assist the physician by writing the
                    prescriptions, but as he wrote a bad hand, he was frequently sent away again. In
                    those days physicians wrote legibly.</p>
                <p>A German student named Koulas also lodged with Stobaeus, and amongst the
                    indulgences he enjoyed was that of access to the library of his landlord; with
                    his fellow-student Linnaeus formed a close friendship, and in return for
                    instruction in the physiology which Linnaeus had learned of Dr Rothman, Koulas
                    supplied him with volumes from the book-shelves of Stobaeus, which were read by
                    him stealthily at night. The mother of Stobaeus, who was old and wakeful,
                    noticed that there was constantly a light in Linnaeus’s room, and, being afraid
                    of fire, desired her son to reprimand the young man for his carelessness. Two
                    nights afterwards, Stobaeus went into Linnaeus’s chamber at eleven o’clock,
                    expecting to find him asleep, but was astonished to find him poring over books.
                    He was forced to confess whence these were obtained, and was at once ordered to
                    bed; but the next morning, being further questioned, he was granted full liberty
                    to use the library, and perfect familiarity was accorded by the doctor, who,
                    having no children, held out hopes of making the young student his heir.</p>
                <p>Whilst botanizing in the spring of 1728, Linnaeus was attacked by what he
                    considered to be a venomous animal, afterwards named by him <hi rend="italic"
                    >Furia infernalis,</hi> in allusion to the torment and danger he suffered from
                    it; after his recovery, he passed the summer at his father’s house in Smâland.
                    Here he again met Rothman, who strongly advised him to quit Lund and to go to
                    Upsala, where he would find greater facilities for the prosecution of his
                    medical studies, and possibly obtain some scholarship to eke out his scanty
                    means. Linnaeus adopted his patron’s advice, and started for Upsala with a sum
                    of £8 sterling, that being all he was to expect' from his parents. At this seat
                    of learning his slender funds were soon exhausted; being young and unknown, he
                    found no means of earning money by lecturing or teaching; he became dependent on
                    chance generosity for a meal, and had to repair his shoes with folded paper. He
                    could not well return to Lund, for Stobaeus had taken offence at his departing
                    without consulting him; and, besides, the journey required money which he did
                    not possess.</p>
                <p>In the autumn of this year, 1729, Linnaeus was engaged intently examining some
                    plants growing in the academical garden, when a venerable clergyman asked him
                    what he was studying, whether he understood botany, whence he came, and how long
                    he had been busied in the study. After being questioned at length, he was
                    requested to follow his companion home; there he discovered him to be Dr Olaf
                    Celsius, professor of theology, at that time working at his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hierobotanicon,</hi> which saw the light nearly twenty years later. When the
                    professor saw Linnaeus’s collections he was still more impressed, and, finding
                    him necessitous, he offered him board and lodging; he afterwards admitted him to
                    close intimacy, and allowed him the free use of his rich library. The temporary
                    adjunctus of the faculty of medicine being incompetent, Linnaeus, by the
                    recommendation of Celsius, was able to get some private pupils, and thereby to
                    assume a more creditable appearance.</p>
                <p>At this time there was only one medical student who distinguished himself by
                    diligence in study, and that was Peter Arctedius, who afterwards styled himself
                    Artedi. A close friendship sprang up between the two young men; they studied in
                    concert, and vied with each other in their attainments, with perfect good
                    temper, though of very diverse dispositions. Linnaeus was sovereign in
                    ornithology, entomology, and botany, Artedi reserving to himself the
                    umbelliferous plants, fishes, and amphibia. A silence, almost total, prevailed
                    in the university at this time on topics of natural history; during his whole
                    curriculum Linnaeus did not hear a single public lecture delivered on anatomy,
                    botany, or chemistry.</p>
                <p>During this period of intense receptivity, he came upon a critique which
                    ultimately led to the establishment of his artificial system of plant
                    classification. This was a review of Vaillant’s <hi rend="italic">Sermo</hi><hi

                    flowers, and, becoming convinced of the paramount importance of these organs, he
                    formed the idea of basing a system of arrangement upon them. Another work by

                    hands, he drew up a short treatise on the sexes of plants, and showed it to Dr
                    Celsius, who put it into the hands of the younger Olaf Rudbeck, at that time
                    professor of botany in the university. In the following year Rudbeck, whose
                    advanced age compelled him to lecture by deputy, appointed Linnaeus his
                    adjunctus; in the spring of 1730, therefore, the latter began his lectures, and
                    was accompanied by many pupils on his botanical excursions. The academic garden
                    was entirely remodelled under his auspices, and furnished with many rare
                    species, he being now in a position to direct the gardener, whereas in the year
                    before he had actually solicited appointment to the vacant post of gardener,
                    which was refused him on the ground of his capacity for better things.</p>
                <p>His evenings were now devoted to the preparation of his epoch-making books, which
                    were issued several years afterwards in the Netherlands. His position at the
                    university having become unpleasant, he readily undertook to explore the little
                    known country of Lapland, at the cost of the Academy of Sciences of Upsala. He
                    started thence on May 12, 1732 o.s., carrying all his luggage on his back,
                    journeying at first on horseback along the road skirting the coast to Umeâ,
                    thence by boat up the river to Lyksele within the Arctic Circle, penetrating to
                    what he terms Olycksmyran <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the unlucky marsh) in
                    spite of the melting of the ice, which made travelling in that part almost
                    impossible. Unable to penetrate farther into the interior, he returned to Umeâ,
                    still skirting the sea-shore by Piteâ to Luleâ. From this latter place he made a
                    long excursion to the north-west by Jockmock and Qvickjock; <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0696-0673"/> then, crossing the mountain range, he came out
                    upon the coast of Finmark. He retraced his steps to Luleâ, and at Calix he
                    learned the art of assaying “in two days and a night,” continuing his journey
                    through Torneâ, and the eastern coast of the gulf of Bothnia to Âbo; there he
                    rested eight days, and finally reached Upsala by sea. The distance traversed in
                    this tour was upwards of 4600 English statute miles; the cost of his journey is
                    given at 112 silver dollars, or less than £25 sterling. His own account of the
                    journey was published in English by Sir J. E. Smith, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Lachesis Lappomca,</hi> in 1811; the scientific results were
                    published in his <hi rend="italic">Flora Lappoηica,</hi> Amsterdam, 1737. In
                    1733 Linnaeus was engaged in teaching the method of assaying ores, and hoped to
                    be allowed to lecture on botany; but a quarrel broke out between a rival, Rosen,
                    and himself, the former having, by private influence, contrived to get a
                    prohibition put ou all private lectures on medicine in the university. Linnaeus,
                    enraged at finding his livelihood thus cut off, went so far as to draw his sword
                    upon Rosen, but was prevented from harming his antagonist. At this juncture the
                    governor of Dalecarlia invited Linnaeus to travel through his province, as he
                    had done through Lapland. Whilst on this journey he lectured at Fahlun to large
                    audiences; Browallius, the chaplain there, afterwards bishop of Âbo, now
                    strongly urged Linnaeus to go abroad and take his degree of M.D. at a foreign
                    university, by which means he could afterwards settle where he pleased.
                    Linnaeus, having become attached to the eldest daughter of Dr Moré or Moraeus,
                    left Sweden in 1735 to seek his fortune in the manner stated, and to return to
                    claim her hand.</p>
                <p>He travelled by Lübeck and Hamburg; detecting a seven-headed hydra to be a
                    fabrication at the latter, he was obliged to quit the town in haste to avoid the
                    wrath of its possessor. From Altona he went by sea to Amsterdam, staying there a
                    week; he then proceeded to Harderwijk, where he went through the requisite
                    examination, and defended his thesis on the cause of intermittent fever. His
                    scanty funds were now nearly spent, but he passed on through Haarlem to Leyden;
                    there he called on Gronovius, who, returning the visit, was shown the <hi
                    rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae</hi> in MS., and was so
                    greatly astonished at it that he sent it to press at his own expense. The first
                    edition was in eight folio sheets; the subsequent editions were in 8vo; and the
                    twelfth immensely enlarged edition appeared during the author’s lifetime. ^This
                    famous system, which, artificial as it was, substituted order for confusion,
                    largely made its way on account of the lucid and admirable laws, and comments on
                    them, which were issued almost at the same time. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Botany,</hi> vol. iv. p. 80. Boerhaave, whom Linnaeus saw after waiting eight
                    days for admission, recommended him to Burman at Amsterdam, where he stayed a
                    twelvemonth, living at the house of the professor. While there he issued his <hi
                    rend="italic">Fundamenta</hi><hi rend="italic">Botanica,</hi> an unassuming
                    small octavo, which has exercised immense influence. The wealthy banker Cliffort
                    having invited Linnaeus to visit his magnificent garden at Harte-camp, he
                    remained there, living like a prince, but working most assiduously in the garden
                    and library, both of which were kept up without regard to cost. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Flora Lapponica</hi> was now printed, containing a description of
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Linnaea,</hi> by his friend Gronovius; he selected
                    this plant to bear his name, from a similarity, as he thought, between it and
                    himself. Whilst living with Cliffort, Linnaeus met with his old fellow-student
                    Àrtedi, who was quite destitute, having spent all his money in London; Linnaeus
                    introduced him to Seba, then working at fishes, Artedi’s chief object of study;
                    he worked hard at describing them, until only six remained undescribed, when he
                    unfortunately fell into a canal at night, and was drowned.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus persuaded Cliffort to redeem the manuscript, and he published it as a
                    memorial of his deceased friend.</p>
                <p>In 1736 Linnaeus visited England. He was warmly recommended by Boerhaave to Sir
                    Hans Sloane, but the old collector seems to have received him coldly. A better
                    reception awaited him at Oxford, where Dr Shaw welcomed him cordially;
                    Dillenius, the professor of botany there, was icy at first, but afterwards
                    thawed completely, kept him a month, and even offered to share the emoluments of
                    the chair with him. At Chelsea he saw Philip Miller, and took some plants thence
                    to Cliffort; but certain other stories which are current about Linnaeus’s visit
                    to England are of very doubtful authenticity.</p>
                <p>On his return to the Netherlands he completed the printing of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Genera Plantarum,</hi> a volume which must be considered the
                    starting point of modern systematic botany; Tournefort formed many genera, but
                    Linnaeus was the first to circumscribe them. During the same year, 1737,
                    Linnaeus finished arranging Cliffort’s collection of plants, living and dried;
                    these were described in the <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cliffortiaηus,</hi> a folio illustrated with engravings by Ehret; this book was
                    entirely written in nine months. During the compilation he used to “amuse”
                    himself with drawing up the <hi rend="italic">Critica Botanica,</hi> also
                    printed in the Netherlands. But this strenuous and unremitting labour told upon
                    him; the atmosphere of the Low Countries seemed to oppress him beyond endurance;
                    he resisted all Cliffort’s entreaties to remain with him, and started
                    homewards.</p>
                <p>Van Royen managed to detain him a year at Leyden, to help in rearranging the
                    garden, thereby offending Cliffort, whom he had quitted on the plea of hastening
                    back to Sweden. Linnaeus now published his <hi rend="italic">Classes
                    Plantarum,</hi> and almost at the same time appeared Van Royen’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Horl·us Leydensis</hi> and Gronovius’s <hi rend="italic">Flora
                    Virginica,</hi> both of these being drawn up on the Linnaean system. In 1738
                    Boerhaave pressed Linnaeus to accept a post at Surinam; he declined this for
                    himself, but passed it on to Johan Bartsch of Königsberg, a member with himself
                    of a select club of naturalists at Leyden. Bartsch ultimately fell a victim to
                    the climate of that colony.</p>
                <p>While residing at Leyden Linnaeus was warned that one of his acquaintance was
                    endeavouring to supplant him in the affections of Sara Moré; he intended to set
                    out at once, but was attacked by ague before he could start. Cliffort, hearing
                    of this, took Linnaeus to his own house again, and would not suffer him to
                    depart until he was sufficiently well. His complete recovery, however, did not
                    take place until he had gained the higher country of Brabant, where in one day
                    he felt himself entirely renovated. He continued his journey to Paris, where he
                    visited Antoine and Bernard de Jussieu, botanizing with the latter. Abandoning
                    all notion of returning through Germany, he went to Rouen, sailed for Sweden,
                    and landed at Helsingborg.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus established himself in September 1738 as physician in Stockholm, but,
                    being unknown as a medical man, no one at first cared to consult him, a great
                    change from the attention paid to him abroad; he himself declared “that, had he
                    not been in love, he would certainly have left his native country.” By degrees
                    he found patients, was then appointed naval physician at Stockholm, with minor
                    appointments, and was married on the 26th June 1739.</p>
                <p>Early in 1740 Rudbeck died, and Roberg resigned; the chairs of botany and
                    medicine at Upsala being thus vacant, Rosen and Linnaeus were chosen
                    respectively to fill them. The former rivals afterwards agreed to exchange
                    professorships to their mutual benefit; in 1741, previous to this exchange,
                    Linnaeus travelled through Öland and Gothland, by command of the state,
                    publishing his results in <hi rend="italic">Oldηdsha</hi><hi rend="italic">och
                    Gothländska</hi><hi rend="italic">Pesa,</hi> 1745. The index to this volume
                    shows thefirst employment of trivial names in nomenclature.</p>

                <p>Henceforward his life was a continuous course of prosperity, his time being taken
                    up by teaching and the preparation of other works. In the year 1745 he issued
                    his <hi rend="italic">Flora Suecica</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Fauna
                    Suecica,</hi> the latter having occupied his attention during fifteen years;
                    afterwards, two volumes of observations made during journeys in Sweden, <hi
                    rend="italic">Wästgota</hi><hi rend="italic">Resa,</hi> Stockholm, 1747, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Skanska Resa,</hi> Stockholm, 1751. He examined the collections
                    made many years before in Ceylon by Hermann, the full publication taking place
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Flora Zeylanica,</hi> Stockholm, 1747. In 1748 he
                    brought out his <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Upsaliensis,</hi>
                    showing that he had added eleven hundred species to those formerly in
                    cultivation in that garden. In 1750 his <hi rend="italic">Philosophia
                    Botanica</hi> was given to the world; it consists of a commentary on the various
                    axioms he had published in 1735 in his <hi rend="italic">Fundamenta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Botanica,</hi> and was dictated to his pupil Löfling, while the
                    professor was confined to his bed by an attack of gout so violent as to threaten
                    his life; he attributed his recovery to eating plentifully of wood-strawberries,
                    a regimen he afterwards carefully observed. A much slighter attack in the
                    following year was mainly cured by the pleasure caused by Kalm bringing home
                    many new plants from Canada.</p>
                <p>He catalogued the Queen’s Museum at Drotningholm, and the King’s at Ulrichsdal,
                    but the most important work of this period of his life is unquestionably his <hi
                    rend="italic">Species Plantarum,</hi> Stockholm, 1753,—a second edition being
                    issued in 1762. In this volume the trivial names are fully set forth; although
                    they had been previously shadowed forth by Linnaeus and others, yet to him
                    belongs -the merit of establishing the use of a single epithet in addition to
                    the generic name. In the same year Linnaeus was created knight of the Polar
                    Star, the first time a scientific man had been raised to that honour in
                    Sweden.</p>
                <p>In 1755 he was invited by the king of Spain to settle in that country, with a
                    liberal salary, and full liberty of conscience, but he declined on the ground
                    that whatever merits he possessed should be devoted to his country’s service;
                    Löfling was sent instead, but died within two years. He was enabled now to
                    purchase the estates of Söfja and Hammarby; at the latter he built his museum of
                    stone, to guard against loss by fire. His lectures at the university drew men
                    from all parts of the world; the normal number of students at Upsala was five
                    hundred, whilst he occupied the chair of botany there it rose to fifteen
                    hundred. In 1761 a patent of nobility was granted, antedated to 1757, from which
                    time Linnaeus was styled Carl von Linné; his arms were those now borne by the
                    Linnean Society of London. To his great delight the tea plant was introduced
                    alive into Europe in 1763; this year also his son Carl was allowed to assist his
                    father in his professorial duties, and to be trained as his successor.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Carl von Linné the younger,
                    the elder son of the distinguished naturalist, was born at Fahlun, 20th January
                    1741. Delicate in constitution, he seemed to be oppressed with his father’s
                    reputation and his having to support it. He published two decades of new plants,
                    and three dissertations, contributing also some descriptions to the first
                    edition of Alton’s <hi rend="italic">Ηortus Kewensis,</hi> at the time of his
                    visit to England. He died unmarried at Upsala, 1st November 1783; and, his only
                    brother Johan having died in infancy, the succession became extinct in the male
                    line. His mother sold the collections and books of father <hi rend="superscript"
                    > a</hi> ∙nd son to Dr. J. E. Smith, the first president of the Linnean Society
                    of London. When Smith died in 1828, a subscription was raised to purchase the
                    herbarium and library for the Society, whose property they now remain. Smith
                    sold the collection of minerals in 1796, and added many insects to the Linnean
                    types, but the herbarium is practically in the same state as when the elder
                    Linné himself last used it. The manuscripts of most of his publications, and the
                    letters he received from his contemporaries, are likewise in the possession of
                    the Society.</p></note> At the age of sixty Linné’s memory began to fail; an
                    apoplectic attack in 1774 greatly weakened him; two years after he lost the use
                    of his right side; and he died</p>
                <p>10th January 1778, of an ulceration of the bladder. He was buried in the
                    cathedral of Upsala, with every token of universal regret.</p>
                <p>In person Linnaeus was described as of medium height, with large limbs, brown
                    piercing eyes, and acute vision, and quick-tempered. He was accustomed to sleep
                    five hours in summer and ten in winter. He lived simply, acted promptly, and
                    noted down his observations at the moment. His handwriting was peculiar, and not
                    very easy to read; copies of his own books were interleaved and copiously
                    annotated, every new discovery being posted into its proper place at once, so
                    that new editions were readily prepared when wanted.</p>
                <p>With him arrangement seems to have been a passion; he delighted in devising
                    classifications; not only did he systematise the three kingdoms of nature, but
                    even drew up a treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Genera Mοrbοrum.</hi> He found
                    biology a chaos; he left it a cosmos. When he appeared upon the scene, new
                    plants and animals were in course of daily discovery in increasing numbers, due
                    to the increase of trading facilities; he devised schemes of arrangement by
                    which these acquisitions might be sorted provisionally, until tbeir natural
                    affinities should have become clearer. He made many mistakes; but the honour due
                    to him for having first enunciated the true principles for defining genera and
                    species, and his uniform use of trivial names, will last so long as biology
                    itself endures. His style is terse and laconic; he methodically treated of each
                    organ in its proper turn; he had a special term for each, the meaning of which
                    did not vary, so that the term did not suggest two ideas at once. The reader
                    cannot doubt the author’s intention; his sentences are business-like, and to the
                    point. The omission of the verb in his descriptions was an innovation, and gave
                    an abruptness to his language which was foreign to the writing of his time; but
                    it probably by its succinctness added to the popularity of his works.</p>
                <p>By his force of character he shifted the scientific centre of gravity during his
                    life to a small town in Sweden; he was constantly receiving presents and praise
                    from crowds of correspondents in every civilized country and in every station of
                    life; hence it is not surprising that this universal homage should have bred the
                    vanity which disfigures the latter part of his diary.</p>
                <p>No modern naturalist has impressed his own character with greater force upon his
                    pupils than did Linnaeus. He imbued them with his own intense acquisitiveness,
                    reared them in an atmosphere of enthusiasm, trained them to close and accurate
                    observation, and then dispatched them to various parts of the globe. His
                    students being drawn from many quarters, he had an extensive choice; some fell
                    victims to fatigue and unkindly climates, but there was no lack of successors.
                    With these young enthusiasts their master’s lore was like a gospel; they were
                    eager to extend the knowledge of it, and to contribute to its richness.</p>
                <p>The published works of Linnaeus amount to more than one hundred and eighty,
                    including the <hi rend="italic">Amoenitates</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Academieae,</hi> for which he provided the material, revising them also for
                    press; corrections in his handwriting may be seen in the Banksian and Linnean
                    Society’s libraries. His correspondence was wide and copious. Some of his
                    letters have been published, but the bulk of them remains inedited. Many works
                    remain in MS.; some have lately been published, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flora Dalecarlica,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Svenska Arbeten,</hi> both
                    edited by Dr Ewald Ährling; those which were issued during the author’s life are
                    enumerated by Dr Pulteney in his <hi rend="italic">General View of the Writings
                    of</hi><hi rend="italic">Linnaeus.</hi> (B. D. J.)</p>
