                    Aberdeen, where he took the degree of M.A. In 1538 he obtained a dispensation
                    permitting him to hold a benefice, notwithstanding his being a natural son, and
                    in June 1546 he was made an acolyte in the cathedral church of Aberdeen, of
                    which he was afterwards appointed a canon and prebendary. He also studied at
                    Poitiers, at Toulouse, and at Paris, where he was made doctor of laws. In 1558
                    he was appointed official of Aberdeen, and in 1559 he was inducted into the
                    parsonage and prebend of Oyne. At the Reformation Lesley became a champion of
                    the Romish faith, and appeared on that side at the disputation held in Edinburgh
                    in 1561, when Knox was one of his antagonists. He was one of the commissioners
                    sent the same year to bring over the young Queen Mary to take the government of
                    Scotland. He returned in her train, and was appointed a privy councillor, and in
                    1564 one of the senators of the college of justice. Shortly afterwards he was
                    made abbot of Lindores, and in 1565 bishop of Ross. He was one of the sixteen
                    commissioners appointed to revise the laws of Scotland, and the volume of the
                    Acts of Parliament known as the Black Acts was, chiefly owing to his care,
                    printed in 1566.</p>

                    royal cause, and whilst Mary was a captive in England, Lesley continued to exert
                    himself on her behalf. He was one of the commissioners at the conference at York
                    in 1568. He appeared as her ambassador at the court of Elizabeth to complain of
                    the injustice done to her, and when he found he was not listened to he laid
                    plans for the escape of the queen. He also projected a marriage for her with the
                    duke of Norfolk, which ended in the execution of that nobleman. For this he was
                    put under the charge of the bishop of Ely, and afterwards imprisoned in the
                    Tower of London. During his confinement he collected materials for his history
                    of Scotland, with which his name is now chiefly known. In 1571 he presented the
                    latter portion of this work, written in his own vernacular tongue, to Queen Mary
                    to amuse her in her captivity. He also wrote for her use his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piae</hi><hi rend="italic">Consolationes,</hi> and the queen devoted some of
                    the hours of her captivity to translating a portion of it into French verse.</p>
                <p>In 1573 he was liberated from prison, but was banished from England. For two
                    years he attempted unsuccessfully to obtain the assistance of Continental
                    princes in favour of Queen Mary. While at Rome in 1578 he published his history
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine, Moribus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Gestis
                    Scotorum,</hi> the Latinity of which is held only second to that of Buchanan. In
                    1579 he went to France, and was made suffragan and vicar-general of the
                    archbishopric of Rouen by the Cardinal de Bourbon. Whilst visiting his diocese,
                    however, he was thrown into prison, and had to pay 3000 pistoles to prevent his
                    being given up to Elizabeth. During the remainder of the reign of Henry III. he
                    lived unmolested, but on the accession of the Protestant Henry IV. he again fell
                    into trouble. In 1590 he was thrown into prison, and had to purchase his freedom
                    at the same expense as before. In 1593 he was made bishop of Coutances in
                    Normandy, and had licence to hold the bishopric of Ross till he should obtain
                    peaceable possession of the former see. Being tired of life, he retired at last
                    to a monastery at Gurtenburg near Brussels, where he died in 1596.</p>
