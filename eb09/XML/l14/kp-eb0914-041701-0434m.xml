                    the</hi></label>. This order of merit was instituted by Napoleon in 1802, all
                    previously existing French military or religious orders—those of St Michael, the
                    Holy Ghost, St Louis, and Military Merit, as well as the united orders of St
                    Lazarus and Our Lady of Mount Carmel—having been abolished at the Revolution.
                    All soldiers on whom sabres of honour had been already conferred were forthwith
                    declared to be members, and all citizens of sufficient merit were declared to be
                    eligible for admission, whatever their birth, rank, religion, or social position
                    might be. At their reception they were required to swear upon their honour to
                    employ all just, reasonable, and lawful means for the service of the republic,
                    the maintenance of its territory, the support of the government, the law, and
                    the public property, and to withstand every effort towards the restoration of
                    the feudal system and its various accompaniments—in short, to co-operate as much
                    as in them lay for the assertion of the principles of freedom and equality. The
                    grand master was Napoleon himself; under him were 105 grand officers, 300
                    commanders, 450 officers, and 3665 chevaliers. To the members of the various
                    classes yearly allowances, ranging from 5000 francs in the case of a grand
                    officer to 200 in that of a chevalier, were assigned. Some unimportant
                    modifications in details were made when the empire was introduced. Between 1805
                    and 1814 about 48,000 nominations were made, 1400 only being in favour of
                    civilians. Shortly after the accession of Louis XVIII. considerable changes took
                    place. The old military and religious orders were restored, and that of the
                    Legion of Honour reduced to the last place; the king was of course its grand
                    master; the membership was divided into five grades,—80 grand crosses, 160 grand
                    officers, 400 commanders, 2000 officers, and an indeterminate number of
                    chevaliers. These fixed numbers were to be exclusive of members of the royal
                    family, princes of the blood, and foreigners. Admission (the reward of at least
                    twenty-five years of distinguished service) in ordinary cases was to be made to
                    the grade of chevalier only; and only chevaliers of more than four years’
                    standing, officers of two years’ standing, and commanders of three years were to
                    be eligible for promotion. The admissions were in every case to be made on
                    parade in the case of military persons, and at a public sitting of a court of
                    first instance in the case of civilians. The terms of the oath required were, of
                    course, somewhat modified, and the arrangements about yearly allowances could
                    not be continued. After the revolution of July, the “Ordre royal de la légion
                    d’honneur” again resumed the unique place and special character which had
                    belonged to it under Bonaparte in 1802. But its constitution was again
                    remodelled in 1852; the numbers of grand crosses, grand officers, commanders,
                    and officers was fixed respectively at 80, 200, 1000, and 2000, the number of
                    chevaliers being still left vague, while the system of annual allowances was
                    restored. Since 1870 the maximum number of chevaliers has been fixed at 25,000,
                    the remaining four classes having 70, 200, 1000, and 4000 assigned to them
                    respectively. In each grade three-fifths must be military persons, the rest
                    civilians. The yearly pension of a military chevalier is 250 francs, of an
                    officer 500, of a commander 1000, of a grand officer 2000, and of a grand cross
                    3000. The order may be conferred upon foreigners, but these do not count. It has
                    occasionally been conferred upon women <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Rosa
                    Bonheur). In connexion with the order there is an army medal, which may be
                    distributed to the number of 40,000, and which entitles the bearer to a pension
                    of 100 francs. On January 1, 1874, the military members of the legion, in point
                    of fact, numbered 39,793, drawing 12,718,050 francs annually; and there were
                    51,460 holders of military medals, drawing 5,146,000 francs, besides not less
                    than 15,000 civil members drawing no pension. By economy in making new
                    appointments, these numbers have subsequently been reduced. Since 1805 there has
                    existed an institution for the education of daughters, sisters, and nieces of
                    members of the legion; in 1809 the numbers were fixed at 600, the place being
                    the “Maison d’éducation de Saint Denis.” The arrangements have subsequently been
                    considerably extended. The decoration under the first empire consisted of a
                    white enamelled five-rayed star, bearing the portrait of Napoleon, and a wreath
                    of oak and laurel, with the words “Napoleon, empereur des Français”; on the
                    reverse was the French eagle grasping a thunderbolt, and the legend “Honneur et
                    patrie.” The ribband was of watered scarlet silk. At present the obverse of the
                    star bears the effigy of the republic and the words “République Française,” the
                    reverse two tricolor flags with the original legend.</p>
