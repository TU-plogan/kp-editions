                    rend="italic">{Liflandia</hi> of the Russians), one of the three Baltic
                    provinces of Russia, is bounded by the Gulf of Riga on the W., Esthonia on the
                    N., the governments of St Petersburg, Pskov, and Vitebsk on the E., and Courland
                    on the S. A group of islands, situated at the entrance of the Gulf of Riga, of
                    which Ösel, Mohn, Runo, and Paternoster are the largest, belong to this
                    government. It covers, with the islands, a surface of 18,160 square miles, but
                    of this the part of Lake Peipus, or Tchudskoye, which belongs to it occupies
                    1090. Its surface is diversified by several plateaus, those of Haanhoff and of
                    the Livonian Aa having an average height of 700 feet, whilst several summits
                    reach from 800 to 1000 feet or more (such as the Munna-Mäggi, 1063 feet:

                    847 feet). The edges of the plateaus are intersected by deep valleys, which give
                    a hilly character to the country; the hilly tract between the Duna and its
                    tributary the Livonian Aa has received from its picturesque narrow valleys,
                    covered with deep forests and numerous lakes, the name of “Wendish Switzerland.”
                    The plateau of Odenpä, watered by the tributaries of the Embach river, which
                    flows for 93 miles from lake Wierz-yärvi into Lake Peipus, occupies an area of
                    2830 square miles, and has an average height of 500 feet. More than a thousand
                    lakes are scattered over Livonia, of which that of Wierz-yärvi, having a surface
                    of 105 square miles (114 feet above sea-level), is the largest; marshes and
                    peat-bogs occupy as much as one-tenth of the province. Of the very numerous
                    rivers which water Livonia, only the Duna, which flows for 90 miles along its
                    frontier, and the Embach are navigable.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of Livonia has been elaborately examined. The Silurian
                    formation which covers Esthonia, and much resembles the Norwegian Silurian,
                    appears in the northern part of Livonia, the remainder of the province
                    consisting of Devonian strata. The whole is covered with a mighty sheet of
                    glacial deposits, sometimes 400 feet thick. The typical bottom moraine, with
                    boulders of all sizes up to 20 feet in diameter, brought from Finland, extends
                    all over the country, reaching even to the summit of Munna-Mäggi. Glacial
                    furrows, striae, and elongated troughs are met with everywhere, running mostly
                    from north-west to south-east, as well as <hi rend="italic">äsar,</hi> which
                    have the same direction and consist of morainic nucleus covered with stratified
                    sands and clays; sand-downs cover large tracts on the shores of the Baltic. As
                    in Esthonia, no traces of marine deposits are found higher than 100 or 150 feet
                    above the present sea-level. The soil is not very fertile. Forests cover about
                    two-fifths of the surface of this government, several of them having a diameter
                    of 150 to 250 miles. The climate is rather severe. The mean temperatures are 43°
                    Fahr, at Riga (winter, 23°; summer, 63°), and 42J° at Dorpat. The intensity and
                    direction of winds are very variable; the average number of rainy and snowy days
                    is one hundred and forty-six at Riga <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> rainfall
                    24*1 inches); fogs are not uncommon.</p>
                <p>The population of Livonia, which was but 621,600 in 1816, reached 1,000,876 in
                    1870, and is now about 1,121,000 in 1882. Though it is often described as a
                    German province, only about 7 per cent, of the population (64,120 in 1863) are
                    Germans, the great bulk being Ehsts or Esthonians (47 per cent.) and Letts (41
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 per cent.). The Russians number about 35,000,
                    Poles 5000, and Jews 7000. The Livonians, who have given their name to the
                    country, and who formerly extended far east to Sebej in the government of
                    Vitebsk, have nearly all passed away; only a few thousands (2050 in 1863)
                    inhabit the forests at the utmost extremity of the peninsula of Courland. Their
                    native language, of Finnish origin, is rapidly disappearing, their present
                    language being rather a Lettish patois. Sjogren, in 1846, had much difficulty in
                    making a grammar and dictionary of it from the mouths of old people. The Ehsts,
                    who greatly resemble the Finns of Tavastland, have maintained their ethnic
                    features, their customs, national traditions, national songs and poetry, and
                    their harmonious language. There is now a marked revival of national feeling,
                    favoured by “Young Esthonia,” together with a tendency towards a union with
                    Finland. No less than eight political papers are published in the Esthonian
                    language. The prevailing religion is the Lutheran (746,654 in 1863); about
                    80,000 Ehsts in Livonia and Esthonia, and 50,000 Letts (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lithuanians),</hi> as well as the Russians, belong to the Greek Church (156,874
                    in 1863); of the Russians, however, a considerable proportion are <hi
                    rend="italic">raskolniks</hi> (nonconformists), who have emigrated to the Baltic
                    provinces in consequence of prosecutions; these last number about 14,500, of
                    whom 8000 are found in the neighbourhood of Riga. About 6000 are Catholics. The
                    Germans <hi rend="italic">belong</hi> to the nobility, or to the burgher class
                    in the towns.</p>
                <p>The efforts of the German conquerors to Germanize the country have completely
                    failed. The Ehsts and Letts openly display their traditional hatred against the
                    invaders. The teaching in primary schools is carried on in Esthonian and
                    Lettish; German prevails in colleges and higher schools. The Russian Government
                    has for some time been labouring for “Russification”; the Russian civil code was
                    introduced in the Baltic provinces in 1835, and the use of Russian, instead of
                    German, in official correspondence and in law courts was ordered in 1867, but
                    not generally brought into practice; the fact that the privileges given by the
                    military law to those who have received primary education extend only to those
                    who know Russian contributes to the extension of that language.</p>
                <p>Nearly all the soil belongs to the nobility, the extent of peasants’ estates
                    being only 15 per cent. Serfdom was abolished in 1819, when the peasants
                    received personal liberty, remaining, however, under the jurisdiction of their
                    landlords, who maintained also the right to have a predominant influence in the
                    nomination of ministers. Since 1849 the contribution in forced labour which the
                    peasants were compelled to pay to landlords has been gradually, though
                    imperfectly, commuted to a money payment, and the peasants have received the
                    right to purchase their allotments. But, owing to later limitations of this law,
                    as well as to the high price of allotments and to the establishment of a minimum
                    size of 80 acres, the redemption of the land is going on very slowly. The class
                    of peasant proprietors being restricted to a small number of wealthy peasants,
                    the great bulk have remained <hi rend="italic">Knechts,</hi> that is, tenants at
                    will; they are very miserable, and about one-fourth of them are continually
                    wandering in search of work. They readily emigrate, even to such unfertile
                    provinces as Novgorod and Vitebsk, and from time to time the emigration takes
                    the shape of a mass movement, which the Government stops by forcible measures.
                    The average size of landed estates is from 9500 to 11,000 acres, far above the
                    general average for Russia. The estates of the nobility are generally as well
                    cultivated as in western Europe, while the peasants’ farms are mostly in a
                    deplorable state. In 1877 21 ’ 4 per cent, of the surface of Livonia was under
                    crop, yielding 1,942,600 quarters of grain, and 1,843,200 quarters of potatoes.
                    There were at the same time 146,000 horses, 372,000 cattle, 312,000 sheep, and
                    150,000 pigs. The shores of the Baltic yield valuable fisheries. Manufactures
                    are steadily increasing. The distilleries yield about 1,400,000 gallons of
                    spirits, part of which is exported; the beer breweries (two hundred) produce
                    beer worth about 650,000 roubles. There are woollen, cotton, and silk mills,
                    sawmills, and paper, glass, candle, tobacco, and machinery works,—the chief*
                    manufacturing districts being Pernau and Riga. Livonia carries on a large export
                    trade, especially through Riga and Pernau, in flax, linseed, hemp, grain,
                    timber, and wooden wares; the Duna is of course the chief channel for this
                    trade. During the last ten years, however, Libau has entered into brisk
                    competition with the more northern ports of Livonia. The imports, especially
                    through Riga, are also most important, the custom-houses of Livonia having had
                    in 1881 ap income of 6,000,000 silver roubles. The government is divided in
                    eleven districts—Riga (104,200), Wollmar (2050), Dorpat (22,600), Pernau
                    (12,500), Wenden (65,000), Arensburg in the island Ösel (3150), Walk (2950),
                    Fellin (2900), Werro (2050), Lämsall (1450), and Schlock (800). The capital of
                    the government is Riga.</p>
                <p>The first historical notices of Livonia are by Tacitus and Jordanes, but coins of
                    the time of Alexander the Great, found on the island of Ösel, show that the
                    coasts of the Baltic were at an early time in commercial relations with the
                    civilized world. The chronicle of Nestor mentions as inhabitants of the Baltic
                    coast the Tchud, the Lives, the Narova, Letgola, Semigalians, and Koré. It is
                    probably about the 9th century that the Tchud became tributary to the λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> ary ago-Russian states. As thςy reacquired their
                    independence, Yaroslaff I. undertook in 1030 a campaign against them, and
                    founded Yourieff (Dorpat). The first Germans penetrated into Livonia in the
                    lltfi century, and in 1158 several Bremen merchants landed at the mouth of the
                    Duna. In 1186 the emissaries of the archbishop of Bremen began to preach the
                    Christian religion among the Ehsts and Letts, and in 1200 the archbishop of
                    Livonia established his residence at the mouth of the Duna, at Riga. In 1202 or
                    1204 Innocent III. recognized the Order of Brothers of the Sword <hi
                    rend="italic">^Schwert-bru,deτ∖</hi> the residence of its grandmaster being at
                    Wenden; and the order, spreading the Christian religion by sword and fire among
                    the natives, carried on from that time a series of uninterrupted wars against
                    the Russian republics and Lithuania, as well as a struggle against the influence
                    of the archbishop of Riga, which last was supported by the importance acquired
                    by Riga as a centre for trade, intermediate between the Hanseatic towns and
                    those of Novgorod, Pskov, and Polotsk. The first active interference of
                    Lithuania in the affairs of Livonia dates from the times which immediately
                    followed the great outbreak of peasants on Ösel; Olgerd devastated then all
                    southern Livonia. The order happening to purchase the Danish part of Esthonia,
                    in 1347, began with fresh forces the war against the bishop of Riga, as well as
                    against Lithuania, Poland, and Russia. The wars against those powers were
                    terminated respectively in 1435, 1466, and 1483. About the end of the 15th
                    century the master of the order, Plettenberg, acquired a position of great
                    importance, and in 1527 he was recognized as a prince of the empire by Charles
                    V. On the other hand, the authority of the bishops of Riga was soon completely
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n748/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0748-0725"/> destroyed (1566). The war of the order with John
                    IV. in 1550 led to a division of Livonia,—its northern part, Dorpat included,
                    being taken by Russia, and the southern part falling under the dominion of
                    Poland. From that time Livonia formed a subject of dispute between Poland and
                    Russia, the latter only formally abdicating its rights to the country in 1582.
                    In 1621 it was the theatre of a war between Poland and Sweden, and was conquered
                    by the latter power, enjoying thus for twenty-five years a milder rule. In 1654,
                    and again at the beginning of the 17th century, it became the theatre of war
                    between Poland, Russia, and Sweden, and at last was finally conquered by Russia.
                    The official concession was confirmed by the treaty of Nystad in 1721, Russia
                    guaranteeing the privileges of the nobility ana citizens, and the freedom of the
                    evangelical confession. (P. A. K.)</p>
