                    side of the river, is connected with the city by an iron bridge 700 feet in
                    length, constructed in 1872. Linz possesses two cathedrals, one dating from
                    1670, and another, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, commenced in 1862,
                    and still unfinished, a Lutheran (1845) and several Roman Catholic churches, the
                    new synagogue opened in 1877, and many religious houses. The old <pb break="no"

                    Bibliotheca Publica (1788), now (1882) containing 34,000 volumes, the Museum
                    Francisco-Carolinum (1834), and a state theatre (1803) may also be noticed, with
                    the episcopal and archducal palaces, and the castle now used as barracks. There
                    are many educational establishments, including the theological diocesan lyceum,
                    a new gymnasium and normal schools, and several hospitals and asylums. The
                    principal manufactories are of tobacco (in 1880 employing 787 hands, and
                    producing 25,286,050 cigars and 1850 tons of tobacco), and boot-varnish and
                    blacking (2500 cwts.), the last chiefly exported to Hungary and Italy. Two
                    breweries in 1881 produced 1,781,828 gallons of beer, and the other industries
                    include iron-boat-building, and the manufacture of locomotives and agricultural
                    implements. Trade and commerce are facilitated by the river. About forty-six
                    thousand passengers embark or disembark at the steamboat landing stage, and the
                    imports and exports there amount together to about 500,000 cwts. annually. There
                    is a considerable traffic in woollen goods, carpets, linen fabrics, thread,
                    prepared leather, iron wares, and salt. Cattle and meat markets are held twice a
                    week. The Volksfest, a popular fair held generally every second September, is
                    much resorted to by strangers. The surrounding country is highly picturesque. On
                    the 31st December 1880 the population (exclusive of the garrison, 2799) was
                    36,116, or with the suburbs of Waldegg (1204) and Lustenau (1568) 38,888,
                    chiefly Roman Catholics.</p>

                    >Lentium</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Lentia.</hi> The authentic history of Linz
                    cannot be traced farther back than 799. In 1140 it was purchased from
                    Gottschalk, count of Kyrnberg, by Leopold I V., margrave of Austria; in 1324 it
                    first received municipal rights, and in 1490 became the capital of the province
                    above the Enns. Of various attacks which Linz from time to time successfully
                    resisted the most notable was that by the insurgent peasants under Stephen
                    Fadinger, 21st and 22d July 1626, when the suburbs were laid in ashes. At Linz
                    (16th December 1645) peace was concluded between the emperor Ferdinand III. and
                    the Transylvanian prince Râkôczy (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hungary,</hi> vol.
                    xii. p. 370). During the siege of Vienna iu 1683 the castle at Linz was the
                    residence of Leopold I. The triple deliverance of Linz from war, fire, and
                    pestilence was commemorated by Charles VI., in 1723, by the erection of a marble
                    monument known as Trinity Column. In 1741, during the war of the Austrian
                    succession, Linz was taken by the troops of the elector of Bavaria, but on the
                    23d January 1742 it was recovered by the Austrians. The bishopric was
                    established by Pope Pius VI. in 1784. On the 15th of August 1800 many of the
                    principal buildings were destroyed by fire. On the 17th May 1809 an Austrian
                    force was defeated near the city in an engagement with Saxon and Wurtemberg
                    troops. The chain of outlying forts, thirty-two in number, now abandoned, and to
                    a great extent demolished, was constructed between 1828 and 1836 under the
                    direction of Archduke Maximilian d’Este. A general assembly of the Catholic
                    Union for Germany was held here 24th to 26th September 1850. Tramways were
                    introduced in 1880, and a new line of railway through the Kremsthal was
                    completed as far as Kremsmiinster in 1881.</p>
