                    presented for study by positive laws.</p>
                <p>The objects which laws ought to subserve, the principles of legislation, the
                    sphere of law, the province of government, and other topics of a similar nature
                    which are generally to be found in writings professing to treat of law in the
                    abstract have been discussed under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Government</hi> and elsewhere. It will be convenient, and it will be following
                    the lines of a very remarkable development of English thought, to take actual
                    laws as positive facts, without reference to their goodness or badness, and
                    examine, so far as it can be done within the limits at our command, the
                    character which they present when looked at from different points of view. This
                    conception of the science of law, which is closely related to the scientific
                    ideas of the time, has been developed by the efforts of the modern school of
                    English jurists. In former times the science of law meant anything but science
                    as we have been taught to conceive it by physical philosophers. It meant if
                    anything a philosophy of legal principles not necessarily related to any system
                    of actual law. A philosophy of laws actually existing in fact is what we in
                    England at least should now consider the science of law to be. By universal
                    consent the somewhat shifting term jurisprudence has been limited to this
                    meaning. Jurisprudence is the science of positive laws. The present article will
                    attempt to present simply the leading principles and conclusions of
                    jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>The human race may be conceived as parcelled out into a number of distinct groups
                    or societies, differing greatly in size and circumstances, in physical and moral
                    characteristics of all kinds. But they all resemble each other in this that they
                    reveal on examination certain rules of conduct in accordance with which the
                    relations of the members <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> are governed. Such
                    rules we may for the present, without anticipating a somewhat difficult
                    discussion, term laws. Each society has its own system of laws, and all the
                    systems, so far as they are known, constitute the appropriate subject matter of
                    jurisprudence. The jurist may deal with it in the following ways. He may first
                    of all examine the leading conceptions common to all the systems, or in other
                    words define the leading terms common to them all. Such are the terms <hi
                    rend="italic">law</hi> itself, <hi rend="italic">right, duty, property,
                    crime,</hi> and so forth, which, or their equivalents, may, notwithstanding
                    delicate differences of connotation, be regarded as common terms in all systems.
                    That kind of inquiry is what is known in England as analytical jurisprudence. It
                    regards the conceptions with which it deals as fixed or stationary, and aims at
                    expressing them distinctly and exhibiting their logical relations with each
                    other. What is really meant by a right and by a duty, and what is the true
                    connexion between a right and a duty, are types of the questions proper to this
                    inquiry. Shifting our point of view, but still regarding systems of law in the
                    mass, we may consider them, not as stationary, but as changeable and changing,
                    we may ask what general features are exhibited by the record of the change.
                    This, somewhat crudely put, may serve to indicate the field of historical
                    jurisprudence. In its ideal condition it would require an accurate record of the
                    history of all legal systems as its material. As yet the record is exceedingly
                    incomplete, and the results are proportionately limited. But whether the
                    material be abundant or scanty, the method is the same. It seeks the explanation
                    of institutions and legal principles in the facts of history. Its aim is to show
                    how a given rule came to be what it is. The legislative source—the emanation of
                    the rule from a sovereign authority—is of no importance here; what is important
                    is the moral source—the connexion of the rule with the ideas prevalent during
                    contemporary periods. This method, it is evident, involves, not only a
                    comparison of successive stages in the history of the same system, but a
                    comparison of different systems, of the Roman with the English, of the Hindu
                    with the Irish, and so on. The historical method as applied to law may be
                    regarded as a special example of the method of comparison. The comparative
                    method is really employed in all generalizations about law; for, although the
                    analysis of legal terms might be conducted with exclusive reference to one
                    system, the advantage of testing the result by reference to other systems is
                    obvious. But, besides the use of comparison for purposes of analysis and in
                    tracing the phenomena of the growth of laws, it is evident that for the purposes
                    of practical legislation the comparison of different systems may yield important
                    results. Laws are contrivances for bringing about certain definite ends, the
                    larger of which are identical in all systems. The comparison of these
                    contrivances not only serves to bring their real object, often obscured as it is
                    in details, into clearer view, but enables legislators to see where the
                    contrivances are deficient, and how they may be improved.</p>
                <p>The “science of law,” as the expression is generally used, means the examination
                    of laws in general in one or other of the ways just indicated. It means an
                    investigation of laws which exist or have existed in some given society in
                    fact—in other words, positive laws; and it means an examination not limited to
                    the exposition of particular systems. Analytical jurisprudence is in England
                    associated chiefly with the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">John Austin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> whose <hi rend="italic">Province of Jurisprudence
                    Determined</hi> systematized and completed the work begun in England by Hobbes,
                    and continued at a later date and from a different point of view by Bentham. The
                    best view of the subject will be obtained by taking Austin’s principal positions
                    in outline, and considering<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n372/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0372-0355"/> the criticisms which later jurists have bestowed
                    upon them.</p>
                <p>Austin’s first position is to distinguish between laws properly so called and
                    laws improperly so called. In any of the older writers on law, we find the
                    various senses in which the word is used grouped together as variations of one
                    common meaning. Thus Blackstone advances to his proper subject, municipal laws,
                    through (1) the laws of inanimate matter, (2) the laws of animal nutrition,
                    digestion, &amp;c., (3) the laws of nature, which are rules imposed by God on
                    men and discoverable by reason alone, and (4) the revealed or Divine law, which
                    is part of the law of nature directly expounded by God. All of these are
                    connected by this common element that they are “rules of action dictated by some
                    superior being.” And some such generalization as this is to be found at the
                    basis of most treatises on jurisprudence which have not been composed under the
                    influence of the analytical school. Austin disposes of it by the distinction
                    that some of those laws are commands, while others are not commands. The
                    so-called laws of nature are not commands; they are uniformities which resemble
                    commands only in so far as they may be supposed to have been ordered by some
                    intelligent being. But they are not commands in the only proper sense of that
                    word,—they are not addressed to reasonable beings, who may or may not will
                    obedience to them. Laws of nature are not addressed to anybody, and there is no
                    pos sible question of obedience or disobedience to them. Austin accordingly
                    pronounces them laws improperly so called, and confines his attention to laws
                    properly so called, which are commands addressed by a human superior to a human
                    inferior.</p>
                <p>This distinction seems so simple and obvious that the energy and even bitterness
                    with which Austin insists upon it now seems superfluous. But the indiscriminate
                    identification of everything to which common speech gives the name of a law was,
                    and still is, a fruitful source of confusion. Blackstone’s statement that when
                    God “put matter into motion He established certain laws of motion, to which all
                    movable matter must conform,” and that in those creatures that have neither the
                    power to think nor to will such laws must be invariably obeyed, so long as the
                    creature itself subsists, for its existence depends on that obedience, imputes
                    to the law of gravitation in respect of both its origin and its execution the
                    qualities of an Act of Parliament. On the other hand the qualities of the law of
                    gravitation are imputed to certain legal principles which, under the name of the
                    law of nature, are asserted to be binding all over the globe, so that “no human
                    laws are of any validity if contrary to this.” Nonsense like this so exasperated
                    Austin that he never fails to stigmatize the use of “natural laws” in the sense
                    of scientific facts as improper, or as metaphorical. A later writer has pointed
                    out that law in the scientific sense has acquired a position of its own, from
                    which it is impossible to dislodge it, and which involves none of the
                    ambiguities and confusions against which Austin protested. It would be as
                    reasonable for the man of science as for the jurist to set up his own conception
                    of law as the only legitimate one. There is perhaps only one field of inquiry
                    where the two opposed conceptions of law are still to be found entangled. The
                    “laws of political economy” still hover in the minds of many between the jural
                    and the scientific conception. Certain economical principles appear to have
                    acquired a double character,—that of scientific generalizations, and that of
                    rules which may be disobeyed. Measures are pronounced to be a violation of the
                    laws of political economy, with a vague implication that these being laws of
                    nature any violation of them must be particularly heinous.</p>
                <p>Having eliminated metaphorical or figurative laws, we restrict ourselves to those
                    laws which are commands. This word is the key to the analysis of law, and
                    accordingly a large portion of Austin’s work is occupied with the determination
                    of its meaning. A command is an order issued by a superior to an inferior. It is
                    a signification of desire distinguished by this peculiarity that “the party to
                    whom it is directed is liable to evil from the other, in case he comply not with
                    the desire.” “If you are able and willing to harm me in case I comply not with
                    your wish, the expression of your wish amounts to a command.” Being liable to
                    evil in case I comply not with the wish which you signify, I am <hi
                    rend="italic">bound</hi> or obliged by it, or I lie under a <hi rend="italic"
                    >duty</hi> to obey it. The evil is called a <hi rend="italic">sanction,</hi> and
                    the command or duty is said to be <hi rend="italic">sanctioned</hi> by the
                    chance of incurring the evil. The three terms <hi rend="italic">command,
                    duty,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sanction</hi> are thus inseparably connected.
                    As Austin expresses it in the language of formal logic, “each of the three terms
                    signifies the same notion, but each <hi rend="italic">denotes</hi> a different
                    part of that notion, and <hi rend="italic">connotes</hi> the residue.”</p>
                <p>All commands, however, are not laws. That term is reserved for those commands
                    which oblige generally to the performance of acts of a class. A command to your
                    servant to rise at such an hour on such a morning is a particular command, but
                    not a law or rule; a command to rise always at that hour is a law or rule. Of
                    this distinction it is sufficient to say in the meantime that it involves, when
                    we come to deal with positive laws, the rejection of particular enactments to
                    which by inveterate usage the term law would certainly be applied. On the other
                    hand it is not, according to Austin, necessary that a true law should bind
                    persons as a class. Obligations imposed on the grantee of an office specially
                    created by parliament would imply a law; a general order to go into mourning
                    addressed to the whole nation for a particular occasion would not be a law.</p>
                <p>So far we have arrived at a definition of laws properly so called. Austin holds
                    superiority and inferiority to be necessarily implied in command, and such
                    statements as that “laws emanate from superiors” to be the merest tautology and
                    trifling. Elsewhere he sums up the characteristics of true laws as ascertained
                    by the analysis thus :— (1) laws, being commands, emanate from a determinate
                    source; (2) every sanction is an evil annexed to a command; and (3) every duty
                    implies a command, and chiefly means obnoxiousness to the evils annexed to
                    commands.</p>
                <p>Of true laws, those only are the subject of jurisprudence which are laws strictly
                    so called, or positive laws. Austin accordingly proceeds to distinguish positive
                    from other true laws, which are either laws set by God to men or laws set by men
                    to men, not, however, as political superiors nor in pursuance of a legal right.
                    The discussion of the first of these true but not positive laws leads Austin to
                    his celebrated discussion of the Utilitarian theory. The laws set by God are
                    either revealed or unrevealed, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> either expressed in
                    direct command, or made known to men in one or other of the ways denoted by such
                    phrases as the “light of nature,” “natural reason,” “dictates of nature,” and so
                    forth. Austin maintains that the principle of general utility, based ultimately
                    on the assumed benevolence of God, is the true index to such of His commands as
                    He has not chosen to reveal. His exposition of the meaning of the principle is a
                    most valuable contribution to moral science, though he rests its claims
                    ultimately on a basis which many of its supporters would disavow. And the whole
                    discussion is now generally condemned as lying outside the proper scope of the
                    treatise, although the reason for so condemning it is not always correctly
                    stated. It is found in such assumptions of fact as that there is a God, that He
                    has issued commands to men in what Austin calls the “truths of revelation,” that
                    He designs the happiness of all His creatures, that there is a predominance of
                    good in <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n373/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0373-0356"/> the order of the world—which do not now command
                    universal assent. It is impossible to place these propositions on the same
                    scientific footing as the assumptions of fact with reference to human society on
                    which jurisprudence rests. If the “Divine laws” were facts like Acts of
                    Parliament, it is conceived that the discussion of their characteristics would
                    not be out of place in a scheme of jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>The second set of laws properly so called, which are not positive laws, consists
                    of three classes:—(1) those which are set by men living in a state of nature;
                    (2) those which are set by sovereigns but not as political superiors, e.&lt;∕.,
                    when one sovereign commands another to act according to a principle of
                    international law; and (3) those set by subjects but not in pursuance of legal
                    rights. This group, to which Austin gives the name of positive morality, helps
                    to explain his conception of positive law. Men are living in a state of nature,
                    or a state of anarchy, when they are not living in a state of government or as
                    members of a political society. “Political society” thus becomes the central
                    fact of the theory, and some of the objections that have been urged against it
                    arise from its being applied to conditions of life in which Austin would not
                    have admitted the existence of a political society. Again, the third set in the
                    group is intimately connected with positive laws on the one hand and rules of
                    positive morality which are not even laws properly so called on the other. Thus
                    laws set by subjects in consequence of a legal right are clothed with legal
                    sanctions, and are laws positive. A law set by guardian to ward, in pursuance of
                    a right which the guardian is bound to exercise, is a positive law pure and
                    simple; a law set by master to slave, in pursuance of a legal right which he is
                    not bound to exercise, is, in Austin’s phraseology, to be regarded both as a
                    positive moral rule and as a positive law.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This appears to be an unnecessary complication. The
                    sovereign has authorized, the master to set the law, although not compelling him
                    to do so, and enforces the law when set. There seems no good reason why the law
                    should be called a rule of positive morality at all.</p></note> On the other
                    hand the rules set by a club or society, and enforced upon its members by
                    exclusion from the society, but not in pursuance of any legal right, are laws,
                    but not positive laws. They are imperative and proceed from a determinate
                    source, but they have no legal or political sanction. Closely connected with
                    this positive morality, consisting of true but not positive laws, is the
                    positive morality whose rules are not laws properly so called at all, though
                    they are generally denominated laws. Such are the laws of honour, the laws of
                    fashion, and, most important of all, international law.</p>
                <p>Nowhere does Austin’s phraseology come more bluntly into conflict with common
                    usage than in pronouncing the law of nations (which in substance is a compact
                    body of well-defined rules resembling nothing so much as the ordinary rules of
                    law) to be not laws at all, even in the wider sense of the term. That the rules
                    of a private club should be law properly so called, while the whole mass of
                    international jurisprudence is mere opinion, shocks our sense of the proprieties
                    of expression. Yet no man was more careful than Austin to observe these
                    proprieties. He recognizes fully the futility of definitions which involve a
                    painful struggle with the current of ordinary speech. But in the present
                    instance the apparent paralogism cannot be avoided if we accept the limitation
                    of laws properly so called to commands proceeding from a determinate source. And
                    that limitation is so generally present in our conception of law that to ignore
                    it would be a worse anomaly than this. No one finds fault with the statement
                    that the so-called code of honour or the dictates of fashion are not, properly
                    speaking, laws. We repel the same statement applied to the law of nature,
                    because it resembles in so many of its most striking features—in the certainty
                    of a large portion of it, in its terminology, in its substantial principles—the
                    most universal elements of actual systems of law, and because, moreover, the
                    assumption that brought it into existence was nothing else than this, that it
                    consisted of those abiding portions of legal systems which prevail everywhere by
                    their own authority. But, though “positive morality” may not be the best phrase
                    to describe such a code of rules, the distinction insisted on by Austin is
                    unimpeachable.</p>
                <p>The elimination of those laws properly and improperly so called which are not
                    positive laws brings us to the definition of positive law, which is the keystone
                    of the system. Every positive law is “set by a sovereign person, or sovereign
                    body of persons, to a member or members of the independent political society
                    wherein that person or body is sovereign or superior.” Though possibly sprung
                    directly from another source, it is a positive law, by the institution of that
                    present sovereign in the character of a political superior. The question is not
                    as to the historical origin of the principle, but as to its present authority.
                    “The legislator is he, not by whose authority the law was first made, but by
                    whose authority it continues to be law.” This definition involves the analysis
                    of the connected expressions <hi rend="italic">sovereignty, subjection,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">independent })olitical society,</hi> and of <hi rend="italic"
                    >determinate body,—</hi> which last analysis Austin performs in connexion with
                    that of commands. These are all excellent examples of the logical method of
                    which he was so great a master. The broad results alone need be noticed here. In
                    order that a given society may form a society political and independent, the <hi
                    rend="italic">generality</hi> or <hi rend="italic">bulk</hi> of its members must
                    be in a <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of obedience to a certain and common
                    superior; whilst that certain person or body of persons must not be <hi
                    rend="italic">habitually</hi> obedient to a certain person or body. All the
                    italicized words point to circumstances under which it might be difficult to say
                    whether a given society is political and independent or not. Several cf these
                    Austin has discussed,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the state of things in which
                    a political society yields obedience which may or may not be called habitual to
                    some external power, and the state of things in which a political society is
                    divided between contending claimants for sovereign power, and it is uncertain
                    which shall prevail, and over how much of the society. So long as that
                    uncertainty remains we have a state of <hi rend="italic">anarchy.</hi> Further,
                    an independent society to be political must not fall below a number which can
                    only be called considerable. Neither then in a state of anarchy, nor in
                    inconsiderable communities, nor among men living in a state of nature, have we
                    the proper phenomena of a political society. The last limitation goes some way
                    to meet the most serious criticism to which Austin’s system has been exposed,
                    and it ought to be stated in his own words. He supposes a society which may be
                    styled independent, which is considerable in numbers, and which is in a savage
                    or extremely barbarous condition. In such a society, “the bulk of its members is
                    not in the habit of obedience to one and the same superior. For the purpose of
                    attacking an external enemy, or for the purpose of repelling an attack, the bulk
                    of its members who are capable of bearing arms submits to one leader or one body
                    of leaders. But as soon as that emergency passes the transient submission
                    ceases, and the society reverts to the state which may be deemed its ordinary
                    state. The bulk of each of the families which compose the given society renders
                    habitual obedience to its own peculiar chief, but those domestic societies are
                    themselves independent societies, or are not united and compacted into one
                    political society by habitual and general obedience to one common superior, and
                    there is no law (simply or strictly so styled) which can be called the law of
                    that society. The so-called laws which are common to the bulk of the community
                    are purely and properly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n374/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0374-0357"/> customary laws—that is to say, laws which are set
                    or imposed by the general opinion of the community, but are not enforced by
                    legal or political sanctions.” Such, he says, are the savage societies of
                    hunters and fishers in North America, and such were the Germans as described by
                    Tacitus. He takes no account of societies in an intermediate stage between this
                    and the condition which constitutes political society.</p>
                <p>We need not follow the analysis in detail. Much ingenuity is displayed in
                    grouping the various kinds of government, in detecting the sovereign authority
                    under the disguises which it wears in the complicated State system of the United
                    States or under the fictions of English law, in elucidating the precise meaning
                    of abstract political terms. Incidentally the source of many celebrated
                    fallacies in political thought is laid bare. That the question who is sovereign
                    in a given state is a question of fact and not of law or morals or religion,
                    that the sovereign is incapable of legal limitation, that law is such by the
                    sovereign’s command, that no real or assumed compact can limit his action—are
                    positions which Austin has been accused of enforcing with needless iteration. He
                    has cleared them, however, from the air of paradox with which they had been
                    previously encumbered, and his influence was in no direction more widely felt
                    than in making them the commonplaces of educated opinion in this generation.</p>
                <p>Passing from these, we may now consider what has been said against the theory,
                    which may be summed up in the following terms. Laws, no matter in what form they
                    be expressed, are in the last resort reducible to commands set by the person or
                    body of persons who are in fact sovereigns in any independent political society.
                    The sovereign is the person or persons whose commands are habitually obeyed by
                    the great bulk of the community; and by an independent society we mean that such
                    sovereign head is not himself habitually obedient to any other determinate body
                    of persons. The society must be sufficiently numerous to be considerable before
                    we can speak of it as a political society. From command, with its inseparable
                    incident of sanction, come the duties and rights in terms of which laws are for
                    the most part expressed. Duty means that the person of whom it is predicated is
                    liable to the sanction in case he fails to obey the command. Right means that
                    the person of whom it is predicated may set the sanction in operation in case
                    the command be disobeyed.</p>
                <p>Before noticing the considerable body of hostile criticism with which in the main
                    we are unable to agree, we may here interpolate a doubt whether the condition of
                    independence on the part of the head of a community is essential to the legal
                    analysis. It seems to us that we have all the elements of a true law present
                    when we point to a community habitually obedient to the authority of a person or
                    determinate body of persons, no matter what the relations of that superior may
                    be to any external or superior power. Provided that in fact the commands of the
                    lawgiver are those beyond which the community never looks, it seems immaterial
                    to inquire whether this lawgiver in turn takes his orders from somebody else or
                    is habitually obedient to such orders when given. One may imagine a community
                    governed by a dependent legislatorial body or person, while the supreme
                    sovereign whose representative and nominee such body or person may be never
                    directly addresses the community at all. We do not see that in such a case
                    anything is gained in clearness by representing the law of the community as set
                    by the suzerain, rather than the dependent legislator. Nor is the ascertainment
                    of the ultimate seat of power necessary to define political societies. That we
                    get when we suppose a community to be in the habit of obedience to a single
                    person or to a determinate combination of persons.</p>
                <p>The use of the word “command” is not unlikely to lead to a misconception of
                    Austin’s meaning. When we say that a law is a command of the sovereign, we are
                    apt to think of the sovereign as enunciating the rule in question for the first
                    time. Many laws are not traceable to the sovereign at all in this sense. Some
                    are based upon immemorial practices, some can be traced to the influence of
                    private citizens, whether practising lawyers or writers on law, and in most
                    countries a vast body of law owes its existence as such to the fact that it has
                    been observed as law in some other society. The great bulk of modern law owes
                    its existence and its shape ultimately to the labours of the Roman lawyers of
                    the empire. Austin’s definition has nothing to do with this, the historical
                    origin of laws. Most books dealing with law in the abstract generalize the modes
                    in which laws may be originated under the name of the “sources” ot law, and one
                    of these is legislation, or the direct command of the sovereign body. The
                    connexion of laws with each other as principles is properly the subject matter
                    of historical jurisprudence, the ideal perfection of which would be the
                    establishment of the general laws governing the evolution of law in the
                    technical sense. Austin’s definition looks, not to the authorship of the law as
                    a principle, not to its inventor or originator, but to the person or persons who
                    in the last resort cause it to be obeyed. If a given rule is enforced by the
                    sovereign it is a law.</p>
                <p>It may be convenient to notice here what is usually said about the sources of
                    law, as the expression sometimes proves a stumbling-block to the appreciation of
                    Austin’s system. In the <hi rend="italic">corpus juris</hi> of any given country
                    only a portion of the laws is traceable to the direct expression of his commands
                    by the sovereign. Legislation is one, but only one, of the sources of law. Other
                    portions of the law may be traceable to other sources, which may vary in effect
                    in different systems. The list given in the <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> of
                    Justinian of the ways in which law may be made— <hi rend="italic">lex,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plebiscitum, principis placita, edicta magistratuum,</hi> and so
                    on—is a list of sources. Among the sources of law other than legislation which
                    are most commonly exemplified are the laws made by judges in the course of
                    judicial decisions, and law originating as custom. The source of the law in the
                    one case is the judicial decision, in the other the custom. In consequence of
                    the decisions and in consequence of the custom the rule has prevailed. English
                    law is largely made up of principles derived in each of those ways, while it is
                    deficient in principles derived from the writings of independent teachers, such
                    as have in other systems exercised a powerful influence on the development of
                    law. The <hi rend="italic">responsa</hi><hi rend="italic">prudentum,</hi> the
                    opinions of learned men, published as such, did undoubtedly originate an immense
                    portion of Roman law. No such influence has affected English law to any
                    appreciable extent—a result owing to the activity of the courts of the
                    legislature. This difference has profoundly affected the form of English law as
                    compared with that of systems which have been developed by the play of free
                    discussion. These are the most definite of the influences to which the beginning
                    of laws may be traced. The law once established, no matter how, is nevertheless
                    law in the sense of Austin’s definition. It is enforced by the sovereign
                    authority. It was originated by something very different. But when we speak of
                    it as a command we think only of the way in which it is to-day presented to the
                    subject. The newest order of an Act of Parliament is not more positively
                    presented to the people as a command to be obeyed than are the elementary rules
                    of the common law for which no legislative origin can be traced. It is not even
                    necessary to resort to the figure of speech by which alone, according to Sir
                    Henry Maine <hi rend="italic">{Early History of Institutions,</hi> p. 314), the
                    common law can be regarded as the commands of the Government. “The common law,”
                    he says, “consists of their commands because they can repeal or alter or restate
                    it at pleasure.” “They command because, being by the assumption possessed of
                    uncontrollable force, they could innovate without limit at any moment.” On the
                    contrary, it may be said that they command because they do as a matter of fact
                    enforce the rules laid down in the common law. It is not because they could
                    innovate if they pleased in the common law that they are said to command it, but
                    because it is known that they will enforce it as it stands.</p>
                <p>The criticism of Austin’s analysis resolved itself into two different sets of
                    objections. One relates to the theory of sovereignty which underlies it; the
                    other to its alleged failure to include rules which in common parlance are laws,
                    and which it is felt ought to be included in any satisfactory definition of law.
                    As the latter is to some extent anticipated and admitted by Austin himself, we
                    may deal with it first.</p>
                <p>A recent writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Frederic Harrison in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review</hi> (vols, xxx.,
                    xxxi. ).</p></note> has been at great pains to collect a number of laws or rules
                    of law which do not square with the Austinian definition of law as a command
                    creating rights and duties. Take the rule that “every will must be in writing.”
                    It is a very circuitous way of looking at things, according to Mr Harrison, to
                    say that such a rule creates a specific right in any determinate person of a
                    definite description. So, again, the rule that “a legacy to the witness of a
                    will is void.” Such a rule is not “designed to give anyone any rights, but
                    simply to protect the public against wills made under undue influence.” Again,
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n375/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0375-0358"/> technical rule in Shelley’s case that a gift to A
                    for life, followed by a gift to the heirs of A, is a gift to A in fee simple, is
                    pronounced to be inconsistent with the definition. It is an idle waste of
                    ingenuity to force any of these rules into a form in which they might be said to
                    create rights.</p>
                <p>This would be a perfectly correct description of any attempt to take any of these
                    rules separately and analyse it into a complete command creating specific rights
                    and duties. But there is no occasion for doing anything of the kind. It is not
                    contended that every grammatically complete sentence in a text-book or a statute
                    is <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> a command creating rights and duties. · A law,
                    like any other command, must be expressed in words, and will require the use of
                    the usual aids to expression. The gist of it may be expressed in a sentence
                    which, standing by itself, is not intelligible; other sentences locally separate
                    from the principal one may contain the exceptions and the modifications and the
                    interpretations to which that is subject. In no one of these taken by itself,
                    but in the substance of them all taken together, is the true law, in Austin’s
                    sense, to be found. Thus the rule that every will must be in writing is a mere
                    fragment—only the limb of a law. It belongs to the rule which fixes the rights
                    of devisees or legatees under a will. That rule in whatever form it may be
                    expressed is, without any straining of language, a command of the legislator.
                    That “every person named by a testator in his last will and testament shall be
                    entitled to the property thereby given him” is surely a command creating rights
                    and duties. After testament add “expressed in writing”; it is still a command.
                    Add further, “provided he be not one of the witnesses to the will,” and the
                    command, with its product of rights and duties, is still there. Each of the
                    additions limits the operation of the command stated imperatively in the first
                    sentence. So with the rule in Shelley’s case. It is resolvable into the rule
                    that every person to whom an estate is given by a conveyance expressed in such
                    and such a way shall take such and such rights. To take another example from
                    recent legislation. A statute passed in 1881 enacts nothing more than this, that
                    an Act of a previous session shall be construed as if “that” meant “this.” It
                    would be futile indeed to force this into conformity with Austin’s definition by
                    treating it as a command addressed to the judges, and as indirectly creating
                    rights to have such a construction respected. As it happens, the section of the
                    previous Act referred to (the Burials Act, 1880) is an undeniable command,
                    addressed to the clergy, and imposing upon them a specific duty. The true
                    command—the law—is to be found in the two sections taken together.</p>
                <p>All this confusion arises from the fact that laws are not habitually expressed in
                    imperative terms. Even in a mature system like that of England the great bulk of
                    legal rules is hidden under forms which disguise their imperative quality. They
                    appear as principles, maxims, propositions of fact, generalizations, points of
                    pleading and procedure, and so forth. Even in the statutes the imperative form
                    is not uniformly observed. It might be said that the more mature a legal system
                    is the less do its individual rules take the form of commands. The greater
                    portion of Roman law is expressed in terms which would not misbecome scientific
                    or speculative treatises. The institutional works abound in propositions which
                    have no legal significance at all, but which are not distinguished from the true
                    law in which they are embedded by any difference in the forms of expression.
                    Assertions about matters of history, dubious speculations in philology, and
                    reflexions on human conduct are mixed up in the same narrative with genuine
                    rules of law. Words of description are used, not words of command, and rules of
                    law assimilate themselves in form to the extraneous matter with which they are
                    mixed up.</p>
                <p>It has been said that Austin himself admitted to some extent the force of these
                    objections. He includes among laws which are not imperative the following
                    :—“declaratory laws, or laws explaining the import of existing positive law, and
                    laws abrogating or repealing existing positive law.” He thus associates them
                    with rules of positive morality and with laws which are only metaphorically so
                    called. This collocation is unfortunate and out of keeping with Austin’s method.
                    Declaratory and repealing laws are as completely unlike positive morality and
                    metaphorical laws as are the laws which he describes as properly so called. And
                    if we avoid the error of treating each separate proposition enunciated by the
                    lawgiver as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> law, the cases in question need give us no
                    trouble. Read the declaratory and the repealing statutes along with the
                    principal laws which they affect, and the result is perfectly consistent with
                    the proposition that all law is to be resolved into a species of command. In the
                    one case we have in the principal taken together with the interpretative statute
                    a law, and whether it differs or not from the law as it existed before the
                    interpretative statute was passed makes no difference to the true character of
                    the latter. It contributes along with the former to the expression of a command
                    which is a true law. In the same way repealing statutes are to be taken together
                    with the laws which they repeal—the result being that there is no law, no
                    command, at all. It is wholly unnecessary to class them as laws which are not
                    truly imperative, or as exceptions to the rule that laws are a species of
                    commands. The combination of the two sentences in which the lawgiver has
                    expressed, himself, yields the result of silence—absence of law—which is in no
                    way incompatible with the assertion that a law, when it exists, is a kind of
                    command. Austin’s theory does not logically require us to treat every Act of
                    Parliament as being a complete law in itself, and therefore to set aside a
                    certain number of Acts of Parliament as being exceptions to the great
                    generalization which is the basis of the whole system.</p>
                <p>Rules of procedure again have been alleged to constitute another exception. They
                    cannot, it is said, be regarded as commands involving punishment if they be
                    disobeyed. Nor is anything gained by considering them as commands addressed to
                    the judge and other ministers of the law. There may be no doubt in the law of
                    procedure a great deal that is resolvable into law in this sense, but the great
                    bulk of it is to be regarded like the rules of interpretation as entering into
                    the substantive commands which are laws. They are descriptions of the sanction
                    and its mode of working. The bare prohibition of murder without any penalty to
                    enforce it would not be a law. To prohibit it under penalty of death implies a
                    reference to the whole machinery of criminal justice by which the penalty is
                    enforced. Taken by themselves, the rules of procedure are not, any more than
                    canons of interpretation, complete laws in Austin’s sense of the term. But they
                    form part of the complete expression of true laws. They imply a command, and
                    they describe the sanction and the mode in which it operates.</p>
                <p>A more formidable criticism of Austin’s position is that which attacks the
                    definition of sovereignty. There are countries, it is said, where the sovereign
                    authority cannot by any stretch of language be said to command the laws, and yet
                    where law manifestly exists. The ablest and the most moderate statement of this
                    view is given by Sir Henry Maine in <hi rend="italic">Early History of
                    Institutions,</hi> p. 380 :—</p>
                <p>“It is from no special love of modern examples that I take one from India, but
                    because it happens to be the most modern precedent in point. My instance is the
                    Indian province called the Punjaub, the country of the Five Bivers, in the state
                    in which it was for about <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0376-0359"/> a quarter of a century before its annexation to
                    the British Indian empire. After passing through every conceivable phase of
                    anarchy and dormant anarchy, it fell under the tolerably consolidated dominion
                    of a half military half religious oligarchy known as the Sikhs. The Sikhs
                    themselves were afterwards reduced to subjection by a single chieftain belonging
                    to their order, Runjeet Singh. At first sight there could be no more perfect
                    embodiment than Runjeet Singh of sovereignty as conceived by Austin. He was
                    absolutely despotic. Except occasionally on his wild frontier he kept the most
                    perfect order. He could have commanded anything; the smallest disobedience to
                    his commands would have been followed by death or mutilation; and this was
                    perfectly well known to the enormous majority of his subjects. Yet I doubt
                    whether once in all his life he issued a command which Austin would call a law.
                    He took as his revenue a prodigious share of the produce of the soil. He harried
                    villages which recalcitrated at his exactions, and he executed great numbers of
                    men. He levied great armies; he had all material of power, and he exercised it
                    in various ways. But he never made a law. The rules which regulated the lives of
                    his subjects were derived from their immemorial usages, and those rules were
                    administered by domestic tribunals in families or village communities—that is,
                    in groups no larger or little larger than those to which the application of
                    Austin’s principles cannot be effected on his own admission without
                    absurdity.”</p>
                <p>So far as the mere size of the community is concerned, there is no difficulty in
                    applying the Austinian theory. In postulating a considerably numerous community
                    Austin was thinking evidently of small isolated groups which could not without
                    provoking a sense of the ridiculous be termed nations. Two or three families,
                    let us suppose, occupying a small island, totally disconnected with any great
                    power, would not claim to be and would not be treated as an independent
                    political community. But it does not follow that Austin would have regarded the
                    village communities spoken of by Alaine in the same light. Here we have a great
                    community, consisting of a vast number of small communities, each independent of
                    the other, and disconnected with all the others, so far as the administration of
                    anything like law is concerned. Suppose in each case that the headman or council
                    takes his orders from Runjeet Singh, and enforces them, each in his own sphere,
                    relying as the last resort on the force at the disposal of the suzerain. The
                    mere size of the separate communities would make no sort of difference to
                    Austin’s theory. He would probably regard the empire of Runjeet Singh as divided
                    into small districts,—an assumption which inverts no doubt the true historical
                    order, the smaller group being generally more ancient than the larger. But
                    provided that the other conditions prevail, the mere fact that the law is
                    administered by local tribunals for minute areas should make no difference to
                    the theory. The case described by Sir Henry Maine is that of the undoubted
                    possession of supreme power by a sovereign, coupled with the total absence of
                    any attempt on his part to <hi rend="italic">originate</hi> a law. That no doubt
                    is, as we are told by the same authority, “the type of all Oriental communities
                    in their native state during their rare intervals of peace and order.” The
                    empire was in the main in each case a tax-gathering empire. The unalterable law
                    of the Medes and Persians was not a law at all but an occasional command. So
                    again Alaine puts his position clearly in the following sentences :—“The
                    Athenian assembly made true laws for residents on Attic territory, but the
                    dominion of Athens over her subject cities and islands was clearly a tax-taking
                    as distinguished from a legislating empire.” Sir Henry Alaine, it will be
                    observed, does not say that the sovereign assembly did not command the laws in
                    the subject islands—only that it did not legislate.</p>
                <p>In the same category may be placed without much substantial difference all the
                    societies that have ever existed on the face of the earth previous to the point
                    at which <hi rend="italic">legislation</hi> becomes active. Sir Henry Alaine is
                    undoubtedly right in connecting the theories of Bentham and Austin with the
                    overwhelming activity of legislatures in modern times. And formal legislation,
                    as he has elsewhere shown, comes late in the history of most legal systems. Law
                    is generated in other ways, which seem irreconcilable with anything like
                    legislation. Not only the tax-gathering emperors of the East, indifferent to the
                    condition of their subjects, but even actively benevolent Governments have up to
                    a certain point left the law to grow by other means than formal enactments. What
                    is <hi rend="italic">ex facie</hi> more opposed to the idea of a sovereign’s
                    commands than the conception of schools of law Î Does it not “sting us with a
                    sense of the ridiculous” to hear principles which are the outcome of long
                    debates between Proculians and Sabinians described as commands of the emperor?
                    How is sectarianism in law possible if the sovereign’s command is really all
                    that is meant by a law? No mental attitude is more common than that which
                    regards law as a natural product—discoverable by a diligent investigator, much
                    in the same way as the facts of science or the principles of mathematics. The
                    introductory portions of Justinian’s <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> are
                    certainly written from this point of view, which may also be described without
                    much unfairness as the point of view of German jurisprudence. And yet the
                    English jurist who accepts Austin’s postulate as true for the English system of
                    our own day would have no difficulty in applying it to German or Roman law
                    generated under the influence of such ideas as these.</p>
                <p>Again, referring to the instance of Runjeet Singh, Sir H. Alaine says no doubt
                    rightly that “he never did or could have dreamed of changing the civil rules
                    under which his subjects lived. Probably he was as strong a believer in the
                    independent obligatory force of such rules as the elders themselves who applied
                    them.” That too might be said with truth of states to which the application of
                    Austin’s system would be far from difficult. The sovereign body or person
                    enforcing the rules by all the ordinary methods of justice might conceivably
                    believe that the rules which he enforced had an obligatory authority of their
                    own, just as most lawyers at one time, and possibly some lawyers now, believe in
                    the natural obligatoriness, independently of courts or parliaments, of portions
                    of the law of England. But nevertheless, whatever ideas the sovereign or his
                    delegates might entertain as to “the independent obligatory force” of the rules
                    which they enforce, the fact that they do enforce them distinguishes them from
                    all other rules. Austin seizes upon this peculiarity and fixes it as the
                    determining characteristic of positive law. When the rule is enforced by a
                    sovereign authority as he defines it, it is his command, even if he should never
                    so regard it himself, or should suppose himself to be unable to alter it in a
                    single particular.</p>
                <p>It may be instructive to add to these examples of dubious cases one taken from
                    what is called ecclesiastical law. In so far as this has not been adopted and
                    enforced by the state, it would, on Austin’s theory, be, not positive law, but
                    either positive morality or possibly a portion of the Divine law. No jurist
                    would deny that there is an essential difference between so much of
                    ecclesiastical law as is adopted by the state and all the rest of it, and that
                    for scientific purposes this distinction ought to be recognized. How near this
                    kind of law approaches to the positive or political law may be seen from the
                    sanctions on which it depended. ‘ ‘ The theory of penitential discipline was
                    this: that the church was an organized body with an outward and visible form of
                    government; that all who were outside her boundaries were outside the means of
                    divine grace; that she had a command laid upon her, and authority given to her,
                    to gather men into her fellowship by the ceremony of baptism, but, as some of
                    those who were admitted proved unworthy of their calling, she also had the right
                    by the power of the keys to deprive them temporarily or absolutely of the
                    privilege of communion with her, and on their amendment to restore them once
                    more to church membership. On this power of exclusion and restoration was
                    founded the system of ecclesiastical discipline. It was a purely spiritual
                    jurisdiction. It obtained its hold over the minds of men from the belief,
                    universal in the catholic church of the early ages, that he who was expelled
                    from her pale was expelled also from the way of salvation, and that the sentence
                    which was pronounced by God’s church on earth was ratified by Him in heaven ’’
                    (Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Christian Antiquities,</hi> art.

                <p>These laws are not the laws of the jurists, though they resemble them closely in
                    many points—indeed in all points except that of the sanction by which they are
                    enforced. It is a spiritual not a political sanction. The force which lies
                    behind them is not that of the sovereign or the state. When physical force is
                    used to compel obedience to the laws of the church they become positive laws.
                    But so long as the belief in future punishments or the fear of the purely
                    spiritual punishments of the church is sufficient to procure obedience to them,
                    they are to be regarded as commands, not by the state, but by the church. That
                    difference Austin makes essential. In rejecting spiritual laws from the field of
                    positive law, his example would be followed by jurists who would nevertheless
                    include other laws, not ecclesiastical in purpose, but enforced by very similar
                    methods.</p>
                <p>Compare the following account of “the mode in which justice was administered in
                    the neighbourhood of Benares towards the end of the last century,” extracted
                    from a very valuable work on the scientific study of Hindu law by Mr J. H.
                    Nelson. “The recognized mode of compelling a debtor to pay up appears to have
                    been by sending a Brahman to do <hi rend="italic">dharna</hi> before his house
                    with a dagger or a bowl of poison to be used by the Brahman on his own body if
                    the debtor proved obstinate. When the tax collector gave too much trouble, a
                    ryot would sometimes erect a <hi rend="italic">koor</hi> or pile of wood and
                    burn an old woman on it by way of bringing sin on the head of the tormentor. The
                    <hi rend="italic">lex</hi><hi rend="italic">talionis</hi> obtained in the
                    following shape. Persons who considered themselves aggrieved by acts of their
                    enemies would kill their own wives and children, in order, as we may suppose, to
                    compel their enemies to do a similar act to their own hurt. Thus two Brahmans
                    cut off their mother’s head to spite a foe.” The same author states that he is ‘
                    ‘ firmly persuaded that the normal condition of India has ever been to be
                    without what Europeans understand by laws and law courts.”</p>
                <p>So far as the question is one of the propriety of language, the burden in this
                    case is decidedly against those who would extend the phraseology of law to such
                    rules as these. Can we with any advantage speak of one person having a right
                    against another, when his remedy consists in starving himself in order to bring
                    sin upon the head of his opponent or compel him to do likewise <hi rend="italic"
                    >1 If dharna</hi> or anything like it suffices to keep a community to its
                    customary practices, is it possible to express such customs in terms applicable
                    to the laws of European societies? Or is any harm done by saying that the
                    difference between the two is so great that the former cannot be regarded as
                    positive laws at all?</p>
                <p>The true criterion in all these cases is, neglecting the shape and circumstances
                    in which the rules in question may have appeared, to ask by what means
                    compliance with them is enforced. Austin’s theory in the end comes to this, that
                    true laws are in all cases obeyed in consequence of the application of regulated
                    physical force by some portion of the community. That is a fair paraphrase of
                    the position that laws are the commands of the sovereign, and is perhaps less
                    objectionable inasmuch as it does not imply or suggest anything about the forms
                    in which laws are enunciated. All rules, customs, practices, and laws— or by
                    whatever name these uniformities of human conduct may be called—have either this
                    kind of force at their back or they have not. Is it worth while to make this
                    difference the basis of a scientific system or not? Apparently it is. If it were
                    a question of distinguishing between the law of the law courts and the laws of
                    fashion no one would hesitate. Why should laws or rules having no support from
                    any political authority be termed laws positive merely because there are no
                    other rules in the society having such support?</p>
                <p>The question may perhaps be summed up as follows. Austin’s definitions are in
                    strict accordance with the facts of government in civilized states; and, as it
                    is put by Sir H. Maine, certain assumptions or postulates having been made, the
                    great majority of Austin’s positions follow as of course or by ordinary logical
                    process. But at the other extreme end of the scale of civilization are societies
                    to which Austin himself refuses to apply his system, and where, it would be
                    conceded on all sides, there is neither political community nor sovereign nor
                    law,—none of the facts which jurisprudence assumes to exist. There is an
                    intermediate stage of society in which, while the rules of conduct might and
                    generally would be spoken of as laws, it is difficult to trace the connexion
                    between them and the sovereign authority whose existence is necessary to
                    Austin’s system. Are such societies to be thrown out of account in analytical
                    jurisprudence, or is Austin’s system to be regarded as only a partial
                    explanation of the field of true law, and his definitions good only for the laws
                    of a portion of the world? The true answer to this question appears to be that
                    when the rules in any given case are habitually enforced by physical penalties,
                    administered by a determinate person or portion of the community, they should be
                    regarded as positive laws and the appropriate subject matter of jurisprudence.
                    Rules which are not so enforced, but are enforced in any other way, whether by
                    what is called public opinion, or spiritual apprehensions, or natural instinct,
                    are rightly excluded from that subject matter. In all stages of society, savage
                    or civilized, a large body of rules of conduct, habitually obeyed, are
                    nevertheless not enforced by any state sanction of any kind. Austin’s method
                    assimilates such rules in primitive society, where they subserve the same
                    purpose as positive laws in an advanced society, not to the positive laws which
                    they resemble in purpose but to the moral or other rules which they resemble in
                    operation. If we refuse to accept this position we must abandon the attempt to
                    frame a general definition of law and its dependent terms, or we must content
                    ourselves with saying that law is one thing in one state of society and another
                    thing in another. On the ground of clearness and convenience Austin’s method is,
                    we believe, substantially right, but none the less should the student of
                    jurisprudence be on his guard against such assumptions as that legislation is a
                    universal phenomenon, or that the relation of sovereign and subject is
                    discernible in all states of human society. And a careful examination of Sir
                    Henry Maine’s criticism will show that it is devoted not so much to a
                    rectification of Austin’s position as to correction of the misconceptions into
                    which some of his disciples may have fallen. It is a misconception of the
                    analysis to suppose that it involves a difference in juridical character between
                    custom not yet recognized by any judicial decision and custom after such
                    recognition. There is no such difference except in the case of what is properly
                    called “judicial legislation”—wherein an absolutely new rule is added for the
                    first time to the law. The recognition of a custom or law is not necessarily the
                    beginning of the custom or law. Where a custom possesses the marks by which its
                    legality is determined according to well understood principles, the courts
                    pronounce it to have been law at the time of the happening of the facts as to
                    which their jurisdiction is invoked. The fact that no previous instance of its
                    recognition by a court of justice can be produced is not material. A lawyer
                    before any such decision was given would nevertheless pronounce the custom to be
                    law,—with more or less hesitation according as the marks of a legal custom were
                    obvious or not. The character of the custom is not changed when it is for the
                    first time enforced by a court of justice, and hence the language used by Sir
                    Henry Maine must be understood in a very limited sense. “Until customs are
                    enforced by courts of justice”—so he puts the position of Austin — they are
                    merely “positive morality,” rules enforced by opinion; but as soon as courts of
                    justice enforce them they become commands of the sovereign, conveyed through the
                    judges who are his delegates or deputies. This proposition, on Austin’s theory,
                    would only be true of customs as to which these marks were absent. It is of
                    course true that when a rule enforced only by opinion becomes for the first time
                    enforceable by a court of justice—which is the same thing as the first time of
                    its being actually enforced—</p>

                <p>its juridical character is changed. It was positive morality; it is now law. So
                    it is when that which was before the opinion of the judge only becomes by his
                    decision a rule enforceable by courts of justice. It was not even positive
                    morality but the opinion of an individual; it is now law.</p>
                <p>The most difficult of the common terms of law to define is <hi rend="italic"
                    >right</hi>; and, as right rather than duty is the basis of classification, it
                    is a point of some importance. Assuming the truth of the analysis above
                    discussed, we may go on to say that in the notion of law is involved an
                    obligation on the part of some one, or on the part of every one, to do or
                    forbear from doing. That obligation is duty; what is right? Dropping the
                    negative of forbearance, and taking duty to mean an obligation to do something,
                    with the alternative of punishment in default, we find that duties are of two
                    kinds. The thing to be done may have exclusive reference to a determinate person
                    or class of persons, on whose motion or complaint the sovereign power will
                    execute the punishment or sanction on delinquents; or it may have no such
                    reference, the thing being commanded, and the punishment following on
                    disobedience, without reference to the wish or complaint of individuals. The
                    last are absolute duties, and the omission to do, or forbear from doing, the
                    thing specified in the command is in general what is meant by a crime. The
                    others are relative duties, each of them implying and relating to a right in
                    some one else. A person has a right who may in this way set in operation the
                    sanction provided by the state. In common thought and speech, however, right
                    appears as something agood deal more positive and definite than this,— as a
                    power or faculty residing in individuals, and suggesting not so much the
                    relative obligation as the advantage or enjoyment secured thereby to the person
                    having the right. Mr J. S. Mill, in a valuable criticism of Austin, suggests
                    that the definition should be so modified as to introduce the element of
                    “advantage to the person exercising the right.” But it is exceedingly difficult
                    to frame a positive definition of right which shall not introduce some term at
                    least as ambiguous as the word to be defined. Professor Holland defines right in
                    general as a man’s “capacity of influencing the acts of another by means, not of
                    his own strength, but of some authority or power external to himself.” Direct
                    influence exercised by virtue of one’s own strength, physical or otherwise, over
                    another’s acts, is “might” as distinguished from right. When the indirect
                    influence is the opinion of society, we have a “moral right.” When it is the
                    force exercised by the sovereign, we have a legal right. It would be more easy,
                    no doubt, to pick holes in this definition than to frame a better one.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In English speech another
                    ambiguity is happily wanting which in many languages besets the phrase
                    expressing “aright.” The Latin “jus,” the German “Recht,” the Italian “diritto,”
                    and the French “droit” express, not only a right, but also law in the abstract.
                    To indicate the distinction between “law” and “aright” the Germans are therefore
                    obliged to resort to such phrases as “objectives” and “subjectives Recht,”
                    meaning by the former law in the abstract, and by the latter a concrete right.
                    And Blackstone, paraphrasing the distinction drawn by Roman law between the “jus
                    quod ad res” and the “jus quod ad personas attinet,” devotes the first two
                    volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> to the “Rights of Persons and
                    the Rights of Things.” See Holland’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Jurisprudence,</hi> p. 57.</p></note></p>
                <p>The distinction between rights available against determinate persons and rights
                    available against all the world, <hi rend="italic">jura in personam</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">jura in rem,</hi> is of fundamental importance. The phrases are
                    borrowed from the classical jurists, who used them originally to distinguish
                    actions according as they were brought to enforce a personal obligation or to
                    vindicate rights of property. The owner of property has a right to the exclusive
                    enjoyment thereof, which avails against all and sundry, but not against one
                    person more than another. The parties to a contract have rights available
                    against each o’her, and against no other persons. The <hi rend="italic">jus in
                    rem</hi> is the badge of property; the <hi rend="italic">jus in personam</hi> is
                    a mere personal claim.</p>
                <p>That distinction in rights which appears in the division of law into the law of
                    persons and the law of things is thus stated by Austin. There are certain rights
                    and duties, with certain capacities and incapacities, by which persons are
                    determined to various classes. The rights, duties, &lt;fcc., are the condition
                    or status of the person; and one person may be invested with many status or
                    conditions. The law of persons consists of the rights, duties, &amp;c.,
                    constituting conditions or status; the rest of the law is the law of things. The
                    separation is a mere matter of convenience, but of convenience so great that the
                    distinction is universal. Thus any given right may be exercised by persons
                    belonging to innumerable classes. The person w ho has the right may be under
                    twenty-one years of age, may have been born in a foreign state, may have been
                    convicted of crime, may be a native of a particular county, or a member of a
                    particular profession or trade, &amp;c.; and it might very well happen, with
                    reference to any given right, that, while persons in general, under the
                    circumstances of the case, would enjoy it in the same way, a person belonging to
                    any one of these classes would not. If belonging to any one of those classes
                    makes a difference not to one right merely but to many, the class may
                    conveniently be abstracted, and the variations in rights and duties dependent
                    thereon may be separately treated under the law of persons. The personality
                    recognized in the law of persons is such as modifies indefinitely the legal
                    relations into which the individual clothed with the personality may enter. See
                    Holland’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of Jurisprudence,</hi> p. 90.</p>
                <p>The author last cited disapproves of the prominence given by Austin to this
                    distinction, instead of that between public and private law. This, according to
                    Professor Holland, is based on the public or private character of the persons
                    with whom the right is connected, public persons being the state or its
                    delegates. Austin, lιolding that the state cannot be said to have legal rights
                    or duties, recognizes no such distinction. The term “public law” he confines
                    strictly to that portion of the law which is concerned with political
                    conditions, and which ought not to be opposed to the rest of the law, but “ought
                    to be inserted in the law of persons as one of the limbs or members of that
                    supplemental department.”</p>
                <p>Lastly, following Austin, the main division of the law of things is into (1)
                    primary rights with primary relative duties, (2) sanctioning rights with
                    sanctioning duties (relative or absolute). The former exist, as it has been put,
                    for their own sake, the latter for the sake of the former. Rights and duties
                    arise from facts and events; and facts or events which are violations of rights
                    and duties are <hi rend="italic">delicts</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >injuries.</hi> Rights and duties which arise from delicts are remedial or
                    sanctioning, their object being to prevent the violation of rights which do not
                    arise from delicts.</p>
                <p>We are inclined to agree with the view expressed by Mr F. Harrison <hi
                    rend="italic">(^Fortnightly Review,</hi> vol. xxxi.), that the rearrangement of
                    English law on the basis of a scientific classification, whether Austin’s or any
                    other, would not result in advantages at all compensating for its difficulties.
                    If anything like a real code were to be attempted, the scientific classification
                    would be the best; but in the absence of that, and indeed in the absence of any
                    habit on the part of English lawyers of studying the system as a whole, the
                    arrangement of facts does not very much matter. It is essential, however, to the
                    abstract study of the principles of law. Scientific arrangement might also be
                    observed with advantage in treatises affecting to give a view of the whole law,
                    especially those which are meant for educational rather than professional uses.

                    that, worse than its first. As an example of the practical application of a
                    scientific system of classification to a complete body of law, we may point to
                    Professor W. A. Hunter’s elaborate <hi rend="italic">Exposition of Roman
                    Law</hi> (London, 1876).</p>
                <p>It is impossible to present the conclusions of historical jurisprudence in
                    anything like the same shape as those which we have been discussing. As yet
                    historical jurisprudence is little more than a method, and its results are
                    generalizations of more or less plausibility or probability. The inquiry is in
                    that stage which is indicated in one way by describing it as a philosophy. The
                    philosophy of the history of law is all that it can yet claim to be. It
                    resembles, and is indeed only part of, the study which is described as the
                    philosophy of history. Its chief interest hitherto has been in the light which
                    it has thrown upon rules of law and legal institutions which had been and are
                    generally contemplated as positive facts merely, without reference to their
                    history, or have been associated historically with principles and institutions
                    not really connected with them.</p>
                <p>The historical treatment of law displaces some very remarkable misconceptions.
                    Peculiarities and anomalies abound in every legal system; and, as soon as laws
                    become the special study of a professional class, some mode of explaining or
                    reconciling them will be resorted to. One of the prehistorical ways of
                    philosophizing about law was to account for what wanted explanation by some
                    theory about the origin of technical words. This implies some previous study of
                    words and their history, and is an instance of the deep-seated and persistent
                    tendency of the human mind to identify names with the things they represent. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> of Justinian abound in explanations, founded
                    on a supposed derivation of some leading term. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Testamentum,</hi> we are told, <hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi rend="italic">eo
                    appellatur</hi><hi rend="italic">quod</hi><hi rend="italic">testatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mentis</hi><hi rend="italic">est.</hi> A testament was no doubt,
                    in effect, a declaration of intention on the part of the testator when this was
                    written. But the <hi rend="italic">mentum</hi> is a mere termination, and has
                    nothing to do with <hi rend="italic">mens</hi> at all. The history of
                    testaments, which, it may be noticed incidentally, has been developed with
                    conspicuous success, gives a totally different meaning to the institution from
                    that which was expressed by this fanciful derivation. So the perplexing subject
                    of <hi rend="italic">possessio</hi> was supposed in some way to be explained by
                    the derivation from <hi rend="italic">pono</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sedeo,</hi><hi rend="italic">—quasi</hi><hi rend="italic">sedibus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">p&gt;ositio.</hi><hi rend="italic">Posthumi</hi> was supposed to
                    be a compound of <hi rend="italic">post</hi> and <hi rend="italic">humus.</hi>
                    These examples belong to the class of rationalizing derivations with which
                    students of philosophy are familiar. Their characteristic is that they are
                    suggested by some prominent feature of the thing as it then appeared to
                    observers,—which feature thereupon becomes identified with the essence of the
                    thing at all times and places.</p>
                <p>Another prehistorical mode of explaining law may be described as metaphysical. It
                    conceives of a rule or principle of law as existing by virtue of some more
                    general rule or principle in the nature of things. Thus, in the English law of
                    inheritance, until the passing of the recent Inheritance Act, an estate
                    belonging to a deceased intestate would pass to his uncle or aunt, to the
                    exclusion of his father or other lineal ancestor. This anomaly from an early
                    time excited the curiosity of lawyers, and the explanation accepted in the time
                    of Bracton was that it was an example of the general law of nature :—“Descendit
                    itaque jus quasi ponderosum quid cadens deorsum recta linea vel transversali, et
                    nunquam reascendit ea via qua descendit.” The author of an excellent summary of
                    the history of the law of real property (Mr Digby) supposes that the “rule
                    really results from the associations involved in the word descent.” It seems
                    more likely, however, that these associations explained rather than that they
                    suggested the rule, —that the omission of the lineal ancestor existed in custom
                    before it was discovered to be in harmony with the law of nature. It would imply
                    more influence than the reasoning of lawyers is likely to have exercised over
                    the development of law at that time to believe that a purely artificial
                    inference of this kind should have established so very remarkable a rule.
                    However that may be, the explanation is typical of a way of looking at law which
                    was common enough before the dawn of the historical method. Minds capable of
                    reasoning in this way were, if possible, farther removed from the conceptions
                    implied in the reasoning of the analytical jurists than they were from the
                    historical method itself. In this connexion it may be noticed that the great
                    work of Blackstone marks an era in the development of legal ideas in England. It
                    was not merely the first, as it still remains the only, adequate attempt to
                    expound the leading principles of the whole body of law, but it was distinctly
                    inspired by a rationalizing method. Blackstone tried not merely to express but
                    to illustrate legal rules, and he had a keen sense of the value of historical
                    illustrations. He worked of course with the materials at his command. His manner
                    and his work are obnoxious alike to the modern jurist and to the modern
                    historian. He is accused by the one of perverting history, and by the other of
                    confusing the law. But his scheme is a great advance on anything that had been
                    attempted before; and, if his work has been prolific in popular fallacies, at
                    all events it enriched English literature by a conspectus of the law, in which
                    the logical connexion of its principles <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> and its
                    relation to historical facts, were distinctly if erroneously recognized.</p>
                <p>While the historical method has superseded the verbal and metaphysical
                    explanation of legal principles, it has apparently, in some cases, come into
                    conflict with the conclusions of the analytical school. The difference between
                    the two systems comes out most conspicuously in relation to customs. There is an
                    unavoidable break in the analytical method between societies in which rules are
                    backed by regulated physical force and those in which no such force exists. At
                    what point in its development a given society passes into the condition of “an
                    independent political society” it may not be easy to determine, for the evidence
                    is obscure and conflicting. To the historical jurist there is no such breach.
                    'The rule which in one stage of society is a law, in another merely a rule of
                    “positive morality,” is the same thing to him throughout. By a recent Act of
                    Parliament the Ulster custom of tenant right and other analogous customs were
                    legalized. For the purposes of analytical jurisprudence there is no need to go
                    beyond the Act of Parliament. The laws known as the Ulster custom are laws
                    solely in virtue of the sovereign government. Between the law as it now is and
                    the custom as it existed before the Act there is all the difference in the
                    world. To the historical jurist no such separation is possible. His account of
                    the law would not only be incomplete without embracing the precedent custom, but
                    the Act which made the custom law is only one of the facts, and by no means the
                    most significant or important, in the history of its development. An exactly
                    parallel case is the legalization in England of that customary tenant right
                    known as copyhold. It is to the historical jurist exactly the same thing as the
                    legalization of the Ulster tenant right. In the one case a practice was made law
                    by formal legislation, and in the other without formal legislation. And there
                    can be very little doubt that in an earlier stage of society, when formal
                    legislation had not become <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n380/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0380-0363"/> the rule, the custom would have been legalized
                    relatively much sooner than it actually was.</p>
                <p>Customs then are the same thing as laws to the historical jurist, and his
                    business is to trace the influences under which they have grown up, flourished,
                    and decayed, their dependence on the intellectual and moral conditions of
                    society at different times, and their reaction upon them. The recognized
                    science—and such it may now be considered to be—with which historical
                    jurisprudence has most analogy is the science of language. Laws and customs are
                    to the one what words are to the other, and each separate municipal system has
                    its analogue in a language. Legal systems are related together like languages
                    and dialects, and the investigation in both cases brings us back at last to the
                    meagre and obscure records of savage custom and speech. A great master of the
                    science of language (Max Müller) has indeed distinguished it from jurisprudence,
                    as belonging to a totally different class of sciences. “It is perfectly true,”
                    he says, “that if language be the work of man in the same sense in which a
                    statue, or a temple, or a poem, or a law are properly called the works of man,
                    the science of language would have to be classed as an historical science. We
                    should have a history of language as we have a history of art, of poetry, and of
                    jurisprudence; but we could not claim for it a place side by side with the
                    various branches of natural history.” Whatever be the proper position of either
                    philology or jurisprudence in relation to the natural sciences, it would not be
                    difficult to show that laws and customs on the whole are equally independent of
                    the efforts of individual human wills,—which appears to be what is meant by
                    language not being the work of man. The most complete acceptance of Austin’s
                    theory that law everywhere and always is the command of the sovereign does not
                    involve any withdrawal of laws from the domain of natural science, does not in
                    the least interfere with the scientific study of their affinities and
                    relationships. Max Müller elsewhere illustrates his conception of the different
                    relation of words and laws to the individual will by the story of the emperor
                    Tiberius, who was reproved for a grammatical mistake by Marcellus, whereupon
                    Capito, another grammarian, observed that, if what the emperor said was not good
                    Latin, it would soon be so. “Capito,” said Marcellus, “is a liar; for, Caesar,
                    thou canst give the Roman citizenship to men, but not to words.” The mere
                    impulse of a single mind, even that of a Roman emperor, however, probably counts
                    for little more in law than it does in language. Even in language one powerful
                    intellect or one influential academy may, by its own decree, give a bent to
                    modes of speech which they would not otherwise have taken. But whether law or
                    language be conventional or natural is really an obsolete question, and the
                    difference between historical and natural sciences in the last result is one of
                    names.</p>
                <p>The application of the historical method to law has not resulted in anything like
                    the discoveries which have made comparative philology a science. There is no
                    Grimm’s law for jurisprudence; but something has been done in that direction by
                    the discovery of the analogous processes and principles which underlie legal
                    systems having no external resemblance to each other. It happens, however, that
                    the historical study of law has, for the most part, been confined to a single
                    system—the Roman law. The Roman law presents itself to the historical student in
                    two different aspects. It is, regarded as the law of the Roman republic and
                    empire, a system whose history can be traced throughout a great part of its
                    duration with certainty, and in parts with great detail. It is, moreover, a body
                    of rationalized legal principles which may be considered apart from the state
                    system in which they were developed, and which have, in fact, entered into the
                    jurisprudence of the whole of modern Europe on the strength of their own
                    abstract authority,—so much so that the continued existence of the civil law,
                    after the fall of the empire, is entitled to be considered one of the first
                    discoveries of the historical method. Alike, therefore, in its original history,
                    as the law of the Roman state, and as the source from which the fundamental
                    principles of modern laws have been taken, the Roman law presented the most
                    obvious and attractive subject of historical study. An immense impulse was given
                    to the history of Roman law by the discovery of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes</hi> of Gaius in 1816. A complete view of Roman law, as it existed
                    three centuries and a half before Justinian, was then obtained, and as the later
                    <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> were, in point of form, a recension of those
                    of Gaius,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A very useful
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Institutes of</hi> Justinian, printed as a

                    stages in legal history was at once easy and fruitful. Moreover, Gaius dealt
                    with antiquities of the law which had become obsolete in the time of Justinian,
                    and were passed over by him without notice. Roman law has accordingly been the
                    main subject of historical study, and the conclusions of jurisprudence are to a
                    great extent generalizations suggested by the history of Roman law.</p>
                <p>Nowhere did Roman law in its modern aspect give a stronger impulse to the study
                    of legal history than in Germany. The historical school of German jurists led
                    the reaction of national sentiment against the proposals for a general code made
                    by Thibaut. They were accused by their opponents of setting up the law of past
                    times as intrinsically entitled to be observed, and they were no doubt strongly
                    inspired by reverence for customs and traditions. Through the examination of
                    their own customary laws, and through the elimination and separate study of the
                    Roman element therein, they were led to form general views of the history of
                    legal principles. In the hands of Savigny, the greatest master of the school,
                    the historical theory was developed into a universal philosophy of law, covering
                    the ground which we should assign separately to jurisprudence, analytical and
                    historical, and to theories of legislation. There is not in Savigny’s system the
                    faintest approach to the Austinian analysis. The range of it is not the analysis
                    of law as a command, but that of a <hi rend="italic">Pechtsverhältniss</hi> or
                    legal relation. Far from regarding law as the creation of the will of
                    individuals, he maintains it to be the natural outcome of the consciousness of
                    the people, like their social habits or their language. And he assimilates
                    changes in law to changes in language. “As in the life of individual men no
                    moment of complete stillness is experienced, but a constant organic development,
                    such also is the case in the life of nations, and in every individual element in
                    which this collective life consists; so we find in language a constant formation
                    and development, and in the same way in law.”<note anchored="true"

                    weakened, as we believe, by defective analysis of positive law. But its
                    conception of laws is exceedingly favourable to the growth of an historical
                    philosophy, the results of which have a value of their own, apart altogether
                    from the character of the first principles. Such, for instance, is Savigny’s

                    law is thus historically independent of Roman law, it is in all respects worthy
                    of being associated with it on its own merits. Its originality, or, if the
                    phrase be preferred, its peculiarity, is not more remarkable than the
                    intellectual qualities which have gone to its formation—the ingenuity, the rigid
                    logic, the reasonableness, of the generations of lawyers and judges who have
                    built it up. This may seem extravagant praise for a legal system, the faults of
                    which are and always have been matter of daily complaint, but it would be
                    endorsed by all unprejudiced students. What men complain of is the practical
                    hardship and inconvenience of some rule or process of law. They know, for
                    example, that the law of real property is exceedingly complicated, and that,
                    among other things, it makes the conveyance of land expensive. But the technical
                    law of real property, which rests to this day on ideas that have been buried for
                    centuries, has nevertheless the qualities we have named. So too with the law of
                    procedure as it existed under the “science” of special pleading. The greatest
                    practical law reformer, and the severest critic of existing systems that has
                    ever appeared in any age or country, Jeremy Bentham, has admitted
                    this:—“Confused, indeterminate, inadequate, ill-adapted, and inconsistent as to
                    a vast extent the provision or no provision would be found to be that has been
                    made by it for the various cases that have happened to present themselves for
                    decision, yet in the character of a repository of such cases it affords, for the
                    manufactory of real law, a stock of materials which is beyond all price.
                    Traverse the whole continent of Europe, ransack all the libraries belonging to
                    all the jurisprudential systems of the several political states, add the
                    contents together, you would not be able to compose a collection of cases equal
                    in variety, in amplitude, in clearness of statement—in a word, all points taken
                    together, in constructiveness—to that which may be seen to be afforded by the
                    collection of English reports of adjudged cases” (Bentham’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Worh,</hi> vol. iv. p. 460). On the other hand, the fortunes of English
                    jurisprudence are not unworthy of comparison even with the catholic position of
                    Roman law. In the United States of America, in India, and in the vast colonial
                    empire, the common law of England constitutes most of the legal system in actual
                    use, or is gradually being superimposed upon it. It would hardly be too much to
                    say that English law of indigenous growth, and Roman law, between them govern
                    the legal relations of the whole civilized world. Nor has the influence of the
                    former on the intellectual habits and the ideas of men been much if at all
                    inferior. Those who set any store by the analytical jurisprudence of the school
                    of Austin will be glad to acknowledge that it is pure outcome of English law.
                    Sir Henry Maine has associated its rise with the activity of modern
                    legislatures, which is of course a characteristic of the societies in which
                    English laws prevail. And it would not be difficult to show that the germs of
                    Austin’s principles are to be found in legal writers who never dreamed of
                    analysing a law. It is certainly remarkable, at all events, that the acceptance
                    of Austin’s system is as yet confined strictly to the domain of English law. Sir
                    H. Maine has found no trace of its being even known to the jurists of the
                    Continent, and it would appear that it has been equally without influence in
                    Scotland, which, like the Continent, is essentially Roman in the fundamental
                    elements of its jurisprudence.</p>
                <p>While, however, Roman law has had many historians, and while it has been, in
                    Germany at least, the subject of a good deal of historical philosophy, English
                    law can hardly yet be said to have had its historian, much less its philosopher.
                    What is wanted here, in the first place, is the setting forth of the materials
                    in a condition fit for examination. This has been rightly described as perhaps
                    the most important intellectual want of the present time. But in the meantime
                    the revival of the study of Roman law in England has made the comparison of
                    Roman and English law a matter of course in legal education, and has undoubtedly
                    led, in accordance, no doubt, with the bent of contemporary thought, to the
                    formation in England of what may not improperly be called a great school of
                    historical jurists.</p>
                <p>By far the most considerable contribution made by England to historical
                    jurisprudence is the writings of Sir Henry Maine. The first of these <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ancient Law),</hi> published in 1861, has probably had a more
                    profound influence on contemporary thought than any other book of this
                    generation. <hi rend="italic">The Early History of Institutions</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Village Communities in the East and West</hi> have since followed.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Ancient Law</hi> Sir Henry Maine proposes to trace the
                    connexion of the subject with the early history of society and its relation to
                    modern ideas. Taking the Roman law as a typical system, he revealed for the
                    first time to English readers the connexion between the principles of forgotten
                    lawyers and, not merely the legal ideas, but the moral commonplaces of our own
                    time. The book undermined what had been accepted as first principles by showing
                    that they had a history. It gratified the intellectual sense by the brilliant
                    identification of legal ideas, obscured by differences of time and place and
                    circumstance. It is not surprising that its influence has been even more
                    extensive among educated laymen than among professional lawyers, for the latter
                    are condemned by custom to disregard everything in their science but its
                    relation to the business of the day. But <hi rend="italic">Ancient Law</hi> set
                    the attitude of regarding a legal rule not as an isolated fact but as the last
                    link in an historical series. In the better sort of legal text-books which have
                    recently appeared this attitude is discernible, and on the whole to the
                    advantage of the exposition, even for the purposes of practice.</p>
                <p>At the present moment conclusions based on an examination of the history of legal
                    systems stand subject to correction by the results of the investigation, which
                    is being conducted with so much diligence and success, into the condition of
                    savage races. If it be a right inference that the phenomena of barbarism, as it
                    exists at the present day, represent a condition through which civilized
                    societies have passed, it is obvious that the origin which recorded history
                    suggests for legal ideas and practices must not be taken as absolute. It so
                    happens that prehistoric society has hitherto engaged a much larger share of
                    attention than the history of laws. Conspicuous among the writers who have made
                    important contributions to the literature of this subjectare Mr E. B. Tylor, Sir
                    J. Lubbock, Mr Lewis Morgan, and especially Mr J. F. M*Lennan. Many of the com
                    elusions to which these inquirers have been led do not affect any position taken
                    up by historical jurists, but others tend to show that social forms which, seen
                    from the side of legal history, appeared to be the absolute beginning of modern
                    institutions, may themselves have been the result of a long evolution. The most
                    conspicuous example, not of antagonism, but of what may be called disconnexion,
                    between juridical and naturalistic theories of the origin of society, is to be
                    found in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Family</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Here
                    it need only be said that the part played by the family in the development of
                    legal ideas has been fully elaborated by historical jurists, sometimes with the
                    inference, implied rather than expressed, that it marks the beginning of the
                    history, or at least is to be found in the earliest period of the race of which
                    we have <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0382-0365"/> trustworthy evidence. Substantially the
                    conclusions of the jurists as to the influence of the conception of the family
                    on historic law remain unimpaired. It is true that a great part of the “legal
                    ideas of civilized races may be traced to this conception, and that the history
                    of their development is the history of its slow unwinding.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Maine’s <hi rend="italic">Village
                    Communities,</hi> p. 15.</p></note> But that there is no anterior condition to
                    that in which the patriarchal family—“a group of men, women, and slaves, of
                    animate and inanimate property, all connected together by subjection to the
                    paternal power of the chief of the household ”— is the unit of society, is not,
                    so far as we are aware, affirmed by any historical jurist. The evidence on that
                    question will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Family</hi> above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Another natural group whose place in legal history has recently been the subject
                    of careful investigation is the village community. In one of its forms—the
                    township— “it is an organized self-acting group of Teutonic families, exercising
                    a common proprietorship over a definite tract of land, its mark, cultivating its
                    domain on a common system, and sustaining itself by the produce. It is described
                    by Tacitus in the <hi rend="italic">Germania</hi> as the vicus; it is well known
                    to have been the proprietary and even the political unit of the earliest English
                    society; it is allowed to have existed among the Scandinavian races, and it
                    survived to so late a date in the Orkney and Shetland islands as to have
                    attracted the attention of Sir Walter Scott” (Maine, <hi rend="italic">Village
                    Communities,</hi> p. 10). Founding on the researches of G. L. von Maurer, of
                    Nasse, and others on the Teutonic mark, and comparing them with the observed
                    phenomena of the village community in India, Sir H. Maine has shown, in the work
                    just cited, how this widely diffused institution illustrates legal history, more
                    particularly with reference to property in land, and to the conservation of
                    customary law.</p>
                <p>The lateness of the intervention of the state or sovereign as a direct legislator
                    has been adverted to in the previous discussion. Formal law-making by the state
                    is everywhere posterior to its intervention as the enforcer of law. Not that
                    law-making was consciously separated from judging, or that the assembly or
                    officer who represented the state was conceived as exclusively judicial. But the
                    state, whether represented by a public assembly or by an officer, undertook to
                    decide disputes between man and man long before it presumed to say on what
                    principle such disputes should be decided. The judge everywhere comes before the
                    legislator, if indeed terms so purely modern can be applied without danger to
                    early law. That the pronouncements of the judge were themselves a source of
                    law,—that he created the law which he professed to declare,—is true in a sense
                    which, however, requires us to obliterate the most conspicuous of all the duties
                    of a judge conceived in relation to mature law. That the law existed before the
                    judgment, that the judgment should simply declare preexisting law, that <hi
                    rend="italic">ex post facto</hi> laws are unjust—are the inveterate beliefs and
                    prejudices of a civilized society, the strength of which is manifested by the
                    fictions elsewhere noticed as concealing the manufacture of new law. No such
                    conception is to be imported into the notions of early society as to the right
                    and wrong of civil justice. The office of the judge was to settle disputes, to
                    do right where wrong had been done; and whether his decision was founded on law,
                    or custom, or religion, or on personal wisdom or inspiration, was a question
                    which we cannot conceive as being asked, when these things were not
                    distinguished in thought.</p>
                <p>A conclusion suggested by the earliest forms of procedure in Roman law is that
                    the intervention of the judge is originally that of a private arbitrator. The
                    <hi rend="italic">legis</hi><hi rend="italic">actio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sacramenti</hi> retained down to a very late period certain symbolical
                    proceedings, in which the features of a private quarrel were simulated. It was a
                    petrified legal drama, like that played by the vouchers in the English action of
                    ejectment. The parties wrangle over the disputed property, the magistrate
                    interposes, and they agree to abide by his decision, each staking a deposit on
                    the justice of his case. Maine felicitously compares these formalities with the
                    trial scene depicted on the shield of Achilles in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iliad,</hi> in which the <hi rend="italic">sacramentum</hi> is represented by
                    two talents of gold to go to the judge who shall best decide the points in
                    dispute in the opinion of the spectators. The reward given to the private
                    arbitrator has become in legal symbolism the fee payable to the court on the
                    hearing of the cause. “In confirmation of this view,” says Maine, “it may be
                    added that many observers of the oldest judicial usages of modern Europe have
                    remarked that the fines inflicted by courts on offenders were originally <hi
                    rend="italic">sacramenta</hi><hi rend="italic">” (Ancient Laιv,</hi> p. 378).
                    The symbolism of another <hi rend="italic">legis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >actio</hi> is susceptible of a similar interpretation. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >condictio</hi> was a personal action taking its name from the notification to
                    the defendant to appear before the judge on a day named, and it simulated a
                    quarrel settled, not by the interposition of the arbitrator, but by agreement of
                    the parties in the form of a wager, to be decided by the arbitrator at a future
                    time. It is consistent with this view cf the first manifestations of judicial
                    functions that early as compared with mature law should assign so large a place
                    to mere procedure. The adjective law, as it is now called, was the first portion
                    of the law to take definite shape, and long maintained its place in the
                    foreground of the system. When a special class in society, whether an
                    aristocratic or priestly caste or a profession, became, as was almost
                    universally the case, the exclusive custodians of the law, the formalities of
                    procedure were their most important secrets. It is represented as a revolution
                    in Roman society when the clerk of one of the aristocratic lawyers divulged to
                    the public his master’s notes for the conduct of legal proceedings. And at all
                    times, it may be said, the law of procedure or practice is in a special sense
                    the law of the professional lawyer, his knowledge of which makes him a skilled
                    craftsman.</p>
                <p>The more definite the judiciary power the more do we approach the state of things
                    in which the postulates of analytical jurisprudence are true. Another mark of
                    maturing law is its expression in writing, which, while it destroys the secret
                    monopoly of a class, tends to develop the separate profession of free practising
                    lawyers, who in all progressive societies count as the most powerful instrument
                    for moulding the shape of the law. The influence of lawyers upon law is one of
                    the topics on which the comparison of English and Roman law throws a flood of
                    light, but its illustration would carry us beyond our present limits. Nor can we
                    do more than allude to the importance tentatively assigned by Maine to the
                    question whether a written law comes relatively early or late in the history of
                    a nation. He appears to hold that the relatively early code of the Romans saved
                    them from that degeneration of custom which takes place when it is transmitted
                    by oral tradition from one generation to another.</p>
                <p>We have discussed elsewhere, under the headings <hi rend="smallcaps">Equity</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fictions,</hi> two of the modes by which legal changes
                    have been brought about indirectly. Direct law-making by the sovereign power,
                    there is reason to believe, is not only everywhere later than these agencies,
                    but its activity is progressive, and constantly tends to displace them. A glance
                    at the English statute-book will show that the legislature at the present day
                    undertakes the deliberate alteration of the law to a much greater extent than it
                    has ever done before. A rough illustration is the fact that the chronological
                    table of the statutes from 1235 to 1877 <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n383/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0383-0366"/> covers over three hundred pages, of which fully
                    two-thirds are occupied with the legislation of the last hundred years. This
                    activity varies of course at different times, and the variations even in recent
                    times have been remarkable. And, large as are the contributions of modern
                    parliaments to the law, it is notorious that but for defects in the legislative
                    machinery they would be much larger. Nor is this activity to be accounted for by
                    the theory that the domain of law is more intrusive than in earlier times. There
                    has undoubtedly been within the last generation a steady increase in the control
                    asserted by the state over the habits of its citizens, for some account of which
                    reference may be made to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Government.</hi> But
                    on the whole the range of action with which the English law declines to
                    interfere is probably as great now as it ever has been in civilized societies.
                    The true explanation is that parliament has effectually secured for itself
                    exclusive authority as the source of legal changes. The violent assault of
                    Bentham on judiciary law was but the echo of the lesson taught by the English
                    judges as to omnipotence of parliament, and thoroughly understood and accepted
                    by popular opinion. To that is due the caution, not to say timidity, which now
                    characterizes the judicial interpretation of statutes. The courts adhere to the
                    literal meaning of the enactment unless compelled to open it by its too frequent
                    absurdity or self-contradiction. If there is any way out of a difficulty which
                    will not involve the slightest addition to the enacted law, that will be the way
                    followed by judicial decision, This attitude is a complete reversal of that
                    which once prevailed in the courts, when the law embodied in decided cases, pure
                    drawn from the fountains of justice, was deemed superior in dignity to the
                    enactments of an unlearned parliament. The tribunals, in so far as they now make
                    law, operate much more freely on the cases than on the statutes.</p>
                <p>The consequence of this relation of the judiciary and the legislature is that,
                    while great reforms are no doubt accelerated, small reforms have to wait.
                    Parliament does in a single session that which would have taken ages to
                    accomplish under the natural agencies of equity and fiction, and much which
                    would never have been brought about by these agencies at all. But the capacity
                    of parliament is limited, and so is its foresight. The work of legislation is
                    left incomplete, and the judicature carefully avoids completing it, leaving the
                    legislature to take it up again when it may. An instance in point is the late
                    history of the law of evidence. This portion of the law grew to maturity in the
                    courts, whose creation it was. It has been wholly transformed by direct
                    legislative enactment (under the influence of Benthamite principles), Act after
                    Act being passed as occasion pointed out defects in what had already been
                    accomplished. One of the latest Acts on the subject simply enables parties and
                    their husbands or wives to give evidence in a certain class of indictments. The
                    substitution of an affirmation for an oath has been carried out in the same
                    piecemeal fashion, the courts refraining from developing the principle of the
                    amendments, as they would have done if the movement had originated with
                    themselves and in an earlier stage of their history. The most portentous example
                    of the intervention of the legislature to complete the exact details of its
                    enactments is the Act previously noticed, which orders the word “this” to be
                    interpreted as “that.” The defects of existing legislative methods in England
                    result in some defects in the form of the law, which the tribunals are free to
                    criticize but not to correct. An Act of Parliament bears upon its face the marks
                    of the tumultuous discussion of a large popular assembly, and of the compromise
                    which reconciles the opposing views of the two Houses. Very few Acts, no matter
                    what care may be employed in framing them, are promulgated in the form best
                    suited for actual exercise,— in the form which would be given to them by an
                    intelligent legislator, charged with the expression of the principle which
                    parliament is supposed to have sanctioned.</p>
                <p>In what has been said regarding the relations of the legislature and the
                    judicature it is not implied that the manufacture of case-law by the latter has
                    ceased. On the contrary, it goes on with yearly increasing volume, and the
                    immense accumulation of decided cases is one of the evils of the present state
                    of the law. The hand of precedent never lay heavier on the conscience of the
                    judge than it does now. The necessary literature of the law is increased by a
                    dozen large volumes every year. The law becomes more voluminous without becoming
                    more elastic or more systematic. The stereotyped judicial habit is to follow
                    absolutely the precedents set by every tribunal of higher rank, and almost
                    absolutely those set by tribunals of coordinate rank. A careful semi-official
                    record has taken the place of the private reports published by lawyers
                    privileged by the courts to take notes of their proceedings. Every case of any
                    importance is recorded and becomes a precedent which the practising lawyer in
                    future must know, and which the judge must follow. The minute detail into which
                    legal literature is thus made to descend is becoming an intolerable load; and it
                    is a question whether some revolution in respect to precedents is not becoming
                    necessary.</p>
                <p>Legislation by judges has its counterpart in the use of legislative forms for
                    judicial purposes. Long after legislative and judicial functions have been
                    separated, we find legislative acts serving the purpose of judicial decisions.
                    The history of English law is full of examples, the best known of which is that
                    of divorce. The practice of passing private bills of divorce, at a time when the
                    technical law did not allow of that remedy, hardened into a purely judicial
                    practice. The Act which established the Divorce Court did not in effect do more
                    than create a new and better tribunal. So with the General Enclosure Act, which
                    took over from the legislature the purely judicial work of sanctioning
                    enclosures in proper cases.</p>
                <p>Comparative jurisprudence, in the sense in which it is distinguishable from
                    historical jurisprudence, can scarcely be said as yet to have a separate
                    existence. Since Leibnitz projected his youthful scheme for tabulating the laws
                    of all the countries of the world, and exhibiting their correspondence and
                    differences by parallel columns, little or nothing has been done for the
                    comparison of laws except in connexion with history. One special line of study
                    does indeed use what may be called a comparative method. The “conflict of laws”
                    involves at least a contrast of a vast number of important points in which the
                    laws of different nations disagree. The object of the study of this conflict is
                    of the practical kind which comparative jurisprudence as here conceived is meant
                    to subserve. It is to develop some <hi rend="italic">rationale</hi> of decisions
                    where two or more discordant rules claim exclusive application to the case.
                    There are circumstances which seem to show that the mere comparison of laws with
                    no other object but that of discovering in how many ways the same thing can be
                    done, and which way is the best, will enter more and more into the higher legal
                    studies. For one thing, the vast increase which has taken place in the means of
                    communication between nations has made a knowledge of each other’s laws a matter
                    of imperative necessity, and has broken down, at least as between the most
                    advanced nations, that barrier of insularity which formerly shut out all
                    suggestions of improvement from abroad. We have already emphasized the marked
                    extent to which this exclusiveness has characterized English law, and we cannot
                    but regard it as typical of a new temper that in preparing for the solution of
                    important problems of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0384-0367"/> legislation, the British Government not
                    unfrequently collects from its agents abroad information as to the solution of
                    the same problems in other countries. An important influence always tending in
                    this direction, and greatly strengthened by the changes to which we have
                    alluded, is that of commerce, and particularly of British commerce. England’s
                    business relations are coextensive with the world; it is a necessity of her
                    business that she should know what view is taken of contracts and the relations
                    arising out of them by the laws of different states. And it is becoming a
                    necessity of the commercial class in all countries that, on fundamental points
                    at least, the principles of law should be everywhere the same. Strenuous
                    efforts, for instance, are now being made for the establishment of a uniform law
                    of negotiable instruments in all countries, and with some prospect of success.
