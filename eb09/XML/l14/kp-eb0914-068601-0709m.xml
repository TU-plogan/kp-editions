                <p><label type="entry">LIQUEURS</label> are perfumed and sweetened spirits prepared
                    for drinking, and for use as a flavouring material in confectionery and cookery.
                    The term liqueur is also applied to certain wines and spirits remarkable for
                    their amount of bouquet, such as tokay and liqueur brandy, &amp;c. Ordinary
                    liqueurs consist of certain mixtures of pure spirit with essential oils and
                    vegetable extracts, and with syrup of refined sugar. A certain number of such
                    preparations have an established reputation; but the methods by which these are
                    compounded, and the precise proportions of the various ingredients they contain,
                    are valuable trade secrets, scrupulously kept from public knowledge.</p>
                <p>The raw materials employed in the preparation of liqueurs are—(1) a pure
                    flavourless spirit, which must be free from fusel oil; (2) various essential
                    oils, on the purity and constant quality of which much of the success of the
                    manufacture depends, or, in place of the oils, the aromatic substances from
                    which they may be distilled; (3) bitter aromatic vegetable substances, -fruits,
                    rinds, &amp;c., or their alcoholic extracts called tinctures; (4) fresh juicy
                    fruits possessed of special flavour; (5) refined sugar prepared in the form of a
                    perfectly smooth colourless syrup; (6) soft or distilled water; and (7)
                    tinctorial substances for those liqueurs in which a particular colour is
                    demanded by fashion. The French, who excel in the preparation of liqueurs, grade
                    their products according to their sweetness and alcoholic strength into <hi
                    rend="italic">cremes,</hi><hi rend="italic">huiles,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >boeumes,</hi> which have a thick oily consistency, and <hi rend="italic">eaux,
                    extraits,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">elixirs,</hi> which, being less sweetened,
                    are perfectly limpid. Liqueurs of British fabrication, generally of inferior
                    quality, are frequently dealt in under the name of <hi rend="italic">cordials.
                    Bitters</hi> form a class of liqueurs by themselves, claiming to possess certain
                    tonic properties and a medicinal value. Certain liqueurs, containing only a
                    single flavouring ingredient, or having a prevailing flavour of a particular
                    substance, are named after that body, as for example—crème de rose, vanille,
                    thé, cacao, anisette, and kümmel, &amp;c. On the other hand, the liqueurs which
                    in general are most highly prized are compounded of very numerous aromatic
                    principles, and they are not considered fit for use till they have matured and
                    mellowed for several years.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0710-0687"/>
                <p>The simplest method of preparing liqueurs is by adding the requisite proportion
                    of essential oil to spirit of known strength, and then mixing this with the
                    necessary amount of clear syrup. In this way, indeed, the greater number of the
                    commoner and cheaper kinds are manufactured. Thus for making (say) 20 gallons
                    inferior quality of kümmel, there are added to 7 gallons of spirit of wine ∣ lb
                    of essential oil of caraway seed, 7∣ drachms of fennel-seed oil, and 15 drops of
                    bitter almond oil With this preparation is mixed a syrup containing 40 lb of
                    refined sugar dissolved in about 12 gallons of water, and when fined with
                    gelatine or with alum and soda solution the liqueur is ready for use. To
                    prepare, on the other hand, 20 gallons of fine kümmel liqueur, there would be
                    placed in a simple still, with 10 gallons of spirit and 8 of water, 4 lb of
                    caraway seeds, ∣ lb of fennel, and 2 oz. of Florentine iris root. This mixture
                    after maceration is distilled, the first portion of the distillate being put
                    aside on account of its rough aroma, after which about 8 gallons of fine kümmel
                    spirit is obtainable. There still may be procured, by forcing the heat, from 3
                    to 4 gallons of inferior spirit. To the 8 gallons of fine spirit is added a
                    syrup consisting of 60 lb of refined sugar dissolved in 10 gallons of water, the
                    two compounds being thoroughly incorporated with heat in an open vessel. On
                    cooling, the amount of water necessary to make up 20 gallons is added; the
                    liqueur is fined with isinglass, and stored to mature and mellow. All varieties
                    of liqueurs may be made or imitated by both these methods; but as a rule it is
                    only the simple-flavoured and commoner varieties which are compounded by the
                    addition of essential oils and alcoholic tinctures. Fine liqueurs are made by
                    macerating aromatic bodies and subsequent distillation; bitters by maceration
                    and straining.</p>
                <p>Of trade liqueurs the most highly esteemed in the United Kingdom are Chartreuse,
                    Curaçoa, Maraschino, and Doppel-Kümmel or Allasch. Of all kinds the most famous
                    is <hi rend="italic">Chartreuse,</hi> so called from being made at the famous
                    Carthusian monastery near Grenoble. Three qualities are made—green, yellow, and
                    white, the green being the richest and most delicate in flavour. Chartreuse is
                    said to be a most complex product, resulting from the maceration and
                    distillation of balm leaves and tops as a principal ingredient, with orange
                    peel, dried hyssop tope, peppermint, wormwood, angelica seed and root, cinnamon,
                    mace, cloves, Tonquin beans, <hi rend="italic">Calamus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aromaticus,</hi> and cardamoms. <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa,</hi> which is a
                    simple liqueur, is chiefly made in Amsterdam from the dried peel of the Curaçoa
                    orange. The peel is first softened by maceration in water; then three-fourths of
                    the quantity in preparation is distilled with mixed spirit and water, and the
                    remaining fourth is macerated in a proportion of this distillate for two or
                    three days; the tincture is strained off and expressed and added to the original
                    distilled Curaçoa spirit. The flavour of Curaçoa is improved by the addition of
                    about one per cent, of Jamaica rum. The centre of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maraschino</hi> trade is at Zara in Dalmatia. Genuine Maraschino is prepared
                    from a variety of cherry—the Marasca—peculiar to the Dalmatian mountain regions.
                    The juice of the cherry fermented and distilled yields the spirit, which is
                    flavoured with the broken cherry kernels themselves. Imitations of Maraschino
                    are easily prepared,—a praiseworthy liqueur resulting from raspberry juice,
                    bitter almonds, and orangeflower water. In the preparation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allasch—</hi> which is a rich <hi rend="italic">Kümmel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> bitter almonds, star-anise, angelica root, Florentine iris root, and
                    orange peel are used in addition to caraway seeds. Goldwater and silver-water
                    are liqueurs to which small quantities of powdered gold-leaf and silver-leaf
                    have been added, on account of their lustre. They are now little used.</p>
                <p>Gentian root is the fundamental “bitter” in most of the preparations known as <hi
                    rend="italic">Bitters.</hi> These compounds, prepared by maceration, are very
                    various in their constitution, but the following is a fair typical sample of the
                    composition of a kind largely used. To prepare 20 gallons of bitters there are
                    taken 6 lb of gentian, 5 lb each of cinnamon and caraway seeds, 1 lb of juniper
                    berries, and ⅜ ft&gt; of cloves. These are macerated in 7 gallons of spirit, 60“
                    over proof, strained and filtered, and to the product is added 10 lb of sugar
                    dissolved in 13 gallons of water, and the resulting liquor is coloured with
                    cochineal.</p>

                    already named :—Noyeau (white and pink), trappistine (yellow and green) (from
                    the Abbey de la Grâce Dieu), bénédictine (from Fecamp), peppermint liqueur,
