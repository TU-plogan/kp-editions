                    from east to west is about 62 miles, and the area 3599 square miles. The
                    department takes its namefrom the <hi rend="italic">landes,</hi> sandy plains
                    formerly covered by the sea, which occupy its greatest portion, and extend into
                    the departments of Gironde and Lot-et-Garonne. South of the Adour, the chief
                    river of the department, the country changes in character, and is called <hi
                    rend="italic">La Chalosse,—</hi> a hilly region, which the various rivers coming
                    down from the Pyrenees intersect like the rays of a fan. The Gabas, Luy, and
                    Gave de Pau are the principal tributaries of the Adour on the left. On the right
                    it is joined by the Midouze, formed by the junction of the Douze and the Midou.
                    North of the Adour the plain of Landes slopes gently to the north-west, and
                    empties its waters partly by the Leyre which flows into the Arcachon basin,
                    partly by brooks which run into the lakes at the foot of the dunes which fringe
                    the coast. The soil of this plain is naturally sterile. It is composed of a
                    mixture of sand, clay, and organic debris, and rests on a subsoil of tufa (α⅛s)
                    which is impermeable to water; for three-quarters of the year, consequently, the
                    waters, settling on the almost level surface and unable to filter through,
                    transform the country into marshes and morasses, while in summer the heat of the
                    sun, drying up the marshes, produces malarious fevers. But during the last
                    twenty-five years much labour has been expended in draining operations. More
                    than 1350 miles of ditches have been dug, and of the 1,112,000 acres which were
                    uncultivated in 1850 two-thirds have now been reclaimed, or planted with forest
                    trees. The coast, for a breadth of about 4 miles, is bordered by a succession of
                    dunes or sand hills, in several ranges parallel to the shore, and from 150 to
                    300 feet in height. Driven by the west wind, which is most frequent in these
                    parts, the dunes were slowly advancing year by year towards the east, burying
                    the cultivated lands and even the houses. Bremontier, towards the end of the
                    last century, devised the plan of arresting this scourge by planting the dunes
                    with maritime pines. At the present time upwards of 98,000 acres have been thus
                    treated, and the forests already supply some fine timber to the navy. In the
                    south-west, cork trees take the place of the pines. On the eastern side of the
                    dunes is a series of lakes (Cazau or Sanguinet, Biscarosse, Aureilhan, St
                    Julien, Léon, and Soustons), which have been separated from the sea by the
                    heaping up of the sand. The salt water has escaped by defiltration, and they now
                    are quite fresh. The climate of Landes is the Girondine, which prevails from the
                    Loire to the Pyrénées. Snow is almost unknown, even in winter; the spring is
                    rainy, the summer warm and stormy. The prevailing wind is the south-west, and
                    the mean temperature of the year is 53 <hi rend="superscript"> o,</hi> 6 Fahr.,
                    the thermometer hardly ever rising above 82° or falling below 14° Fahr. The
                    annual rainfall in the south of the department in the neighbourhood of the sea
                    reaches 55 inches, but diminishes by more than half as we proceed to the
                    north-east. Most of the department is still in the condition of <hi
                    rend="italic">landes,</hi> traversed by flocks of sheep, which are kept by
                    shepherds perched upon stilts. These <hi rend="italic">landes</hi> are gradually
                    giving place to forests, and in extent of forest land this department occupies
                    the first place in France. In the <hi rend="italic">Chalosse,</hi> the richest
                    portion of the department, the vine, maize, wheat, millet, tobacco, vegetables,
                    hemp, and flax are cultivated; yet, small though the population is, the
                    department does not produce corn enough for its own consumption. The
                    exploitation of the forests forms the chief industry. The resin obtained from
                    the maritime pine furnishes by distillation essence of turpentine, and from the
                    residue we have various qualities of resin, which serve to make varnish, tapers,
                    sealing-wax, and lubricants. Tar, and an excellent charcoal for smelting
                    purposes, are also obtained from the pine-wood. From the numerous iron furnaces
                    in the department there was, in 1878, an output of 17,000 tons smelted with
                    charcoal, and 8139 tons during the first six months of 1881. The cultivation of
                    the cork tree is also very important; its produce is much sought after both by
                    French and by foreign manufacturers. There are also a number of brick and tile
                    works, and potteries. The department has several mineral springs, the most
                    important being those of Dax, which were frequented even in the time of the
                    Romans. The population of Landes in 1876 was 303,508, or 84 inhabitants to the
                    square mile. In 1801 the population was only 224,272. The department includes
                    three arrondissements (Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, and St Sever), 28 cantons, and 333
                    communes. Mont-de-Marsan is the capital of the department. It is noticeable that
                    in its long extent of coast it has no considerable port. Opposite Cape Breton,
                    however, where the Adour formerly entered the sea, there is, close to land, a
                    deep channel where there is safe anchorage. It was from this once important
                    harbour of Cape Breton that the discoverers of the Canadian island of that name
                    set out.</p>
