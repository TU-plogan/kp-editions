                <p><label type="entry">LEECH</label>. The medicinal leech <hi rend="italic">(Hirudo
                    medicinalis,</hi> L.) is a species grouped under the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gnathobdellidae</hi> (with a dental apparatus composed of armed muscular
                    ridges) of the discophorous <hi rend="italic">Annelida.</hi> The body of a leech
                    is spindle-shaped, and flattened dorsally and ventrally so as to be elliptical
                    in transverse section. It is somewhat pointed in front except when the mouth is
                    in action, while posteriorly it is terminated by a disk or sucker. The surface
                    is marked by a series of annulations reaching from ninety-five to one hundred,
                    but such are only cutaneous, as indicated by the ganglia, the segmental organs,
                    the white spots on each side, and even by the arrangement of the two outer
                    yellowish stripes, for the primary segments of the body comprise from three to
                    five of these. The anterior sucker (fig. 1, α) is composed of four incomplete
                    annuli and another surrounding the mouth, while the posterior (α') has seven.
                    The colour of the dorsum is generally dull olive or olive-brown, with six
                    yellowish, rusty, or greenish-yellow bands more or less interrupted with black,
                    the spots of the latter being somewhat symmetrically arranged in the two outer
                    rows. The ventral surface is speckled with black spots on a greyish ground.
                    Several varieties occur, according as the dorsum is lighter or darker brownish
                    or olive, and the ventral surface with or without spots. Thus Moquin-Tandon,
                    Diesing, and others indicate six or seven, each of which again has various
                    subvarieties, ranging from two to five. Externally the body is invested by a
                    thin translucent chitinous cuticle, which is perforated, apparently with some
                    regularity, by the apertures of the glands. This coat is shed at intervals.
                    Beneath is the hypoderm (epidermis of some), which is much firmer and thinner
                    than in the Nemerteans.</p>
                <p>It contains the pigment, though part of the latter intrudes into the subjacent
                    layer, and is composed as usual of columnar granular cells, a horizontal section
                    presenting a somewhat regularly areolated aspect. Rawlins Johnson alludes to the
                    vascularity of the surface of the leech, and Ray Lankester notes the extension
                    of the capillaries into this layer. The latter has not been verified, even in
                    the hypoderm of the snout, though preparations presenting such appearances are
                    not uncommon. The hypoderm is closely united to the subjacent muscular layer,
                    though it can hardly be said with Gegenbaur that it is continued into the
                    parenchyma of the body. It is this layer and the cuticle which are marked by the
                    superficial annulations. Various unicellular glands occur underneath the
                    hypoderm, in particular two chief sets—superficial and deep. The former are
                    situated amongst the outer (circular) muscular fibres and pigment, while the
                    latter lie amongst the connective tissue, muscular fibres, and vessels that
                    constitute <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n418/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0418-0401"/> the “parenchyma” between the muscular layers of
                    the body-wall and the alimentary canal. It has been suggested that the former
                    secrete the ordinary mucus, the latter the cocoons. Both open by ducts on the
                    surface of the cuticle, and it is stated that those in the neighbourhood of the
                    genital segments are enlarged at the time of oviposition. In the Nemerteans it
                    is the homologue of the leech’s hypoderm which secretes the envelopment of the
                    ova.</p>
                <p>The muscular layers consist of external circular fibres in several strata,
                    between which the hypodermicglands, pigmentcells, and vessels intrude. When this
                    coat is examined in thin superficial (horizontal) sections the fasciculi are
                    observed to be separated by intervals. Other circular fibres occur within the
                    longitudinal layer. The latter muscles form the great mass of the body-wall, and
                    are grouped into various bands by the connective tissue and radiating muscles.
                    The latter pass directly from the dorsal to the ventral surface laterally, and
                    thus become vertical fibres; and they are very well seen in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Xephelis,</hi> where they form four or five conspicuous bands between the
                    circular layer dorsally and ventrally, and thus appear to have a considerable
                    influence in determining the shape of the body. The extensible snout presents a
                    muscular structure analogous to that of the tongue in the higher animals, and it
                    is capable of even more extensive and varied movements. A complex series of
                    muscles (circular, radial, and longitudinal) exists in connexion with the
                    posterior sucker. The muscles of the leech are non-striated, and are formed of
                    long spindle-cells with nuclei. The locomotion of the leech is effected by the
                    alternate attachment of the suckers, or by swimming through the water like an
                    eel. It is fond of waving its body to and fro in the water when attached by its
                    posterior sucker, and this would certainly aid the aeration of the blood in the
                    superficial vessels.</p>
                <p>There is no special body-cavity, the blood-vessels and connective tissue alone
                    occurring between the muscles and the digestive chamber. Rolleston speaks of
                    dissepiments between the digestive diverticula, that between the last two not
                    being prolonged to the ganglia. In the histology of the leech an important part
                    is played by the connective tissue, which envelops all the organs, traverses the
                    muscles, and is filled in certain places and in its cellular elements by brown
                    granules. Moreover, certain of these cells are stated by Ray Lankester to form
                    the walls of the blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The inferior surface of the snout constitutes a spoonshaped cavity leading into
                    the mouth, which thus with its marginal lip is capable of forming a most
                    efficient sucker. At the junction of the buccal with the pharyngeal region are a
                    median dorsal and two lateral prominent semicircular or sometimes slightly
                    hatchet-shaped elevations, which in contraction fit into pits in the wall. On
                    the free edge of each of these muscular cushions the chitinous buccal lining is
                    furnished with a closely arranged and microscopic series of transverse processes
                    (eighty or ninety in number), each of which somewhat resembles the middle valve
                    of a <hi rend="italic">Chiton</hi> or the upper jaw of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Physa.</hi> They are arranged indeed after the manner of the ridge-tiles of a
                    roof, the lateral pieces sloping downward on each side from the prominent median
                    point. These angular transverse plates are separated by a well-marked interval,
                    and they commence as small processes. They are distinctly calcified. It is these
                    organs, mounted on the three muscular cushions, which cause the somewhat
                    triradiate wounds, and which may pass through the true skin to the cellular
                    tissue, a feat which Poupart’s notion of suction could hardly accomplish. Great
                    ambiguity seems to run throughout text-books on this subject, and yet the
                    figures of Brandt and Moquin-Tandon represent the condition very fairly, though
                    some appear to have mistaken the lateral view of the muscular cushion for a
                    “horny jaw.” These teeth can only act <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse</hi> with the muscular pad on which they rest, and have not the
                    individual movement seen for instance in the long hook-rows of certain
                    polychaetous Annelids. As Leuckart and others have shown, each of these muscular
                    cushions has a most complex structure. The superficial fibres are for the most
                    part oblique, the central vertical (that is, at right angles to the teeth) and
                    cut into lamellae by transverse fibres. The whole forms a very efficient motor
                    apparatus for both cushion and teeth in all their varied functions.</p>
                <p>The mouth opens into the pharynx, the structure of which, as in other <hi
                    rend="italic">Cnathobdellidae,</hi> differs essentially from that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phynchobdellidae.</hi> In ordinary contracted preparations the
                    central canal in front is either triangular or triradiate. Internally it is
                    covered by the cuticular and the tough hypodermic layers, from which the
                    radiating muscles pass to the body-wall, the space between the hypoderm and the
                    strong circular fibres of the organ being occupied by regularly arranged
                    longitudinal fibres clasped by the radial fibres. The mixed muscular layer of
                    the body-wall occurs outside the foregoing. The entire arrangement is well
                    adapted for dilating, shortening, and lengthening the canal, and performing all
                    the complex actions of a powerful suctorial apparatus. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bhyη-</hi><hi rend="italic">choljdellidae,</hi> on the other hand, the
                    protrusible proboscis, with its intricate structure and its sheath, presents
                    little in common with the foregoing. The pharynx terminates in the stomach, an
                    elongated chamber having eleven lateral diverticula (c to c''), which form short
                    pouches directed backward on each side, with the exception of the posterior pair
                    (c"), which are so large and long as to be almost in apposition when distended,
                    and nearly to reach the termination of the body. From the point of bifurcation
                    the canal proper (c') is continued as a somewhat small tube—to end in an anus on
                    the dorsum, immediately in front of the posterior sucker. The inner surface of
                    the alimentary canal is lined by a minutely granular epithelium. Salivary glands
                    have been described by various authors as situated in the parenchyma outside the
                    pharynx, and the number of large granular glands in this region is certainly
                    great. Digestion seems to be slow in leeches, and breeders feed them with blood
                    only once in six months. It is well to remember that the alimentary canal
                    contains blood in those brought direct from their native marshes.</p>
                <p>The nervous system consists of twenty-three pairs of ventral ganglia, the first
                    being connected by commissures (between which the gullet passes) with the
                    supra-cesophageal or cephalic ganglia. An intermediate stomato-gastric ganglion
                    sends branches to the central muscular cushion for the teeth, and another on
                    each side gives twigs to the lateral cushions. The cephalic mass supplies the
                    eyes and the cup-shaped sense-organs. The former, to the number of ten, are
                    situated on the three anterior segments and on the fifth and eighth segments,
                    the whole forming an ellipse, and their structure has been carefully
                    investigated by Leydig and others. Dr R. M. Gunn observes that in the leech they
                    are formed of cup-shaped or bell-shaped depressions of the skin, surrounded by
                    numerous pigmentcells. The fundus is furnished with large clear cells having
                    peculiar nuclei. They are merely altered epithelial cells, and are found to be
                    continuous with them. Between these in the axis of the cup is a space traversed
                    by a nervous filament which pierces the fundus. According to Leydig this
                    nerve-filament ends in a freely exposed papilliform elevation at the mouth of
                    the cup-shaped eye. No connexion has been found between the nerve and the cells.
                    Milne-Edwards, again, suggests that these refracting cellules are very like the
                    primordial cellules of the refracting cone of the retinal composite eye of
                    insects. Near the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n419/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0419-0402"/> mouth of the cup Ranke figures retinal cones
                    (Glaskörperkugeln), which are arranged like nerve end-organs in a mosaic, on a
                    flat extension of the optic ganglion. These cones are very like those of the
                    vertebrate eye, consisting of a somewhat rounded granular body, connected at the
                    base with a nerve filament, and having a clear, stiff, rod-like projection on
                    its outer part. Dr Gunn has been unable to see these cones or the termination of
                    the optic nerve. The wall of the clear cell is very thick, and the “nucleus” is
                    generally seen to be an inward projection of this wall ending in a knob-like
                    enlargement. Where it appears free, that is probably due to the plane of
                    section, the side or end of the knob being severed from its connexion. Besides
                    the cells having this inward projection of the wall there are others containing
                    highly refractive spherules like oil globules. Ranke observes how little these
                    “optic cups” differ from the touch or taste organs scattered on the snout and
                    sides of the animal, and he is of opinion that they probably serve equally for
                    the three kinds of sensory perception (sight, taste, and touch). If Ranke’s
                    account is correct, and if the cone-mosaic situated at the mouth of the cup be
                    directly stimulated by the rays of light, it is difficult to account for the
                    function of the large clear cells, and more especially the pigment around. F rom
                    the position of the pigment it cannot serve for the isolation of Ranke’s
                    elements, and it can hardly be required for the prevention of the confusion of
                    images. Yet by its presence the eye of the leech is distinguished from the
                    adjacent and very similar touch-organs. Dr Gunn is of opinion that the light
                    acts on the pigment, and develops some form of energy which affects the contents
                    of the cell, whence a stimulus is communicated to the nerve. Unfortunately a
                    nervous connexion with these cells has not been found.</p>
                <p>The three anterior pairs of ventral ganglia (δ) coalesce into a single mass, and
                    in the same way the last large ganglion (δ') is composed of seven. The ordinary
                    ventral ganglia give off two branches on each side, one of which has a small
                    ganglion developed on it. The penultimate ganglion sends off only a single
                    branch on each side, while the last gives off from seven to nine for the supply
                    of the posterior sucker. The nerve-cells, as usual in these ganglia, are chiefly
                    external, and the fibrous region internal, while the whole is surrounded by a
                    neurilemma. This system has been the subject of many elaborate researches,
                    amongst which those of Leydig and Hoffmann are conspicuous. A sympathetic or
                    azygos nerve discovered by Brandt runs along the ventral surface of the
                    digestive tract. In development it is found that in many leeches the long cords
                    are originally separate, but afterwards come close together so as to resemble a
                    single connecting cord.</p>
                <p>The circulatory system presents a median dorsal, a median ventral, and two large
                    lateral longitudinal trunks, all anastomosing with each other, and giving off
                    numerous branches to the muscular layer of the mesoderm and various internal
                    organs. The median sinus in the head surrounds the ganglia and oesophageal ring.
                    It has a ventral development in the rest of the body, where it encloses the
                    alimentary canal and the gangliated nerve-cord. The blood-vessels have a well
                    marked systole and diastole—from eight to ten times per minute. The fluid is
                    red, and devoid of corpuscles. Old observers noticed the finely reticulated
                    condition of the integuments when the vessels were injected, but, as formerly
                    noticed, vessels could not be seen in the hypoderm proper. The active to and fro
                    waving movements of leeches in the water when attached by the posterior sucker
                    are probably connected with cutaneous respiration.</p>
                <p>No part of the leech has caused more discussion than the series of seventeen
                    pairs of segmental organs (e, e') which occur in a line external to the testes,
                    and alternating in position with them. Some considered them respiratory, others
                    excretory, while a few connected them with the reproductive system. They consist
                    of a muscular saccate ciliated organ which communicates with the exterior near
                    the posterior part of each primary segment, and externally of a loopshaped
                    gland, labyrinthine in structure, one end of which opens into the former sac,
                    while a caecal process is prolonged on each of the testes in their region. In
                    minute structure it has been found that the cells which constitute the gland are
                    all penetrated by ductules, which, however, do not communicate with the large
                    duct in the axis of all the lobes (Bourne). The gland is surrounded by an
                    elaborate plexus of blood-vessels. These organs are in the embryo preceded, in
                    the posterior region of the body, by three pairs of looped canals, which
                    disappear before the permanent ones are developed.</p>
                <p>The leech is hermaphrodite, hut congress of different individuals is necessary
                    for reproduction, and thereafter spermatophores, which have a special covering,
                    are found in the respective vaginae. The male organs consist of an intromittent
                    apparatus (Ae) with a muscular and glandular basal structure (y), and a duct <hi
                    rend="italic">(f)</hi> on each side from the <hi rend="italic">vesicula
                    seminalis.</hi> The latter has a <hi rend="italic">vas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >deferens</hi> connecting it with the nine globular testes (d, <hi rend="italic"
                    >d', d",</hi> &amp;c.) ranged along each side of the body, one of which is
                    displaced outward at <hi rend="italic">d".</hi> The intromittent organ reaches
                    the exterior at the junction of the first and second sixth of the body (between
                    the twenty-fourth and twenty-fifth rings). The female apparatus is placed in the
                    segment between the seminal vesicles and the first testis, four annuli
                    intervening between the respective sexual apertures. The external opening of
                    this system (between the twenty-ninth and thirtieth rings) leads into an oval
                    sac (∕)&gt; the vagina—furnished with thick muscular walls. A coiled oviduct
                    passes from its apex through glandular tissue, which probably secretes the
                    albuminous matter surrounding the eggs, and divides into branches, one leading
                    to each ovary (ι). In <hi rend="italic">Haemopis</hi> the ovaries form a coiled
                    filament, and on this the ovarian germs are budded. The ova are connected with
                    the filament by a thin envelope which is drawn out into a stalk. There is no
                    cord in <hi rend="italic">Nephelis,</hi> but the ovarian germs form groups of
                    cells.</p>
                <p>Three or four days after congress the leech may be observed to be contracted
                    above and below the genital apertures, and an abundant secretion is poured out
                    so as to surround this region of the body as in the Nemerteans. Into this
                    investment the contents of the female organs and their opaline gelatinous
                    envelopment are forced. The animal elongates the anterior part of its body,
                    withdraws its head, and the structure just mentioned slips off as a cocoon
                    containing from five to eighteen ova, and frequently showing slight elevations
                    at the points through which the body passed. The cocoons are deposited in
                    cavities in the mud during the summer and autumn, and some seem also to deposit
                    them during the winter. The ovoid cocoons consist of a network of spongy fibres,
                    and indeed have been mistaken for a sponge. The older authors considered the
                    leech viviparous until Noble and Rawlins Johnson observed the foregoing
                    phenomena.</p>
                <p>There is little difficulty in rearing leeches in confinement if a proper method
                    is followed, and accordingly various leech tanks and ponds have been
                    constructed. One of the largest schemes of the kind is a leech farm of 13 acres
                    near Newton, Long Island, U.S. The breeding ponds are in oblongs, each of 1⅜
                    acres in extent, and 3 feet or more in depth. The bottom is composed of clay,
                    and the margins of peat. The cocoons are deposited in the soft peat from June
                    onward, the chief enemies being musk-rats, water-rats, and water-shrews, which
                    dig the cocoons out of the peat. The adult leeches are fed every six months on
                    fresh blood placed in linen bags suspended in the water. It is also the opinion
                    of some that leeches which have been filled with blood make good breeders.</p>
                <p>In regard to the development of the <hi rend="italic">Gnatliobdellidae,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Neρhelis,</hi> perhaps, has been more completely worked out than
                    <hi rend="italic">Hinido</hi> (though the observations of Weber, Leuckart,
                    Robin, and others on the latter are important), and, as the former very much
                    resembles the latter, except in the presence of cilia in the embryo anteriorly,
                    a brief notice of it will suffice. Butschli describes the usual divisions of the
                    eggs, which need not be given in detail, especially as an excellent summary is
                    to be found in Balfour’s <hi rend="italic">Comparative Embryology.</hi>
                    According to these authors the cells which constitute the epiblast give origin
                    to others which form the hypoblast and vitelline spheres. Two patches of
                    epiblast gradually spread over the vitelline spheres. Then the hypoblast cells
                    increase and fill up a space bounded behind by three vitelline spheres and in
                    front by the epiblast of the anterior end. At the sides of the hypoblast the
                    mesoblast has become established, probably as two lateral bands. The hypoblast
                    cells range themselves round a central cavity, increase, and become filled with
                    food-yolk. The mouth and thick-walled oesophagus are then developed, probably by
                    epiblastic invagination.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n420/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0420-0403"/>
                <p>The mesoblast now forms two lateral curved bands at the sides of the body. The
                    three vitelline spheres become covered with the flattened cells of the epiblast.
                    The cephalic region becomes ciliated, and the cilia enter the oesophagus. The
                    epiblast develops the cuticle, which is raised into transverse rings, without,
                    however, having any relation to the true segments of the mesoblast. The nervous
                    system is probably derived from the epiblast, the ventral cord breaking up into
                    a series of ganglia, which correspond with the true somites, except that the
                    first and last, as already mentioned, are composed of several. The
                    supra-cesophagal ganglia arise independently. The mesoblast probably takes its
                    origin from the two mesoblastic bands, and the segments formed by it grow upward
                    and meet in the dorsal line, and septa are formed between the somites. The
                    somatic layer of the mesoblast gives rise to the muscles. The mesoblast also
                    gives origin to the excretory (segmental) and generative organs, and the
                    vascular system. A delicate musculature, however, would appear to be developed
                    independently of the mesoblastic bands. The mouth and pharynx are formed by the
                    epiblast, the rest of the canal by the hypoblast, which from the first has a
                    sac-like shape. The posterior sacculation of the stomach in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirudo</hi> is originally unpaired. The dental pads are formed about the same
                    time as the eyes as protuberances of the oral cavity. The anus is developed very
                    late above the posterior· sucker. In the embryo of <hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi>
                    Leuckart found three pairs of segmental organs at the posterior end of the body,
                    consisting of an enlargement from which a convoluted tube is continued for some
                    distance backward, and then bends forward to open on the exterior. The anterior
                    part is broken up into a labyrinthic network. These organs disappear in the
                    adult. The recent researches of Whitman on <hi rend="italic">Clcpsine</hi> and
                    of Hoffmann have greatly extended our information with regard to the histology
                    and morphology of the parts in the embryos of the leeches.</p>
                <p>The time between the deposition of the ova and their hatching is variable, and
                    probably depends, as in the ova of the <hi rend="italic">Salmonidae,</hi> on
                    temperature and other causes. It is said to range from twenty-five to forty
                    days. The young arrive at perfect coloration when two years old, and become
                    sexually mature at three years, about which age they become fit for medicinal
                    use; their food consists at first of microscopic organisms, and afterwards, when
                    the mouth has attained more complete development, of the larvae of insects and
                    other small animals.</p>
                <p>There is no annelid that has been more prominently brought under notice than the
                    leech, both on account of its use in medicine from very early times, and its
                    fitness for anatomical and other investigations. The number of treatises,
                    inaugural, historical, and structural, that have been devoted to it is very
                    considerable; of these the voluminous article in Brandt and Batzeburg’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Medicin∙ ische</hi><hi rend="italic">Zoologie</hi> may be taken as
                    a type.</p>
                <p>The leech is the ∕3δελλα of Herodotus, Theocritus, Nicander, and other Greek
                    authors, and the <hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanguisuga</hi> of Plautus, Cicero, Horace, Pliny, and other Roman writers.
                    Caelius Aurelianus mentions its use, and Galen and his successors recommend its
                    application. Appian also alludes to the latter, and describes very graphically
                    the process by which it fills itself with blood. It was sufficiently familiar to
                    naturalists both before and after the time of Linnaeus, though occasionally
                    there has been considerable ambiguity in regard to species. The use of the leech
                    is mainly for local blood-letting, but in modern times the practice has greatly
                    diminished; indeed, in some cities the druggists chiefly use them with doubtful
                    efficiency in cases of incipient gumboil and in facial ecchymosis. They may be
                    applied to any part of the adult skin, and to the mouth, fauces, and other
                    available inlets by the aid of a leech-glass, which consists of a tube with a
                    slightly contracted aperture, and provided (or not) with a glass piston to push
                    the leech onward. In China a piece of bamboo serves the same purpose. For such
                    functions the most active specimens should be chosen (and, as Sir Robert
                    Christison states, these contract firmly when squeezed in the hand) and kept for
                    an hour out of water, and then applied to a perfectly clean surface of skin.
                    They may also be made to bite by smearing the skin with cream or blood, or by
                    immersing the leech for a minute in porter or tepid water. Each fills in about
                    fifteen minutes, and draws from 40 to 85 grains of blood, or, including that
                    afterwards obtained by fomenting the wound, about half an ounce. In young
                    children they should never be placed on parts where firm pressure cannot be
                    applied. It was formerly the practice to prepare the leeches that had been used
                    for further action by sprinkling a few grains of salt on the snout, and
                    stripping them gently between the fingers so as to cause them to eject the
                    blood. This plan is not now adopted, and rightly so, since various diseases
                    might thus be communicated. They certainly can be applied four and five times in
                    succession by placing them in vinegar and water, and afterwards in a vessel
                    (which the French call a domestic marsh) with turfy earth; but they draw less
                    blood on the fifth occasion. Should the haemorrhage from the wounds (as in
                    certain constitutions) prove severe, it may be staunched by the application of
                    vinegar, solid nitrate of silver, a hot wire, or a hot solution of alum, or by
                    acupuncture. If a leech by accident be swallowed, a pretty strong solution of
                    common salt, or a glassful or two of wine may be taken. Instead of the actual
                    leech an instrument called an artificial leech is now sometimes used. This
                    consists of a small sharp steel cylinder (worked by a spring) with which a
                    circular incision can be made through the skin, and a glass cylinder capable of
                    being exhausted by a piston worked by a screw. Care must be taken to move the
                    piston at about the same rate as the blood flows, and the edge of the glass
                    cylinder should not press too tightly, else the flow is arrested.</p>
                <p>Leeches are imported from France and Hungary, and also through Hamburg from
                    Poland and the Ukraine; they likewise come from Turkey, Wallachia, Russia,
                    Egypt, and Algeria. They are found in Britain—both in Scotland and England, but
                    especially in the latter. In the French trade Bordeaux leeches are preferred;
                    Polish, Swedish, and Hungarian are those most commonly met with in Britain. It
                    is difficult to estimate the number of leeches now used. In 1846 Moquin-Tandon
                    calculated that there were from twenty to thirty millions used in France; and
                    Leuckart mentions in 1863 that in London seven millions, and in the Parisian
                    hospitals five to six millions, were annually employed At the great American
                    leech-farm the average sale is one thousand per day. There cannot be a doubt,
                    however, that the use of leeches at the present time is greatly
                    restricted—indeed, the younger generation of British medical men seldom or never
                    prescribe them—so that scarcely one will now be employed where one hundred were
                    a quarter of a century ago. This is very well shown in a note from Messrs
                    Duncan, Flockhart, &amp; Co. of Edinburgh, from which it appears that the
                    account for leeches supplied during three months in 1844 to the Royal Infirmary,
                    Edinburgh, was £45. This steadily decreased until about 1868 it amounted for the
                    same period only to 5s. 6d. Sir Robert Christison mentions that the price of the
                    best leeches in 1845 ranged from <hi rend="italic">£4 to £8</hi> per thousand;
                    twenty years ago they were from £10 to £15 per thousand; and at the present time
                    good leeches cost about 10s. per hundred, or £5 per thousand.</p>
                <p>They inhabit ditches and ponds, with pure running water, weeds for shelter, and
                    muddy banks and bottom. They are captured by nets after attracting them by
                    baits, or by wading into the water, and then stripping them off the legs on
                    coming to land. Leeches are preserved in loose turf or moss constantly
                    moistened, or in earthenware or glass vessels half full of water, covered with
                    glass or linen-gauze; and some place a rusty nail, others a clean sponge in the
                    vessel, which can be exposed to the light. In transporting them the French
                    “domestic marsh,” a vessel with small perforations inferiorly and filled with
                    moist turfy earth or peat made into a stiff mud, is excellent. Sometimes an
                    exterior vessel with a few inches of water is placed round the former. The mouth
                    of the vessel is closed with a coarse linen cloth. Leeches, like many other
                    annelids, live for several years without food in vessels of pure water.</p>

                    rend="italic">bdcllidae.</hi></p>
                <p>The Rhynchobdellidae are those leeches furnished with a protrusible proboscis
                    (which is often exserted if the animal is removed from the water and placed on a
                    dry surface). This family includes the fish-leeches <hi rend="italic"
                    >fchythyobdxllidae),</hi> which have an anterior and posterior sucker, a simple
                    intestine, and mostly two pairs of eyes. Amongst these are <hi rend="italic"
                    >Piscicola</hi><hi rend="italic">geometra,</hi> L., found on freshwater fishes,
                    <hi rend="italic">P. hippoglossi</hi> on the holibut, and <hi rend="italic">P.
                    respirans,</hi> in which the body has lateral sacs into which the blood enters.
                    The first-mentioned (P. <hi rend="italic">geometra)</hi> is a somewhat beautiful
                    species, and full of activity, waving its body to and fro, and floating by aid
                    of the expanded posterior sucker on the surface of the water. Another well-known
                    genus <hi rend="italic">{Pontobdella)</hi> is characterized by its thick warty
                    skin, and four rings to each segment. The best-known example is the skate-leech
                    <hi rend="italic">(P. muricata,</hi> L.), which is olive-coloured and dusted
                    with whitish grains. The anterior sucker is furnished with papillae round its
                    edge. It adheres to the skin of the skate, and deposits the curious pedicled
                    horny capsules, containing a single egg, inside shells. In the same group is the
                    remarkable genus <hi rend="italic">Branchellion,</hi> which has a narrow nuchal
                    region with the sexual orifice at its posterior part, and a series of frilled
                    lateral appendages, the function of which has been supposed to be branchial. Its
                    stomach is sacculated. One species <hi rend="italic">(B.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    and De Quatrefages. The next subfamily—the <hi rend="italic">Clepsinidae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> have somewhat broad bodies capable of being curved downward
                    at the margins so as to form a hollow ventral groove for the lodgment of the
                    eggs and the young, while the snout is pointed. They have from one to four pairs
                    of eyes, and three rings to each segment. The dorsal bloodvessel is rhythmically
                    contractile, and the median blood-sinus envelops the digestive canal and the
                    ventral nerve-cord. The stomach is branched, and the anus opens above the
                    posterior sucker. The skin in many is warty, and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clcpsine cchinulata</hi> of Grube, from Lake Baikal, the dermal papillae are
                    furnished with soft pointed processes, so that in outline they are spinulose.
                    The oviducts have no common tract or vagina, but open at the female pore. The
                    genital apertures occur between the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth, and between
                    the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth rings. The ova are in some kept under the
                    body till hatched. Several species abound in the freshwater lakes and ponds of
                    Britain, and their remarkable and beautiful anatomical structure is yet in need
                    of elucidation. Amongst those most commonly met with is <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clepsine bioculata,</hi> Sav. (fig. 2), which is about an inch in length,
                    generally has a greenish-grey hue, and is much tapered anteriorly. Two closely
                    approximated eyes occur in front. There is a reddish-brown body on the eleventh
                    ring, marking an aperture described by O. F. Miiller, and a whitish opacity in
                    front of it. It often fixes itself by the posterior sucker, and waves its body
                    to and fro in the water, and it swims actively like a Nemertean or horse-leech.
                    The ova and young are carried in groups on the abdominal surface. It contracts
                    itself into a ball on irritation. Its food consists of fluviatile and lacustrine
                    mollusks, especially of <hi rend="italic">Physae</hi> (bubble-shells). <hi
                    rend="italic">Clepsine eomplanata,</hi> Sav. (fig. 3), again, is distinguished
                    by its greyish-green or pale brown appearance, often with two (sometimes four)
                    interrupted dark brown bands along the middle of the dorsum, in which are pale
                    papillae, four rows of the latter being generally present. The eyes are six in
                    number, in parallel series. The body is firm, and the crenatures at the sides
                    are never obliterated. There are six gastric sacs on each side; and in the young
                    the rectum is ciliated. The proboscis is a cylindrical organ slightly narrowed
                    anteriorly and posteriorly, and finely barred with transverse striae, a feature
                    in <hi rend="italic">C. bioculata</hi> due to the arrangement of the granular
                    nucleated glands on its inner surface. It feeds on <hi rend="italic"
                    >Planorbis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Limnaeus</hi> (coil and mud-shells). <hi
                    rend="italic">Clepsine</hi><hi rend="italic">heteroclita,</hi> L. (fig. 4), a
                    somewhat smaller form, is characterized by its translucent yellowish aspect. The
                    dorsum is rather regularly dotted with pale brownish, so as to give it a
                    checkered appearance. The snout is acute, and is furnished with six eyes, the
                    anterior pair being closely approximated, while the two succeeding are separated
                    by an interval from the foregoing, and the eyes in each pair are at a greater
                    distance from each other. The digestive caeca are beautiful objects from their
                    regularity and complexity. The ova are carried on the under surface of the body.
                    It is less active than <hi rend="italic">C. complanata.</hi> Another form very
                    abundant under flat stones in similar lakes and ponds in certain places is <hi
                    rend="italic">Clepsine tessulata,</hi> 0. F. Müller (fig. 5), a large and
                    conspicuously tinted form. It reaches the length of 3 inches, and is of various
                    shades of green, brownish, or olive, with six rows of yellowish or whitish
                    specks, the marginal in all cases being the largest, while the four internal
                    occupy papillae. The eyes are eight in number in two series approximated in
                    front. The soft, mobile, and almost gelatinous body is capable of assuming
                    endless shapes, and is sometimes like a cordate leaf. It is gregarious in
                    confinement. When a specimen is detached from its own adherent mass of ova, it
                    occasionally selects another group and fixes itself to the glass to nurse them.
                    The young are borne on the ventral surface (fig. 6). The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Haemcntaria</hi> has two eyes, a bifid anterior sucker with the mouth in front,
                    a long pointed proboscis, and five rings in each segment. The species <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g., H. mexicana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">II.
                    officinalis)</hi> occur in the Mexican lakes and South America, the latter being
                    used medicinally, since it is capable of penetrating the skin with its pointed
                    proboscis.</p>
                <p>The second family, Gnathobdellidae, includes the medicinal leech, besides <hi
                    rend="italic">Hirudo interrupta</hi> (Μ. Tand.) from Algiers, <hi rend="italic"
                    >H.</hi><hi rend="italic">javanica</hi> from Java, <hi rend="italic">H.

                    >II. decora</hi> (Say), the native leechof North America, is used in the same
                    wayas <hi rend="italic">II.</hi><hi rend="italic">medicinalis.</hi> It is
                    bluish, with about twenty-two reddish points on the dorsum and a lateral series
                    of black touches of the same number. The ventral surface is ruddy with black
                    points. It also comprises the genera <hi rend="italic">Bdella,</hi> without
                    denticles, and <hi rend="italic">Haemopis,</hi> the best-known example of which
                    is <hi rend="italic">II.</hi><hi rend="italic">vorax,</hi> Μ. Tand., a kind of

                    posterior caeca, is abundant in British ponds and lakes, as also is <hi
                    rend="italic">Nephelis vulgaris,</hi> L. (fig. 7), a species about 3 inches in
                    length. Its dorsum is brownish-yellow, often with a conspicuously tesselated
                    appearance, while the under surface is pale olive. The eyes are eight—four being
                    placed somewhat in a semicircle, and four a short distance behind, wider apart,
                    and at a different angle. It is active and restless, keeping up an undulating
                    motion of its body when attached by the posterior sucker, apparently as in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Phyllodocidoe,</hi> to promote respiration. It also swims on
                    edge through the water like an eel. The skin is exceedingly sensitive to the
                    vapour of chloroform, while the contact of a single drop causes tetanic
                    convulsions, and the annelid dies, quite rigid. The digestive canal is nearly
                    simple, and there are no buccal teeth. The dorsal blood-vessel is absent. The
                    ova are deposited in a horny capsule fixed horizontally to subaquatic
                    structures, and it is curious that Linnaeus described it as a hemipterous insect
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Coccus</hi><hi rend="italic">aquaticus.</hi>

                    >Nephelis</hi> feeds on earthworms, larvae, mollusks, and other organisms. <hi
                    rend="italic">Trochcta</hi><hi rend="italic">subviridis,</hi> Dutrochet, is a
                    large European form (7 inches in length), which frequents the marshes and
                    ditches of France and Algeria (and also rarely, apparently from introduction, of
                    England). It leaves the water to follow the earthworms on which it feeds. There
                    are no buccal teeth, and the alimentary tube is only slightly camerated. In
                    Ceylon the <hi rend="italic">Hirudo</hi><hi rend="italic">tagalla</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ceylanica,</hi> a land-leech about an inch in length, is a great
                    annoyance to travellers, especially in the rainy season, attacking men and
                    horses when journeying through the woods and jungles, and causing considerable
                    irritation from its bites. They come in troops out of the grass and dead leaves,
                    and one cannot leave the gravel in the gardens in some places without being
                    attacked. Leech-gaiters, therefore, are worn by many residents for protection. A
                    similar form occurs at an elevation of 4000 feet in the Philippines, and others
                    in Java and Sumatra; and Sir Joseph Hooker found them at a height of 11,000 feet
                    on the Himalayas. Landleeches also exist in Australia, Japan, and Chili,—where
                    very few occur in the water. They frequent plants, trunks of trees, and shrιιbs,
                    as well as grass. An eyeless leech, called <hi rend="italic">Typhlobdella,</hi>
                    inhabits the subterranean waters of the Baradla cave in Hungary. An allied
                    eyeless form, <hi rend="italic">Cyliobdellalumbricoides,</hi> Grιιbe, which was
                    found by Fritz Muller in Brazil, lives in damp earth. It has a slender
                    spindle-shaped outline. The exact position of the gigantic <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macro-bdcllcι valdiυiana</hi> of Filippi, a South American leech measuring
                    about 2⅛ feet, is uncertain. It is eyeless, and has neither lips nor teeth. It
                    probably lives in damp earth, and feeds on earthworms.</p>
                <p>In the third family, Branchiobdellidae, the irregularly annulated body is
                    elongated, somewhat cylindrical, with a bilobed eyeless snout, and a sucker at
                    the posterior end. There is no proboscis, but the pharynx has two flattened
                    edentate pads (dorsal and ventral). The body is provided with a coelom or
                    body-cavity, an unusual feature in the leeches. The alimentary canal is simple.
                    There are only two longitudinal vascular trunks—a dorsal and a ventral, the
                    former showing a dilatation behind the cephalic branches, sometimes termed a
                    heart. Two pairs of segmental organs are present, the posterior pair of which
                    are modified for the conveyance of the ovarian products to the exterior; for the
                    ovaries, which are situated far back, discharge their contents into the
                    body-cavity. The best known are <hi rend="italic">Branchiobdellaastaci,</hi>
                    Odier,and <hi rend="italic">B. parasita,</hi> Henle, which occur as
                    ectoparasites—the former (smaller) on the branchiae, the latter under the tail
                    and on the antennae and eyes, of the crayfish. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myzobdclla,</hi> Leidy, and <hi rend="italic">Temnocephala,</hi> Gay, are
                    allied forms. The latter is a curious Chilian leech having five digitate
                    processes attached to its anterior end, behind which a pair of eyes and the
                    mouth are situated. A sucker exists posteriorly. In the same family are placed
                    the aberrant types <hi rend="italic">Acanthobdclιa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histriobdclla.</hi> The former is characterized by a somewhat flattened
                    spindle-shaped body resembling a Gephyrean, bluntly pointed in front, furnished
                    with minute hooks near the anterior end, ami a posterior sucker. The <hi
                    rend="italic">A. paledina,</hi> Grube, a fish-parasite from Sicily, is an
                    example. The latter <hi rend="italic">(Histriobdellidoe)</hi> are remarkable in
                    the group in being dioecious instead of hermaphrodite, and somewhat resemble in
                    outline grotesque insect-larvae. The peculiar beak-like head fitted for suction,
                    the jointed body, and the pair of posterior suckers are characteristic. They are
                    ectoparasites on marine Crustacea; thus <hi rend="italic">Histriobdclla
                    homari,</hi> Van Beneden, occurs on the lobster, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Saccobdella</hi> on other decapods.</p>
                <p>Formerly <hi rend="italic">Udonella</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Entobdella</hi>
                    were included under the leeches, but they seem to be more correctly located
                    amongst the <hi rend="italic">Trematoda.</hi> Until lately <hi rend="italic"
                    >Malacobdella</hi> was also considered one of the group, but its ciliated skin,
                    separate nerve-cords, proboscis, and development point it out as an intermediate
                    type allied to the Nemerteans.</p>
