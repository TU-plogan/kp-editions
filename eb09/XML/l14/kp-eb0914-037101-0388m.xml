                    descendant of John Knox. To this couple were born twelve children, of whom three
                    became famous in India, Sir George St Patrick, Sir Henry (noticed below), and
                    Lord Lawrence. Irish Protestants, the boys were trained at Foyle College, Derry,
                    and at Clifton, and received commissions from their mother’s cousin, Mr
                    Huddleston, who had been the friend of Schwartz in Tanjore. In 1829, when only
                    seventeen, John Lawrence landed at Calcutta; he mastered the Persian language at
                    the college of Fort William, and was sent to Delhi, on his own application, as
                    assistant to the collector. The position was the most dangerous and difficult to
                    which a Bengal civilian could be appointed at that time. The titular court of
                    the pensioner who represented the Great Mogul was the centre of that
                    disaffection and sensuality which found their opportunity in 1857. A Mussulman
                    rabble filled the city. The district around, stretching from the desert of
                    Rajpootana to the Jumna, was slowly recovering from the anarchy to which Lord
                    Lake had given the first blow. When not administering justice in the city courts
                    or under the village tree, John Lawrence was scouring the country after the
                    marauding Meos and Mohammedan freebooters. His keen insight and sleepless energy
                    at once detected the murderer of his official superior, William Fraser, in 1835,
                    in the person of the nawab of Loharu, whose father had been raised to the
                    principality by Lake, and the assassin was executed. The first twenty years,
                    from 1829 to 1849, during which John Lawrence acted as the magistrate and land
                    revenue collector of the most turbulent and backward portion of the Indian
                    empire as it then was, formed the period of the reforms of Lord William
                    Bentinck. To what is now the lieutenant-governorship of the North-Western
                    Provinces Lord Wellesley had promised the same permanent settlement of the
                    land-tax which Lord Cornwallis had made with the large landholders or zemindars
                    of Bengal. The court of directors, going to the opposite extreme, had sanctioned
                    leases for only five years, so that agricultural progress was arrested. In 1833
                    Mertins Bird and Thomason introduced the system of thirty years’ leases based on
                    a careful survey of every estate by trained civilians, and on the mapping of
                    every village holding by native subordinates. These two revenue officers created
                    a school of enthusiastic economists who rapidly registered and assessed an area
                    as large as that of Great Britain, with a rural population of twenty-three
                    millions. Of that school John Lawrence proved the most ardent and the most
                    renowned. Intermitting his work at Delhi, he became land revenue settlement
                    officer in the district of Etawah, and there began, by buying out or getting rid
                    of the talukdars, to realize the ideal which he did much to create throughout
                    the rest of his career—a country “thickly cultivated by a fat contented
                    yeomanry, each man riding his own horse, sitting under his own fig-tree, and
                    enjoying his rude family comforts.” This and a quiet persistent hostility to the
                    oppression of the people by their chiefs formed the two features of his
                    administrative policy throughout life.</p>
                <p>It was fortunate for the British power that, when the first Sikh war broke out,
                    John Lawrence was still collector of Delhi. The critical engagements at
                    Firozshâh, following Mudki, and hardly redeemed by Aliwâl, left the British army
                    somewhat exhausted at the gate of the Punjab, in front of the Sikh entrenchments
                    on the Sutlej. For the first seven weeks of 1846 there poured into camp, day by
                    day, the supplies and munitions of war which this one man raised and pushed
                    forward, with all the influence acquired during fifteen years of an iron yet
                    sympathetic rule iu the land between the Sutlej and the Jumna. The crowning
                    victory of Sobraon was the result, and at thirty-five Lawrence became
                    commissioner of the Jalandhar Doab, the fertile belt of hill and dale stretching
                    from the Sutlej north to the Indus. The still youthful civilian did for the
                    newly annexed territory what he had long before accomplished in and around Delhi
                    He restored it to order, without one regular soldier. By the fascination of his
                    personal influence he organized levies of the Sikhs who had just been defeated,
                    led them now against a chief in the upper hills and now to storm the fort of a
                    raja in the lower, till he so welded the people into a loyal mass that he was
                    ready to repeat the service of 1846 when, three years after, the second Sikh war
                    ended in the conversion of the Punjab up to Peshawar into a British
                    province.</p>
                <p>The marquis of Dalhousie had to devise a government for a warlike population now
                    numbering twenty-three millions, and covering an area little less than that of
                    the United Kingdom. The first results were not hopeful (see next article), and
                    it was not till John Lawrence became chief commissioner, and stood alone face to
                    face with the chiefs and people and ring fence of still untamed border tribes,
                    that there became possible the most successful experiment in the art of
                    civilizing turbulent millions which history presents. The province was mapped
                    out into districts, now numbering thirty-two, in addition to thirty-six
                    tributary states, small and great. To each the thirty years’ leases of the
                    north-west settlement were applied, after a patient survey and assessment by
                    skilled officials ever in the saddle or the tent. The revenue was raised on
                    principles so fair to the peasantry that Ranjit Singh’s exactions were reduced
                    by a fourth, while agricultural improvements were encouraged. For the first time
                    in its history since the earliest Aryan settlers had been overwhelmed by
                    successive waves of invaders, the soil of the Punjab came to have a marketable
                    value, which every year of British rule has increased. A stalwart police was
                    organized; roads were cut through every district, and canals were constructed.
                    Commerce followed on increasing cultivation and communications, courts brought
                    justice to every man’s door, and crime hid its head. The adventurous and warlike
                    spirits, Sikh and Mohammedan, found a career in the new force of Irregulars
                    directed by the chief commissioner himself under the governor-general, while
                    Dost Mohammed kept within his own fastnesses, and the long extent of frontier at
                    the foot of the passes was patrolled. In the brilliance of his later services to
                    his country, this, the first, which alone rendered those possible, has not yet
                    received justice.</p>
                <p>Seven years of such work prepared the lately hostile and always anarchic Punjab
                    under such a pilot as John Lawrence not only to weather the storm of 1857 but to
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n389/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0389-0372"/> lead the older provinces into port. On the 12th
                    May the news of the tragedies at Meerut and Delhi reached him at Rawal Pindi.
                    The position was critical in the last degree, for of 50,000 native soldiers
                    38,000 were Hindustanis of the very class that had mutinied elsewhere, and the
                    British troops were few and scattered. For five days the fate of the Punjab hung
                    upon a thread, for the question was, Could the 12,000 Punjabis be trusted and
                    the 38,000 Hindustanis be disarmed? Not an hour was lost in beginning the
                    disarming at Lahore: and, as one by one the Hindustani corps succumbed to the
                    epidemic of mutiny, the sepoys were deported or disappeared, or swelled the
                    military rabble in and around the city of Delhi. The remembrance of the ten
                    years’ war which had closed only in 1849, a bountiful harvest, the old love of
                    battle, the offer of good pay, but, above all, the personality of Lawrence and
                    his officers, raised the Punjabi force into a new army of 59,000 men, and
                    induced the non-combatant classes to subscribe to a 6 per cent, loan, Delhi was
                    invested, but for three months the rebel city did not fall. Under John Nicholson
                    Lawrence sent on still more men to the siege, till every available European and
                    faithful native soldier was there, while a movable column swept the country, and
                    the border was kept by an improvised militia. At length, when even in the Punjab
                    confidence became doubt, and doubt distrust, and that was passing into
                    disaffection, John Lawrence was ready to consider whether we should not give up
                    the Peshawar valley as a last resource, and send its garrison to recruit the
                    force around Delhi. Another week and that must have been faced. But on the 20th
                    September the city and palace were again in British hands, and the chief
                    commissioner and his officers united in ascribing “to the Lord our God all the
                    praise due for nerving the hearts of our statesmen and the arms of our
                    soldiers.” As Sir John Lawrence, Bart., G.C.B., with the thanks of parliament,
                    the gratitude of his country, and a life pension of £2000 a year in addition to
                    his ordinary pension of £1000, the “Saviour of India” returned home in 1859.
                    While guarding the interests of India and its people as a member of the
                    secretary of state’s council, he was sent out again in 1864 as viceroy and
                    governor-general on the resignation and death of Lord Elgin. At what appeared to
                    be a critical time on the Punjab frontier Lord Palmerston recommended for the
                    office the first civilian, not a peer, who has filled the governor-general’s
                    seat since Warren Hastings. If no great crisis enabled him to increase the
                    lustre of his reputation, his five years’ administration of the whole Indian
                    empire was worthy of the ruler of the Punjab. His foreign policy has become a
                    subject of imperial interest; his internal administration was remarkable for
                    financial prudence, a jealous regard for the good of the masses of the people
                    and of the British soldiers, and a generous interest in education, especially in
                    its Christian aspects.</p>
                <p>When in 1854 Dost Mohammed Khan, weakened by the antagonism of his brothers in
                    Kandahar, and by the interference of Persia, sent his son to Peshawar to make a
                    treaty, Sir John Lawrence was opposed to any entangling relation with the
                    Afghans after the experience of 1838-42, but he obeyed Lord Dalhousie so far as
                    to sign a treaty of perpetual peace and friendship. His ruling idea, the fruit
                    of long and sad experience, was that <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> powers only
                    should be recognized beyond the frontier. When in 1863 Dost Mohammed’s death let
                    loose the factions of Afghanistan he acted on this policy to such an extent that
                    he recognized both the sons, Afzul Khan and Shere Ali, at different times, and
                    the latter fully only when he had made himself master of all his father’s
                    kingdom. The steady advance of Russia from the north, notwithstanding the
                    Gortchakoff circular of 1864, led to severe criticism of this cautious “buffer”
                    policy which he justified under the term of “masterly inactivity.” But he was
                    ready to receive Shere Ali in conference, and to aid him in consolidating his
                    power after it had been established and maintained for a time, when his term of
                    office came to an end and it fell to Lord Mayo, his successor, to hold the
                    Ambala conference in 1869. When, nine years after, the second Afghan war was
                    precipitated, the retired viceroy gave the last days of his life to an unsparing
                    exposure, in the House of Lords and in the press, of a policy which he had
                    striven to prevent in its inception, and which he did not cease to denounce in
                    its course and consequences.</p>
                <p>On his final return to England early in 1869, after forty years’ service in and
                    for India, “the great proconsul of our English Christian empire” was created
                    Baron Lawrence of the Punjab, and of Grately, Hants. He assumed the same arms
                    and crest as those of his brother Henry, with a Pathan and a Sikh trooper as
                    supporters, and took as his motto “Be ready,” his brother’s being “Never give
                    in.” For ten years he gave himself to the work of the London school board, of
                    which he was the first chairman, and of the Church Missionary Society. Latterly
                    his eyesight failed, and on the 27th June 1879 he died at the age of
                    sixty-eight. He was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey, beside Clyde,
                    Outram, and Livingstone. He married the daughter of the Rev. Richard Hamilton,
                    Harriette-Katherine, C.I., who survived him; and he was succeeded by his eldest
                    son, John Hamilton, born in 1846.</p>
                <p>Beyond, numerous minutes and reports, written in plain and trenchant English, and
                    occasional letters, Lord Lawrence published nothing. These, the printed <hi
