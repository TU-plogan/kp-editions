                    (1741-1801), is a remarkable instance of a man who has obtained celebrity by
                    following a bypath apart from the proper work of his life. As a preacher,
                    theological writer, and spiritual director he occupied duriħg his lifetime a
                    position not very dissimilar to that held by Keble in our own day, but he
                    survives for posterity chiefly as the author of a work on physiognomy. He was
                    born at Zürich, November 15,1741. Consistent with himself from the first, he
                    manifested little application to study, but great depth of feeling, especially
                    on religious themes, and a remarkable fluency of fervent and persuasive
                    discourse. When barely one and twenty he greatly distinguished himself by
                    denouncing, in conjunction with his friend the painter Fuseli, an iniquitous
                    magistrate, who was compelled to make restitution of his ill-gotten gains. In
                    1769 Lavater took orders, and officiated till his death as deacon or pastor in
                    various churches in his native city. The advantages of his manner and address,
                    as well as his oratorical fervour and genuine depth of conviction, gave him
                    great personal influence, especially with women; he was extensively consulted as
                    a casuist, and was welcomed with demonstrative enthusiasm in his numerous
                    journeys through Germany. His mystical writings were also widely popular.
                    Scarcely a trace however, of this influence has remained, and Lavater’s name
                    would be forgotten but for his work on physiognomy, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Physiognomische</hi><hi rend="italic">Fragmente zur Beförderung der
                        Menschen-kenntniss und Menschenlieben</hi> Leipsic, 1775-78, republished in
                    French with extensive additions by the author. The fame even of this universally
                    known book rests to a great extent upon the handsome style of publication and
                    the accompanying illustrations. It is not to be compared with the subsequent
                    labours of Caius for scientific value, and leaves the study of physiognomy as
                    desultory and unsystematic as it found it. The author’s remarks, nevertheless,
                    frequently display remarkable acuteness and insight into character, and the
                    illustrations render it very valuable to artists. Next to his physiognomy,
                    Lavater is perhaps chiefly remembered for his acquaintance with Goethe, and the
                    lively portrait of him in <hi rend="italic">Wahrheit und Dichtung.</hi> The
                    impression he produced upon one so dissimilar to himself shows that the man was
                    greater than his works. At a later period Goethe became estranged from him,
                    somewhat abruptly accusing him of superstition and hypocrisy. Of the former
                    charge he cannot be acquitted, seeing that he had manifested a tendency to run
                    after Cagliostro; but he seems to have been no more open to the latter than
                    every man whose ideal of creed and conduct is too exalted to be maintained with
                    unvarying consistency. A more cogent reason for Lavater’s discredit with Goethe
                    was his intellectual intolerance. No man was more bigoted upon paper, while in
                    truth his heart was open to all. He was continually propounding the alternative
                    of his own form of Christianity or atheism; and it is indeed true that, if
                    passages in his own writings are to be taken literally, he was himself incapable
                    of conceiving a Deity apart from the person of the Redeemer. Much that he has
                    written might be expressed in the language of Feuerbach with but slight
                    alteration. He had a mystic’s indifference to historical Christianity, and,
                    although esteemed by himself and others a champion of orthodoxy, was in fact
                    only an antagonist of rationalism. During the latter years of his life his
                    influence waned, and he incurred ridicule by some exhibitions of vanity,
                    pardonable in the recipient of so much incense. He redeemed himself by his
                    patriotic conduct during the troubles occasioned by the French occupation of
                    Switzerland, which brought about his tragical death. On the taking of Zürich by
                    the French in 1799, Lavater, while endeavouring to appease the soldiery, was
                    shot through the body by an infuriated grenadier, and died after long sufferings
                    borne with great fortitude, on January 2, 1801. His life was written in the
                    following year by his son-in-law Georg Gessner, with natural partiality and
                    unavoidable reticences, but faithfully in the main. There are more recent
                    biographies by Hegner and Bodemann, the latter entirely from the religious point
                    of view.</p>
