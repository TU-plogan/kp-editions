                    free from difficulties, is yet clear enough in its general scope <hi
                    rend="italic">(apτιd</hi> Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> v. 24), mentions
                    that the custom of keeping a fast before Easter Sunday was quite old even in his
                    day, but that no uniformity of observance had up to that time been established,
                    some thinking they ought to fast for one day, others for two days, and others
                    having further peculiarities. In Tertullian’s day the Good Friday fast at all
                    events was “communis et quasi publica jejunii religio” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De</hi><hi rend="italic">Orat.,</hi> c. 18), and elsewhere <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De Jejun.</hi> 2) he indicates his opinion that Christians ought to
                    commemorate by a religious fast all the time during which “the bridegroom was
                    taken away from them.” This period of fasting was gradually extended, but still
                    without uniformity of praxis. The diversity of usage covered by a common name is
                    referred toby Socrates <hi rend="italic">(H. E.,</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> n.</hi> 22) as a source of perplexity to him. He tells us that in
                    Rome the custom was to fast three continuous weeks before Easter, Saturdays and
                    Sundays not being included; that in Illyria, Greece, and Alexandria the period
                    of abstinence called <hi rend="italic">τεσσαρακοστή</hi> extended over six
                    weeks; and that in some other places, which he does not specify, the custom was
                    to begin the fast seven weeks before Easter, but actually to observe it at
                    intervals only for three periods of five days each, and nevertheless still to
                    call it <hi rend="italic">τεσσαρακοστή.</hi> Cassianus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Coll.</hi> 21, 5) calls attention to the fact that a fast of seven weeks, when
                    Saturdays and Sundays, except Holy Saturday, are excluded as they ought to be,
                    means a fast of thirty-six days in all, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a tithe of
                    the year,—an idea which seems to have found wide acceptance. Leo I. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Serm.</hi> 44) alludes to the fast of forty days as having
                    apostolic <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n466/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0466-0447"/> authority, but the number does not seem to have
                    been taken quite literally. In one of the homilies <hi rend="italic">{In
                    Evang.,</hi> xvL) of Gregory the Great, the precise number is fixed as by
                    Cassianus at thirty-six, but this figure is obtained by reckoning from the sixth
                    Sunday before Easter and deducting Sundays only. In the <hi rend="italic">Corpus
                    Juris</hi><hi rend="italic">Canonici</hi> this passage is reproduced, but with
                    an important change which must have been made before the end of the 8th century;
                    it is to the effect that, in order to make up the sacred number of forty days
                    dedicated to fasting by our Lord, it is necessary to take in as fasts the four
                    days preceding Quadragesima Sunday. As regards the manner of observing Lent,
                    various degrees of strictness have prevailed in the church. Perfect abstinence
                    from all food every fasting day until evening is in theory at least required,
                    and it has also been considered desirable that public worship with sermon should
                    be attended daily, with frequent communion, especially on Saturday and Sunday;
                    public amusements, especially stage plays, are prohibited, and the celebration
                    of religious festivals, as also of birthdays and marriages, is held to be
                    unsuitable; and increased diligence in almsgiving and deeds of charity is
                    enjoined.</p>
