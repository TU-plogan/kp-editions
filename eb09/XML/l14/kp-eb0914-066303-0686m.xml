                    the young duke of Northumberland. On his return he was presented to the living
                    of Kirkby-Wiske in Yorkshire, and after exchanging it for that of Piddletown in
                    Dorsetshire he in 1763 removed to Catterick in Yorkshire. Meanwhile he had begun
                    to entertain anti-Trinitarian views, and to be troubled in conscience about
                    their inconsistency with the creed he had repeatedly subscribed; since 1769 the
                    intimate friendship of Priestley had served to foster his scruples, and in 1771
                    he united with Archdeacon Blackburne (his father-in-law), Jebb, Wyvell, and Law
                    in preparing a petition to parliament with the prayer that clergymen of the
                    church, and graduates of the universities, might be relieved from the burden of
                    subscribing to the thirty-nine articles, and “restored to their undoubted rights
                    as Protestants of interpreting Scripture for themselves.” After two hundred and
                    fifty signatures to the document had, with six months of vast effort on
                    Lindsey’s part, been obtained, it was, in February 1772, rejected in the House
                    of Commons by a majority of two hundred and seventeen to seventy-one; the
                    adverse vote was repeated in the following year, and in the end of 1773, seeing
                    no prospect of obtaining within the church the relief which his conscience
                    demanded, Lindsey resigned his vicarage and took leave of a warmly attached
                    congregation. In April 1774 he began to conduct a Unitarian service in a room in
                    Essex Street, Strand, London; four years later he removed to a chapel built for
                    him in the same street Here he continued to labour till 1793, when he resigned
                    his charge in favour of Disney, who like himself had. left the established
                    church, and had become his colleague. His active interest in the Unitarian
                    movement continued, however, until his death, which took place on November 3,
                    1808.</p>
