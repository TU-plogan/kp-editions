                    (1813-1873), missionary and explorer, was born on March 19, 1813, at the village
                    of Blantyre Works, in Lanarkshire, Scotland. David was the second child of his
                    parents Neil Livingston (for so he spelled his name, as did his son for many
                    years) and Agnes Hunter. His parents were poor and self-respecting, typical
                    examples of all that is best among the humbler families of Scotland. At the age
                    of ten years David left the village school for the neighbouring cotton-mill, and
                    by strenuous efforts he qualified himself at the age of twenty-three to
                    undertake a college curriculum. He attended for two sessions the medical and the
                    Greek classes in Anderson’s College, and also a theological class. In September
                    1838 he went up to London, and was accepted by the London Missionary Society as
                    a candidate. During the next two years he resided mostly in London, diligently
                    attending medical and science classes, and spending part of his time with the
                    Rev. Mr Cecil at Ongar in Essex, studying theology and learning to preach. He
                    took his medical degree in the Faculty of Physicians and Surgeons in Glasgow in
                    November 1840. Livingstone had from the first set his heart on China, and it was
                    a great disappointment to him that the Society finally decided to send him to
                    Africa. To an exterior in these early years somewhat heavy and uncouth, he
                    united a manner which, by universal testimony, was irresistibly winning, with a
                    fund of genuine but simple humour and fun that would break out on the most
                    unlikely occasions, and in after years enabled him to overcome difficulties and
                    mellow refractory chiefs when all other methods failed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> Livingstone sailed from England on December 8, 1840.
                    I ’ rom Algoa Bay he made direct for Kuruman, the mission station, 700 miles
                    north, established by Hamilton and Moffat thirty years before, and there he
                    arrived on July 31, 1841. The next two years Livingstone spent in travelling
                    about the country to the northwards, in search of a suitable outpost for
                    settlement. During these two years he had already become convinced that the
                    success of the white missionary in a field like Africa is not to be reckoned by
                    the tale of doubtful conversions he can send home each year,—that the proper
                    work for such men was that of pioneering, opening up and starting new ground,
                    leaving native agents to work it out in detail. The whole of his subsequent
                    career was a development of this idea. He selected the valley of Mabotaa, on one
                    of the sources of the Limpopo river, 200 miles north-east of Kuruman, as his
                    first station. It was shortly after his settlement here that he was attacked by
                    a lion which crushed his left arm, and nearly put an end to his career. The arm
                    was imperfectly set, and it was a source of trouble to him at times throughout
                    his life, and was the means of identifying his body after his death. To a house,
                    mainly built by himself at Mabotsa, Livingstone in 1844 brought home his wife,
                    Mary Moffat, the daughter of Moffat of Kuruman. Here he laboured till 1846, when
                    he removed to Chonuane, 40 miles further north, the chief place of the Bakwain
                    tribe under Sechele. In 1847 he again removed to Kolobeng, about 40 miles
                    westwards, the whole tribe following their missionary. With the help of and in
                    the company of two English sportsmen, Mr Oswell and Mr Murray, he was able to
                    undertake a journey of great importance to Lake Ngami, which had never yet been
                    seen by a white man. Crossing the Kalahari Desert, of which Livingstone gave the
                    first detailed account, they reached the lake on August 1, 1849. In April next
                    year he made an attempt to reach Sebituane, who lived 200 miles beyond the lake,
                    this time in company with his wife and children, but again got no further than
                    the lake, as the children were seized with fever. A year later, April 1851,
                    Livingstone, again accompanied by his family and Mr Oswell, set out, this time
                    with the intention of settling among the Makololo for a period. At last he
                    succeeded, and reached the Chobe, a southern tributary of the Zambesi, and in
                    the end of June discovered the Zambesi itself at the town of Sesheke. Leaving
                    the Chobe on August 13, the party reached Capetown in April 1852. Livingstone
                    may now be said to have completed the first period of his career in Africa, the
                    period in which the work of the missionary had the greatest prominence.
                    Henceforth he appears more in the character of an explorer, but it must be
                    remembered that he regarded himself to the last as a pioneer missionary, whose
                    work was to open up the country to others.</p>
                <p>Having, with a sad heart, seen his family off to England, Livingstone left the
                    Cape on June 8, 1852, and reached Linyanti, the capital of the Makololo, on the
                    Chobe, on May 23, 1853, received in royal style by Sekeletu, and welcomed by all
                    the people. His first object in this journey was to seek for some healthy high
                    land in which to plant a station. Ascending the Zambesi, he, however, found no
                    place free from the destructive tsetse insect, and therefore resolved to
                    discover a route to the interior from either the west or east coast. To
                    accompany Livingstone in his hazardous undertaking twenty-seven men were
                    selected from the various tribes under Sekeletu, partly with a view to open up a
                    trade route between their own country and the coast. The start was made from
                    Linyanti on November 11, 1853, and, by ascending the Leeba, Lake Dilolo was
                    reached on February 20, 1854. On April 4 the Coango was crossed, and on May 31
                    the town of Loanda was entered, much to the joy of the men,—their leader,
                    however, being all but dead from fever, semi-starvation, and dysentery.
                    Livingstone speaks in the warmest terms of the generosity of the Portuguese
                    merchants and officials. From Loanda Livingstone sent his astronomical
                    observations to Maclear at the Cape, and an account of his journey to the Royal
                    Geographical Society, which in May 1855 awarded him its highest honour, its gold
                    medal.</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0744-0721"/>
                <p>Luanda was left on September 20, 1854, but Livingstone lingered long about the
                    Portuguese settlements. Making a slight detour to the north to Cabango, the
                    party reached Lake Dilolo on June 13. Here Livingstone made a careful study of
                    the watershed of the country in what is perhaps the most complicated river
                    system in the world. He “now for the first time apprehended the true form of the
                    river systems and the continent,” and the conclusions he came to have been
                    essentially confirmed by subsequent observations. The return journey from Lake
                    Dilolo was by the same route as that by which the party came. Their reception
                    all along the Barotse valley was an ovation, and Linyanti was reached in the
                    beginning of September.</p>
                <p>For Livingstone’s purposes the route to the west was unavailable, and he decided
                    to follow the Zambesi to its mouth. With a numerous following, he left Linyanti
                    on November 8, 1855. A fortnight afterwards he made the great discovery with
                    which, in popular imagination, his name is more intimately associated than with
                    anything else he did,—the famous “Victoria” falls of the Zambesi, which, after a
                    second examination in his subsequent journey, he concluded to be due to an
                    immense fissure or fault right across the bed of the river, which was one means
                    of draining off the waters of the great lake that he supposed must have at one
                    time occupied the centre of the continent. He had already formed a true idea of
                    the configuration of the continent as a great hollow or basin-shaped plateau,
                    surrounded by a ring of mountains. Livingstone reached the Portuguese settlement
                    of Tette on March 2, 1856, in a very emaciated condition, and after six weeks,
                    left his men well cared for, and proceeded to Kilimane, where he arrived on May
                    20, thus having completed in two years and six months one of the most remarkable
                    and fruitful journeys on record. The results in geography and in natural science
                    in all its departments were abundant and accurate; his observations necessitated
                    a reconstruction of the map of central Africa. Men of the highest eminence in
                    all departments of science testified to the high value of Livingstone’s work. In
                    later years, it is true, the Portuguese, embittered by his unsparing
                    denunciations of their traffic in slaves, attempted to depreciate his work, and
                    to maintain that much of it had already been done by Portuguese explorers. When
                    Livingstone began his work in Africa it was virtually a blank from Kuruman to
                    Timbuctoo, and nothing but envy or ignorance can throw any doubt on the
                    originality of his discoveries.</p>
                <p>On December 12 he arrived in England, after an absence of sixteen years, and met
                    everywhere with the welcome of a hero. He told his story in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa</hi> (1857) with
                    straightforward simplicity, and with no effort after literary style, and no
                    apparent consciousness that he had done anything extraordinary. Its publication
                    brought what he would have considered a competency had he felt himself at
                    liberty to settle down for life. In 1857 he severed his connexion with the
                    London Missionary Society, with whom, however, he always remained on the best of
                    terms, and in February 1858 he accepted the appointment of “Her Majesty’s consul
                    at Kilimane for the eastern coast and the independent districts in the interior,
                    and commander of an expedition for exploring eastern and central Africa.”</p>
                <p>The Zambesi expedition, of which Livingstone thus became commander, sailed from
                    Liverpool in H.M.S. “Pearl” on March 10,1858, and reached the mouth of the
                    Zambesi on May 14, and the party ascended the river from the Kongone mouth in a
                    steam launch, the “Ma-Robert,” reaching Tette on September 8. The remainder of
                    the year was spent in examining the river above Tette, and especially the
                    Kebrabasa rapids. Most of the year 1859 was spent in the exploration of the
                    river Shire and Lake Nyassa, which was discovered in September; and much of the
                    year 1860 was spent by Livingstone in fulfilling his promise to take such of the
                    Makalolo home as cared to go. In January of next year arrived Bishop Mackenzie
                    and a party of missionaries sent out by the Universities Mission to establish a
                    station on the upper Shire.</p>
                <p>After exploring the river Rovuma for 30 miles in his new vessel the “Pioneer,”
                    Livingstone and the missionaries proceeded up the Shire to Chibisa’s; there they
                    found the slave trade rampant, desolating the country and paralysing all effort.
                    On July 15 Livingstone, accompanied by several native carriers, started to show
                    the bishop the country. Several bands of slaves whom they met were liberated,
                    and after seeing the missionary party settled in the highlands of Magomero to
                    the south of Lake Shirwa, Livingstone spent from August to November in exploring
                    Lake Nyassa. While the boat sailed up the west side of the lake to near the
                    north end, the explorer marched along the shore. He returned more resolved than
                    ever to do his utmost to rouse the civilized world to put down the desolating
                    slave-trade. On January 30, 1862, at the Zambesi mouth, Livingstone welcomed his
                    wife and the ladies of the mission, with whom were the sections of the “Lady
                    Nyassa,” a river steamer which Livingstone had had built at his own expense,
                    absorbing most of the profits of his book, and for which he never got any
                    allowance. When the mission ladies reached the mouth of the Ruo tributary of the
                    Shire, they were stunned to hear of the death of the bishop and of Mr Burrup.
                    This was a sad blow to Livingstone, seeming to have rendered all his efforts to
                    establish a mission futile. A still greater loss to him was that of his wife at
                    Shupanga, on April 27, 1862.</p>
                <p>The “Lady Nyassa” was taken to the Rovuma. Up this river Livingstone managed to
                    steam 156 miles, but further progress was arrested by rocks. Returning to the
                    Zambesi in the beginning of 1863, he found that the desolation caused by the
                    slave trade was more horrible and widespread than ever. It was clear that the
                    Portuguese officials were themselves at the bottom of the traffic. Kirk and
                    Charles Livingstone being compelled to return to England on account of their
                    health, the doctor resolved once more to visit the lake, and proceeded some
                    distance up the west side and then north-west as far as the watershed that
                    separates the Loangwa from the rivers that run into the lake. Meanwhile a letter
                    was received from Earl Russell recalling the expedition by the end of the year.
                    In the end of April 1864 Livingstone reached Zanzibar in the “Lady Nyassa,” and
                    on the 30th he set out with nine natives and four Europeans for Bombay, which
                    was reached after an adventurous voyage of a month, and on July 23 Livingstone
                    arrived in England. He was naturally disappointed with the results of this
                    expedition, all its leading objects being thwarted through no blame of his. For
                    the unfortunate disagreements which occurred, and for which he was blamed in
                    some quarters, he must be held acquitted, as he was by the authorities at home;
                    though it is not necessary to maintain that Livingstone was exempt from the
                    trying effects on the temper of African fever, or from the intolerance of
                    lukewarmness which belongs to all exceptionally strong natures. Still the
                    results at the time, and especially those of the future, were great. The
                    geographical results, though not in extent to be compared to those of his first
                    and his final expeditions, were of high importance, as were those in various
                    departments of science. Details will be found in his <hi rend="italic">Narrative
                    of an Expedition to the Zambesi and its Tributaries,</hi> published in 1865.</p>
                <p>By Murchison and his other staunch friends Livingstone was as warmly welcomed as
                    ever. When Murchison proposed to him that he should go out again, although he
                    seems to have had a desire to spend the remainder of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n745/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0745-0722"/> days at home, the prospect was too tempting to be
                    rejected. He was appointed H.M. consul to central Africa without a salary, and
                    Government contributed only £500 to the expedition. The chief help came from
                    private friends. During the latter part of the expedition Government granted him
                    £1000, but that, when he learned of it, was devoted to his great undertaking.
                    The Geographical Society contributed £500. The two main objects of the
                    expedition were the suppression of slavery by means of civilizing influences,
                    and the ascertainment of the watershed in the region between Nyassa and
                    Tanganyika. At first Livingstone thought the Nile problem had been all but
                    solved by Speke, Baker, and Burton, but the idea grew upon him that the Nile
                    sources must be sought farther south, and his last journey became in the end a
                    forlorn hope in search of the “fountains” of Herodotus. Leaving England in the
                    middle of August 1865, <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Bombay, Livingstone arrived at
                    Zanzibar on January 28, 1866. He was landed at the mouth of the Rovuma on March
                    22, and started for the interior on April 4. His company consisted of thirteen
                    sepoys, ten Johanna men, nine African boys from Nassick school, Bombay, and four
                    boys from the Shire region, besides camels, buffaloes, mules, and donkeys. This
                    imposing outfit soon melted away to four or five boys. Rounding the south end of
                    Lake Nyassa, Livingstone struck in a north-northwest direction for the south end
                    of Lake Tanganyika, over country much of which had not previously been explored.
                    The Loangwa was crossed on December 15, and on Christmas day Livingstone lost
                    his four goats, a loss which he felt very keenly, and the medicine chest was·
                    stolen in January 1868. Fever came upon him, and for a time was his almost
                    constant companion; this, with the fearful dysentery and dreadful ulcers and
                    other ailments which subsequently attacked him, and which he had no medicine to
                    counteract, no doubt told fatally on even his iron frame. The Chambeze was
                    crossed on January 28, and the south end of Tanganyika reached March 31. Here,
                    much to his vexation, he got into the company of Arab slave dealers, by whom his
                    movements were hampered; but he succeeded in reaching Lake Moero. After visiting
                    Lake Mofwa and the Lualaba, which he believed was the upper part of the Nile,
                    he, on July 18, discovered Lake Bangweolo. Proceeding up the west coast of
                    Tanganyika, he reached Ujiji on March 14, 1869, “a ruckle of bones.” Supplies
                    had been forwarded to him at Ujiji, but had been knavishly made away with by
                    those to whose care they had been entrusted. Livingstone recrossed Tanganyika in
                    July, and through the country of the Manyuema he tried in vain, for a whole
                    year, to reach and cross the Lualaba, baffled partly by the natives, partly by
                    the slave hunters, and partly by his long illnesses. It was, indeed, not till
                    March 29, 1871, that he succeeded in reaching the Lualaba, at the town of
                    Nyangwe, where he stayed four months, vainly trying to get a canoe to take him
                    across. It was here that a party of Arab slavers, without warning or
                    provocation, assembled one day when the market was busiest and commenced
                    shooting down the poor women, hundreds being killed or drowned in trying to
                    escape. Livingstone had “the impression that he was in hell,” but was helpless,
                    though his “first impulse was to pistol the murderers.” The account of this
                    scene which he sent home roused indignation in England to such a degree as to
                    lead to determined and to a considerable extent successful efforts to get the
                    sultan of Zanzibar to suppress the trade. In sickened disgust the weary
                    traveller made his way back to Ujiji, which he reached on October 13. Five days
                    after his arrival in Ujiji he was cheered and inspired with new life, and
                    completelyset upagain, as he said,by the timelyarrival of Mr H. M. Stanley, the
                    richly laden almoner of Mr Gordon Bennett, of the <hi rend="italic">New York
                    Herald.</hi> Mr Stanley’s residence with Livingstone was almost the only bright
                    episode of these last sad years. With Stanley Livingstone explored the north end
                    of Tanganyika, and proved conclusively that the Lusize runs into and not out of
                    it. In the end of the year the two started eastward for Unyanyembe, where
                    Stanley provided Livingstone with an ample supply of goods, and bade him
                    farewell. Stanley left on March 15, 1872, and after Livingstone had waited
                    wearily at Unyanyembe for five months, a troop of fifty-seven men and boys
                    arrived, good and faithful fellows on the whole, selected by Stanley himself.
                    Thus attended, he started on August 15 for Lake Bangweolo, proceeding along the
                    east side of Tanganyika. His old enemy dysentery soon found him out. In January
                    1873 the party got among the endless spongy jungle on the east of Lake
                    Bangweolo, Livingstone’s object being to go round by the south and away west to
                    find the “fountains.” Vexatious delays took place, and the j ourney became one
                    constant wade below, under an almost endless pour of rain from above. The doctor
                    got worse and worse, but no idea of danger seems to have occurred to him. At
                    last, in the middle of April, he had unwillingly to submit to be carried in a
                    rude litter. On April 29 Chitambo’s village on the Lull mala, in Ilala, on the
                    south shore of the lake, was reached. The last entry in the journal is April 27
                    :— “Knocked up quite, and remain—recover—sent to buy milch goats. We are on the
                    banks of the Molilamo.” On April 30 he with difficulty wound up his watch, and
                    early on the morning of May 1 the boys found “the great master,” as they called
                    him, kneeling by the side of his bed, dead. His faithful men preserved the body
                    in the sun as well as they could, and wrapping it carefully up, carried it and
                    all his papers, instruments, and other things across Africa to Zanzibar. It was
                    borne to England with all honour, and on April 18, 1874, was deposited in
                    Westminster Abbey, amid tokens of mourning and admiration such as England
                    accords only to her greatest sons. Government bore all the funeral expenses. His
                    faithfully kept journals during these seven years’ wanderings were published
                    under the title of the <hi rend="italic">Last Journals of David Livingstone in
                    Central Africa,</hi> in 1874, edited by his old friend the Rev. Horace
                    Waller.</p>
                <p>In spite of his sufferings and the many compulsory delays, Livingstone’s
                    discoveries during these last years were both extensive and of prime importance
                    as leading to a solution of African hydrography. No single African explorer has
                    ever done so much for African geography as Livingstone during his thirty years’
                    work. His travels covered one-third of the continent, extending from the Cape to
                    near the equator, and from the Atlantic to the Indian Ocean. Livingstone was no
                    hurried traveller; he did his journeying leisurely, carefully observing and
                    recording all that was worthy of note, with rare geographical instinct and the
                    eye of a trained scientific observer, studying the ways of the people, eating
                    their food, living in their huts, and sympathizing with their joys and sorrows.
                    It will be long till the tradition of his sojourn dies out among the native
                    tribes, who almost, without exception, treated Livingstone as a superior being;
                    his treatment of them was always tender, gentle, and gentlemanly. But the direct
                    gains to geography and science are perhaps not the greatest results of
                    Livingstone’s journeys. He conceived, developed, and carried out to success a
                    noble and many-sided purpose, with an unflinching and self-sacrificing energy
                    and courage that entitle him to take rank among the great and strong who
                    single-handed have been able materially to influence human progress, and the
                    advancement of knowledge. His example and his death have acted like an
                    inspiration, filling Africa with an army of explorers and missionaries, and
                    raising in Europe so powerful a feeling against the slave trade that it may be
                    considered as having received its deathblow. Personally Livingstone was a pure
                    and tender-hearted man, <pb break="no"

                    child. The motto of his life was the advice he gave to some school children in
                    Scotland,—“Fear God, and work hard.”</p>
