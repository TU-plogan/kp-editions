                    Staffordshire, employing his spare time in experimental research and in
                    preparing a translation of Buffon’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                    Birds,</hi> which was published in nine 8vo vols, in 1793, and brought him some
                    money. For the next twelve years (passed chiefly in London or at Largo, with an
                    occasional visit to the Continent) he continued his physical studies, which
                    resulted in numerous papers contributed by him to Nicholson’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Journal,</hi> and in the publication (1804) of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of Heat,</hi>
                    a work which gained for its author the Rumford Medal of the Royal Society of
                    London. In 1805 he was elected to succeed Playfair in the chair of mathematics
                    at Edinburgh, not, however, without violent though unsuccessful opposition on
                    the part of a narrowminded clerical party who accused him of heresy in something
                    he had said as to the “unsophisticated notions of mankind” about the relation of
                    cause and effect. During his tenure of this chair he published two volumes of a
                    <hi rend="italic">Course of Mathematics—</hi> the first, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis, and Plane
                    Trigonometry,</hi> in 1809, and the second, <hi rend="italic">Geometrical
                    Analysis, and Geometry of Curve Lines,</hi> in 1821; the third volume, on
                    “Descriptive Geometry” and the “Theory of Solids” was never completed. With
                    reference to his invention (in 1810) of a process of artificial congelation, he
                    published in 1813 <hi rend="italic">A Short Account of Experiments and
                    Instruments depending on the relations of Air to Heat and Moisture·,</hi> and in
                    close connexion with the subject of this treatise he also wrote a paper on the
                    aethrioscope, which appeared in 1818 in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of
                    the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</hi> In 1819, on the death of Playfair, he was
                    promoted to the more congenial chair of natural philosophy, which he continued
                    to hold until his death, and in 1823 he published, chiefly for the use of his
                    class, the first volume of his never-completed <hi rend="italic">Elements of
                    Natural Philosophy.</hi> Leslie’s main contributions to physics were made by the
                    help of the “differential thermometer,” an instrument whose invention was
                    contested with him by Count Rumford. By adapting to this instrument various
                    ingenious devices he was enabled to employ it in a great variety of
                    investigations, connected especially with photometry, hygroscopy, and the
                    temperature of space. In 1820 he had been elected a corresponding member of the
                    Royal Institute of France, the only distinction of the kind which he valued, and
                    early in 1832 he was, on the recommendation of Lord Chancellor Brougham, created
                    a knight of the Guelphic order. He died at Coates, a small property which he had
                    acquired near Largo, on November 3 of the same year.</p>
