                    (1460-1524), a distinguished humanist and physician, was born at Canterbury
                    about the year 1460. Of his parentage or descent nothing certain is known. He
                    received his early education at the cathedral school of Canterbury, then under
                    the direction of William of Selling, afterwards prior of Canterbury. Selling was
                    an ardent scholar, and one of the earliest in England who cultivated Greek
                    learning. From him Linacre must have received his first incentive to this study,
                    in which he afterwards became eminent. Linacre entered the university of Oxford
                    about the year 1480, and in 1484 was elected a fellow of All Souls’ College.
                    Shortly afterwards he visited Italy in the train of William of Selling, who was
                    sent by Henry VIII. as an envoy to the papal court, and accompanied his patron
                    as far as Bologna. There he became the pupil of Angelo Poliziano, and afterwards
                    shared the instruction which that great scholar imparted at Florence to the
                    youthful sons of Lorenzo de’ Medici. The younger of these princes became Pope
                    Leo X., and was in after years mindful of his old companionship with
                    Linacre.</p>
                <p>Among his other teachers and friends in Italy should be mentioned Demetrius
                    Chalcondylas, Hermolaus Barbaras, Aldus Romanns the printer of Venice, and
                    Nicolaus Leonicenus of Vicenza. Linacre took the degree of doctor of medicine
                    with great distinction at Padua. On his return to Oxford, full of the learning
                    and imbued with the spirit of the Italian Renaissance, he formed one of the
                    brilliant circle of Oxford scholars, including Colet, Grocyn, and William
                    Latimer, who are mentioned with so much warm eulogy in the letters of
                    Erasmus.</p>
                <p>Linacre does not appear to have practised or taught medicine in Oxford. About the
                    year 1501 he was called to court as tutor of the young prince Arthur; and
                    continued to act in this capacity till the prince’s death in 1503. On the
                    accession of Henry VIII. he was appointed the king’s physician, an office at
                    that time of considerable influence and importance, and practised medicine in
                    London, having among his patients most of the great statesmen and prelates of
                    the time, as Wolsey, Warham, and Fox.</p>
                <p>After some years of professional activity, and when in advanced life, Linacre
                    received priest’s orders. But, as he had for some years previously held several
                    clerical benefices, it would seem that he must have been already a deacon, and
                    thus nominally at least a cleric, but this status would not in those days have
                    interfered with his practising as a physician. There is no doubt, however, that
                    his ordination as priest was connected with his retirement from active life.
                    Literary labours, and the cares of the foundation which owed its existence
                    chiefly to him, the Royal College of Physicians, occupied Linacre’s remaining
                    years till his death in 1524.</p>
                <p>Linacre was more of a scholar than a man of letters, and rather a man of learning
                    than a scientific investigator. It is difficult now to judge of his practical
                    skill in his profession, but it was evidently highly esteemed in his own day;
                    and several instances are recorded of his wise prognosis and judicious
                    treatment. He took no part in political or theological questions, and died too
                    soon to have to declare himself on either side in the formidable controversies
                    which were even in his lifetime beginning to arise.</p>
                <p>But his career as a scholar was one eminently characteristic of the critical
                    period in the history of learning through which he lived. He was one of the
                    first Englishmen who studied Greek in Italy, whence he brought back to his
                    native country and his own university the lessons of the “New Learning.” His
                    teachers, who have already been named, were some of the greatest scholars of the
                    day. Among his pupils was one—Erasmus—whose name alone would suffice to preserve
                    the memory of his instructor in Greek, and others of note in letters and
                    politics, such as Sir Thomas More, the lamented Prince Arthur, and Queen Mary.
                    Colet, Grocyn, William Lilye, and other eminent scholars were his intimate
                    friends, and he was esteemed by a still wider circle of literary correspondents
                    in all parts of Europe.</p>
                <p>Linacre’s literary activity was displayed in two directions, in pure scholarship
                    and in translation from the Greek. In the domain of scholarship he was known by
                    the rudiments of (Latin) grammar composed in English for the use of the Princess
                    Mary, and afterwards translated into Latin by George Buchanan, and by a work on
                    Latin composition, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">emendata structura
                    Latini sermonis,</hi> which enjoyed a wide popularity. It was originally
                    composed for the use of St Paul’s school, when founded by Dean Colet, but was
                    set aside as unsuited for the purpose. It was, however, printed in London, in
                    1524, and many times reprinted on the Continent.</p>
                <p>Linacre’s only medical works were his translations. It was the cherished project
                    of his life to make the works of Galen (and indeed those of Aristotle also)
                    accessible to all readers of Latin. What he effected in the case of the first,
                    though not trifling in itself, is inconsiderable as compared with the whole mass
                    of Galen’s writings; and of his translations from Aristotle, some of which are
                    known to have been completed, nothing has survived. The following are the works
                    of Galen translated by Linacre :—(1) <hi rend="italic">De Sanitate</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tuenda,</hi> printed at Paris in 1517; (2) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodus Medendi,</hi> Paris, 1519; (3) <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Temperamentis</hi><hi rend="italic">et de InaequaU</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Intemperie,</hi> Cambridge, 1521; (4) <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturalibus Facultatibus,</hi> London, 1523; (5) <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Symptomatum Differentiis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Causis,</hi> London, 1524; (6) <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pulsuum Usu,</hi> London, without date. He also
                    translated for the use of his pupil Prince Arthur an astronomical treatise of
                    Proclus, <hi rend="italic">De Sphaera,</hi> which was printed at Venice by Aldus
                    in 1499. The accuracy of these translations and their elegance of style were
                    universally admitted. They have been generally accepted as the standard versions
                    of those parts of Galen’s writings, and frequently reprinted, either as a part
                    of the collected works or separately.</p>
                <p>But the most important service which Linacre conferred upon his own profession
                    and science was not by his writings. To him was chiefly owing the foundation by
                    royal charter of the College of Physicians in London, which first gave the
                    medical profession in this country a recognized legal status, and which has been
                    the model of all the similar colleges of physicians and surgeons in the three
                    kingdoms. He was the first president of the new college, which he further aided
                    by conveying to it his own house, and by the gift of his library. Shortly before
                    his death Linacre obtained from the king letters patent for the establishment of
                    readerships in medicine at Oxford and Cambridge, and placed some valuable
                    estates in the hands of trustees for their endowment. Two readerships were
                    founded in Merton College, Oxford, and one in St John’s College, Cambridge, but
                    owing to neglect and bad management of the funds, they fell into uselessness and
                    obscurity. The Oxford foundation was revived by the university commissioners in
                    1856 in the form of the Linacre professorship of anatomy. Posterity has done
                    justice to the generosity and public spirit which prompted these foundations;
                    and it is impossible not to recognize a strong constructive genius in the scheme
                    of the College of Physicians, by which Linacre not only first organized the
                    medical profession in England, but impressed upon it for some centuries the
                    stamp of his own individuality. The intellectual fastidiousness of Linacre, and
                    his habits of minute accuracy were, as Erasmus suggests, tire chief cause why he
                    accomplished so little and left behind no more permanent literary memorials. It
                    will be found, perhaps, difficult to justify by any extant work the extremely
                    high <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n676/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0676-0653"/> reputation which he enjoyed among the scholars of
                    his time. His Latin style was so much admired that, according to the flattering
                    eulogium of Erasmus, Galen spoke better Latin in the version of Linacre than he
                    had before spoken Greek; and even Aristotle displayed a grace which he hardly
                    attained to in his native tongue. Erasmus praises also Liuacre’s critical
                    judgment (vir non exacti tantum sed severi judicii). According to others it was
                    hard to say whether he were more distinguished as a grammarian or a rhetorician.
                    Of Greek he was regarded as a consummate master; and he was equally eminent as a
                    “philosopher,” that is, as learned in the works of the ancient philosophers and
                    naturalists. In this there may have been, as the custom of the day was, some
                    exaggeration; but all have acknowledged the elevation of Linacre’s character,
                    and the fine moral qualities summed up in the epitaph written by John
                    Caius:—“Fraudes dolosque mire perosus; fidus amicis; omnibus ordinibus juxta
                    carus.”</p>
                <p>The materials for Linacre's biography are to a large extent contained in the
                    older biographical collections of George Lilly (in Paulus Jovius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Descriptio Britannice),</hi> Bale, Leland, and Pits, in wood’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Athenae</hi><hi rend="italic">Oxonienses,</hi> and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Biographia Britannica·,</hi> but all are completely collected in

                    1835. Reference may also be made to Dr Munk's <hi rend="italic">Boll cf the

                    Linacre’s works or translations have been reprinted in modern times. (J. F.
