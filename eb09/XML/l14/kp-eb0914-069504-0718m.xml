                    in which he argues, against those who were objecting to certain innovations,
                    that neither were “litanies” used in the time of Gregory Thaumaturgus. The
                    nature of the recently introduced litanies, which must be assumed to have been
                    practised at Neocaesarea in Basil’s day, can only be vaguely conjectured;
                    probably they had many points in common with the “rogationes,” which, according
                    to Sidonius Apollinaris, had been gradually coming into occasional use in France
                    about the beginning of the 5th century, especially when rain or fine weather was
                    desired, and which, so far as the three fast days before Ascension were
                    concerned, were first definitely fixed, for one particular district at least, by
                    Mamertus or Mamercus of Vienne (e. 450 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> We
                    gather that they were penitential and intercessory prayers offered by the
                    community while going about in procession, fasting, and clothed in sackloth.
                    Sidonius alludes to the incongruity of men going “castorinati ad litanias.” In
                    the following century the manner of making litanies (litanias facere) was to
                    some extent regulated for the entire Eastern empire by one of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Novels</hi> of Justinian, which forbade their celebration without
                    the presence of the bishops and clergy, and ordered that the crosses (which were
                    carried about in procession) should not be deposited elsewhere than in churches,
                    nor be carried by any but such persons as were duly appointed to do so. The
                    first synod of Orleans (511 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> in its
                    twenty-seventh canon enjoins <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n719/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0719-0696"/> for all Gaul that the “litanies” before Ascension
                    be celebrated for three days; on these days all menials are to be exempt from
                    work, so that every one may be free to attend divine service. The diet is to be
                    the same as in Quadragesima; clerks not observing these rogations are to be
                    punished by the bishop. In 517 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the synod of
                    Gerunda provided for two sets of “litanies”; the first were to be observed for
                    three days (from Thursday to Saturday) in the week after Pentecost with fasting,
                    the second for three days from November 1. A synod of Paris (573) in its tenth
                    canon ordered litanies to be held for three days at the beginning of Lent, and
                    the fifth synod of Toledo (636) appointed litanies to be observed throughout the
                    kingdom for three whole days from December 14. The first mention of the word
                    litany in connexion with the Roman Church goes back to the pontificate of
                    Pelagius I. (555), but implies that the thing was at that time already old. In
                    590 Gregory I., moved by the pestilence which had followed an inundation,
                    ordered a “litania septiformis,” that is to say, a sevenfold procession of
                    clergy, laity, monks, virgins, matrons, widows, poor, and children. He is said
                    also to have appointed the processions or litanies of April 25 (St Mark’s day),
                    which seem to have come in the place of the ceremonies of the old Robigalia. In
                    7 47 the synod of Cloveshoe (can. 16 and 17) ordered the litanies or rogations
                    to be gone about by all the clergy and people with great reverence,—on April 25
                    “after the manner of the Roman Church,” and on the three days before Ascension
                    “after the manner of our ancestors.” The latter are still known in the English
                    Church as Rogation Days. Garnis, horse racing, junkettings were forbidden; and
                    in the litanies the name of Augustine was to be inserted after that of Gregory.
                    The reforming synod of Mainz in 813 ordered the major litany to be observed by
                    all for three days, not with horses or in magnificent attire, but in sackcloth
                    and ashes, and barefoot. The sick only were exempted from this command.</p>
                <p>As regards the form of words prescribed for use in these “litanies” or
                    “supplications,” documentary evidence is somewhat defective. Sometimes it would
                    appear that the “procession” or “litany” did nothing else but chant “Kyrie
                    eleison” without variation. There is no reason to doubt that from an early
                    period the special written litanies of the various churches all showed the
                    common features which are now regarded as essential to a litany, in as far as
                    they consisted of (1) invocations, (2) deprecations, (3) intercessions, (4)
                    supplications. But in details they must have varied immensely. The offices of
                    the Roman Catholic Church at present recognize two litanies, the “Litaniae
                    majores” and the “Litaniae breves,” which differ from one another chiefly in
                    respect of the fulness with which details are entered upon under each of the
                    four heads mentioned above. It is said that in the time of Charlemagne the
                    angels Orihel, Raguhel, Tobihel were invoked, but the names were removed by Pope
                    Zacharias as really belonging to demons. In some mediaeval litanies there were
                    special invocations of S. Sapientia, S. Fides, S. Spes, S. Charitas. The major
                    litanies, as given in the Breviary, are at present appointed to be recited on
                    bended knee, along with the penitential psalms, in all the six week days of Lent
                    when ordinary service is held. Without the psalms they are said on the feast of
                    Saint Mark and on the three rogation days. They are also chanted in procession
                    before mass on Holy Saturday. The “litany” or “general supplication” of the
                    Church of England, which is appointed “to be sung or said after morning prayer
                    upon Sundays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and at other times when it shall be
                    commanded by the ordinary,” closely follows the “Litaniae majores” of the
                    Breviary, the invocations of saints being of course omitted. A very similar
                    German litany will be found in the works of Luther. In the Roman Church there
                    are a number of special litanies peculiar to particular localities or orders,
                    such as the “Litanies of Mary” or the “Litanies of the Sacred Name of
                    Jesus.”</p>
