                    prophetic lessons at least had not yet reached the fixity of the later ritual.
                    For obvious reasons the reading of Scripture at public worship was continued by
                    the Christian Church with certain modifications (1 Thess. v. 27; Col. iv. 16).
                    An authority so early as Justin Martyr (ApoZ., i. 67) states that in the
                    Christian assemblies of his day “the memoirs of the apostles, or the writings of
                    the prophets, are read as long as time permits.” What we are precisely to
                    understand by these “memoirs of the apostles” is doubtful; but the evidence we
                    have, fragmentary though it is, may be said to make it certain that neither in
                    his day, nor for many years afterwards, was the canon of sacred books to be read
                    in public worship rigidly fixed, and still less were definite portions of
                    Scripture appointed to be read on particular days of the ecclesiastical year.
                    Traces of the office of reader as distinct from that of deacon begin to appear
                    in Tertullian <hi rend="italic">(De Prsεscr.,</hi> 41), who makes frequent
                    allusions to the public reading of both Old and New Testament Scriptures <hi
                    rend="italic">(Apol.,</hi> 39 <hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">De
                    Presser.,</hi> 36 <hi rend="italic">; De A'</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ι.,</hi> 9), but says nothing that can be construed as implying
                    anything like a fixed table of lessons. Towards the end of the 4th century,
                    however, indications of a widely spread custom of reading the Scriptures
                    according to a uniform and rigid scheme became frequent; and the practice even
                    then was spoken of as ancient. Thus Chrysostom and Augustine both show
                    incidentally that the Acts of the Apostles were publicly read between Easter and
                    Pentecost and then laid aside, while Genesis was read in Lent. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apostolical Constitutions</hi> (ii. 57) a very methodical service
                    is enjoined; it prescribes two lessons from the Old Testament by a reader; the
                    Psalms of David are then to be sung, next the Acts of the Apostles and the
                    epistles of Paul, and finally (by a deacon or presbyter) the gospels, are to be
                    read. The labours of Scholz and Tischendorf have brought to light a large body
                    of MS. Greek lectionaries ranging between the 7th and the 10th century, from
                    which, when fully collated, it will probably be possible to ascertain with
                    precision the order of yearly lections contemplated within the circles to which
                    the documents respectively belong. Most of them contain gospel lessons only; the
                    rest lessons from the Acts and the epistles. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Evangelion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Apostolos</hi> of the modern Greek Church
                    has a proper gospel and epistle, not only for every Saturday and Sunday, but for
                    every day of the week. The order of (continuous) lessons for the five ordinary
                    week days cannot be traced with certainty further back than to the 10th century,
                    but those for the Sundays, also for the most part continuous, can be traced, so
                    far as the gospels at least are concerned, to the 8th, and large coincidences
                    with the Armenian lectionary lead to the inference that much had been already
                    fixed before 595. Of Western lectionaries the earliest is probably the <hi
                    rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Comitis sive</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Lectioηamus,</hi> which used to be attributed to Jerome. On the whole it does
                    not observe a <hi rend="italic">lectio</hi><hi rend="italic">continua,</hi> but
                    is characterized rather by free selection of suitable passages for each Sunday.
                    Next in chronological order is the <hi rend="italic">Tabula,</hi> drawn up by
                    Victor of Capua (546); it was printed by Gerbert in his <hi rend="italic">Monum.
                    Veh Liturg. Alem.</hi> in 1777. It also has no trace of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lectio</hi><hi rend="italic">continua.</hi> The same remark applies to the
                    Luxueil lectionary, edited by Mabillon in the <hi rend="italic">De
                    Liturgia</hi><hi rend="italic">Gallicana</hi> (Migne, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ρatr.,</hi> lxxii.); it is assigned by Mabillon to the end of the 7th century,
                    and certainly is not later than the time of Charlemagne; besides the usual
                    gospel and epistle, it prescribes a lesson from the Old Testament.</p>
                <p>The earliest allusion seeming to imply an order of lectors or readers as one of
                    the standing orders of the church occurs, as already mentioned, in a solitary
                    passage in Tertullian. In Cyprian, allusions much less ambiguous are frequent.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions</hi> give a form of prayer to be
                    used at the ordination of lectors by the imposition of hands. In the modern
                    Greek Church the functions of the Anagnostes are strictly confined to the
                    reading of the epistle, that of the gospel being reserved for the deacon. In the
                    old Catholic Church, the ordination of lectors was by publicly placing the Bible
                    in their hands, with some such formula of exhortation as is prescribed in can. 8
                    of the fourth council of Carthage. By the council of Trent the order of lector
                    was recognized as one of the minor orders of the Roman Catholic Church, but it
                    has no actual independent existence, being regarded merely as a necessary step
                    in promotion to a higher office.</p>
