                <p><label type="entry">LIPPE</label> is the name of a territory in north-western
                    Germany, now divided into two small sovereign principalities, but formerly
                    united under the same ruler. The name is derived from the river Lippe, which
                    rises in the Teutoburgian Forest, and flows into the Rhine at WeseL</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lippe</hi> proper, also called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Lippe-Detmold,</hi> is bounded on three sides by the Prussian province of
                    Westphalia, and on the E. and N.E. by Hanover, Pyrmont, and Hesse-Cassel. It
                    also possesses three small enclaves in Westphalia. Its area is about 450 square
                    miles. The greater part of the surface is mountainous, especially towards the
                    south, where it is intersected by the Teutoburgian Forest. The chief rivers are
                    the Weser, which crosses the north extremity of the principality, and its
                    affluents the Werre, Exter, Kalle, and Emmer. The forests of Lippe are among the
                    finest in Germany, and produce abundance of excellent timber. The valleys
                    contain a considerable amount of good arable land, the tillage of which occupies
                    the greater part of the inhabitants. The principal crops are corn, flax, and
                    rape. Cattle, sheep, and swine are also reared, and the “Senner” breed of horses
                    is celebrated. The industries of Lippe are almost confined to a little
                    yarn-spinning and linen-weaving. Its trade is also inconsiderable; but, besides
                    agricultural products, timber, meerschaum pipes, and starch are exported. The
                    brine springs of Salzuflen produce about 1500 tons of salt annually. In 1880 the
                    population amounted to 120,216 souls, upwards of 95 per cent, of whom were
                    Calvinists (Reformed Church), the remainder being Lutherans, Roman Catholics,
                    and Jews. Education is provided for by two gymnasia and numerous other efficient
                    schools. The principality contains seven small towns, the chief of which are
                    Detmold, the seat of government, and Lemgo. The present constitution was granted
                    in 1836, and is modified by a new election law of 1876. It provides for a
                    representative chamber of twenty-one members, whose functions are mainly
                    consultative. For electoral purposes the population is divided into three
                    classes, rated according to taxation, each of which returns seven members. The
                    estimated revenue in 1881 was £49,200, and the expenditure £50,850. The public
                    debt amounts to nearly £60,000. Lippe has one vote in the German Reichstag, and
                    also one vote in the Federal Council. Its military forces form a battalion of
                    the 6th Westphalian infantry.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Schaumburg-Lippe,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Lippe-Bückeburg,</hi> to the north of Lippe-Detmold, consists of the
                    western half of the old countship of Schaumburg, and is surrounded by
                    Westphalia, Hanover, and the Prussian part of Schaumburg. The northern extremity
                    of the principality, which is 175 square miles in extent, is occupied by a lake
                    named the Steinhuder Meer. The southern part is mountainous, but the remainder
                    consists of a fertile plain, producing abundant crops of cereals and flax.
                    Besides husbandry, the inhabitants practise yarn-spinning and linen-weaving, and
                    the coal-mines of the Bückeburg, on the south-eastern border, are very
                    productive. The great bulk of the population, which in 1880 amounted to 35,374,
                    are Lutherans. The capital is Bückeburg, and Stadthagen is the only other town.
                    Under the constitution of 1868 there is a legislative diet of fifteen members,
                    ten of whom are elected by the towns and rural districts and three by the
                    nobility, clergy, and educated classes, while the remaining two are nominated by
                    the prince. Schaumburg-Lippe sends one deputy to the Federal Council, and has
                    one vote in the Reichstag. It contributes a battalion of riflemen to the
                    imperial army. The budget of 1881-82 showed an estimated revenue of £25,750,
                    which was balanced by the expenditure. The public debt is about £18,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The district now named Lippe was inhabited in
                    the earliest times of which we have any record by the Cherusci, whose leader
                    Arminius annihilated the legions of Varus in the Teutoburgian Forest (9 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> It was afterwards occupied by the Saxons, and
                    was subdued by Charlemagne. The founder of the present reigning family, one of
                    the most ancient in Germany, was Bernard I. (1128-58), who received a grant of
                    the territory, till then called the countship of Haholt, from the emperor
                    Lothair, and assumed the title of lord of Lippe. Bernard VIII., who with his
                    people embraced the tenets of the Reformation in 1556, was the first to style
                    himself count of Lippe. In 1613 Lippe was divided among the three sons of Simon
                    VI., the lines founded by two of whom still exist, while the third (Brake)
                    became extinct in 1709.</p>
                <p>Lippe-Detmold was the patrimony of the eldest son, whose descendants became
                    princes of the empire in 1789. In 1809 it joined the Confederation of the Rhine,
                    and in 1813 the German Confederation. Under the prudent government of the
                    Princess Pauline (1807-20) the little country enjoyed great prosperity. Her son,
                    Paul Alexander Leopold, ruled in the same spirit, and in 1836 granted the
                    charter of rights on which the government is now based. In 1842 Lippe entered
                    the German Customs Union <pb break="no"

                    with Prussia and joined the North German Confederation.</p>
                <p>Philip, the youngest son of Simon VI. (see above), received but a scanty share of
                    his father’s possessions, but in 1640 he inherited a large part of the countship
                    of Schaumburg, including Bückeburg, and adopted the title of count of
                    Schaumburg-Lippe. The ruler of this territory became a sovereign prince in 1807.
                    In 1866 the prince at first sided with Austria, but afterwards entered the
                    German Confederation.</p>
