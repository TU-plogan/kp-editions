                <p><label type="entry">LISBON</label> (Portuguese, <hi rend="italic">Lisboa),</hi>
                    the capital of the kingdom of Portugal, is situated in 38° 42' N. lat. and 9° 5'
                    W. long., on the northern bank of the Tagus (7⅛b), at the spot where the river
                    broadens to a width of 9 miles, some 8 or 9 miles from the point where it enters
                    the Atlantic. Standing on a range of low hills, backed by the lofty granite
                    range of Cintra, and extending along the margin of the wide Tagus, Lisbon wears
                    a very noble aspect to those who approach it from the sea. In regard to beauty
                    of position it may rightly claim to be the third of European cities,
                    Constantinople and Naples alone ranking before it. The river affords secure
                    anchorage for a very large number of vessels, and the bar at the mouth is easily
                    crossed even in rough weather. Like London, Paris, and Vienna, Lisbon stands in
                    a geological basin of Tertiary formation. The upper portion consists of loose
                    sand and gravel destitute of organic remains, below which is a series of beds
                    termed by Mr Daniel Sharpe the Almada beds, composed of yellow sand, calcareous
                    sandstone, and blue clay, rich in marine remains. The greater part of Lisbon
                    stands on those beds which bejong to the older Miocene epoch, and are nearly of
                    the same age as those of Bordeaux. Next comes a conglomerate without fossils.
                    These Tertiary deposits, which cover altogether an area of more than 2000 square
                    miles, are separated, near Lisbon, from rocks of the secondary epoch by a great
                    sheet of basalt which covered the Secondary rocks before any of the Tertiary
                    strata were in existence. The uppermost of the Secondary deposits is the
                    Hippurite Limestone, which corresponds to a part of the Upper Chalk of northern
                    Europe. The narrow valley of Alcantara, in the immediate neighbourhood of
                    Lisbon, has been excavated in this deposit; and here there are extensive
                    quarries, where abundance of its peculiar shells may be collected.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>After careful investigation,
                    Mr Sharpe discovered that the greatest force of the earthquake of 1755 was
                    expended upon the area of the above-mentioned Almada blue clay, and that not one
                    of the buildings standing upon it escaped destruction. Those upon the slopes of
                    the hills immediately above the clay suffered very severely, and all on the
                    Tertiary strata were more or less injured, whilst none of the buildings on the
                    hippurite limestone or the basalt suffered any damage whatever,—the line at
                    which the earthquake ceased to be destructive corresponding exactly with the
                    boundary of the Tertiary beds.</p></note></p>
                <p>Lisbon stretches along the margin of the river for 4 or 5 miles, and extends
                    northward over the hills for nearly 3 miles, but much of it is scattered amongst
                    gardens and fields. In the older parts the streets are very irregular, but that
                    portion which was rebuilt after the great earthquake of 1755 consists of lofty
                    houses arranged in long straight streets. Here are the four principal squares,
                    the handsomest of which, the Praça do Commercio, is open on one side to the
                    river, and on the other three is surrounded by the custom-house and Government
                    offices, with a spacious arcade beneath. In the middle is a bronze equestrian
                    statue of Joseph I., in whose reign the earthquake and restoration of the city
                    took place. At the middle of the north side is a grand triumphal arch, under
                    which is a street leading to another handsome square, the Rocio or Praça do Dorn
                    Pedro (built on the site of the Inquisition palace and prisons), where stands
                    the theatre of D. Maria II. The houses are for the most part well built, and are
                    divided into flats for the accommodation of several families. The streets had
                    formerly a bad reputation in regard to cleanliness, but of late years great
                    improvement has taken place in this respect, although no general system of
                    drainage has yet been adopted. They are lighted with gas made from British coal.
                    The public gardens, five in number, are small, but are much frequented in the
                    evenings. The city contains seven theatres and a bull ring. The hotels of Lisbon
                    offer but indifferent accommodation to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0714-0691"/> strangers; the shops present little display, and
                    are ill furnished with wares. The markets are tolerably well supplied with meat,
                    fish, and country produce. A large quantity of excellent fruit is brought in for
                    sale during the season.</p>
                <p>The king usually resides at the palace of Ajuda, situate on a hill above the
                    suburb of Belem. It is in the Italian style, and was intended to be one of the
                    largest palaces in Europe, but it has been left incomplete. It contains a large
                    library, a collection of pictures, and a numismatic cabinet. There is another
                    royal palace at Lisbon (that of the Neces-sidades), where former monarchs were
                    wont to reside; and in the neighbourhood of the city are numerous others.
                    Several of the nobility have good and spacious houses in the city, which are
                    dignified with the name of palaces. The houses of the British residents are
                    mostly to be found in the elevated district called Buenos Ayres.</p>
                <p>Two or three small forts, one on a rock at the mouth of the Tagus, afford a very
                    inadequate defence against the attacks of a hostile fleet. In ascending the
                    river the picturesque Tower of Belem, built about the end of the 15th century,
                    is seen on the north bank close to the water’s edge. On a rocky hill stands the
                    citadel of St George, surrounded by the most ancient part of Lisbon, composed of
                    narrow tortuous streets, still retaining its old Moorish name, Alfama. The chief
                    naval and military arsenals of the kingdom are at Lisbon. Attached to the former
                    are a naval school and a hydrographical office. Here also is a museum of
                    colonial products. In various parts of the city are barracks for the
                    accommodation of the troops and for the municipal guard. The churches are
                    numerous, but are nearly all in the same tasteless Italian style; the interiors,
                    overlaid by heavy ornament, contain pictures utterly devoid of merit. The
                    cathedral is gloomy without being grand, but the oldest part behind the high
                    altar may deserve inspection. The largest church in the city is St Vincent’s,
                    222 feet by 82. The large adjacent convent is now the residence of the cardinal
                    patriarch. In a modern chapel attaehed to the church the coffined corpses of the
                    monarchs of the house of Braganza are deposited, and the public are admitted to
                    see them on certain days in the year. Perhaps the most striking church in Lisbon
                    itself is that of the Estrella, with a dome commanding an extensive view, and
                    two towers, the whole design reminding the visitor of St Paul’s, London. At St
                    Roque is the famous chapel of St John the Baptist, designed by Vanvitelli, and
                    made at Rome for King John V., who had been enriched by the discovery of the
                    gold and diamond mines in Brazil. Before being sent to Portugal it was set up in
                    St Peter’s, and Benedict XIV. celebrated the first mass in it. It is composed of
                    precious marbles with mosaics and ornaments in silver and bronze, and is said to
                    have cost upwards of £120,000. By far the most interesting architectural object
                    at Lisbon is, however, the unfinished Hieronymite church and monastery at Belem.
                    The church was begun in 1500 near the spot where Vasco da Gama had embarked
                    three years before on his famous voyage to India. The style is a curious mixture
                    of Moorish Gothic and Renaissance, with beautiful details. The English college
                    was founded in 1628 for the education of British Roman Catholics; and the Irish
                    Dominicans have a church and convent originally established for the education<pb

                    Ecclesiastically Lisbon is a patriarchate, the holder of the dignity being at
                    the head of the clergy of the kingdom, and president of the chamber of peers. He
                    is usually made a cardinal.</p>
                <p>The two chambers of parliament hold their sittings in a huge building, formerly
                    the monastery of St Bento, to which a handsome façade has been added. New and
                    ornamental buildings have been erected for the courts of justice and the
                    municipal chamber. The mint is fitted up with steam machinery on a small scale
                    for coining gold, silver, and copper. Postage stamps and inland revenue stamps
                    are printed at this establishment. The national astronomical observatory is near
                    the Ajuda palace, and the meteorological observatory is at the Polytechnic
                    school, which also contains the national museum of natural history. Here is a
                    good collection of the birds of Portugal, with collections in other branches of
                    the zoology of Portugal and the Portuguese possessions in Africa—minerals,
                    fossils, &amp;c. The fossils collected by the Geological Commission to
                    illustrate the geology of the kingdom are preserved in the sequestrated Convento
                    do Jesus.</p>
                <p>Lisbon is singularly destitute of works of high art. The gallery of the Academy
                    of Fine Arts contains only a few pictures worth notice. In the custody of the
                    academy is an interesting assemblage of gold and silver plate taken from
                    suppressed monasteries. There is also a collection of pictures at the Ajuda
                    palace. At the Carmo church is an archaeological museum. The great national
                    library consists for the most part of old theological works and ecclesiastical
                    histories swept out of various suppressed monasteries, and has a collection of
                    24,000 coins with some Roman bronzes. The Portuguese take little interest in
                    literature, art, or science, and almost everything connected with them is in a
                    neglected state. Literary and scientific societies are few in number and badly
                    supported, the principal one being the Royal Academy of Sciences, founded in
                    1779. The national printing office, a Government establishment, turns out
                    creditable work, but the booksellers’ shops are few and ill-stocked. Eight or
                    ten daily journals are published in Lisbon, and there are a few weekly
                    newspapers, besides periodicals appearing at longer intervals, and chiefly
                    devoted to special interests.</p>
                <p>Several cemeteries have been constructed of late years near Lisbon, the practice
                    of interring in churches having been abandoned. In the English cemetery lies the
                    English novelist Fielding, who died here in 1754; a marble sarcophagus with a
                    long Latin inscription covers his remains. The British residents maintain a
                    chaplain who performs service regularly in an adjacent chapel, and the Scottish
                    Presbyterians have also a place of meeting. The great hospital of S. José
                    contains beds for nine hundred patients, and the large lunatic asylum has
                    accommodation for four hundred patients. The Foundling Hospital takes in more
                    than two thousand children annually. At Belem is an excellent establishment
                    where a large number of male orphans and foundlings are fed, clothed, educated,
                    and taught various trades. The Lazaretto is a vast building on the south side of
                    the Tagus, where one thousand inmates can be received at one time.</p>
                <p>Lisbon is connected by railway with Madrid, and there is also a line northward to
                    Coimbra and Oporto, as well as lines southward to Setubal, Evora, and Beja.
                    Submarine cables connect it with England and with Brazil, There is communication
                    by regular lines of steamers with the Portuguese islands in the Atlantic and the
                    colonies in Africa, and with a great number of ports in Britain, continental
                    Europe, and other parts of the world. Lisbon is the largest port in the kingdom,
                    and its custom-house is a spacious and very substantial fire-proof building
                    worthy of any capital in Europe, in which merchants are allowed to deposit their
                    goods free of duty for a year, or for two years in the case of Brazilian
                    produce. The duties annually collected here exceed £1,150,000, tobacco alone
                    producing £400,000. Upwards of 1400 foreign vessels, and about 1100 Portuguese
                    ships, including coasters, enter the port annually. The annual imports amount to
                    about £5,600,000, and the exports to £4,500,000. A considerable number of
                    foreign merchants reside in Lisbon, and there are about fifty British firms. The
                    most active commerce is carried on with Brazil and Great Britain, tropical
                    produce being imported from the one, and manufactured goods from the other,
                    while wine and oil are sent to both in return. The wine for exportation is all
                    made and stored outside the city bounds, so as not to be subject to the octroi
                    duty. There are several joint-stock banks, one of them being British (the New
                    London and Brazilian Bank), as well as private bankers. Manufactures are carried
                    on only to a limited extent. The largest establishment by far is the tobacco
                    manufactory, where 1600 persons are employed, and three millions of pounds are
                    annually manufactured.</p>
                <p>The chief supply of water, for the use of the city is brought by an aqueduct 9
                    miles in length, from springs situated on the north-west. This work, one of the
                    boasts of Lisbon, was completed in 1738, and was so well executed that the great
                    earthquake did it no injury. It crosses the Alcantara valley on thirty-five
                    arches, the principal one being 263 feet above its base, with a span of 110
                    feet. On reaching the city the water is conducted into a covered massive stone
                    reservoir, which an inscription styles “urbis ornamentum orbis miraculum,” and
                    thence it flows to the fountains, thirty-one in number, distributed throughout
                    the city. From these fountains it is removed in barrels to the houses by
                    “Gallegos,” men from Galicia, who do the principal part of the hard work in
                    Lisbon. Although there are two other reservoirs near the city, the supply of
                    water is insufficient for the requirements of the place during the warm
                    season.</p>
                <p>For municipal purposes the city is divided into four districts <hi rend="italic"
                    >(farros),</hi> the whole under one municipal chamber, and two suburban
                    districts under separate chambers. The city chamber consists of twelve members
                    elected by the burgesses every two years. Its revenue is about £75,000. The
                    octroi duties, levied on provisions and fuel entering the city, are 'collected
                    on account of the Government, and exceed £270,000 a year. The police force is
                    paid by the Government, and consists of the municipal guard, a military force of
                    cavalry and infantry under the orders of the home secretary, and a body of
                    ordinary policemen at the orders of the civil governor, an official appointed by
                    Government. According to the census of 1878 the population in the thirty-nine
                    parishes of the city and suburbs was 253,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Notwithstanding the mildness of the climate,
                    Lisbon is not considered a healthy place of residence, owing chiefly to the
                    defective sanitary arrangements. The annual death-rate is 36 per thousand. The
                    deaths are said to exceed the births, and the population would therefore
                    decrease were the city not continually recruited from the country. To chest

                    on account of the frequent and rapid changes of temperature to which it is
                    subject. These changes, and the great difference between the temperature of sun
                    and shade during the winter and spring, are dangerous to the delicate. In summer
                    the heat is great, and all who have the means betake themselves during that
                    season to Cintra or to the seaside. The following data, deduced from twenty
                    years’ observations (1856 to 1875) taken at the Meteorological Observatory, a
                    well-managed institution which stands 335 feet above the level of the sea, will

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The name Lisbon (Portuguese, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lisboa.)</hi> is a modification of the ancient name Olisipo, also written
                    Ulyssippo under the influence of a mythical story of a city founded by Ulysses
                    in Iberia, which, however, according to Strabo, was placed by ancient tradition
                    rather in the mountains* of Turdetania. Under the Romans Olisipo became a
                    municipium with the epithet of Felicitas Julia, but was inferior in importance
                    to the less ancient Emerita Augusta (Merida). After the Romans the Goths and the
                    Moslems successively became masters of the town and district. Under the latter
                    the town bore in Arabic the name of Lashbûna or Oshbûna. It was the first point
                    of Moslem Spain attacked by the Normans in the invasion of 844. When Alphonso I.
                    of Portugal took advantage of the decline and fall of the Almoravid dynasty to
                    incorporate the provinces of Estremadura and Alemtejo in his new kingdom, Lisbon
                    was the last city of Portugal to fall into his hands, and yielded only after a
                    siege of several months (21st October 1147), with the aid of English and Flemish
                    crusaders who were on their way to Syria. In 1184 the city was again attacked by
                    the Moslems under the powerful caliph Abu Ya'kub, but the enterprise failed. In
                    the reign of Ferdinand I., the’greater part of the town was burned by the
                    Castilian army under Henry II. (1373), and in 1384 the Castilians again beseiged
                    Lisbon, but without success. Lisbon became the seat of an archbishop in 1390,
                    the seat of government in 1422. It gained much in wealth and splendour from the
                    maritime enterprises that began with the voyage of Vasco da Gama (1497). The
                    patriarchate dates from 1716. From 1586 to 1640 Lisbon was a provincial town
                    under Spain, and it was from this port that the Spanish Armada sailed in 1588.
                    In 1640 the town was captured by the duke of Braganza, and the independence of
                    the kingdom restored. For many centuries the city had suffered from earthquakes,
                    of more or less violence, but these had been almost forgotten when, on the 1st
                    of November 1755, it was reduced almost in an instant to a heap of ruins. A fire
                    broke out to complete the work of destruction, and between 30,000 and 40,000
                    persons lost their lives. Pombal, an unscrupulous minister, but a man of great
                    talent, applied himself with unremitting energy both to the protection of the
                    rights of property (for the place was infested by bands of robbers) and to the
                    reconstruction of the buildings. The handsomest part of the present city was
                    erected under his direction, but even to this day there are edifices which speak
                    forcibly of the great earthquake. In 1807 Napoleon proclaimed that the house of
                    Braganza had ceased to reign in Europe, whereupon the regent Don John (his
                    mother the reigning queen Maria I. having become insane) thought it prudent to
                    quit the country for Brazil, and next day a French army under Junot entered the
                    city, possession of which he retained for ten months. He then quietly embarked
                    his army under the protection of the inexplicable convention of Cintra so
                    disgraceful to the English generals. In 1859 Lisbon was stricken by yellow
                    fever, and many thousands were carried off before the plague was stayed. Lisbon
                    boasts of having been the birthplace of St Anthony, surnamed of Padua, of
                    Camoens, the national epic poet (to whose honour a bronze statue has been placed
                    in one of the squares), and of Pope John XXL (J. Y. J.)</p>
