                    (1713-1762), a zealous and successful astronomer, was born at Rumigny, near
                    Rheims, March 15, 1713. Left destitute by the death of his father, who held a
                    post in the household of the duchess of Vendôme, his theological studies at the
                    Collége de Lisieux in Paris were prosecuted at the expense of the duke of
                    Bourbon. After he had taken deacon’s orders, however, he devoted himself
                    exclusively to science, and, through the patronage of Cassini, obtained
                    employment, first in surveying the coast from Nantes to Bayonne, then, in 1739,
                    in remeasuring the French arc of the meridian. The success of this difficult
                    operation, which occupied two years, and achieved the correction of the
                    anomalous result obtained by the elder Cassini in 1684, was mainly due to
                    Lacaille’s industry and skill. He was rewarded by admission to the Academy, and
                    the appointment of mathematical professor in Mazarin college, where he worked
                    diligently for some years in a small observatory fitted up for his use. His
                    desire to observe the southern heavens led him to propose, in 1750, an
                    astronomical expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, which was officially
                    sanctioned, and fortunately executed (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Astronomy,</hi>
                    vol. ii. p. 757). On his return in 1754 he was distressed to find himself an
                    object of public attention, and withdrew to his former retreat in Mazarin
                    college, where he died, March 21, 1762, of an attack of gout aggravated by
                    unremitting toil. Lalande said of him that, during a comparatively short life,
                    he had made more observations and calculations than all the astronomers of his
                    time put together. And, his carefulness equalling his rapidity, the quality of
                    his work rivalled its quantity. The rectitude of his moral character earned him
                    universal respect, and his career ranks, if not amongst the most brilliant,
                    amongst the most useful and honourable in the annals of science.</p>

                    eighteen hundred years were inserted in Part de vérifier les dates, 1750; he
                    communicated to the Academy in 1755 a classed catalogue of forty-two southern
                    nebulae, and gave in vol. ii. of his Éphéméridcs, 1754, practical rules for the
                    employment of the lunar method of longitudes, proposing in his additions to
                    Bouguer’s Traité de Navigation, 1760, the model of a nautical almanac.</p>
