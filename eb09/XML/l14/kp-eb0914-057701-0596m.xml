                    the tympanum, so Light may be defined by the mechanical effect produced upon the
                    extension of the optic nerve which forms the sensitive surface of the
                    retina.</p>
                <p>In treating of Light it will be convenient to use the term in a sort of mixed
                    sense, at least until we come to discuss the different theories which have been
                    devised to account for the propagation of the agent which causes vision. Then we
                    shall have to use the term entirely in the objective sense. On the other hand,
                    in Physiological Optics we are concerned chiefly with the subjective sense of
                    the term.</p>

                    Optics, so far as it can be treated by the help of elementary mathematics, but
                    with sufficient detail to show the connexion of its various branches, and to
                    enable the reader who desires further information on any point to judge for

                    connexion between light and radiant heat will be discussed under <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Radiation.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Early History of the
                    Subject.</hi> —It is to sight that we are mainly indebted for our knowledge of
                    external things. All our other senses together, except under very special
                    conditions, do not furnish us with a tithe of the information we gain by a
                    single glance. And sight is also that one of our senses which we are able most
                    effectively and extensively to aid by the help uf proper apparatus— not merely
                    (as by spectacles, invented <hi rend="italic">circa</hi> 1300) for the cure of
                    natural defects, but (as by the telescope and microscope) for the examination of
                    bodies either too distant or too minute to be studied by the unassisted eye.</p>
                <p>It is very remarkable, under these circumstances, to find how slowly men have
                    reached some even of the simplest facts of optics. We can easily understand how
                    constant experience must have forced on them the conviction that light usually
                    moves in straight lines,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that we see an object in
                    the direction in which it really lies. But how they could have believed for ages
                    that objects are rendered visible by something projected from the eye itself—so
                    that the organ of sight was supposed to be analogous to the tentacula of
                    insects, and sight itself a mere species of touch —is most puzzling. They seem
                    not till about 350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> tc have even raised·the
                    question—If this is how we see, why cannot we see in the dark? or, more
                    simply,—What it darkness? The former of these questions seems to have been first
                    put by Aristotle.</p>
                <p>The nature and laws of reflexion were, of course, forced on the ancients by the
                    images seen in still water; and the geometers of the Platonic school were well
                    acquainted with these laws. To Hero of Alexandria we owe the important deduction
                    from them that the course of a reflected ray is the shortest possible.</p>
                <p>The general nature of refraction also was known, with some of its special
                    applications, such as, for instance, to burning-glasses and to magnifiers. These
                    were probably either spherical glass shells filled with water (Pliny, 2Z.A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>., xxxvi. 67 [25]; Lact., <hi rend="italic">De Ira
                    Dei,</hi> c. 10) or balls of rock crystal (Pliny, xxxvii. 10).</p>
                <p>In the first century of our era Cleomedes pointed out how a coin at the bottom of
                    an empty cup, where the eye cannot see it, can be made visible by filling the
                    cup with water; and he showed that, in a similar way, the air may render the sun
                    visible to us while it is still under the horizon. Shortly after this date
                    Ptolemy (the celebrated astronomer) published his great work on <hi
                    rend="italic">Optics.</hi> He treats of vision, reflexion, the theory of plane
                    and concave mirrors, and refraction. He measured, with considerable accuracy,
                    the angles of incidence and refraction, for rays passing from air into water and
                    into glass, and from water into glass; it was not, however, till more than
                    fifteen hundred years had passed that the true relation between these angles was
                    discovered. In addition to what has just been mentioned, the ancients’ knowledge
                    of optics was limited to a very superficial acquaintance with some of the
                    properties of rainbows, halos, mirage, Ä’c. But it was fragmentary in the
                    extreme—though it far surpassed in amount as well as in accuracy their knowledge
                    of the other branches of physical science.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to understand the ideas of the ancients about colour. That it is a
                    property of a body—just as its density, its hardness, or its smell is a
                    property—was probably held by them. But they also imagined that a body could
                    communicate its colour to light; thus, for instance, the clouds were, bv some of
                    them, sunoosed <pb break="no"

                    which form a rainbow.</p>

                    treatise on optics in Arabic, which for five hundred years or more was a
                    recognized authority on the subject. It was, in many parts, founded on the work
                    of Ptolemy, but with considerable additions and improvements. Alhazen gives an
                    anatomical description of the eye, and points out, fairly enough, how with two
                    eyes we see only one image. But he also points out that we see each object,
                    however small, <hi rend="italic">∖yya.pencil</hi> of diverging rays,—not (as the
                    ancients imagined) by a single ray. Alhazen accounts for twilight, and shows how
                    by it to measure the height of the atmosphere. He also gives the now generally
                    received explanation of the curious fact that the sun and moon appear larger
                    when rising or setting than when they are high in the heavens.</p>
                <p>The farther progress of the subject we need not now trace. From the end of 16th
                    century that progress has been extremely rapid. The dates of the more important
                    steps, and the names of their authors, will be given when we treat of these, in
                    their turn, in the course of the article; and we will give them the additional
                    interest of being presented, when this can readily be done, in the author’s own
                    words.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Preliminary Statements.</hi> —Before we commence a more
                    rigorous treatment of the subject, it may be well to make a few preliminary
                    statements as to the nature of <hi rend="italic">vision</hi> and the conditions
                    for <hi rend="italic">distinct vision.</hi> Properly speaking, these belong to
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics (Physiological)</hi> (g.v.), but it is impossible to
                    treat intelligibly any part of our subject without presupposing some, generally
                    very slight, knowledge of other parts. And the few preliminary statements we
                    have now to make are in no respect theoretical, while they are so simple that
                    any one may at once test their truth for himself.</p>
                <p>Except in the case of a very abnormal eye (extremely short-sighted or
                    long-sighted as the case may be) there is a distance from it—usually somewhere
                    about 10 inches— at which if an object be placed it is seen more distinctly than
                    if placed at any other distance. Almost every one, perhaps without knowing it,
                    habitually places at or about that distance from his eye an object which he
                    wishes to examine carefully. When he.places it at a smaller distance he becomes
                    conscious of the <hi rend="italic">effort</hi> required to see it distinctly. He
                    has, in fact, to alter the form of the optical machinery of the eye, by a
                    muscular effort, so that it may become capable of bringing to a focus on the
                    retina rays more divergent than those for which the parts were in their
                    unstrained state adapted. A corresponding effort, but usually much more slight,
                    is commonly felt to be required if the object be at a distance greater than 10
                    inches.</p>
                <p>Hence we arrive at the conclusion that, for the minimum of strain on the eye,
                    rays should fall on it diverging as if they came from a peint about 10 inches
                    distant. But for all ordinary eyes any divergence from double of this <hi
                    rend="italic">Ci.e.,</hi> divergence as if from a distance of <hi rend="italic"
                    >5</hi> inches) to zero <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> parallel rays) is
                    consistent with the possibility of distinct vision. Rays either more divergent
                    than the former limit, or convergent, are unfit to produce distinct vision.
                    Hence every optical instrument, whatever be the reflexions or refractions to
                    which light has been subjected in passing through it, must finally allow the
                    light to escape either in parallel rays or with a divergence within the above
                    specified limits, if it is to be employed by an ordinary eye. The comparatively
                    slight differences which exist among ordinary eyes are easily compensated by the
                    rack-work, or screw adjustment, which is invariably attached to the eye-piece of
                    a good telescope and to the body of a good microscope. Every motion of this
                    rack-work alters the divergence of the rays as they finally escape from the
                    instrument Any eye, however abnormal, if it be capable of producing distinct
                    vision at all, has only to be furnished with suitable spectacles in order that
                    it may behave exactly as does a normal eye. This statement, however, refers only
                    to sharpness of definition, not in any degree to <hi rend="italic">colour.</hi>
                    The deficiency which causes <hi rend="italic">colour-blindness</hi> cannot be
                    supplied by any conceivable process. A definite part of the ordinary organ of
                    vision is wanting (or inactive) in such cases— while the merely optical parts of
                    the eye are usually in perfect order.</p>
                <p>Another fact which must be stated here is that, to produce vision of a body in
                    its natural position, the image on the retina, as seen from the back, must be
                    inverted—not merely as regards up and down, but also as regards right and left.
                    Thus, in the ordinary astronomical telescope, the image on the retina is not
                    inverted, and we therefore see an inverted image.</p>
                <p>A third is that our judgment of the relative distances of objects is formed
                    mainly by the use of the two eyes simultaneously. One eye, kept still, can
                    inform us only of relative distance in virtue of the greater or less effort to
                    see distinctly (already spoken of). With both eyes, or with one eye moved from
                    side to side, <hi rend="italic">parallax</hi> comes in, and gives us the <hi
                    rend="italic">stereoscopic</hi> effect, as it is called. This power of judging
                    distance is, of course, greater as the eyes are set more widely apart. There is,
                    practically, no limit to the effective distance between the eyes when the proper
                    instrumental methods (as with the telestereoscope) are employed.</p>
                <p>It is also necessary to premise a few words about colour. The various homogeneous
                    rays of the solar spectrum have each a colour of its own which no refraction can
                    modify. But what about the many colours which do not occur in the spectrum? To
                    such a question as “What is <hi rend="italic">yellow” 1</hi> the answer is, “<hi
                    rend="italic">Each particular kind of yellow may be any one of an infinite
                    number of different combinations of homogeneous rays.”</hi> And the same is
                    true, in general, of all other colours. Clerk Maxwell found that a yellow
                    equivalent to that of the spectrum can be obtained by mixing in proper
                    proportions certain homogeneous red and green rays. This single example is
                    sufficient to show that the coloursense is of a very singular nature. This
                    question will be fully treated in <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics
                    (Physiological)</hi>; but for our present purpose it is only necessary to say
                    that we now know (after Wünsch and Young) that the normal eye has only <hi
                    rend="italic">three colour-sensations—</hi> a red, a green, and a violet,—and
                    that the apparent colour of any light which falls on it depends merely on the
                    <hi rend="italic">relative intensities of the excitement</hi> produced by the
                    light on the three organs of sense corresponding to these sensations. This is
                    true, however, only within certain limits of intensity; for extremely bright
                    light, whatever be its real colour, seems to excite all the three sensations
                    simultaneously, much as white light does; and with very feeble light (as, for
                    instance, that of an ordinary aurora or of a lunar rainbow) we are sometimes
                    scarcely conscious of <pb break="no"

                    imperfect. The most common form, Daltonism, depends on the absence of the red
                    sense. Great additions to our knowledge of this subject, if only in confirmation
                    of results already deduced from theory, have been obtained in the last few years
                    by Holmgren<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ρrοc. Roy. Soc.,</hi> Jan. 1881.</p></note>; who has experimented
                    on two persons, each of whom was found to have one colour-blind eye, the other
                    being nearly normal. In this way was obtained, what could otherwise have been
                    matter of conjecture only, a description of colour-blind vision in terms of (at
                    least approximately) normal vision.</p>
                <p>Finally, the sensation of sight is not limited to the duration of the mechanical
                    action on the eye. It is known that we do not see a sudden flash (an electric
                    spark for instance) until a measurable, though very short, period has elapsed.
                    This depends on the rate at which an excitation is propagated along the optic
                    nerve. But the familiar experiment of whirling a red-hot stick in a dark room
                    shows that the sensation of sight lasts for a short period after the mechanical
                    action which produced it has ceased. This period is probably different for
                    different eyes, and for different amounts of excitement even in the same eye.
                    (If the light be very intense the effect lasts much longer, but completely
                    changes its character.) For our present purpose it may be assumed that the
                    duration is somewhere about ⅜th of a second. Thus, if the end of the red-hot
                    stick describes a circle once in γth of a second, we see the complete circle; if
                    in a longer period, we only see at once such a part of it as was described in
                    4∙th of a second. Connected with this is the remarkable result obtained
                    experimentally by Swan,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi> 1849, 1861.</p></note> that
                    the amount of sensation is, for flashes of short duration, directly
                    proportional, not only to the brightness of the flash, but also to its duration.
                    A flash which lasts for <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript">

                    the eye; but an electric spark, as a flash of lightning, which certainly does

                    motion, or of change of form, which would present it to the eye in these
                    successive positions or forms. Thus, a tadpole may be represented as wriggling

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sources of Light.</hi> —This subject will be fully treated
                    in other parts of this work under various heads: from the purely scientific
                    point of view under <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiation</hi>; from the more practical
                    side under <hi rend="smallcaps">Lighting</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(Electric),</hi> àc. For our present purpose a very brief summary of the
                    question will suffice; and we do not require to investigate the <hi
                    rend="italic">process</hi> by which, in any case, the light is produced.</p>
                <p>1. The main source of light is <hi rend="italic">incandescence.</hi> (It is
                    usually understood that to be incandescent a body must be at a high
                    temperature.) This may be due to any of a number of causes, such as the
                    following :—</p>
                <p>(a) <hi rend="italic">The Potential Energy of Gravitation of Scattered Fragments
                    of Matter.—</hi> When these fall together, as in the formation of the sun and
                    stars, heat enough is generated by impact to render the whole vividly
                    incandescent. It is probable that the light of nebulae, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">proper</hi> light of comets, is due to this cause. The proximate
                    cause, in all these cases, is the kinetic energy of the fragments before impact.
                    To this class, therefore, can be reduced the light given out when a target is
                    struck by a cannon shot.</p>
                <p>(δ) <hi rend="italic">The Kinetic Energy of Cutrent Electricity or of an Electric
                    Discharge.—</hi> Here we have lightning, the electric light, and probably also
                    the light of the aurora.</p>
                <p>(c) <hi rend="italic">The Potential Energy of Chemical Affinity.—</hi> The
                    lime-light, gas-light, candle and lamp-light, fire-light, the magnesium light,
                    &amp;c.; also phosphorus, dead fish (1), &lt;fcc., glowing in the dark.</p>
                <p>(&lt;7) <hi rend="italic">Friction,</hi> as in the trains of sparks from a
                    grindstone or brake; though here, in general, chemical affinity also has a
                    share.</p>
                <p>(e) <hi rend="italic">Sudden great Compression of a Gas,</hi> as of air by
                    meteoric stones and falling stars.</p>
                <p>2. Another very curious source, not (so far as is known) reducible to
                    incandescence, is <hi rend="italic">the giving out (^usually in an
                    altered</hi><hi rend="italic">form')</hi><hi rend="italic">of light previously
                    absorbed</hi>:—fluorescence, phosphorescence, &lt;fcc.</p>
                <p>3. A third source is <hi rend="italic">physiological</hi>:—fire-flies, glowworms,
                    <hi rend="italic">Medusae,</hi> dead fish (?), &lt;fcc., the eye of a cat.</p>
                <p>Any not black and not transparent body, exposed to any of these sources of light,
                    becomes in its turn what may for our purpose also be treated as a source.</p>
                <p>As will be shown in <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiation,</hi> the only bodies which,
                    when incandescent, give <hi rend="italic">every</hi> constituent of white light
                    are bodies which are black in the sense of absorbing each and every ray which
                    falls upon them. Such bodies are not <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi>
                    solids—though the best examples we have of them are lamp-black, and (somewhat
                    less perfect) charcoal and gas-coke.</p>
                <p>Newton’s speculations on these subjects, taken from the “Queries” at the end of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi> give an exceedingly interesting sketch of the
                    state of this subject in his time. We quote a few of the more curious. There is
                    a strange admixture of errors, but a still more strange anticipation of some of
                    the most important of modern discoveries.</p>
                <p>“Query 6. Do not Black bodies conceive heat more easily from light than those of
                    other colours do, by reason that the light falling on them is not reflected
                    outwards; but enters the bodies, and is often reflected and refracted within
                    them, until it be stifled and lost?</p>
                <p>“Query 8. Do not all Fixed bodies, when heated beyond a certain degree, emit
                    light and shine; and is not this emission performed by the vibrating motions of
                    their Parts. And do not all bodies, which abound with Terrestrial parts, and
                    especially with Sulphureous ones, emit light, as often as those Parts are
                    sufficiently agitated; whether that agitation be made by heat, or by friction,
                    or percussion, or putrefaction, or by any vital motion, or any other cause? . .
                    . .</p>
                <p>“Query 9. Is not Fire a body heated so hot, as to emit light copiously? For what
                    else is a red hot iron than fire? And what else is a burning coal than red hot
                    wood?</p>
                <p>“Query 10. Is not Flame a vapour, fume or exhalation heated red hot, that is, so
                    hot as to shine? For bodies do not flame without emitting a copious fume, and
                    this fume burns in the flame. The <hi rend="italic">Ignis Fαtτιus</hi> is a
                    vapour shining without heat; and is there not the same difference between this
                    vapour and flame, as between rotted wood shining without heat and burning coals
                    of fire? In distilling hot spirits, if the head of the still be taken off, the
                    vapour, which ascends out of the still, will take fire at the flame of a candle,
                    and turn into flame, and the flame will run along the vapour from the candle to
                    the still. Some bodies heated by motion or fermentation, if the heat grow
                    intense, fume copiously; and if the heat be great enough, the fumes will shine,
                    and become flame. Metals in fusion do not flame for Avant of a copious fume,
                    except spelter, which fumes copiously, and thereby flames. All flaming bodies,
                    as oil, tallow, wax, wood, fossil coals, pitch, sulphur, by flaming waste and
                    vanish into burning smoke; which smoke, if the flame be put out, is very thick
                    and visible, and sometimes smells strongly, but in the flame loses its smell by
                    burning; and, according to the nature of the smoke, the flame is of several
                    colours; as that of sulphur, blue; that of copper opened with sublimate, green;
                    that of tallow, yellow; that of camphire, white. Smoke passing through flame
                    cannot but grow red hot; and red hot smoke can have no other appearance than
                    that of flame</p>
                <p>“Query 11. Do not Great bodies conserve their heat the longest, their parts
                    heating one another; and may not Great dense and Fixed bodies, when heated
                    beyond a certain degree, emit light so <pb break="no"

                    its light, and the reflexions and refractions of its rays within its pores, to
                    grow still hotter, till it comes to a certain period of heat, such as is that of
                    the sun? And are not the sun and fixed stars great earths vehemently hot; whose
                    heat is conserved by the greatness of the bodies, and the mutual action and
                    re-action between them, and the light which they emit; and whose parts are kept
                    from fuming away, not only by their Fixity, but also by the vast weight and
                    density of the atmospheres incumbent upon them, and very strongly compressing
                    them, and condensing the vapours and exhalations which arise from them? .... And
                    the same great weight may condense those vapours and exhalations, as soon as
                    they shall at any time begin to ascend from the sun, and make them presently
                    fall back again into him; and by that action increase his heat, much after the
                    manner that in our earth the air increases the heat of a culinary fire. And the
                    same weight may hinder the globe of the sun from being diminished, unless by the
                    emission of light, and a very small quantity of vapours and exhalations.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Theories of Propagation of Light.</hi> —We may begin by
                    assuming that the sensation of light is due to a mechanical action on the retina
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Eye).</hi> Now such a mechanical action must have a
                    mechanical cause, and, as far as we can judge with our present knowledge, the
                    latter must consist of impacts on the retina, due to moving matter. This matter
                    may have travelled all the way from the source of light, or it may have been set
                    in motion in the eye by a disturbance (analogous to a wave) which has travelled
                    from the source. What is transferred, or what moves, is a quite independent
                    question. Light must, as far as we can conceive, consist in the motion of
                    particles of some kind from external objects to the eye, or in the propagation
                    of some disturbance or wavemotion in an as yet unknown medium. Though it has
                    been proved, as we will presently show, that some of the consequences of the
                    first supposition are entirely inconsistent with observed facts, the nature of
                    the propagation of the supposed luminous particles is still a very interesting
                    study, and indeed many of the fundamental propositions in optics follow more
                    easily from this hypothesis than from the other. We will therefore <hi
                    rend="italic">not</hi> at present dismiss this hypothesis, but will refer freely
                    to it now and then, until its truth is shown to be inconsistent with
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>This view, associated with the names of Newton, Laplace, and Biot, is known as
                    the <hi rend="italic">corpuscular theory</hi> of light. A formidable objection
                    to it, <hi rend="italic">in limine,</hi> will be easily seen to be furnished by
                    the velocity of light. Since every point of every visible body must (on this
                    theory) send such corpuscles to the eye, moving as we shall find at a rate of
                    nearly 200,000 miles per second, their masses must be inconceivably minute in
                    order that their united momentum may not amount to something comparable with
                    that of a cannon shot, a supposition of course utterly destructive of all belief
                    in the hypothesis. But, as we shall see, there are still higher grounds of
                    objection, and such as no mere smallness of mass or size of each corpuscle can
                    explain away.</p>
                <p>The rival theory labours under considerable disadvantages, inasmuch as the theory
                    of wave-propagation is very much more obscure and difficult than that of the
                    motion of free particles; but the student, who has mastered the fundamental
                    difficulties of sound (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics),</hi> which presents
                    a fair although not an exact analogy, will find it comparatively easy to obtain
                    a clear conception of the fundamental principles of the explanation offered by
                    the <hi rend="italic">undulatory theory</hi> of light.</p>
                <p>The difference between these two theories of light may be illustrated by
                    contrasting wind moving at the rate of 1100 feet per second (an inconceivably
                    violent hurricane) and sound, gentle or violent, moving at precisely the same
                    rate—yet how different in its effects!</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Division of the Subject.</hi> —Optics, or the science of
                    Light, is usually divided into two parts. A simple illustration of the nature of
                    this division will be found in the different conditions of fluid equilibrium
                    according as we do not or do introduce the idea of action between the fluid and
                    the containing vessel <hi rend="smallcaps">(Capillary Action,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.vf.</hi> In the first or hypothetical case it is known that the
                    free surface must be horizontal, and that all its separate parts must lie in the

                    molecular action modifying these results, sometimes indeed to a very large

                    are at the same level. So in what is called <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometrical

                    agrees with experiment in showing that under certain circumstances a ray of
                    light bends round an obstacle. But as, in obtaining the main facts of fluid
                    equilibrium, capillary forces may be neglected, so, for the explanation of the
                    ordinary phenomena of light, even with accuracy sufficient for the construction
                    of the very finest telescopes and microscopes, it suffices that Geometrical
                    Optics, based on laws <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> verified by experiment, be
                    followed out to its consequences. The residual phenomena then came in to be
                    treated by the undulatory theory. Pouillet divides the subject, in consequence
                    of this distinction, into two parts, viz., (1) that in which we deal with the
                    direction only of the rays, and (2) that in which we deal with the physical
                    properties of the rays themselves.</p>
                <p>In this order we will consider the subject, giving the explanations of the
                    approximate experimental laws of Geometrical Optics, as we reach them, in the
                    language of either theory. But before we come to the residual phenomena we shall
                    have found that the corpuscular theory must be rejected, and we will therefore
                    give, without detail, the principles of the undulatory explanation, which will
                    be fully discussed in a special article.</p>

                <p>It is approximately true that, in any homogeneous medium, <hi rend="italic">light
                    moves in straight lines.</hi></p>
                <p>If an opaque body be placed anywhere in the straight line between the eye and an
                    object, the object is concealed. Through a long straight tube no objects can be
                    seen but those situated in the direction of its axis produced. This is so
                    fundamental a fact, or it is so evident a result of experience, that it is the
                    foundation of every process which involves the direction in space of one object
                    as regards another,—whether it be for the aiming with a rifle, the pointing of a
                    telescope, or for the delicate observations of a geodetic survey. But we must
                    carefully observe the restrictions under which the statement is made. Not merely
                    is it said to be only approximately true, but it is so only in a homogeneous
                    medium. To both of these restrictions we will revert later.</p>
                <p>(a) On this is founded the geometrical theory of <hi rend="italic">shadoιοs,</hi>
                    —a subject of some importance, especially as regards eclipses. In this
                    application the results may be considered as absolutely true, though, as we
                    shall see in a subsequent page, the statement is liable in certain delicate
                    cases to somewhat startling exceptions. When an opaque body is placed between a
                    screen and a luminous <hi rend="italic">point,</hi> it casts a shadow on the
                    screen. (The sun’s image formed by a lens or burning glass of short focus is our
                    best mode of attempting to realize the conception of a luminous point; but a
                    fair approximation may be made by piercing a very small needle-hole in a large
                    plate of thin metal, and placing it close to any bright flame or incandescent
                    body.) The outline of the shadow is, of course, to be found by drawing straight
                    lines from the luminous point so as to touch the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n600/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0600-0581"/> opaque body all round. These lines form a cone.
                    The points of contact form a line on the opaque body separating the illuminated
                    from the non-illuminated portion of its surface. Similarly, when these lines are
                    produced to meet the screen, their points of intersection with it form a line
                    which separates the illuminated from the non-illuminated parts of the
                    screen.</p>
                <p>This line is called the boundary of the <hi rend="italic">geometrical
                    shadow.</hi> A common but beautiful instance of it is seen when a very small
                    gas-jet is burning in a ground-glass shade, near the wall of a room. In this
                    case the cone, above mentioned, is usually a right cone with its axis vertical.
                    Thus the boundary of the geometric shadow is a portion of a circle on the roof,
                    but a portion of an hyperbola on the vertical wall. If the roof be not
                    horizontal, we may obtain in this way any form of conic section. Interesting and
                    useful hints in <hi rend="italic">projection</hi> may be obtained by observing
                    the shadows of bodies of various forms cast in this way by rays which virtually
                    diverge from one point: <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> how to place a plane
                    quadrilateral of given form so that its geometric shadow may be a square; how to
                    place an elliptic disk, with a small hole in it, so that the shadow may be
                    circular with a bright spot at its centre, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>When there are more luminous points than one, we have only to draw separately the
                    geometrical shadows due to each of the sources, and then superpose them. A new
                    consideration now comes in. There will be, in general, portions of all the
                    separate geometrical shadows which overlap one another in some particular
                    regions of the screen. In such regions we still have full shadow; but around
                    them there will be other regions, some illuminated by one of the sources alone,
                    some by two, tfcc., until finally we come to the parts of the screen which are
                    illuminated directly by all the sources. There will evidently be still a
                    definite boundary of the parts wholly unilluminated, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the true shadow or <hi rend="italic">umbra,</hi> and also a definite
                    boundary of the parts wholly illuminated. The region between these boundaries—
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the partially illumined portion—is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">penumbra.</hi></p>
                <p>Fig. 1 shows these things very well. It represents the shadow of a circular disk
                    cast by four equal luminous points arranged as the corners of a square,—the disk
                    being large enough to admit of a free overlapping of the separate shadows. The
                    amount of want of illumination in each portion of the penumbra is roughly
                    indicated by the shading. The separate shadows are circular, if the disk is
                    parallel to the screen. If we suppose the number of sources to increase
                    indefinitely, so as finally to give the appearance of a luminous <hi
                    rend="italic">surface</hi> as the source of light, it is obvious that the
                    degrees of darkness at different portions of the penumbra will also increase
                    indefinitely; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> there will be a gradual increase of
                    brightness in the penumbra from total darkness at the edge next the geometrical
                    shadow to full illumination at the outer edge. It is most instructive to
                    contrast with the above figure that now given (fig. 2), in which the size of the
                    disk is considerably diminished — everything else being unchanged. Here there is
                    no true shadow·—only four <hi rend="italic">equally bright</hi> portions of the
                    penumbra, each illuminated by three of the sources.</p>
                <p>Thus we see at once why the shadows cast by the sun or moon are in general so
                    much less sharp than those cast by the electric light (when it is not surrounded
                    by a semiopaque screen). For, practically, at moderate distances from the
                    electric arc, it appears as a mere luminous point. But, if we place a body at a
                    distance of a foot or two only from the arc, the shadow cast will have as much
                    of penumbra as if the sun had been the source. The breadth of the penumbra when
                    the source and screen are nearly equidistant from the opaque body is equal to
                    the diameter of the luminous source. Simple as is the question from the point of
                    view we have adopted, it may to some persons appear simpler to imagine
                    themselves placed (as spectators) on the screen in different parts of the shadow
                    or penumbra, and to consider what portions of the luminous source they would
                    then be in a position to see.</p>
                <p>This is what happens to us when we observe an eclipse of the sun. When the
                    eclipse is total, there is a real geometrical shadow,—very small compared with
                    the penumbra (for the <hi rend="italic">apparent</hi> diameters of the sun and
                    moon are nearly equal, but their distances are as 370: 1); when the eclipse is
                    annular, the shadow is all penumbra. In a lunar eclipse, on the other hand, the
                    earth is the shadowcasting body, and the moon is the screen, and we observe
                    things according to our first point of view.</p>
                <p>Suppose, next, that the body which casts the shadow is a large one, such as a
                    wall, with a hole in it. If we were to plug the hole, the whole screen would be
                    in geometrical shadow. Hence the illumination of the screen by the light passing
                    through the hole is precisely what would be cut off by a disk which fits the
                    hole Fig. 3, which is the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n601/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0601-0582"/> complement of fig. 1, gives therefore the effect
                    of four equal sources of light shining on a wall through a circular hole. And it
                    is evident that, with the change of a word here and there, the previous
                    reasoning may be applied to this case also. The umbra in the former case becomes
                    the fully illuminated portion, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> The
                    penumbra remains the penumbra, but it is now darkest where before it was
                    brightest, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> For further information we
                    subjoin the complement (fig. 4) of the second case above,—the same four sources,
                    but the smaller hole. Here we have four <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> bright,
                    separate images</p>
                <p>—one belonging to each of the sources. Thus we see how, when a <hi rend="italic"
                    >small</hi> hole is cut in the window-shutter of a dark room, a picture of the
                    sun, and bright clouds about it, is formed on the opposite wall. This picture is
                    obviously inverted, and also perverted, for not only are objects depicted lower
                    the higher they are, but also objects seen to the right are depicted to the
                    left, &amp;c. But it will be seen unperverted (though still inverted) if it be
                    received on a sheet of ground glass and looked at from behind. The smaller the
                    hole (so far at least as Geometrical Optics is concerned) the less confused will
                    the picture be. As the hole is made larger the illuminated portions from
                    different sources gradually overlap; and when the hole bec6mes a <hi
                    rend="italic">window</hi> we have no indications of such a picture except from a
                    body (like the sun) much brighter than the other external objects. Here the
                    picture has ceased to be one of the sun, it is now a picture of the window. But
                    if the wall could be placed 100 miles off, the picture would be one of the sun.
                    To prevent this overlapping of images, and yet to admit a good deal of light, is
                    one main object of the lens which usually forms part of the camera obscura.</p>
                <p>The formation of pictures of the sun in this way is well seen on a calm sunny day
                    under trees, where the sunlight penetrating through small chinks forms elliptic
                    spots on the ground. During a partial eclipse these pictures have, of course, a
                    crescent form. When detached clouds are drifting rapidly across the sun, we
                    often seethe shadows of the bars of the window on the walls or floor suddenly
                    shifted by an inch or two, and for a moment very much more sharply defined. They
                    are, in fact, shadows cast by a <hi rend="italic">small</hi> portion of the
                    sun’s limb, from opposite sides alternately. Another beautiful illustration is
                    easily obtained by cutting with a sharp knife a <hi rend="italic">very
                    small</hi> T aperture in a piece of note paper. Place this close to the eye, and
                    an inch or so behind it place another piece of paper with a fine needle-hole in
                    it. The light of the sky passing through the needle-hole forms a bright picture
                    of the T on the retina. The eye perceives this picture, which gives the
                    impression of the T much magnified, but <hi rend="italic">turned upside
                    doινn.</hi></p>
                <p>Another curious phenomenon may fitly be referred to in this connexion, viz., the
                    <hi rend="italic">phantoms</hi> which are seen when we look at two parallel sets
                    of palisades or railings, one behind the other, or look through two parallel
                    sides of a meat-safe formed of perforated zinc. The appearance presented is that
                    of a magnified set of bars or apertures which appear to move rapidly as we
                    slowly walk past. Their origin is the fact that where the bars appear nearly to
                    coincide the apparent gaps bear the greatest ratio to the dark spaces; <hi
                    rend="italic">he.,</hi> these parts of the field are the most highly
                    illuminated. The exact determination of the appearances in any given case is a
                    mere problem of convergents to a continued fraction. But the fact that the
                    apparent rapidity of motion of this phantom may exceed in any ratio that of the
                    spectator is of importance,— enabling us to see how velocities, apparently of
                    impossible magnitude, may be accounted for by the mere running along of <hi
                    rend="italic">the condition of visibility</hi> among a group of objects no one
                    of which is moving at an extravagant rate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">{b)</hi> Another important consequence of this law is that <hi
                    rend="italic">if the medium be transparent the intensity of illumination which a
                    luminous point can produce on a white surface directly exposed to it is
                    inversely as the square of the distance.</hi></p>
                <p>The word transparent implies that no light is absorbed or stopped. Whatever,
                    therefore, leaves the source of light must in succession pass through each of a
                    series of spherical surfaces described round the source as centre. The same <hi
                    rend="italic">amount</hi> of light falls perpendicularly on all these surfaces
                    in succession. The amount received in a given time by a unit of surface on each
                    is therefore inversely as the number of such units in each. But the surfaces of
                    spheres are as the squares of their radii,—whence the proposition. (We assume
                    here that the velocity of light is constant in the medium, and that the source
                    gives out its light uniformly and not by fits and starts.) When the rays fall
                    otherwise than perpendicularly on the surface, the illumination produced is
                    proportional to the cosine of the obliquity; for the area seen under a given
                    spherical angle increases as the secant of the obliquity, the distance remaining
                    the same.</p>
                <p>As a corollary to this we have the further proposition that <hi rend="italic">the
                    apparent brightness of a luminous surface {seen through a transparent
                    homogeneous medium) is the same at all distances.</hi></p>
                <p>The word brightness is here taken as a measure of the amount of light falling on
                    the pupil per unit of spherical angle subtended by the luminous surface. The
                    spherical angle subtended by any small surface whose plane is at right angles to
                    the line of sight is inversely as the square of the distance. So also is the
                    light received from it. Hence the brightness is the same at all distances.</p>
                <p>The word brightness is often used (even scientifically) in another sense from
                    that just defined. Thus we speak of a bright star, of the question—When is Venus
                    at its brightest! &lt;kc. Strictly, such expressions are not defensible except
                    for sources of light which (like a star) have no apparent surface, so that we
                    cannot tell from what amount of spherical angle their light appears to come. In
                    that case the spherical angle is, for want of knowledge, assumed to be the same
                    for all, and therefore the brightness of each is now estimated in terms of the
                    <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> quantity of light we receive from it. It is in this
                    sense only that we use the word when we speak of Venus at its brightest; for if
                    we take the former definition of brightness the solution of this once celebrated
                    problem would be very different from that usually given. As the questiori,
                    however, is an interesting one both in itself and historically, we give an
                    approximate solution of it. The approximation assumes what is certainly not
                    true, that the illuminated portion of Venus always appears <hi rend="italic"
                    >uniformly</hi> bright, and of the same degree of brightness in all aspects.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">α</hi> be the radius of the earth’s orbit, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> that of the orbit of Venus, δ the distance between the

                <p>Then if <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be the apparent angular distance of the earth

                <p>Substituting for cos <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and putting the differential

                <p>From this the other quantities can be calculated.</p>
                <p>But another matter has to be taken into consideration when we apply the above
                    definition of brightness in practice. For the aperture of the pupil is usually
                    very much contracted when we look at a brightly illuminated sky or cloud. Thus
                    there is a rough compensation which, to a certain extent, modifies the effect on
                    the retina.</p>
                <p>Founded on the above is Cheseaux’s celebrated argument about the finite
                    dimensions of the stellar universe. For it is easy to see, as below, that if
                    stars be scattered through infinite space, with average closeness and brightness
                    such as is presented by those nearest us, and if stellar space be absolutely
                    transparent, the whole sky should appear of a brightness like that of the sun.
                    Cheseaux and Olbers endeavoured to show that, because the sky is not all over as
                    bright as the sun, there is absorption of light in stellar space. This idea was
                    ingeniously developed by Struve.</p>
                <p>Consider a small spherical angle <hi rend="italic">ω.</hi> The number of stars
                    included in it whose distances are between <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">r + δr</hi> from the earth is proportional to <hi rend="italic"
                    >ωr</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">δr.</hi></p>
                <p>The whole amount of light received from such a portion of the sky must be
                    therefore as</p>
                <p>∕*OO ω∕ <hi rend="italic">dr,</hi> √0</p>
                <p>provided that no star intercepts the light coming from another. This condition is
                    unattainable, so that the conclusion is that the brightness is as great as it
                    can be with the materials employed. Every portion of the background shines as if
                    it were a star.</p>
                <p>(c) A third very important fact, connected with our present subject, but not
                    immediately deducible from our principle, is— <hi rend="italic">The brightness
                    of a self-luminous surface does not depend upon its inclination to the line of
                    sight.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus a red-hot ball of iron, free from scales of oxide, &amp;c., appears flat in
                    the dark; so, also, the sun, seen through mist, appears as a flat disk. This
                    fact, however, depends ultimately upon the second law of thermodynamics, and its
                    explanation will be fully given under <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiation.</hi></p>
                <p>It may be stated, however, in another form, in which its connexion with what
                    precedes is more obvious— <hi rend="italic">The amount of radiation, in any
                    direction, from a luminous surface is proportional to the cosine of the
                    obliquity.</hi></p>
                <p>The flow of light (if we may so call it) in straight lines from the luminous
                    point, with constant velocity, leads as we have seen to the expression -ff
                    (where <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the distance from the luminous point) for the
                    quantity of light which passes through unit of surface perpendicular to the ray
                    in unit of time, <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> being a quantity indicating the rate
                    at which light is emitted by the source. This represents the illumination of the
                    surface on which it falls. The flow through unit of surface whose normal is
                    inclined at an angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> to the ray is of course</p>
                <p>-4- cos <hi rend="italic">G, r</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> again
                    representing the illumination. These are precisely the expressions for the
                    gravitation force exerted by a particle of mass μ on a unit of matter at
                    distance <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and for its resolved part in a given
                    direction. Hence we may employ an expression</p>
                <p>V = 2— , <hi rend="italic">r</hi> which is exactly analagous to the gravitation
                    or electric potential, for the purpose of calculating the effect due to any
                    number of <hi rend="italic">separate</hi> sources of light.</p>
                <p>And the fundamental proposition in potentials, viz., that, if <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> be the external normal at any point of a closed surface, the integral
                    <hi rend="italic">ff^</hi> tιken over the whole surface, has the value</p>
                <p>- 4vμ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>, where μ <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> is the
                    sum of the values of <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> for each source lying <hi
                    rend="italic">within</hi> the surface, follows almost intuitively from the mere
                    consideration of what it means as regards light. For every source <hi
                    rend="italic">external</hi> to the closed surface sends in light which goes out
                    again. But the light from an internal source goes wholly out; and the amount per
                    second from each unit source is 4ιr, the total area of the unit sphere
                    surrounding the source.</p>
                <p>It is well to observe, however, that the analogy is not quite complete. To make
                    it so, all the sources must lie on the same side of the surface whose
                    illumination we are dealing with. This is due to the fact that, in order that a
                    surface may be illuminated at all, it must be capable of <hi rend="italic"
                    >scattering</hi> light, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it must be to some extent
                    opaque. Hence the illumination depends mainly upon those sources which are on
                    the same side as that from which it is regarded.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Though this process bears some resemblance to the heat analogy employed by Sir W.
                    Thomson for investigations in statical electricity <hi rend="italic">(Cambridge
                    Mathematical Journal,</hi> 1842) and to Clerk Maxwell’s device of an

                    1856), it is by no means identical with them. Each method deals with a
                    substance, real or imaginary, which flows in conical streams from a source so
                    that the same amount of it passes per second through every section of the cone.
                    But in the present process the velocity is constant and the density variable,
                    while in the others the density is virtually constant and the velocity variable.
                    There is a curious reciprocity in formulae such as we have just given. For
                    instance, it is easily seen that the light <hi rend="italic">received from</hi>
                    a uniformly illuminated surface is represented by <hi rend="superscript"> cos
                    0</hi></p>
                <p>As we have seen that this integral vanishes for a closed surface which has no
                    source inside, its value is the same for all shells of equal uniform brightness
                    whose edges lie on the same cone.</p>
                <p>We have said that light moves in straight lines in a homogeneous medium. This
                    rectilinear path follows at once from the corpuscular theory, as well as from
                    the undulatory theory of light: in the first case there is no deflecting cause,
                    so each corpuscle moves in a straight line; in the second, the direction of
                    propagation of a plane wave in an uniform isotropic medium is always
                    perpendicular to its front. Looking along a hot poker or the boiler of a
                    steamboat, we see objects beyond <hi rend="italic">distorted·, i.e.,</hi> we no
                    longer see each point in its true direction. Here we have a non-homogeneous
                    medium, the air being irregularly expanded in the neighbourhood of the hot body.
                    To this simple cause are due the phenomena of mirage, the fata morgana, the
                    reduplication of images of a distant object seen through an irregularly heated
                    atmosphere, the scintillation or twinkling of stars, and the uselessness of even
                    the best telescopes at certain times, &amp;c. It is interesting to note here
                    that Newton<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Optics,</hi> end of part i.</p></note> says :—“Long telescopes may
                    cause objects to appear brighter and larger than short ones can do; but they
                    cannot be so formed as to take away that confusion of the rays which arises from
                    the tremors of the atmosphere. The only remedy is a most serene and quiet air,
                    such as may perhaps be found on the tops of the highest mountains, above the
                    grosser clouds.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Photometry.</hi> —The principle above explained suggests
                    many simple methods of comparing the amounts of light given by different
                    sources. If, for instance, a porcelain plate, or even a sheet of paper, of
                    uniform thickness, have one half illuminated directly by one source of light,
                    the other by a different source, and if one or other of these sources be moved
                    to or from the plate till the halves appear equally illuminated, it is obvious
                    that the amounts of light given out by the two sources are directly as the
                    squares of their distances from the screen. This is the principle of Ritchie’s
                    photometer. Rumford suggested the comparison of the intensity of the shadows of
                    the same object thrown side by side on a screen by the two lights to be
                    compared. In this case the shadow due to one source is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n603/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0603-0584"/> lit up by the other alone; and here again the
                    amounts of light given out by the sources are as the squares of their distances
                    from the screen when the shadows are equally intense. The shadow-casting object
                    should be near the screen, so as to avoid penumbra as much as possible; yet not
                    too near, so that the shadows may not overlap.</p>
                <p>Bunsen has recently suggested the very simple expedient of making a grease-spot
                    on white paper for photometric purposes. When the paper is equally illuminated
                    from both sides, the grease-spot cannot be seen except by very close inspection.
                    In using this photometer, the sources are placed in one line with the
                    grease-spot, which lies between them and can be moved towards one or other. To
                    make the most accurate determinations with this arrangement the adjustment
                    should first be made from the side on which one source lies, then the screen
                    turned round and the adjustment made from the side of the other source,—in both
                    cases, therefore, from the same side of the paper screen. Take the mean of these
                    positions (which are usually very close together), and the amounts of light are
                    as the squares of the distances of the sources from this point. Wheatstone
                    suggested a hollow glass bead, silvered internally, and made to describe very
                    rapidly a closed path, for use as a photometer. When it is placed between two
                    sources, we see two <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> curves of reflected light,
                    one due to each source. Make these, by trial, equally bright; and the amounts of
                    light from the sources are, again, as the squares of the distances. These simple
                    forms of apparatus give results which are fairly accurate, so long at least as
                    the <hi rend="italic">qualities</hi> of the light furnished · by the two sources
                    are nearly the same. But, when we endeavour to compare differently coloured
                    lights, the result is by no means so satisfactory. In fact, we cannot well
                    define equality of illumination when the lights are of different qualities. In
                    the undulatory theory, no doubt, we can distinctly define the intensity of any
                    form of radiation. But the definition is a purely dynamical one, and has not
                    necessarily any connexion with what we usually mean by intensity, viz., the
                    amount of effect produced upon the nerves of the retina. Thus the theoretical
                    intensities of a given violet and a given red source may be equal, while one may
                    appear to the eye very much brighter than the other. Think, for instance, of a
                    colour-blind person, who might, under conceivable circumstances, be unable to
                    see the red at all. We are <hi rend="italic">all</hi> as it were colour-blind as
                    far as regards radiations whose wave-lengths are longer or shorter than those
                    included in the range of the ordinary solar spectrum.</p>
                <p>Other modes of measuring the intensity of light usually depend upon more
                    recondite physical principles,—such as, for instance, the amounts of chemical
                    action of certain kinds which can be produced by an exposure of a given duration
                    to the light from a particular source. But all have the same grand defect as the
                    simpler processes,— they are not adapted to the comparison of sources giving
                    different qualities of light. And those last mentioned are liable to another
                    source of error, viz., the action of radiations which are not called light, only
                    because they are not visible to the eye; for in all other respects they closely
                    resemble light, and are often more active than it is in producing chemical
                    changes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Velocity of Light.</hi> —Light moves with a velocity of
                    nearly 186,000 miles per second. Of this we have four distinct kinds of proof,
                    on each of which depends a method which is capable of giving pretty accurate
                    results.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Römer'»</hi><hi rend="italic">Method.—</hi> By this the
                    finite velocity of light was discovered in 1676. Suppose, to illustrate this,
                    that at a certain place a cannon is fired precisely at intervals of an hour
                    while the weather is perfectly calm. A person provided with an accurate watch
                    travels about in the surrounding district. When he first hears the cannon let
                    him note the time by his watch, then on account of the non-instantaneous
                    propagation of sound, if at the next discharge he be <hi rend="italic"
                    >nearer</hi> the gun than before, the report will arrive at his ear <hi
                    rend="italic">before</hi> the hour’s interval has elapsed; if he be farther from
                    the gun, the interval between the discharges will appear longer than an hour;
                    and the number of seconds of defect or excess will evidently represent the time
                    employed by sound in travelling over a space equal to the difference of his
                    distances from the gun at the successive observations.</p>
                <p>Now the satellites of Jupiter are subject—like our moon, only much more
                    frequently—to eclipse, and the interval between two successive eclipses can
                    easily be observed. The almost sudden extinction of the light is a phenomenon
                    similar to the discharge of the gun; and, if light take time to move from one
                    place to another, we should find the interval between successive eclipses too
                    short when we are approaching Jupiter, too long when we are receding from him.
                    Such was found to be the case by Römer; and he also found that the shortening or
                    lengthening of the interval depended upon the rate at which the earth was
                    approaching to or receding from Jupiter. The inevitable conclusion from these
                    facts is that light is propagated with finite velocity. Römer calculated from
                    them that light takes about 16 <hi rend="superscript"> m</hi> 5 to cross the
                    earth’s orbit. The exact velocity deduced by this method is, after making all
                    corrections, and assuming the most probable value of the solar parallax, about
                    186,500 miles per second.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bradley's Method.—</hi> This depends on the <hi
                    rend="italic">aberration of light,</hi> discovered by Bradley in 1728. When in a

                    protect himself. If he walk he requires to hold it forwards, and more inclined
                    the faster he walks. In other words, to a person walking the rain does not
                    appear to come in the same direction as to a person standing still.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In fact, to estimate the
                    relative direction and velocity of two moving bodies we must subtract the vector
                    velocity of the first from that of the second.</p></note> Now the earth’s
                    velocity in its orbit is a very large quantity, some 18∣ miles per second, or
                    about -∏∏∏∏j4h of that of light Hence the light from a star does not appear to
                    come in the proper direction unless the earth be moving exactly to or from the
                    star, and, as the direction of the earth’s motion is continually changing, so
                    the directions in which different stars are seen are always changing, and thus
                    this phenomenon, called the “aberration of light,” proves at once the finite
                    velocity of light and the earth’s motion round the sun.</p>
                <p>As an additional illustration of the phenomenon, suppose a bullet fired through a
                    railway carriage, in a direction perpendicular to the sides of the carriage. If
                    the carriage be standing still, the bullet will make holes in the sides, the
                    line joining which is perpendicular to the length of the carriage; if it be in
                    motion, then the second side of the carriage will have moved through a certain
                    space during the interval occupied by the bullet in passing from side to side,
                    and thus the line joining the holes in the sides <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi>
                    the line pursued by the bullet relatively to the carriage), will be inclined at
                    an angle greater than a right angle to the direction of the train’s motion.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the path apparently described by each star during a year, in
                    conséquence of aberration, will be found by laying off from the star lines which
                    bear the same ratio to the star’s distance as the velocity of the earth does to
                    that of light,—their directions being always the same as that of the earth’s
                    motion at every instant. This is precisely the definition of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hodograph (&lt;?.v.)</hi> of the earth’s orbit. Hence, on
                    account of the finite velocity of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0604-0585"/> light, each star appears to describe in space a
                    circle (not an ellipse) of fixed magnitude in a plane parallel to that of the
                    ecliptic. As seen from the earth, therefore, stars will appear to describe paths
                    which are the projections of these circles on the celestial sphere. These are in
                    general ellipses, but circles for stars at the poles of the ecliptic and
                    straight lines for stars in the ecliptic. This is found to be quite consistent
                    with observation; and the major axes of these ellipses, the diameters of the
                    circles, or the lengths of the lines subtend equally angles of about 41" at the
                    earth. Hence the velocity of light is to the velocity of the earth as 1: tan ⅜
                    41"; that is, about 10,000: 1.</p>
                <p>Both these methods depend, for their final result, upon a true knowledge of the
                    earth’s distance from the sun. But the most accurate measurements of this
                    quantity are probably to be obtained from the velocity of light itself, this
                    being independently determined by the physical processes next to be described.
                    Thus the earth’s distance from the sun will in future be measured rather by the
                    constant of aberration, or by the acceleration or retardation of the eclipses of
                    Jupiter’s satellites, than by a transit of Venus, by the moon’s motion, or by
                    the parallax of Mars. Thus Römer’s and Bradley’s processes are now applied to
                    the determination of solar parallax.</p>

                    —To illustrate the next and by far the most convincing <hi rend="italic"
                    >i)opular</hi> proof of the finite velocity of light, suppose a persen ooking at
                    himself in a mirror, before which is moving a screen with a number of apertures,
                    the breadth of each aperture being equal to the distance between any two of
                    them. If the screen be at rest with an aperture before the mirror, the light
                    from the observer’s face passes through the aperture and is reflected back, so
                    that he sees himself as if the screen were not present. Suppose the screen to be
                    moving in such a way that, when the light which passed through the aperture
                    returns to the screen after reflexion, the unpierced part of the screen is in
                    its way, it is evident that the observer cannot see himself in the mirror. If
                    the screen pass twice as fast, the light that escaped by one aperture will,
                    after reflexion, return by the next, so that he will see his image as at first.
                    If three times as fast, the second unperforated part of the screen will stop the
                    returning light; so he cannot see his image. To apply this practically a thin
                    metallic disk had a set of teeth cut on its circumference so that the breadth of
                    a tooth was equal to that of the space between two teeth. This disk could be set
                    in very rapid rotation by a train of wheel work, and the rate of turning could
                    easily be determined by Savart’s method (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics,
                    voL</hi> i. p. 108). Light passed between two teeth to a mirror situated at 10
                    miles’ distance, which sent it back by the same course, so that when the wheel
                    was at rest the reflected light could be seen. On turning the disk with
                    accelerated velocity the light was observed to become more and more feeble up to
                    a certain velocity, at which it was extinguished; turning faster it reappeared,
                    growing brighter and brighter till the velocity was doubled; then it fell off,
                    till it vanished when the velocity was trebled, and so on. It is evident from
                    the first illustration above that the velocity of light in air is to that of the
                    tooth, at the first disappearance of the reflected light, as the distance of the
                    mirror from the disk is to the half breadth of the tooth. It is not to be
                    supposed that the description we have just given embodies all the details of
                    this remarkable experiment. On the contrary, telescopes were used at each
                    station to prevent loss of light as much as possible, and many other precautions
                    were adopted which would be unintelligible without references to later parts of
                    this article. This method and its first results were published in 1849 in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Comptes Rendus.</hi> The experiments gave, on their very
                    careful repetition by Cornu in 1874, the value 186,700 miles for the velocity in
                    vacuo <hi rend="italic">(Nature,</hi> xi. p. 274).</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Foucault's Method.—</hi> This was described in 1850 to the
                    Academy of Sciences. It depends upon the principle of the rapidly revolving
                    plane mirror introduced by Wheatstone to demonstrate the non instantaneous
                    propagation of an electric discharge. The mirror was made to revolve from 600 to
                    800 times per second, by means of a <hi rend="italic">siren</hi> (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acoustics)</hi> driven by steam. A ray of sunlight fell upon it
                    from a small aperture crossed by a grating of platinum wires. Between the wires
                    and the mirror was placed an achromatic lens—the wires being farther from it
                    than its principal focus, but <hi rend="italic">not twice as far—</hi> so that
                    the rays falling on the mirror were slowly convergent. They formed an image of
                    the wires at a distance of about 4 metres from the mirror. In certain positions
                    of the revolving mirror, the rays fell upon a concave mirror of 4 metres radius
                    whose centre of curvature was at the centre of the revolving mirror. They were,
                    therefore, reflected back directly to the revolving mirror, and, passing again
                    through the lens, formed an image of the wire grating which, when the adjustment
                    was perfect, coincided with the grating itself. This coincidence was observed by
                    reflexion from a piece of unsilvered glass, placed obliquely in the track of the
                    rays, the image in which was magnified by an eye-piece. It is obvious that, when
                    the mirror is made to turn, the light which comes back to it after passing to
                    the fixed mirror, finds it in a position slightly different from that in which
                    it left it. That difference is due to the amount of rotation during the time of
                    passage of the light to and fro along an air-space of 4 metres. Accordingly, as
                    soon as the mirror began to rotate with considerable velocity, the coincidence
                    between the wires and their images was destroyed; and the two were separated
                    more and more widely as the velocity of rotation was increased. It was easy to
                    calculate, from the measured dimensions of the apparatus, the amount of
                    deflexion, and the rate of rotation of the mirror, the velocity of light. The
                    rate of rotation was, of course, given by the pitch of the note produced by the
                    siren.</p>
                <p>Foucault’s early results with this apparatus showed that the velocity of light
                    which had been deduced from the old methods was too large; and he concludes his
                    first paper by the statement that the determination of the distance of the earth
                    from the sun must now be made by physical instead of astronomical methods.
                    Foucault’s process lias recently been very considerably improved by Mitchelson,
                    who, in 1879, found for the velocity of light in vacuo 186,380 miles per second
                    <hi rend="italic">(Nature,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 226).</p>
                <p>By interposing a tube filled with water, and having flat glass ends, between the
                    fixed and revolving mirrors, Foucault found that (for the same rate of rotation)
                    the displacement of the image was greater than before in the proportion of the
                    refractive index of water to unity. Thus it was at once evident, by a mode of
                    experimenting exposed to no possible doubt, that light moves faster in air than
                    in water, and, therefore, as will be seen later, that the corpuscular theory of
                    light must be abandoned.</p>
                <p>Other methods of determining the velocity of light in air, and for comparing the
                    velocities of light in air and water (on wdιich depends the most definite proof
                    of the erroneousness of the corpuscular theory), and in still and moving water,
                    will be afterwards explained. They give results of very great value, but we
                    cannot introduce then here, as they depend upon somewhat more recondite
                    principles of <hi rend="italic">physical</hi> optics.</p>
                <p>It is interesting to observe that, as the nearest fixed star is probably about
                    200,000 times farther from us than the sun is, we now see such a star by light
                    which left it more than three years ago. If, as is now supposed, <hi
                    rend="italic">variable</hi> stars <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n605/mode/1up"

                    changes of brightness to eclipses, and if different homogeneous rays travel with
                    different velocities in free space, it is evident that such stars would show a
                    gradual change of colour as they wax, and an opposite change as they wane.
                    Nothing of the kind has as yet been observed, though it has been carefully
                    sought for. Hence we have every reason to conclude that, in free space, all
                    kinds of light have the same velocity. It will be seen later that <hi
                    rend="italic">dispersion</hi> has been accounted for by the different velocities
                    of light of different wave-lengths in the same refracting medium,—this being a
                    consequence of the ultimate grained structure of ordinary matter, which is on a
                    scale not incomparably smaller than the average wave-length.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Behaviour of Light at the Common Surface of Two Homogeneous
                    Media.</hi></p>
                <p>When a ray of light,'moving in one homogeneous medium, falls on the bounding
                    surface of another homogeneous medium, it is in general divided into several
                    parts, which pursue different courses. These parts are respectively— (a)
                    reflected; (/?) refracted (singly or doubly); (γ) scattered; (δ) absorbed.</p>
                <p>In the first two categories the result is two or three rays of light pursuing
                    definite paths according to laws presently to be given. The fraction of the
                    incident light which is reflected is in general greater as the angle of
                    incidence is greater. In one important class of cases the reflexion is <hi
                    rend="italic">total.</hi> But at direct incidence the reflected portion is much
                    greater for some bodies, such as mercury, than fpr others, such as water or
                    glass. In bodies which give no scattering, the refracted portion of a ray
                    consists of all the non-reflected portion, and therefore usually diminishes as
                    the angle of incidence increases.</p>
                <p>In the third category the common surface of the two media becomes illuminated,
                    and behaves as if it were itself a source of light, sending rays in all
                    directions. It may be objected to this, that in many cases the rays are
                    scattered while penetrating the second medium. But in such cases the second
                    medium cannot be called <hi rend="italic">homogeneous.</hi> This will come up
                    for discussion when we treat of absorption and colours.</p>
                <p>In the fourth category the light ceases for an instant to exist as light; but its
                    energy may either become heat in the absorbing body, or it may again be given
                    out by the absorbing body in the form of light, but of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >degraded</hi> character. This is called <hi rend="italic">fluorescence,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">phosphorescence,</hi> according as the phenomenon is
                    practically instantaneous or lasts for a measurable time.</p>
                <p>In category (a) the light is sent back into the first medium; in (fl) it
                    penetrates into the second; in (γ) it goes, in general, mainly to the first; in
                    (δ) it is shared by both.</p>
                <p>It is by scattered light that non-luminous objects are, in general, made visible.
                    Contrast, for instance, the effects when a ray of sunlight in a dark room falls
                    upon a piece of polished silver, and when it falls on a piece of chalk. Unless
                    there be dust or scratches on the silver you cannot see it, because no light is
                    given from it to surrounding bodies except in one definite direction, into which
                    (practically) the whole ray of sunlight is diverted. But the chalk sends light
                    to <hi rend="italic">all</hi> surrounding bodies from which any part of its
                    illuminated side can be seen; and there is no special direction in which it
                    sends a much more powerful ray than in others. It is probable that if we could,
                    with sufficient closeness, examine the surface of the chalk, we should find its
                    behaviour to be of the nature of reflexion, but reflexion due to little mirrors
                    inclined in all conceivable aspects, and at all conceivable angles, to the
                    incident light. Thus scattering may be looked upon as ultimately due to
                    reflexion. When the sea is perfectly calm, we see in it one intolerably bright
                    image of the sun only. But when it is continuously covered with slight ripples,
                    the definite image is broken up, and we have a large surface of the water
                    shining by what is virtually scattered light,—though it is really made up of
                    parts each of which is as truly reflected as it was when the surface was
                    flat.</p>
                <p>We have spoken above of the behaviour of light at the common surface of two
                    media. Now we do not by this phrase necessarily mean two media different in
                    their chemical composition. We mean merely media <hi rend="italic"
                    >optically</hi> different. Thus water with steam above it, and in very special
                    cases layers of water or air of different temperatures, give surfaces of
                    separation at which reflexion and refraction may and do take place. But, except
                    in such special cases, we rarely have an abrupt change, such as is necessary for
                    reflexion, between two portions of the same substance <hi rend="italic">in the
                    same molecular state.</hi> In general the transition is gradual; and special
                    mathematical methods must be applied for the purpose of tracing the behaviour of
                    the ray, which is now really travelling in a <hi rend="italic"

                    sides') to, the perpendicular to the reflecting surface at the point of
                    incidence.</hi> This is sometimes stated in the form— <hi rend="italic">The
                    angles of incidence and of reflexion are equal to one another, and in one
                    plane.</hi> The best experimental proof of the truth of this statement is
                    deduced from the use of a reflecting surface of mercury in observations with the
                    mural circle. The graduation of such an instrument is the most perfect that
                    human skill can accomplish, and no one has ever been able to find by it the
                    slightest exception to the preceding statement.</p>
                <p>The principle of Hadley’s quadrant, and of the sextant as now used (an invention
                    of Newton’s), is founded on this fact. If a plane mirror on which a ray falls be
                    turned through any angle about an axis perpendicular to the plane of reflexion,
                    the reflected ray is turned through twice that angle. This is an immediate
                    consequence of the above law. For, if the plane be turned through any angle <hi
                    rend="italic">θ,</hi> the perpendicular to it is turned through the same angle.
                    Hence the angle between the incident ray and the perpendicular is increased or
                    diminished by <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and therefore that between the incident
                    and reflected rays (which is double of this) is altered by <hi rend="italic"
                    >2θ.</hi> A plane mirror is now extensively used for the purpose of indicating,
                    by the change of direction of a reflected ray, the motion of a portion ol an
                    instrument to which the mirror is attached. Thus the magnetometers of Gauss, the
                    tuning-forks of Lissajoux, and the electrometers and galvanometers of Sir W.
                    Thomson are all furnished with mirrors. The law of reflexion is also the basis
                    of the goniometer, for the measurement of the angles of crystals and prisms.</p>
                <p>It follows from this law that, if a ray pass from one point to another, after any
                    number of reflexions at fixed surfaces, the length of its whole path from one
                    point to the other is the least possible—subject to the condition that it shall
                    <hi rend="italic">meet</hi> each of the reflecting surfaces. For the point in a
                    given plane the sum of whose distances from two given points (on the same side
                    of the plane) is the least possible is that to which, if lines be drawn from the
                    points, they are in one plane with the normal (or perpendicular) to the given
                    plane and make equal angles with it. And, as the same is true of each separate
                    reflexion, it is true for the whole course of the ray, since for any one of the
                    reflecting surfaces may be substituted its tangent plane at the point of
                    incidence.</p>

                <p>It is to be remarked that there are exceptions to this form of the statement. The
                    true form is that the actual path of a ray, under the given conditions, is less
                    in length than any other path (satisfying the conditions) which is nowhere
                    finitely divergent from it. This may be best seen by another method. Suppose a
                    series of ellipses to be described whose foci are the source of light and an
                    assigned point which is to be reached by the reflected ray. Let this system turn
                    about the line joining the foci; it generates a series of prolate spheroids such
                    that the time of light’s passing from one focus to a point in any one of the
                    surfaces, and thence to the other focus, is the same whatever point be chosen on
                    that particular surface. If we take any point <hi rend="italic">without</hi>
                    that surface, for it the corresponding time is obviously greater. Hence to find
                    the path of that one of a system of rays diverging from a given point which,
                    after reflexion at a given surface, shall pass through a given point, we have
                    only to imagine spheroids constructed as before. Of these one at least will <hi
                    rend="italic">touch</hi> the given surface. All points on the surface <hi
                    rend="italic">in the neighbourhood of the point of contact</hi> (mark this
                    limitation) will in general be outside the spheroid. Hence this point gives the
                    shortest path. But the spheroid and the reflecting surface have the same tangent
                    plane, and therefore the parts of the ray are equally inclined to the
                    surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of Images by Reflexion at a Plane Surface.—</hi> We
                    may assume here—what is indeed evident from the rectilinear propagation of
                    light—that objects are rendered visible to the eye by rays <hi rend="italic"
                    >diverging</hi> from them. Hence, if we have a set of reflected or refracted
                    rays diverging from any point, or diverging as if they came from any point, they
                    will convey to the eye the impression of the existence of a luminous source at
                    that point. The eye, in fact, can only tell us what effect is produced upon it,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> what sort of mechanical action it is subjected to.
                    Its indications must therefore depend only upon what reaches it, and in no other
                    sense whatever upon the source or the path of light. This point from which rays
                    diverge, or appear to diverge, is called an <hi rend="italic">image.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">The image of any point in a plane mirror is found by drawing from
                    the point a perpendicular on the mirror and producing it till its length is
                    doubled.</hi></p>
                <p>The extremity of the line so drawn is the image of the point; or, in other words,
                    rays proceeding from the point diverge after reflexion as if they came from the
                    image so found. The image in this case is called <hi rend="italic">virtual,</hi>
                    to distinguish it from cases, subsequently to be mentioned, where it is <hi
                    rend="italic">real—</hi> the distinction being that the rays have actually
                    passed through a real image, while they only appear to come from a virtual
                    one.</p>
                <p>To prove this it is only necessary to observe that, if A (fig. 5) be a luminous
                    point or a point from which rays diverge, and CB any section of the mirror by a
                    plane through AB, the perpendicular to it, and if we make Bα = AB, and take any
                    point P, then, joining AP, αP, and producing the latter, the angles APB, αPB,
                    and therefore CPQ are equal; also the plane of the piper contains the
                    perpendicular to the mirror at P. Hence PQ is the reflected ray; or the ray,
                    after reflexion, appears to come from <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is the image—a virtual one, as before noticed. Also, if R
                    be any point whatever (not P) in the plane of the mirror, we have obviously
                    &lt;ιR = RA. Hence the path AR, RQ is equal to αR, RQ, two sides of the triangle
                    αRQ, of which αQ, which is equal to the actual path (AP, PQ), is the third
                    side.</p>
                <p>Fig. G represents the pencils of diverging rays by which two points of the image
                    are rendered visible to an eye placed in front of the mirror. From the requisite
                    modification of this figure it follows that one can see his whole person in a
                    mirror of only half his height and breadth.</p>
                <p>Dircks’s <hi rend="italic">ghost,</hi> which has played a prominent part in
                    popular entertainments for some years back, is the image, in a large sheet of
                    unsilvered plate glass hung at the front of the stage, of an actor or figure
                    strongly illuminated, and concealed from the audience in a sort of enlarged
                    prompter’s box. Any one can see the phenomenon completely by looking into a
                    plate-glass window on a sunny day, when he sees the passers-by apparently
                    walking <hi rend="italic">inside</hi> the house.</p>
                <p>The principles already stated suffice fully for the explanation of the curious
                    vistas of images formed by two <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> plane mirrors
                    facing one another at opposite sides of a room. The only additional observation
                    necessary on this subject is that, if the mirrors are silvered on the back, the
                    light at each reflexion has to pass twice through the glass. Thus, if the glass
                    be pinkish or greenish, the various images are more and more coloured as they
                    are due to more numerous reflexions.</p>
                <p>These principles also easily explain the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Kaleidoscope</hi><hi rend="italic">(g.vi)</hi> of Sir D. Brewster, where images
                    are formed by two mirrors inclined to one another. It is easy to see that the
                    series of images of a luminous point produced by such an arrangement after one,
                    two, &amp;c., reflexions must all lie on a circle; also that, if the angle
                    between the mirrors be an aliquot part of four right angles, these images will
                    form a finite number of groups, each consisting of an infinite number of images
                    which have exactly the same position.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the law of reflexion which is furnished by the corpuscular
                    theory is excessively simple. We have only to suppose that at the instant of its
                    impact on the reflecting surface the velocity of a corpuscle <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpendicular</hi> to the surface is reversed, while that <hi rend="italic"
                    >parallel</hi> to the surface is unchanged. It bounds off, in fact, like a
                    billiard-ball from the cushion. The undulatory theory gives an explanation,
                    which is <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> in reality, quite as simple, but requires
                    a little more detail for those who are not familiar with the common facts of
                    wave-motion. We therefore reserve it for a time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reflexion at a Spherical Surface.—</hi> Let APB (fig. 7) be a

                <p>VP <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> UP.</p>
                <p>The full consequences of this <hi rend="italic">exact</hi> statement will be
                    developed under <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics (Geometrical).</hi> For our present
                    purpose, an approximation will amply suffice. Let us suppose P to be so near to
                    A that no sensible error is introduced by writing A for P in the above formula.
                    This amounts to supposing the mirror’s breadth to be very small in comparison
                    with its radius of curvature. The formula now becomes</p>
                <p>VO OU .</p>
                <p>AV <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> AU’</p>
                <p>or, what is the same,</p>

                <p>AV “AU ’</p>
                <p>and V is, to the degree of approximation above stated, independent of the
                    position of the point P. If. we call <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the radius AO of
                    the mirror, « = AU the distance of the source, and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> =
                    AV, the distance of the point V from the mirror, this becomes</p>
                <p>-'→.'irr <hi rend="subscript"> ι01</hi> l <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> l.J. . . .

                <p><hi rend="italic">V U U V r</hi></p>
                <p>The formula, or the cut, shows at once that this relation between U and V is <hi
                    rend="italic">reciprocal; i.e.,</hi> all rays from V, falling on the mirror,
                    will be made to converge at U. These points are therefore called <hi
                    rend="italic">conjugate foci.</hi></p>
                <p>The simplicity of (a) is remarkable; so, also, is that of its interpretation. For
                    the rays passing from a source to a given object, like the mirror, are less and
                    less divergent as the source is farther off. Hence (a) signifies that the
                    (algebraic) sum of the divergences of the incident and reflected rays is equal
                    to that divergence which the mirror can convert into parallelism.</p>
                <p>In fact the rigorous geometrical relation may be written in the obvious form AVP
                    +AUP = 2A0P,—which, when all three angles are small, is simply (a). A similar
                    statement may easily be made in the case of refraction.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to develop the consequences of this simple formula, we may
                    point out that it is applicable to all cases,—to convergent rays falling on a
                    concave mirror, to divergent rays falling on a convex mirror, &lt;tc., &lt;fcc.
                    The reader may easily verify this by trial for himself. But it follows at once
                    from the necessary interpretation of the negative sign in geometry. Thus, if the
                    mirror were convex, O would be to the <hi rend="italic">left</hi> of A, as the
                    figure is drawn; and AO, if formerly positive, would now be negative. Thus, for
                    a convex mirror, the formula is</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> 1=-A.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">u v</hi><hi rend="italic">r</hi></p>
                <p>If the incident rays be <hi rend="italic">convergent,</hi> U is to the left of A,
                    and therefore AU, or <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> is negative; and so on.</p>
                <p>We must now study the <hi rend="italic">relative</hi> positions of U and V, in
                    order to find the size and position of the image for different positions of the
                    object.</p>
                <p>Returning to the formula (a) above, we see that the following pairs of values of
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> satisfy it :—</p>

                <p>Thus, when the source is at a practically infinite distance (as the sun or a
                    star) the image is formed at a distance from the mirror equal to <hi
                    rend="italic">half its</hi> radius of curvature. It is then said to be in the
                    <hi rend="italic">principal</hi> focus. As the source comes nearer, the image
                    comes out to meet it, and they coincide at the centre of curvature of the
                    mirror. In fact, a ray leaving the centre of the mirror must meet the surface at
                    right angles, and thus go back by the way it came. When the source comes still
                    nearer, the image goes further off, until, when the source is at the principal
                    focus, the image is at an infinite distance; that is, the rays go off parallel
                    to one another. This is the mode in which a concave reflector is employed for
                    lighthouse purposes. When the source comes still nearer, the image is behind the
                    mirror, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the incident rays are so divergent that
                    part of their divergence remains after reflexion. This remnant of divergence
                    becomes greater and greater as the source is nearer to the mirror, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the (then <hi rend="italic">virtual)</hi> image comes
                    closer to the mirror, which finally behaves, for a very near source, almost
                    precisely like a plane mirror.</p>
                <p>All of these phenomena can be beautifully seen in a dark room by employing a beam
                    of sunlight, rendered distinctly visible, in the fashion noted by Lucretius, by
                    the motes in the air.</p>
                <p>For further explanation pictures are given (figs. 8, 9), showing the course of
                    the pencil of rays when (1) a <hi rend="italic">real</hi> and (2) a <hi
                    rend="italic">virtual</hi> image is formed by a concave mirror. It will be seen
                    at once that, in the cases figured, the <hi rend="italic">real</hi> image is <hi
                    rend="italic">inverted</hi> and less than the object, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >virtual</hi> image <hi rend="italic">erect</hi> and larger. In fact the size of
                    a small object is obviously to that of its image in proportion to their
                    distances from O, the centre of curvature of the mirror. Also the image is erect
                    when it lies on the same side <pb break="no"

                    inverted, if 0:1 the opposite. In other words, the image is inverted if the rays
                    cross one another’s path, erect if they do not.</p>
                <p>When the breadth of the mirror is large compared with its radius, the
                    approximation upon which all these results depend can no longer be made. There
                    is then no definite image even of a luminous point. It becomes spread over what
                    is called a <hi rend="italic">caustic,</hi> a section of which is the bright
                    curve familiar to every one who has looked at a cup of milk in sunshine.</p>
                <p>Even when the approximation is close enough for ordinary purposes, it is not so
                    for astronomical purposes, and the effect of its inexactness upon the image is
                    known as <hi rend="italic">spherical aberration.</hi> For the fine mirrors of
                    reflecting <hi rend="smallcaps">Telescopes</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.')</hi>
                    the spherical form cannot be employed; the surface of the mirror must be of <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Cylindrical Mirrors.—</hi> As a simple example of the
                    application of the law of reflexion at curved surfaces, when the rigorous
                    solution is demanded, let us take the case of a vertical right cylinder, the
                    object being a drawing on a horizontal plane. Such mirrors, with the frightfully
                    distorted drawings necessary to give an image of natural proportions, were very
                    common fifty years ago, but are now rarely seen. They are still, however,
                    valuable as illustrations of our subject.</p>
                <p>Let the plane of the object cut the axis OB of the cylinder at right angles in 0
                    (fig. 10), and let A be the position of the eye, and RQA a ray from a point R of
                    the object, reflected at Q. Draw QP perpendicular to the axis. The AQ and QR are
                    in the same plane with QP (the normal to the surface) and make equal angles with
                    it. Hence, when this figure is projected by vertical lines on the plane of the
                    object, it takes the form in fig. 11; and AQ, QR now make equal angles with OQ.
                    Also, if AB be drawn (in fig. 10) perpendicular to OP, the ratio of AQ to QR in
                    fig. 11 is equal to that of BP to PO in fig. 10. </p>
                <p>Take QS:QO::QR:QA, and draw ST parallel to OA. Then it is obvious that</p>
                <p>SR-ST-jgoA; and also that the angles QSR and QST are equal. Hence the following
                    theorems, which enable us at once to draw a figure on the object plane such that
                    its image shall appear of any assigned form.</p>
                <p>1. Any line, such as QR, on the object plane, drawn from a point Q in the section
                    of the cylinder so that the angles OQR and OQA are equal, is seen after
                    reflexion as a generating line of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>2. If an epicycloid be described by lines of fixed length OS, SR, turning about 0
                    with angular velocities 1 and 2, and both coinciding with OA at starting, its
                    image will be a circular section of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>Thus, if we imagine as drawn on the cylinder any number of vertical and
                    horizontal sections, forming a network, the object corresponding to them can be
                    traced as a number of intersecting straight lines and epicycloids. Thus we have
                    a well-known means of drawing the required object. A similar process may be
                    applied to other modes of using such mirrors.</p>
                <p>When the cylinder has a small diameter, it may be usefully employed to intercept
                    and reflect part of a beam of sunlight entering a dark room. It is easy to see,
                    by a geometrical construction, that the reflected rays will, in this case, form
                    a right cone, whose axis is that of the cylinder; and one of its generating
                    lines will be parallel to the incident ray. Thus the angle of the cone becomes
                    smaller as the inclination of the reflecting cylinder to the ray becomes less.
                    If the ray, at the point of interruption, was at the centre of a spherical dome,
                    after reflexion it will form on the dome a circle, small or great, which passes
                    through its original point of incidence.</p>

                <p>Imitations, more or less perfect, of primary and secondary rainbows can easily be
                    made by this process,—the sunbeam being led through a prism just before it falls
                    on the cylindrical rod. This experiment is a very striking one; but, though
                    capable of giving much information, it is of that dangerous kind which is liable
                    to mislead instead of instructing an audience.</p>
                <p>If we look at a great number of thin cylindrical rods, parallel to one another,
                    and illuminated by sunlight, the rays which reach the eye must, by what we have
                    already said, each form a side of some right cone (of definite angle) whose axis
                    is parallel to each of the cylinders. The appearance presented will therefore be
                    that of a luminous <hi rend="italic">circle,</hi> passing through the sun. Its
                    angular diameter becomes less as the axes of the cylinders are less inclined to
                    the incident rays.</p>
                <p>This phenomenon is beautifully shown by some specimens of crystals, especially of
                    Iceland spar, which are full of minute tubes parallel to one another. In a plate
                    of such a doubly-refracting crystal, however, there are necessarily four images.
                    That which is <hi rend="italic">throughout</hi> due to the ordinary ray (this
                    term will be explained later) shows perfectly the phenomenon above described.
                    The light of the luminous circle is white. The other three curves are not
                    circles, and in them the colours are separated. One of them, which is
                    elliptical, is usually very much brighter than either of the remaining two.</p>

                <p>The law of single refraction was put in a form equivalent to this (all but one
                    word) for the first time by Snell in Leyden, some time before 1626. It was first
                    published in 1637 by Descartes, who undoubtedly obtained it from Snell; but he
                    gave it without any mention of its author.</p>
                <p>The one word referred to is <hi rend="italic">homogeneous</hi> as applied to the
                    incident light. For the fact that white light consists of innumerable different
                    homogeneous constituents, which are separated from one another by refraction,
                    was first established by Newton. We quote his own account of this important
                    discovery from his letter to Oldenburg, dated Feb. , 167½:—</p>
                <p>“To perform my late promise to you, I shall without further ceremony acquaint
                    you, that in the year 1666 (at which time I applied myself to the grinding of
                    optick-glasses of other figures than spherical) I procured me a triangular
                    glass-prism, to try therewith the celebrated phaenomena of colours. And in order
                    thereto, having darkened my chamber, and made a small hole in my window-shuts,
                    to let in a convenient quantity of the sun’s light, I placed my prism at its
                    entrance, that it might be thereby refracted to the opposite wall. It was at
                    first a very pleasing divertisement, to view the vivid and intense colours
                    produced thereby; but after a while applying myself to consider them more
                    circumspectly, I became surprised to see them in an oblong form; which,
                    according to the received laws of refractions, I expected should have been
                    circular. They were terminated at the sides with streight lines, but at the ends
                    the decay of light λvas so gradual, that it was difficult to determine justly
                    what was their figure, yet they seemed semicircular.</p>
                <p>“Comparing the length of this coloured <hi rend="italic">spectrum</hi> with its
                    breadth, I found it about five times greater; a disproportion so extravagant,
                    that it excited me to a more than ordinary curiosity of examining from whence it
                    might proceed. I could scarce think, that the various thickness of the glass, or
                    the termination with shadow or darkness, could have any influence on light to
                    produ&lt;⅛ such an effect: yet I thought it not amiss, first to examine those
                    circumstances, and so tried what would happen by transmitting light through
                    parts of the glass of divers thicknesses, or through holes in the window of
                    divers bignesses, or by setting the prism without, so that the light might pass
                    through it, and be refracted, before it was terminated by the hole: but I found
                    none of those circumstances material. The fashion of the colours was in all
                    these cases the same.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Then I suspected, whether by any unevenness in the glass, or other contingent
                    irregularity, these colours might be thus dilated. And to try this, I took
                    another prism like the former, and so placed it, that the light passing through
                    them both, might be refracted contrary ways, and so by the latter returned into
                    that course from which the former had diverted it: for by this means I thought
                    the regular effects of the first prism would be destroyed by the second prism,
                    but the irregular ones more augmented, by the multiplicity of refractions. The
                    event was, that the light, which by the first prism was diffused into an oblong
                    form, was by the second reduced. into an orbicular one, with as much regularity
                    as when it did not at all pass through them. So that whatever was the cause of
                    that length, it was not any contingent irregularity.</p>
                <p>“I then proceeded to examine more critically, what might be effected by the
                    difference of the incidence of rays coming from divers parts of the sun; and to
                    that end, measured the several lines and angles belonging to the image. Its
                    distance from the hole or prism was 22 foot; its utmost length 13⅛ inches; its
                    breadth 2∣; the diameter of the hole ⅛ of an inch. The angle which the rays,
                    tending towards the middle of the image, made with those lines, in which they
                    would have proceeded without refraction, was 44 deg. 56 min. and the vertical
                    angle of the prism 63 deg. 12 min. Also the refractions on both sides the prism,
                    that is, of the incident and emergent rays, were, as near as I could make them,
                    equal; and consequently about 54 deg. 4 min. And the rays fell perpendicularly
                    upon the wall. Now subducting the diameter of the hole from the length and
                    breadth of the image, there remains 13 inches in the length, and 2§ the breadth,
                    comprehended by those rays which passed through the center of the said hole; and
                    consequently the angle of the hole, which that breadth subtended, was about 31
                    min. answerable to the sun’s diameter; but the angle which its length subtended,
                    was more than 5 such diameters, namely, 2 deg. 49 min.</p>
                <p>“Having made these observations, I first computed from them the refractive power
                    of that glass, and found it measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31; and
                    then by that ratio I computed the refractions of two rays flowing from opposite
                    parts of the sun’s <hi rend="italic">discus,</hi> so as to differ 31 min. in
                    their obliquity of incidence, and found that the emergent rays should have
                    comprehended an angle of about 31 min. as they did before they were
                    incident.</p>
                <p>“But because this computation was founded on the hypothesis of the
                    proportionality of the sines of incidence and refraction, which though by my own
                    experience I could not imagine to be so erroneous, as to make that angle but 31
                    min. "which in reality was 2 deg. 49 min. yet my curiosity caused me again to
                    take my prism: and having placed it at my window, as before, I observed, that by
                    turning it a little about its axis to and fro, so as to vary its obliquity to
                    the light, more than an angle of 4 or 5 degrees, the colours were not thereby
                    sensibly translated from their place on the wall; and consequently by that
                    variation of incidence, the quan tity of refraction was not sensibly varied. By
                    this experiment, therefore, as well as by the former computation, it was
                    evident, that the difier-ence of the incidence of rays, flowing from divers
                    parts of the sun, could not make them after decussation diverge at a sensibly
                    greater angle, than that at which they before converged; which being at most but
                    about 31 or 32 min. there still remained some other cause to be found out, from
                    whence it could be 2 deg. 49 min.</p>
                <p>“Then I began to suspect, whether the rays, after their trajection through the
                    prism, did not move in curve lines, and according to their more or less curvity,
                    tend to divers parts of the wall. And it increased my suspicion, when I
                    remembered that I had often seen a tennis-ball, struck with an oblique racket,
                    describe such a curve line. For, a circular as well as a progressive motion
                    being communicated to it by that stroke, its parts, on that side where the
                    motions conspire, must press and beat the contiguous air more violently than on
                    the other, and there excite a reluctancy and re-action of the air proportiouably
                    greater. And for the same reason, if the rays of light should possibly be
                    globular bodies, and by their oblique passage out of one medium into another
                    acquire a circulating motion; they ought to feel the greater resistance from the
                    ambient aether, on that side where the motions conspire, and thence be
                    continually bowed to the other. But notwithstanding this plausible ground of
                    suspicion, when I came to examine it, I could observe no such curvity in them.
                    And besides (which was enough for my purpose) I observed, that the difference
                    betwixt the length of the image and. the diameter of the hole, through which the
                    light was transmitted, was proportionable to their distance.</p>
                <p>“The gradual removal of these suspicions at length led me to the <hi
                    rend="italic">experimentum crucis,</hi> which was this. I took two boards, and
                    placed one of them close <hi rend="italic">behind the prism at the window,
                    so</hi> that the light might pass through a small hole, made in it for the
                    purpose, and fall on the other board, which I placed at about 12 feet distance,
                    having first made a small hole in it also for some of that incident light to
                    pass through. Then I placed another prism behind this second board, so that the
                    light trajected through both the boards might pass through that also, and be
                    again refracted before it arrived at the wall. This done, I took the first prism
                    in my hand, and turned it to and fro slowly about its axis, so much as to make
                    the several parts of the image, cast on the second board, successively pass
                    through the hole in it, that I might observe to what places on the wall the
                    second prism would refract them. And I saw, by the variation of those places,
                    that the light, tending to that end of the image towards which the refraction of
                    the first prism was made, did in the second prism suffer a refraction
                    considerably greater than the light tending to the other end. And so the true
                    cause of the length of that image was detected to be no other, than that <hi
                    rend="italic">light</hi> is not similar or homogeneal, but consists of <hi
                    rend="italic">difform rays, some of which are more refrangible than others</hi>;
                    so that without any difference in their incidence on the same medium, some shall
                    be more <hi rend="italic">refracted</hi> than others; and therefore that,
                    according to their <hi rend="italic">particular degrees of refrangibility,</hi>
                    they were transmitted through the prism to divers parts of the opposite
                    wall.”</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">constant ratio</hi> mentioned in the above statement of the
                    law of refraction is called the <hi rend="italic">refractive index.</hi> Its
                    numerical value depends upon the nature of the two media, and also upon the
                    quality of the homogeneous light. It is usually greater for orange light than
                    for red, for yellow than for orange, and so on,—so that the violet rays are
                    often called the “more refrangible” rays.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The following experimental facts are additions to the law.</p>
                <p>When refraction takes place from a rarer into a denser medium, the angle of

                <p>Mi</p>
                <p>These being premised, let us consider a source ⅛f homogeneous light in air
                    shining on a surface of water. Here we may take <hi rend="italic">p</hi> as
                    about equal to ∣.</p>
                <p>Let MN (fig. 12) be the perpendicular to the water surface at the point where the
                    incident ray AP meets it. In the plane APM make the angle QPN such that sin APM
                    = ⅜ sin QPN, then PQ is the refracted ray. If QP be produced backward to meet
                    the vertical line BA in 2, we may present this statement in the form</p>
                <p>PB <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> PB</p>
                <p>PA <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> I⅛ ’ or</p>
                <p>PA≡∣Pg <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>.</p>
                <p>If the rays fall <hi rend="italic">nearly</hi> perpendicularly on the surface, we
                    may put (approximately) B for P, and we have</p>
                <p>Bg=⅜BA.</p>
                <p>Hence, an eye placed under water and nearly in the vertical through A, sees a <hi
                    rend="italic">virtual image</hi> of A at 2, one-third farther from the surface
                    of the water.</p>
                <p>As P is taken farther and farther from A, the angle of incidence becomes more
                    nearly a right angle, and the sine of the angle of refraction becomes more
                    nearly equal to <hi rend="italic">Λ ray cannot go from air into ιvater so as to

                    >.</hi> The true nature of this curious statement is, however, best seen when we
                    suppose the source to be under water, and the light to be refracted into air. If
                    APQ (fig. 13) be the course of a ray, we have as before</p>
                <p>AP-⅜P&lt; <hi rend="subscript"> r</hi>.</p>
                <p>Hence, if Γ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be taken so that</p>
                <p>AP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>-⅜P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> B, it is clear
                    that <hi rend="italic">q</hi> coincides with B, or the ray AP <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, refracted at P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, runs
                    along the surface of the water. If AP. <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> be less than
                    I P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> B, no point <hi rend="italic">q</hi> can be
                    found; so that the ray AP., <hi rend="italic">cannot get out of the water.</hi>
                    It is found to be completely reflected in the water. This reflexion
                    unaccompanied by refraction is called <hi rend="italic">total reflexion.</hi>
                    The limiting angle of incidence (at P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>) which
                    separates the totally reflected rays from those which (at least partially)
                    escape into air is called the <hi rend="italic">critical angle.</hi> When an
                    equilateral triangular prism of glass is placed in a ray of sunlight, and made
                    to rotate, we see (besides the spectra formed by refraction) beams of white
                    light reflected alternately from the <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">inside</hi> of each face. The totally reflected ray from the
                    inside is seen to be very much brighter than that reflected from the
                    outside.</p>
                <p>To an eye placed nearly in the vertical of A, A appears at A <hi rend="subscript"
                    > o</hi>, where</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> B = ≡AB.</p>
                <p>Thus a clear stream, when we look vertically into it, appears to be of only ^ths
                    of its real depth. But when we look more and more obliquely, seeing A for
                    instance by the ray QP, the image appears nearer and nearer to the surface; or,
                    if A be at the bottom, the water will appear more and more shallow; and all
                    objects in it will appear to be crowded towards the surface. Thus the part of a
                    stick immersed in water appears bent up towards the surface of the water.</p>
                <p>Again, to an eye at A, all objects <hi rend="italic">above</hi> the water will be
                    seen within a right cone of which AB is the axis and AP <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> a side. The rest of the water surface, outside the cone just mentioned,
                    shows us objects at the bottom by reflexion in a perfect mirror.</p>
                <p>All this is on the supposition that the light is homogeneous. But when white
                    light is emitted by A, the point A <hi rend="subscript"> o</hi> will be nearer
                    the surface for each constituent the greater is the refractive index. Thus a
                    white point at A will appear drawn out into a coloured line whose lower end is
                    red and upper end violet.</p>
                <p>It is easily seen from the law of refraction that light, on passing through a
                    plate of homogeneous material with parallel faces, finally emerges in a
                    direction parallel to that at incidence, and therefore white light comes out
                    from it still white. If the plate be water in a glass vessel with parallel
                    sides, a body placed close to one side, while the eye is close to the other,
                    appears to be at fths of its real distance from the eye.</p>
                <p>The explanation of the law of refraction, on the corpuscular theory, was given by
                    Newton. It is still of importance, as the earliest instance of the solution of a
                    problem involving molecular forces. Newton shows that, as the molecular forces
                    on a corpuscle balance one another at every point inside either of the media,
                    its velocity must be constant in each, but that in passing through the surface
                    of separation of the two media the square of the velocity perpendicular to the
                    surface undergoes a finite change.</p>
                <p>Thus, if <hi rend="italic">V</hi> bo the velocity in air, <hi rend="italic"
                    >α</hi> the angle of incidence, then in glass the velocity parallel to the
                    surface is still <hi rend="italic">υ</hi> sin <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> but that
                    perpendicula r to t he surface is <hi rend="italic">^fυ</hi><hi rend="italic

                    2</hi>. Thus the whole velocity is V <hi rend="italic">ν</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> i</hi> + α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>; and, if <hi

                <p>Vv <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> + α <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> sin <hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Prisms.—</hi> When the surfaces are plane, but not parallel, we
                    have what is called a <hi rend="italic">prism.</hi></p>
                <p>The general nature of the action of a prism will be easily understood by the help
                    of the previous illustrations, if we restrict ourselves to the case of a prism
                    of very small angle and to rays passing nearly perpendicular to each of its
                    faces. Thus, the rays falling nearly at right angles to its surface from a point
                    A (fig. 14) will, after the first refraction, appear to diverge from aluminous
                    line RV, red at the end next to A, violet at the other. This line is in the
                    perpendicular AB from A to the first surface of the prism. Draw from R and V
                    perpendiculars RS, VT to the second surface of the prism. Join BS, BT, and draw
                    <hi rend="italic">Ar, Av</hi> parallel to them so as to cut RS in <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> and VT in <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> To an eye behind the
                    prism, the bright point A will appear to be drawn out into a coloured line <hi
                    rend="italic">rv,</hi> red at the end nearest to A.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n611/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0611-0592"/>
                <p>If A be a nιrrow bright line of light, parallel to the edge of the prism, it will
                    appear to be drawn out into a rectangle consisting of images of the line ranged
                    parallel to one another, and due to the various homogeneous constituents of
                    white light in order of their refrangibility. If the light do not contain rays
                    of every degree of refrangibility, some of these images will be wanting, and
                    there will be corresponding dark lines or bands crossing this <hi rend="italic"
                    >spectrum</hi> (as it is called). The amount by which any part of this spectrum
                    is shifted from the true position of the bright slit depends <hi rend="italic"
                    >(caeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">paribus)</hi> upon the amount of the
                    refraction. It also depends on the angle of the prism. And, for a given angle,
                    the length of the spectrum depends upon the difference between the refractive
                    indices for the red and the violet rays. This is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dispersion.</hi></p>
                <p>If a second prism, of the same glass, and of the same angle, as the first, be
                    placed in a reversed position behind it (as indicated by the dotted lines in the
                    figure), the effect of the two would be simply that of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >plate</hi> of glass with parallel faces; the emergent rays would each be
                    parallel to its original direction, and there would be no separation of colours.
                    The reversed prism would therefore undo the work of the direct prism. Then we
                    should have no dispersion, but we should also have no refraction. We have,
                    however, as has already been shown, an increase of divergence, 7.e., the image
                    is nearer to the eye than the object. Blair, Brewster, and Amici devised
                    combinations of two pairs of prisms of the same glass, those of each pair having
                    then edges parallel, such that the combination acted as a sort of achromatic
                    telescope of low power.</p>
                <p>Newton, from some rough experiments, hastily concluded that the amount of
                    dispersion is in all substances proportional to that of the refraction. If such
                    were the case it is easy to see that prisms of two differently refracting
                    materials and of correspondingly different angles, combined (as above described)
                    so as to annul the dispersion, would likewise annul the refraction. Thus Newton
                    was led to suppose that refraction without dispersion is impossible.</p>
                <p>It was found by Hall in 1733, and afterwards (independently) by Dollond, that
                    this idea is incorrect—that, in fact, we have in certain media large refraction
                    with comparatively small dispersion, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa,</hi> and
                    thus that the dispersion may be got rid of while a part of the refraction
                    remains. James Gregory had previously conjectured that this might be done by
                    using, <hi rend="italic">as is done in the eye,</hi> more media than one. Thus
                    we have for certain specimens of flint and crown glass, whose optical constants
                    were carefully measured by Fraunhofer, the following values of the refractive
                    index for three definite kinds of homogeneous light :—</p>

                    opposite directions, the C and F images will coincide. Both, however, will be
                    displaced from the real direction of A as if a prism had been employed, with its
                    edge turned as that of the crown glass was, and to the same extent as that prism
                    would have displaced them had its refractive index been about 1 ∙21 and the same
                    for the two kinds of light C and F.</p>
                <p>In fact, the displacements by the flint prism are as</p>
                <p>630, 648, and those by the crown prism (to the opposite side) are as 1054,
                    1072.</p>
                <p>The differences, in favour of the crown prism, are as</p>
                <p>424, 424.</p>
                <p>This combination of prisms is called <hi rend="italic">achromatic,</hi> or
                    colourless, but is not perfectly so. For if we inquire into the displacement of
                    the D image, we find that it is as</p>
                <p>635</p>
                <p>for the flint prism; but as</p>
                <p>1060</p>
                <p>in the opposite direction, for the crown prism. Hence its whole displacement is
                    as</p>
                <p>425, a little greater than that common to C and F. The reason for this is obvious
                    from Fraunhofer’s numbers given above. The interval from C to D is to that from
                    C to F in a greater ratio in crown than in flint glass,—so that the spectra
                    given by these media are not <hi rend="italic">similar.</hi> The rays of higher
                    refrangibility are more separated in proportion to those of lower refrangibility

                <p>By looking through a prism at a very narrow slit, formed by the window shutters
                    of a darkened room, Wollaston (in 1802) found that the light of the sky <hi
                    rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> sunlight) ^ives a spectrum which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >not continuous.</hi> It is crossed by dark bands, as already hinted. These
                    bands are due to the deficiency of intensity of certain definite kinds of
                    homogeneous light. They were, independently, rediscovered, and their positions
                    measured, by Fraunhofer <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> in 1817 with far more
                    perfect optical apparatus. He also found similar, but not the same, deficiencies
                    in the light from various fixed stars. The origin of these bands will be
                    explained in <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiation,</hi> along with the theory of their
                    application in spectrum analysis. In optics they are useful to an extreme degree
                    in enabling us to measure refractive indices with very great precision.
                    Wollaston’s own account of his discovery is as follows :—</p>
                <p>“If a beam of day-light be admitted into a dark room by a crevice √ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th of an inch broad, and received by the eye at the
                    distance of 10 or 12 feet, through a prism of flint-glass, <hi rend="italic"
                    >free from veins,</hi> held near the eye, the beam is seen to be separated into
                    the four following colours only, red, yellowish-green, blue, and violet, in the
                    proportions represented in lig</p>
                <p>“The line A that bounds the red side of the spectrum is somewhat confused, which
                    seems in part owing to want of power in the eye to converge red light. The line
                    B, between red and green, in a certain position of the prism is perfectly
                    distinct; so also are D and E, the two limits of violet. But C, the limit of
                    green and blue, is not so clearly marked as the rest; and there are also on each
                    side of this limit other distinct dark lines <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">g,</hi> either of which in an imperfect experiment might be
                    mistaken for the boundary of these colours.</p>
                <p>“The position of the prism in which the colours are most clearly &lt;livided is
                    when the incident light makes about equal angles with two of its sides. I then
                    found that the spaces AB, BC, CD, DE occupied by them were nearly as the numbers
                    16, 23, 36, 25.” <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>The mode of formation of a spectrum which was employed by Newton, and which is
                    still used when the spectrum is to be seen by many spectators at a time, differs
                    from that just explained in this, that the light from a source A is allowed to
                    pass through the prism, and to fall on a white screen at a considerable distance
                    from it. In this case the paths of the various rays as they ultimately escape
                    from the prism are found by joining the points <hi rend="italic">r,....ν,</hi>
                    with the prism and producing these lines to meet the screen. Unless one surface
                    of the prism be covered by an opaque plate, with a narrow slit in it parallel to
                    the edge of the prism, the spectrum produced iu this way is very <hi
                    rend="italic">impure, i.e.,</hi> the spaces occupied by the various homogeneous
                    rays overlap one another. To make it really pure an achromatic lens is
                    absolutely requisite. This leads us, naturally, to the consideration of the
                    refraction of light at spherical surfaces.</p>

                <p>This quantity is the divergence or convergence of rays falling on the lens from
                    or passing from it to its principal focus. Or it is the convergence or
                    divergence which the lens produces in parallel rays. Thus, if the distance of an
                    object from a convex lens is twice the focal length of the lens, the image is
                    formed at the same distance from the lens, and is equal in size to the
                    object.</p>

                    lenses which produce <hi rend="italic">convergence</hi> of parallel rays—along
                    with the rays by which these are seen by an eye placed behind the lens. In
                    either case it is obvious that the sizes of object and image are, respectively,
                    as their distances from the centre of the lens.</p>
                <p>Fig. 18 shows how a lens produces a real inverted image of a body placed farther
                    from it than its principal focus. This is the case in the camera obscura, in the
                    solar microscope, and in the object glass of a telescope. Fig. 19 shows how a
                    virtual image is formed of a body placed nearer to a lens than its principal
                    focus. This is the case of a single lens used as a microscope. In the former
                    case the divergence of the incident rays is so small that the lens renders them
                    convergent. In the latter the divergence is so great that the lens can only
                    diminish, not destroy it.</p>
                <p>In using a hand-magnifier in this way, we so adjust it, by practice, that the
                    enlarged image appears to be formed at the distance from the eye at which vision
                    is most distinct. It is obvious that the amount of magnification must, then, be
                    greater as the focal length of the lens is less.</p>
                <p>We can now understand the working of the ordinary <hi rend="italic">astronomical
                    telescope</hi> (fig. 20). The object glass furnishes an inverted but real image
                    of a distant body, <hi rend="italic">within our reach.</hi> We can, therefore,
                    place the eye-glass (like the single microscope above spoken of) so as to form a
                    virtual magnified image of this real image treated as an object. It is still, of
                    course, inverted. It is easy to see that the angle subtended at the eye by the
                    virtual image seen through the eye-piece is to that subtended by the object at
                    the unaided eye approximately as the focal length of the object lens is to that
                    of the eye lens. These angles are, in fact, those subtended . at the centres of
                    the two lenses by the real image. This ratio is, therefore, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">magnifying power</hi> of the telescope.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">compound microscope,</hi> in its simplest form, is
                    precisely the same arrangement as the astronomiβal telescope. The only
                    difference is that the object, being at hand, can be placed near to the
                    object-glass (still, however, beyond its principal focus), so that the real
                    image formed is already considerably larger than the object, and is then still
                    further magnified by the eye-glass.</p>

                <p>The magnifying power of a single lens, when used as a hand microscope, is to be
                    measured by the ratio of the angle under which the virtual image of an object is
                    seen (at the distance of most distinct vision) to that at which the object
                    itself would be seen (at that same distance); <hi rend="italic">i,e.,</hi> it is
                    the ratio of 10 inches to the focal length of the lens.</p>

                <p>These questions, however, are beyond the scope of this article. We can remark

                    lenses one must be convex and the other concave.</p>
                <p>The reader must, however, be reminded that we are dealing with a first
                    approximation only, and that spherical aberration does not come in till we reach
                    a second. The details for a proper achromatic combination will be given in <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Optics (Geometrical).</hi></p>
                <p>Before leaving this subject, we must find the behaviour of two thin lenses which
                    are placed at a finite distance from one another. For the first lens we have, as
                    before, <hi rend="italic">w u~* f</hi></p>
                <p>If the second lens be placed at a distance <hi rend="italic">a</hi> behind the
                    first, the rays which fall on it appear to come from a distance <hi
                    rend="italic">w + a.</hi> Hence, for the light emerging from the second lens, we
                    have</p>
                <p>_1 L· <hi rend="subscript"> =</hi> 2_</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x w+aff</hi></p>
                <p>When <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is infinite, we have from the last two
                    equations</p>
                <p>J--J- <hi rend="subscript"> +</hi> l .</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x f+a f</hi> ’</p>
                <p>It is obvious that a combination of this nature offers the same kind of
                    facilities for the partial cure of dispersion and of spherical aberration as
                    when the lenses are in contact, with <hi rend="italic">one</hi> additional
                    disposable constant. Thus we have compound <hi rend="italic">achromatic
                    eye-pieces,</hi> which can be corrected for spherical aberration also.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Formation of a Pure Spectrum.—</hi> We may now go back to the
                    formation of an image by a prism, and inquire how, by the use of an achromatic
                    lens, we can project a pure spectrum on a screen. We have seen that a thin
                    prism, for rays falling nearly perpendicular to it, forms a virtual and
                    approximately rectilineal image of a luminous point, in which the colours are
                    ranged in order of refrangibility. Suppose the light which passes through the
                    prism to fall on an achromatic lens, placed at a distance greater than its focal
                    length from the virtual image above mentioned. These rays after passing through
                    the lens will proceed to form, at the proper distance, a real linear coloured
                    image of the luminous point, in which (as in the virtual image) the colours do
                    not overlap. Instead of a luminous point, rays diverging from a very narrow slit
                    parallel to the edge of the prism are employed. It is usual to place the lens at
                    <hi rend="italic">double</hi> its focal distance from the virtual image, and
                    thus the real image is formed at an equal distance on the other side of it, and
                    is of the same size. It may now, if required, be magnified by means of an
                    achromatic eye-piece. Or, in other words, it may be examined by means of a
                    telescope. In fact a telescope, whose object glass is covered by a thin prism,
                    has been usefully employed during a total eclipse in examining the light of the
                    solar corona. A similar arrangement, made to have an exceptionally large field
                    of view, is employed to find the nature of the spectra of meteorites or falling
                    stars.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refraction at a Cylindrical Surface.—</hi> A very simple, but
                    interesting, case of refraction at a cylindrical surface is furnished by a
                    thermometer tube. It is easily seen that the diameter of the bore appears, to an
                    eye at a distance large as compared with the diameter of the tube, to be greater
                    than it really is, in the proportion of the refractive index of the glass to
                    unity. Thus in flint glass it appears magnified in about the ratio 5: 3. Hence
                    the mercury appears completely to fill the external surface of such a tube, if
                    the bore be only ⅜ths of the external diameter.</p>
                <p>But a far more interesting case is that of parallel rays falling on a solid
                    cylinder of glass or water. Its interest consists in the fact that by its aid we
                    can explain the phenomena of the <hi rend="italic">rainbow.</hi> We,
                    accordingly, devote special attention to it The problem, without losing any of
                    its applicability to the rainbow, is much simplified by supposing the rays to be
                    incident in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the cylinder; for in this
                    case the whole course of each ray is in a plane perpendicular to the axis. We
                    need not treat here of rays which pass <hi rend="italic">close to</hi> the axis
                    of the cylinder. For such the cylinder acts as a lens, and its focal length (to
                    the usual first approximation) can easily be obtained by methods such as those
                    given above.</p>
                <p>What we are mainly concerned with is the behaviour of the rays which escape into
                    the air, after <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or <hi rend="italic">two</hi>
                    reflexions at the inner surface of the cylinder.</p>
                <p>Suppose first that we consider a ray once reflected in the interior of the
                    cylinder. Let SP (fig. 21) be one of the set of incident parallel rays, and let
                    its path be SPQP'S ’. This involves refraction at P, reflexion at Q, and again
                    refraction<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n615/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0615-0596"/> at P'. But it is obvious from the symmetry of the
                    circular section, and from the laws of refraction and reflexion, that this path
                    is symmetrical about the line OQ which joins the axis of the cylinder to the
                    point at which the ray is reflected. Hence SP, S'P' meet OQ in the common point
                    s; and the amount by which the direction of the ray has been turned round by the
                    refractions and the reflexion is twice the supplement of half the angle at s.
                    But the angle POR is double OPQ the angle of refraction, while OPs is equal to
                    the angle of incidence. Hence the half angle at s is the excess of twice the
                    angle of refraction over the angle of incidence.</p>
                <p>Turn now to fig. 22, in which we have two concentric circles whose radii are to
                    one another as the refractive index of the cylinder is to unity. If A be any
                    point on a diameter, and tangents <hi rend="italic">Ap</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Aq</hi> be drawn from it, we see at once that the sines of the
                    angles at A are to one another as the radii of the circles. Hence, if <hi
                    rend="italic">OAp</hi> be the angle of incidence, OA# is the corresponding angle
                    of refraction; and it is easy to see that the half angle at s (in fig. 21) will
                    in fig. 22 be represented by the <hi rend="italic">excess</hi> of OAy over <hi
                    rend="italic">qAp.</hi> Now when OA is large, both of these angles are small,
                    and thus their difference is likewise small. As OA becomes less the difference
                    of the angles becomes greater, but only up to a certain point, for when A is
                    near the outer circle the angle <hi rend="italic">OAp</hi> begins to increase
                    much faster than does OAg. Hence there is a single definite position of A for
                    which the difference is a <hi rend="italic">maximum.</hi> In the first figure
                    these changes in the angles of incidence and refraction, for the members of a
                    group of parallel rays, correspond to the varying position of P in the circular
                    section of the cylinder. Hence there is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> position of P
                    for which the angle at s is a maximum. Now one of the conditions of a maximum or
                    minimum of any quantity is that, near it, the value of the quantity <hi
                    rend="italic">changes very slowly.</hi> Thus a number of issuing rays are
                    crowded together near the direction corresponding to this maximum, the others
                    being more widely scattered,—while for all of them the angle at s is smaller.
                    Newton gives us as an illustration of this, the very slow change of length of
                    the day when the sun is near one of the tropics.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">To find this Maximum Angle.—</hi> If <hi rend="italic">θ</hi>

                    determines the requisite angle of incidence. The values of the other quantities
                    are easily calculated from this; and we finally have, for the maximum value of
                    the sine of the half angle at <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> the expression</p>
                <p>⅛(⅛- ’)* &lt;‘&gt;·</p>
                <p>This is obviously smaller as <hi rend="italic">μ</hi> is greater, at least up to

                <p>Now suppose the diameter of the cylinder to be small compared with the distance
                    of the eye from it. In this case the point s may be considered as being in the

                    will receive the rays which are congregated towards the maximum. An eye <hi

                    eye outside that angle (as at E <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) will see nothing.
                    Let there now be imagined a great number of parallel cylinders; let E <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> σ be drawn parallel to the incident rays, and make the
                    angle σE <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> s'</p>
                <p>equal to σE <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> s. Then the eye at E <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will see the concentrated rays (already spoken of) in
                    the directions E <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> s and E <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> s'. From points within sE <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> s' some straggling
                    rays will reach it, from points outside that angle none.</p>
                <p>Now suppose cylinders to be placed in great numbers <hi rend="italic">in all
                    directions</hi> perpendicular to the incident rays. The eye at E <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> will see a bright <hi rend="italic">circle</hi> of
                    light whose centre is in E <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> σ. Inside that circle
                    there will be feeble illumination; outside it, darkness. This is obviously the
                    case of the rainbow, where we have spherical drops of water instead of the
                    cylinders above spoken of. For each spherical drop is effective only in virtue
                    of a section through its centre, containing the incident ray and the eye; and
                    such sections are the same as those of the cylinders.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have been dealing with <hi rend="italic">parallel</hi> rays of <hi
                    rend="italic">homogeneous</hi> light; and the appearance (to the degree of
                    approximation we have adopted) is that of a bright circle whose centre is
                    diametrically opposite to the source of light, whose radius is (for raindrops)
                    about 42° 2', and whose area is slightly illuminated.</p>
                <p>Introduce the idea of the different kinds of homogeneous light which make up
                    sunlight, and we find a circular (almost pure) spectrum—the less refrangible
                    rays being on the outside. Next we introduce the consideration of the finite
                    disk of the sun, and we have an infinite series of such arrangements superposed
                    on one another, the centre of each individual of the series being at the point
                    diametrically opposite to the point of the sun’s disk which produced it. This
                    leaves the <hi rend="italic">general</hi> aspect of the phenomenon unchanged,
                    but altogether destroys the purity of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>If we next consider light which has been twice reflected within the cylinder, we
                    have a figure like the diagram fig. 21; where the lettering is as nearly as
                    possible the same as that in fig. 23. Everything is still symmetrical about the
                    line Os, which obviously cuts at right angles the ray QQ'. .</p>
                <p>Reasoning precisely similar to that above given shows that the complement of half
                    the angle at s is now equal to the excess of <hi rend="italic">thmce</hi> the
                    angle of refraction (OPQ) over that of incidence (the supplement of OPs), and
                    that this also has a maximum value, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that s itself
                    has a minimum value.</p>

                <p>Carrying out the same steps of reasoning as before, and applying the result to
                    raindrops, we find a second rainbow concentric with the first, but with a
                    greater radius, viz., about 51° (for yellow light). All the above remarks about
                    the impurity of the spectrum, &lt;fcc., apply to this bow also. In this bow the
                    less refrangible rays are on the <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> side, and the
                    straggling rays illuminate feebly the space <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> it.
                    Hence the space between the red boundaries of the two bows has no illumination
                    from rays reflected either once or twice within the water drops.</p>
                <p>What we have now given is nearly all that geometrical optics can tell us about
                    the rainbow. It seems that the first really important steps in the explanation,
                    viz., (1) that the primary bow is due to rays falling on the outer portions of
                    the drops, which suffer two refractions and one reflexion before reaching the
                    eye, and (2) that the secondary bow is due to rays falling on the inner side,
                    and suffering two refractions and two reflexions, are due to Theodorich, about
                    1311. His work was not published, and its contents were first announced by
                    Venturi<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    These results were, independently, discovered by De Dominis<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Newton, in his <hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi>
                    says the work of De Dominis was written twenty years before it was
                    published.</p></note> in 1611. Neither of these writers, however, pointed out
                    the concentration of the rays in particular directions. This was done by
                    Descartes in 1637, by the help of Snell’s law. He calculated with great labour
                    the paths of each of 10,000 parallel rays falling on different parts of one side
                    of the drop, and showed that from the 8500th to the 8600th the angle between the
                    extreme issuing rays is measured in <hi rend="italic">minutes</hi> of arc,—thus
                    discovering by sheer arithmetic the maximum which, as we have seen above, is so
                    easily found by less laborious methods. Newton’s addition to this theory
                    consisted mainly in applying his discovery of the different refrangibilities of
                    the different homogeneous rays. The explanation was then thought to be complete.
                    For a long time this was held to be one of Newton’s most brilliant discoveries.
                    It is well to notice that he himself speaks of it in its true relation to the
                    work of his predecessors. He merely says :—“But whilst they understood not the
                    true origin of colours, it is necessary to pursue it here <hi rend="italic">a
                    little further?'</hi> And he said well; for a full investigation conducted on
                    the principles of the undulatory theory introduces, as was first pointed out by
                    Young, certain important modifications in the above statements. Of these we need
                    mention only one, viz., that in each bow there is more than one maximum of
                    brightness for each homogeneous ray. The <hi rend="italic">spumous</hi> bows, as
                    they are called, which often appear like ripples, inside the primary and outside
                    the secondary bow, and which depend upon the fact just mentioned, have no place
                    in even Newton’s theory. About them, in fact, geometrical optics has nothing to
                    say. Young, in 1804, took the first step for their explanation. They were fully
                    investigated, from the undulatory point of view, by Airy, in 1836-38; and his
                    results were completely verified by the measurements of Hallows Miller in
                    1841.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Airy’s paper is in
                    vol. vi. of the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge PhU. Trans.,</hi> Miller’s in vol.
                    vii.</p></note> Miller used a fine cylinder of water escaping vertically from a
                    can. This is <hi rend="italic">one</hi> of the reasons which induced us to treat
                    the subject as a case of refraction and reflexion in a right cylinder.</p>
                <p>The overlapping of the colours in the rainbow, due to the apparent size of the
                    sun’s disk, is occasionally so greatly exaggerated that only faint traces of
                    colour appear. This may happen, for instance, when the sun shines on raindrops
                    in the lower strata of the atmosphere through clouds of icecrystals in the
                    higher strata. By reflexion from the faces of these crystals, the source of
                    light is spread over a much larger spherical angle, and there is no sharp edge
                    to it as in the case of the unclouded disk. The rainbow is then much broader and
                    fainter than usual, and nearly white. The size of the drops also produces
                    modifications which are not indicated by the geometrical theory.</p>
                <p>When the moon is the source of light, the rainbow is so faint that it is often
                    difficult to distinguish the colours; but with full moon, and other favourable
                    circumstances, it is easy to assure one’s self that the colours are really
                    present.</p>
                <p>The refraction of sunlight, or moonlight, through icecrystals forming cirrhus
                    clouds, gives rise to coloured <hi rend="italic">halos, parhelia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">paraselenae,</hi> &amp;c. Their approximate explanation depends
                    upon the behaviour of prisms with angles of 60° or 90°, and therefore does not
                    come within the scope of the present article. They must not, however, be
                    confounded with <hi rend="italic">coronae,</hi> those rings which encircle the
                    sun or moon when seen through a mist or cloud. Halos have definite radii
                    depending on the definite angles of ice-crystals; the size of a corona depends
                    on the size of the drops of water in a mist or cloud, being smaller as the drops
                    are larger. Thus their diminution in radius shows that the drops are becoming
                    larger, and implies approaching rain. They are due to <hi rend="italic"
                    >diffraction,</hi> and can only be explained by the help of the undulatory
                    theory.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refraction in a Nan-Homogeneous Medium.—</hi> The principles
                    already explained are sufficient for the purpose of treating this question also.
                    But they require, for their application, the artifice of supposing the medium to
                    be made up of layers, in each of which the refractive power is the same
                    throughout the layer, but finitely differs from one layer to another, and then
                    supposing these layers to become infinitely thin and infinitely numerous. In
                    this case there will of course be only an infinitely small difference in
                    properties between contiguous layers; and the abrupt change of direction which
                    accompanies ordinary refraction is now replaced by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >continuous curvature</hi> of the path of the ray.</p>
                <p>Glimpses of a more general method had been obtained even in the 17th century; and
                    in the 18th these had become a consistent process so far as application to the
                    corpuscular theory is concerned. But it was reserved for Sir W. R. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hamilton</hi> (g ’.v.) to discover the existence of what he
                    called the <hi rend="italic">characteristic function,</hi> by the help of which
                    all optical problems, whether on the corpuscular or on the undulatory theory,
                    are solved by one common process. Hamilton was in possession of the germs of
                    this grand theory some years before 1824, but it was first communicated to the
                    Royal Irish Academy in that year, and published in imperfect instalments some
                    years later. The following is his own description of it. It is extremely
                    important as showing his views on a very singular part of the more modern
                    history of science.</p>
                <p>“Those who have meditated on the beauty and utility, in theoretical mechanics, of

                    attain a coordinate rank with mathematical mechanics . . . , when it shall
                    possess an appropriate method, and become the unfolding of a central idea. ...
                    It appears that if a general method in deductive optics can be attained at all,
                    it must flow from some law or principle, itself of the highest generality, and
                    among the highest results of induction. . . . [This] must be the principle, or
                    law, called usually the Law of Least Action; suggested by questionable views,
                    but established on the widest induction, and embracing every known combination
                    of media, and every straight, or bent, or curved line, ordinary or
                    extraordinary, along which light (whatever light may be) extends its influence
                    successively in space and time: namely, that this linear path of light, from one
                    point to another, is always found to be such that, if it be compared with the
                    other infinitely various lines by which in thought and in geometry the same two
                    points might be connected, a certain integral or sum, called often <hi
                    rend="italic">Action,</hi> and depending by fixed rules on the length, and
                    shape, and position of the path, and on the media which are traversed by it, is
                    less than all the similar integrals for the other neighbouring lines, or, at
                    least, possesses, with respect to them, a certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >stationary</hi> property. From this Law, then, which may, perhaps, be named the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Law of Stationary Action,</hi> it seems that we may most
                    fitly and with best hope set out, in the synthetic or deductive process and in
                    the search of a mathematical method.</p>
                <p>“Accordingly, from this known law of least or stationary action I deduced (long
                    since) another connected and coextensive principle, which may be called by
                    analogy the <hi rend="smallcaps">Law of Varying Action,</hi> and which seems to
                    offer naturally a method such as we are seeking; the one law being as it were
                    the last step in the ascending scale of induction, respecting linear paths of
                    light, while the other law may usefully be made the first in the descending and
                    deductive way.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ The former of these two laws was discovered in the following manner. The
                    elementary principle of straight rays showed that light, under the most simple
                    and usual circumstances, employs the direct, and therefore the shortest, course
                    to pass from one point to another. Again, it was a very early discovery
                    (attributed by Laplace to Ptolemy), that, in the case of a plane mirror, the
                    bent line formed by the incident and reflected rays is shorter than any other
                    bent line having the same extremities, and having its point of bending on the
                    mirror. These facts were thought by some to be instances and results of the
                    simplicity and economy of nature; and Fermat, whose researches on maxima and
                    minima are claimed by the Continental mathematicians as the germ of the
                    differential calculus, sought anxiously to trace some similar economy in the
                    more complex case of refraction. He believed that by a metaphysical or
                    cosmological necessity, arising from the simplicity of the universe, light
                    always takes the course which it can traverse in the shortest time. To reconcile
                    this metaphysical opinion with the law of refraction, discovered experimentally
                    by Snellius, Fermat was led to suppose that the two lengths, or <hi
                    rend="italic">indices,</hi> which Snellius had measured on the incident ray
                    prolonged and on the refracted ray, and had observed to have one common
                    projection on a refracting plane, are inversely proportional to the two
                    successive velocities of the light before and after refraction, and therefore
                    that the velocity of light is diminished on entering those denser media in which
                    it is observed to approach the perpendicular; for Fermat believed that the time
                    of propagation of light along a line bent by refraction was represented by the
                    sum of the two products, of the incident portion multiplied by the index of the
                    first medium, and of the refracted portion multiplied by the index of the second
                    medium; because he found, by his mathematical method, that this sum was less, in
                    the case of a plane refractor, than if light went by any other than its actual
                    path from one given point to another, and because he perceived that the
                    supposition of a velocity inversely as the index reconciled his mathematical
                    discovery of the minimum of the foregoing sum with his cosmological principle of
                    least time. Descartes attacked Fermat’s opinions respecting light, but Leibnitz
                    zealously defended them; and Huygens was led, by reasonings of a very different
                    kind, to adopt Fermat’s conclusions of a velocity inversely as the index, and of
                    a <hi rend="italic">minimum time</hi> of propagation of light, in passing from
                    one given point to another through an ordinary refracting plane. Newton,
                    however, by his theory of emission and attraction, was led to conclude that the
                    velocity of light was <hi rend="italic">directly,</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                    >inversely,</hi> as the index, and that it was <hi rend="italic">increased</hi>
                    instead of being <hi rend="italic">diminished</hi> on entering a denser medium;
                    a result incompatible with the theorem of the shortest time in refraction. This
                    theorem of shortest time was accordingly abandoned by many, and among the rest
                    by Maupertuis, who, however, proposed in its stead, as a new cosmological
                    principle, that <hi rend="italic">celebrated law of least action</hi> which has
                    since acquired so high a rank in mathematical physics, by the improvements of
                    Euler and Lagrange.</p>
                <p>“Maupertuis gave the name of <hi rend="italic">action</hi> to the product of
                    space and velocity, or rather to the sum of all such products for the various
                    elements of any motion,—conceiving that the more space has been traversed and
                    the less time it has been traversed in, the more action may be considered to
                    have been expended; and by combining this idea of action with Newton’s estimate
                    of the velocity of light as increased by a denser medium, and as proportional to
                    the refracting index, and with Fermat’s mathematical theorem of the minimum sum
                    of the products of paths and indices in ordinary refraction at a plane, he
                    concluded that the course chosen by light corresponded always to the <hi
                    rend="italic">least possible action,</hi> though not always to the least
                    possible time. He proposed this view as reconciling physical and metaphysical
                    principles which the results of Newton had seemed to put in opposition to each
                    other; and he soon proceeded to extend his law of least action to the phenomena
                    of the shock of bodies. Euler, attached to Maupertuis, and pleased with these
                    novel results, employed his own great mathematical powers to prove that the law
                    of least action extends to all the curves described by points under the
                    influence of central forces; or, to speak more precisely, that if any such curve
                    be compared with any other curve between the same extremities, which differs
                    from it indefinitely little in shape and in position, and may be imagined to be
                    described by a neighbouring point with the same law of velocity, and if we give
                    the name of action to the integral of the product of the velocity and element of
                    a curve, the difference of the two neighbouring values of this action will be
                    indefinitely less than the greatest linear distance (itself indefinitely small)
                    between the two near curves; a theorem which I think may be advantageously
                    expressed by saying that the action is <hi rend="italic">stationary.</hi>
                    Lagrange extended this theorem of Euler to the motion of a system of points or
                    bodies which act in any manner on each other; the action being in this case the
                    sum of the masses by the foregoing integrals.</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ Laplace has also extended the use of the principle in optics, by applying it
                    to the refraction of crystals, ana has pointed out an analogous principle in
                    mechanics, for all imaginable connexions between force and velocity.”</p>
                <p>We give, first, a very brief indication of the nature of Hamilton’s method, as
                    applicable directly to the corpuscular theory. Here the <hi rend="italic"
                    >action</hi> of a corpuscle is the quantity which possesses the stationary
                    property. Let <hi rend="italic">v</hi> be the velocity at any point <hi

                    depends upon a change of the terminal point of the ray, and leads at once to the

                <p>The treatment of this equation is precisely the same as that of the corresponding
                    one which will presently be derived from the undulatory view of the
                    question.</p>
                <p>We will now illustrate the application of Hamilton’s method to the undulatory
                    theory, in which the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> of passage from one point of
                    the path to another is the characteristic which fulfils the stationary
                    condition. For the sake of limitation, we will confine ourselves to its
                    application to single refraction in a non-homogeneous medium. In such a medium
                    the velocity of light, at any point, is the same whatever be the direction of
                    the ray. Hence it depends only upon the coordinates of the point, and upon some
                    characteristic (say the wave-length) of the light considered.</p>
                <p>If τ be this time of passage, <hi rend="italic">ds</hi> an element of the path,
                    andv the velocity of light in that element, we must have <hi rend="italic"
                    >J</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> υ</hi><hi rend="italic">*</hi> a quantity
                    fulfilling the stationary condition. This gives <hi rend="italic">∕</hi><hi

                <p>Now, by what has just been said, if λ be the wave-length, we have an equation

                    are necessary, and sufficient, for the purpose of making the two intersecting

                <p>As an illustration, let us suppose the light to be homogeneous, and the medium to
                    be arranged in concentric spherical shells such that the velocity at a distance

                    passes through the origin is ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>.</p>
                <p>Hence every ray in any diametral plane describes a circle; and pairs of conjugate
                    foci are situated on a line through the centre, the rectangle under their

                    all rays in the medium. This very singular ideal arrangement was suggested to
                    Clerk Maxwell by the eye of a fish. He has given an investigation of it, by a
                    totally different analysis, in the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge and Dublin
                    Mathematical Journal,</hi> vol. ix. As an illustration of those effects of want
                    of homogeneity to which (as already stated) all the complex phenomena of <hi
                    rend="italic">mirage,</hi> &amp;c., are due, it may be well to consider this
                    simple case more closely. We will therefore consider how images are seen in such
                    a medium. To get rid of the difficulty which would arise from finite change of
                    density if an eye were supposed to be plunged in the medium, we will suppose it
                    to be cut across by a crevasse whose surface is everywhere nearly at right
                    angles to the rays by which the image is to be seen,—the eye being then placed
                    (in air) close to such a cutting surface.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 25) be a small object, 0 the centre of the spherical layers of equal
                    refractive index. Then every ray from A describes a circle which passes through
                    A', where A0A' is a straight line, and</p>
                <p>AO.OA'-δ <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>.</p>
                <p>A similar construction gives B' from B.</p>
                <p>To an eye placed at E <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> (in a little crevasse as
                    before explained), and looking towards the object, it will be seen erect,— A
                    being seen in the direction of a tangent to the circle through AE <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> A ’, and similarly for B. Here the rays have not passed
                    through their conjugate focus. But if the eye be now turned away from the
                    object, it (or rather its image) will be seen, A' in the direction opposite to
                    that in which A was seen, B' in the opposite direction to B. The image will now
                    be an <hi rend="italic">inverted</hi> one, but it will easily be seen to possess
                    a strange peculiarity. For what is now seen will be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >back</hi> of the object, the side farthest from the eye. The reader may easily
                    trace for himself the course of the rays which would fall on the eye in any
                    other assigned position. Vision in such cases would usually be of a peculiar
                    character from another point of view, viz., the amount of divergence in the
                    plane of the figure will in general differ from that perpendicular to its plane,
                    and therefore the rays would have different divergence for the height and for
                    the breadth of the image. These would therefore appear at different distances
                    from the spectator. This, however, could be cured by a proper cylindrical lens.
                    It is clear from this example (which has been chosen for its special simplicity)
                    that want of <pb break="no"

                    producing phenomena of the most extraordinary character.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to ascertain exactly what is the condition of the atmosphere when
                    multiple images, mirage, &amp;c., are seen; and it is obvious from the remarks
                    and illustrations already given that many very different arrangements will
                    produce sensibly the same result to a spectator in a given position. Comparison
                    of the appearances seen simultaneously by a great number of scattered observers
                    is the only way in which we can expect to obtain definite information on such a
                    point. But the following investigation suggests the general nature of the
                    explanation.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the refractive index of the air to depend only upon the vertical
                    height above the earth’s surface, rays will all travel in vertical planes, and
                    Hamilton’s equation (neglecting the curvature of the earth’s surface) takes the
                    very simple form</p>
                <p>(S)÷(g)*-∕ω∙</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">x</hi> being measured ho rizontally, and the refractive index
                    being proportional to</p>
                <p>This equation gives, as before,</p>
                <p>τ <hi rend="italic">=- ax +Jdy∖∕f{y) - aø,</hi> and the equation of the path of a
                    ray is</p>
                <p>⅛-a-≈-.4 <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> Λ=.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">da J∖f{y)-</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;</hi></p>
                <p>Here, on the corpuscular theory, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the horizontal
                    velocity of the light, and <hi rend="italic">∖JJ∖y} -</hi> α <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi> the vertical velocity. If the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">f</hi> and the value of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be such that we
                    can have ∕ <hi rend="italic">(∙η')</hi>- α <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> = 0,
                    it is clear that at <hi rend="italic">y=n</hi> the ray is for a moment
                    horizontal. The form of the equation of the ray shows that it has a <hi
                    rend="italic">vertex</hi> at this point, and that it is symmetrical about a
                    vertical axis passing through the vertex. If ξ, η be the coordinates of the
                    vertex for a ray passing through the point 0, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> we have
                    the relation <hi rend="superscript"> w</hi> &lt;⅛</p>
                <p>This is the equation of the locus of the vertices of all rays which, starting
                    from a given point, return again to the same level. To find, then, the various
                    rays by which a distant object near the horizon can be seen, all that we have to
                    do is to draw the curve of vertices which passes through the eye of the
                    spectator, and to find the points in which it is intersected by a vertical line
                    situated midway between the object and the eye. Each of these points is the
                    vertex of a ray by which the object can be seen. When the curve of vertices
                    leans forward towards the eye at one of these points, two contiguous rays cross
                    one another, and an inverted image is seen; when it leans from the eye, they do
                    not cross, and the image is erect.</p>
                <p>Now, when the curve of vertices is traced, from the above formula, for an
                    arrangement of the air such that the refractive index falls off through a
                    horizontal stratum of air from a greater value below the stratum to a smaller
                    value above it, it is found that the curve of vertices in the· stratum can in
                    general be cut by a vertical line in one point only. But if the refractive index
                    have a nearly <hi rend="italic">stationary</hi> value at the upper boundary of
                    the stratum the curve of vertices can be cut twice, or not at all, by a vertical
                    line. When there is no intersection we have only the direct image; but when
                    there are two intersections a distant ship will be seen as usual through the
                    lower uniform air, while there will be seen above it an inverted image, and then
                    a direct image, both due to the stratum. This is a form of mirage very commonly
                    seen at sea.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    especially Vince, in the Bakerian Lecture, <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trαns.,</hi>
                    1799.</p></note> When there is no <hi rend="italic">stationary</hi> value of the
                    index at the upper boundary, the upper erect image is not given by the stratum.
                    This arrangement, however, turned upside down, explains the ordinary mirage of
                    the desert—where we see objects directly through the nearly uniform air at some
                    distance above the sand, but also an inverted image (suggesting reflexion from a
                    pool or lake) formed by the refraction in the hot layer of air near the
                    sand.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Absorption, Fluorescence.</hi> —We must now take up the <hi
                    rend="italic">third</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> of the categories
                    under which light incident on the bounding surface of two media may fall <hi
                    rend="italic">—scattering</hi> and <hi rend="italic">absorption.</hi> We take
                    them together, because in the great majority of bodies, as we have already seen,
                    scattering takes place not merely at the surface but within some distance below
                    the surface, which in general is small, but in some cases considerable. And when
                    the scattering takes place, even in part only, below the surface, the scattered
                    light is usually modified by absorption.</p>
                <p>An excellent instance of this scattering from below the surface is afforded by a
                    mass of thin films or small particles of transparent bodies, such as glass,
                    water, or ice. Thus pounded glass, froth or foam, snow, clouds, &amp;c., appear
                    brilliantly white in sunlight, and are, in consequence, opaque when in layers of
                    sufficient thickness. Here the light is obviously scattered by reflexion. What
                    passes through one film, crystal, or particle is, in part, reflected from the
                    next, and so on.</p>
                <p>Even when the froth consists of bubbles of a highly coloured liquid, such as
                    porter for instance, it usually shows but slight traces of colour, for the great
                    majority of the scattered rays have passed through very small thicknesses only
                    of the liquid. In the same way, very finely pounded blue or red glass (unless it
                    be exceedingly deeply coloured when in mass) appears nearly white. But when a
                    mass of water is full of air bubbles, as, for instance, is the case in the
                    neighbourhood of a breaker, the light reflected from the surfaces of these
                    bubbles suffers a double absorption by the water before it reaches the eye. This
                    is one of the causes of the exquisite colours of the sea. Near shore, or in
                    shoal water, another cause sometimes comes into play, viz., fine solid particles
                    suspended in the water. When such particles, whether in air or in water, are
                    exceedingly small, they may produce colours due to their minuteness alone, and
                    not to their own colour nor to the absorptive properties of the medium. This,
                    however, is a question of physical optics.</p>
                <p>In general, even the most highly coloured opaque or translucent solids, such as
                    painted wood or stained paper, are visible by scattered light whatever portion
                    of the spectrum falls on them. This is very well seen with highly coloured
                    paper-hangings, when illuminated by homogeneous light, such as that of a sodium
                    flame (a Bunsen flame, into which is thrust a platinum wire dipped in strong
                    brine). The red, orange, and yellow parts usually appear very bright under such
                    treatment, the blue parts appearing but slightly illuminated. The colour of all
                    is, of course, that of the incident light. It appears, therefore, that <hi
                    rend="italic">some</hi> of the light is scattered from the surface. It is by
                    this, for instance, that the blue parts are feebly visible. But that which is
                    scattered from the portions coloured red, orange, &amp;c., must come mainly from
                    under the surface.</p>
                <p>An excellent proof of this is furnished by mixing, in proper proportions, a
                    yellow and a blue powder, or yellow and blue paints. It is commonly imagined
                    that the green colour which is thus produced is a <hi rend="italic">mixture</hi>
                    of blue and yellow. Far from it! When a disk divided into alternate sectors,
                    coloured with the same blue and yellow pigments, is made to rotate rapidly in
                    its own plane, it of course produces on the eye the true result of a mixture of
                    these blue and yellow colours. This depends for its exact tint on the pigments
                    employed, and on the angles of the sectors, but is usually a faint pink or a
                    muddy purple,—utterly different from the green produced by mixing the powders or
                    the paints. Helmholtz was the first to point out the true source of the green.
                    It is the <hi rend="italic">one colour</hi> which is not freely absorbed either
                    by the yellow or by the blue pigment. For the scattered light by which the
                    mixture is seen comes chiefly from below the surface, and has thus suffered
                    absorption by each of the component powders. The yellow powder removes the
                    greater part of the blue, indigo, and violet rays; the blue, the greater part of
                    the reds, oranges, and yellows. Thus the light which finally escapes is mainly
                    green.</p>
                <p>For the accurate study of the absorptive power of a solid or liquid medium, it is
                    necessary to compare the spectrum of white light which has passed through a
                    plate or layer of it with a normal spectrum. This is easily effected by placing
                    the absorbing medium (if a fluid, it must be in a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n620/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0620-0601"/> glass trough with parallel sides) in front of the
                    narrow slit through which the light passes, and in such a position that one half
                    of the slit only is thus covered. We have then side by side, under precisely
                    similar circumstances, two spectra to be compared (one altered by absorption,
                    the other not); and very minute differences between them can thus be detected.
                    When the medium produces a general weakening of the whole spectrum, as well as
                    particular local absorptions, the white light passing through the other half of
                    the slit may be weakened to any desired extent by reflexion at the proper
                    incidence from a plate of glass, before it falls on the slit.</p>
                <p>To give a satisfactory representation of the phenomena of absorption spectra by
                    the help of a woodcut is not easy. The highest artistic skill could not
                    adequately represent the ordinary solar spectrum by the use of the finest
                    pigments. All optical <hi rend="italic">colour</hi> phenomena must be <hi
                    rend="italic">seen,</hi> they cannot be reproduced by painting. In such
                    circumstances the simplest method of indicating the locality and amount of the
                    absorption is the best. As we have already seen that we cannot by the eye judge
                    of the relative intensities of lights which differ much in colour, we shall
                    represent the normal spectrum (for our present purpose) as equally bright
                    throughout, and indicate the absorption at different parts by shading of various
                    degrees of depth. A few of the Fraunhofer lines are introduced to indicate (in
                    the absence of colour) the parts of the spectrum which are attacked by the
                    various absorbents. These lines are, of course, in the same absolute positions
                    in all the various spectra; for the spectra are all supposed to be given by the
                    same prism. The line B is in the red, D in the orange, E and F in the green, and
                    G in the indigo. They correspond, as we have already said, to perfectly definite
                    kinds of homogeneous light, and therefore adequately represent the distribution
                    of colours in the spectrum, however much irrationality of dispersion may be
                    shown by the material of the prism.</p>

                <p>These figures are taken from an important paper by Stokes <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Fig. 27 shows in a rude way the absorption by cobalt glass cut in wedge form, and
                    corrected by an equal prism of clear glass.</p>
                <p>The commonly received method of calculating the absorption by layers of gradually
                    increasing thickness is to suppose that, if a layer of unit thickness weakens in
                    any ratio the intensity of any particular homogeneous ray, another unit layer
                    will farther weaken in the same ratio that which reaches it, and so on. Thus the
                    amount which passes through a number of layers diminishes in geometrical
                    progression, while the number of layers increases in arithmetical progression.
                    This is certainly true (neglecting the amount reflected), unless the <hi
                    rend="italic">intensity</hi> of the light have an effect on the percentage
                    transmitted. And fig. 27 shows, in a very striking manner, the difference
                    between similar terms of different geometric series as the common ratio becomes
                    less and less. This ratio is not much less than 1 for certain red and blue rays,
                    is smaller for yellow, and is very small for the rest of the red, for orange,
                    and for green. The latter colours are therefore rapidly got rid of with
                    increasing thickness; then the yellow becomes too feeble to be seen; while, even
                    after the blue becomes almost insensible, the specially favoured red rays are
                    still transmitted in sufficient quantity to be observed.</p>

                <p>Thus a ray which loses 1 per eent. in unit thickness still preserves more than 90
                    per cent, after passing through ten units. But a ray w·hich loses 10 per cent,
                    in the first unit (and which, therefore, will thus far appear scarcely more
                    weakened than the first) is reduced to 35 per cent, by passage through ten
                    units. After passing through a hundred units the first ray has lost only 63 per
                    cent., the second is practically invisible.</p>
                <p>In thin plates cobalt glass is blue, because the particular red which it does not
                    absorb freely forms only a small fraction of the whole transmitted rays; while
                    in thick masses it is nearly red, for then little but this favoured red is
                    transmitted. For a similar reason Condy’s fluid (permanganate of potash) changes
                    its tint in a very singular manner (even when preserved from the action of the
                    air) by gradual dilution with water.</p>
                <p>The imperfection of the achromatism of the eye is readily proved by looking
                    through a plate of cobalt glass at a small hole in the window-shutter of a dark
                    room. The hole at first appears red with a blue space round it; but, by an
                    effort of the muscles of the eye, we can see the hole blue, and then there is a
                    red space surrounding it. Rays of so widely different refractive index cannot be
                    seen in focus simultaneously.</p>
                <p>Very curious effects are produced when we examine a landscape through such a
                    glass. Foliage of certain kinds scatters scarcely any blue rays, and therefore
                    appears reddish. Bluish-greens, again, which scatter very little red, appear
                    blue. The effects may be exaggerated in a very striking degree by combining the
                    absorptions of two or more media, so as to allow of the free transmission of a
                    few, far detached, portions of the spectrum.</p>
                <p>Brewster made the very singular discovery that a solution of oxalate of chromium
                    and potash produces one solitary, narrow, absorption band, almost resembling one
                    of the broader lines in the solar spectrum.</p>
                <p>Closely connected with intense local absorption in certain parts of the spectrum

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0621-0602"/> Talbot; and he discovered its real nature. But
                    the first published notice of such phenomena is due to Le Roux. Christiansen and
                    others have since greatly extended our knowledge of the subject, and Helmholtz
                    and Ketteler have given theoretical explanations of it. Fox Talbot’s experiment,
                    though the earliest on record, is one of the easiest to perform, and we
                    therefore quote his own account. The experiment was made about 1840, and the
                    following account is from the <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Soc. Edin.,</hi>
                    1870-71.</p>
                <p>“I prepared some square pieces of window glass, about an inch square. Taking one
                    of these, I placed upon it a drop of a strong solution of some salt of chromium,
                    which, if I remember rightly, was the double oxalate of chromium and potash, but
                    it may have been that substance more or less modified. By placing a second
                    square of glass on the first, the drop was spread out in a thin film, but it was
                    prevented from becoming too thin by four pellets of wax placed at the corners of
                    the square, which likewise served to hold the two pieces of glass together. The
                    glasses were then laid aside for some hours until crystals formed in the liquid.
                    These were necessarily thin, since their thickness was limited by the interval
                    between the glasses. Of course the central part of each crystal, except the
                    smallest ones, was bounded by parallel planes, but the extremities were bevilled
                    at various angles, forming so many little prisms, the smallest or them floating
                    in the liquid. When a distant candle was viewed through these glasses, having
                    the little prisms interposed, a great number of spectra became visible, caused
                    by the inclined edges. Most of these were no doubt very imperfect, but by trying
                    the glass at various points, some very distinct spectra were met with, and these
                    could with some trouble be isolated by covering the glass with a card pierced
                    with a pin-hole. It was then seen that each prism (or oblique edge of crystal)
                    produced two spectra oppositely polarized and widely separated. One of these
                    spectra was normal; there was nothing particular about it. The colours of the
                    other were very anomalous, and, after many experiments, I came to the conclusion
                    that they could only be explained by the supposition that the spectrum, after
                    proceeding for a certain distance, stopped short and returned upon itself.”</p>
                <p>Le Roux in 1860<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> lv., 1862.</p></note> discovered that vapour
                    of iodine, which allows only red and blue rays to pass, refracts the red more
                    than the blue. He, like Talbot, did not at first venture to publish his result,
                    and it appeared only in 1862. Among the many convincing proofs of its accuracy
                    he shows that the dispersion by an iodine-vapour prism can be nearly
                    achromatized by a glass prism which gives refraction in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >same</hi> direction. He also states that the dispersion in iodine-vapour
                    is-less as the temperature is higher.</p>

                    made in 1870 upon an alcoholic solution of fuchsine (one of the powerful aniline
                    colours). This solution gives a dark absorption band in the green; and it was
                    found that the refractive index rises (as in normal bodies) for rays from the
                    red to the yellow. But all the rest of the transmitted light, consisting of the
                    so-called “more refrangible” rays, is less refracted than the red. Kundt and
                    others shortly afterwards greatly extended these observations.</p>

                    the mutual action between the luminiferous ether and the particles of the
                    absorbing medium, coupled with a further assumption connecting the absorption
                    itself with a species of friction among the parts of each absorbing
                    particle.</p>
                <p>In 1879 De Klerker<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Comptes Rendus,</hi> 1879.</p></note> made a very curious
                    observation, which shows that the whole subject is still obscure. He employed
                    two hollow prisms of equal angle, turned opposite ways, and filled with alcohol.
                    Through such a combination light passes (as we have seen) w ithout refraction or
                    dispersion. When a few drops of the fuchsine solution were added to the contents
                    of one of the prisms, the yellow, orange, and red rays (in the order named)
                    began to separate themselves from the others. This process could be carried on
                    until the solution was so strong that it transmitted no visible light. All this
                    time the blue and violet rays remained apparently unrefracted—the yellow,
                    orange, and red showing continually increasing refraction. The conclusion from
                    this, on either theory of light, is that the addition of fuchsine to alcohol
                    alters the velocity of propagation of the (so-called) less refrangible rays, but
                    not perceptibly that of the more refrangible.</p>

                    which will presently be described, he put it beyond doubt that the cause of
                    these phenomena lies in a change of refrangibility of the light which has been
                    absorbed by the upper layers of the medium, and then given off again. In every
                    case the fluorescent light appears to belong to a less refrangible part of the
                    spectrum than does the incident light which gave rise to it, thus affording an
                    instance of dissipation, or degradation of energy.</p>
                <p>The yellowish-green surface-colour of canary glass (coloured with oxide of
                    uranium) is well known, as the substance is, mainly on account of this property,
                    very commonly used for ornaments. If we admit a ray of sunlight (or light from
                    the electric lamp) into a dark room, through a cobalt glass so dark that the
                    feeble violetcoloured light it transmits is scarcely visible, we find that the
                    canary glass shows its yellow-green colour vividly when placed in the track of
                    the ray. Striking as this experiment is, it is not quite conclusive as to the
                    true cause of the appearance. But if we take another piece of glass, slightly
                    tinged of a brownish-yellow (by oxide of gold), we find that it is quite
                    transparent to the brilliant light from the canary glass; if, however, we place
                    it in the track of the violet rays <hi rend="italic">before</hi> they fall on
                    the uranium glass, it prevents the production of the phenomenon altogether. That
                    is, rays which cannot pass through the glass coloured with gold are rendered
                    capable of freely passing through it after incidence on the canary glass. That
                    the phenomenon is due to rays which are stopped by the uranium glass itself is
                    proved by the fact that a second piece of the glass, placed in the track of the
                    rays which have passed through the first, does not show the phenomenon. Unless,
                    indeed, the source of light be very bright, the appearance is confined to a mere
                    surfacelayer of the first piece of canary glass. The phenomenon is very well
                    shown by an aqueous infusion of horse-chestnut bark. Some specimens of paraffin
                    oil exhibit it most brilliantly.</p>
                <p>To find the rays which are most effective in producing the fluorescence of any
                    substance, we have only to place it in a pure spectrum of sunlight (or,
                    preferably, of the electric light),—prisms and lenses of quartz being used for
                    producing the spectrum, because that material is found to be far less opaque
                    than glass is to the violet and ultraviolet rays. When this is done with uranium
                    glass we find scarcely a trace of effect until the substance reaches the blue
                    rays, and the effect persists through all the higher colours, and even very
                    considerably beyond the bounds of the visible spectrum. Stokes in fact used it
                    as a means of studying the otherwise invisible, but far extending, spectrum of
                    the ultra-violet rays of the electric spark.</p>
                <p>The mechanism of the process by which these extraordinary results are produced is
                    still somewhat obscure, and we cannot attempt to explain it here.</p>
                <p>The duration of fluorescence is so very short that it is only by specially
                    devised methods that we can make certain that it persists for any measurable
                    time after the exciting <pb break="no"

                    Becquerel’s ingenious <hi rend="italic">phosphOroscope</hi> was invented for the
                    purpose of inquiries of this kind. It consists essentially of a shallow drum, in
                    whose ends two excentric holes, exactly opposite to one another, are cut. Inside
                    it are fixed two equal metal disks, attached perpendicularly to an axis, and
                    divided into the same number of sectors, the alternate sectors of each being cut
                    out. One of these disks is close to one end of the drum, the other to the
                    opposite end, and the sectors are so arranged that, when the disks are made to
                    rotate, the hole in one end is open while that in the other is closed, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> If the eye be placed near one hole, and a ray of
                    sunlight be admitted by the other, it is obvious that while the sun shines on an
                    object inside the drum the aperture next the eye is closed, and <hi
                    rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> If the disks be made to revolve with great
                    velocity by means of a train of toothed wheels, the object will be presented to
                    the eye almost instantly after it has been exposed to sunlight; and these
                    presentations succeed one another so rapidly as to produce a sense of continued
                    vision. By means of this apparatus we can test with considerable accuracy the
                    duration of the phenomenon after the light has been cut off. For such a purpose
                    we require merely to know the number of sectors in the disks and the rate at
                    which they are turned. To guard against deception by the persistence of
                    impressions on the retina, the eye should not be directed fixedly on the object,
                    but should be kept travelling slowly round the position in which it is seen to
                    lie.</p>
                <p>Uranium glass shows, with rapid turning, nearly as vivid an effect as when
                    exposed to continuous light, but fades rapidly when the speed of the rotation
                    falls off. A pinkish kind of ruby, exposed to concentrated sunlight in the
                    phosphoroscope, is seen to glow with a bright red like a piece of live coal.
                    With very rapid turning, feeble fluorescence can be detected in a great many
                    substances in which the ordinary methods will not show it. This is due in great
                    measure to the fact that the phosphoroscope entirely does away with the
                    scattered light, which in the ordinary mode of examining these substances
                    overpowers their feeble fluorescence.</p>
                <p>What is correctly termed phosphorescence has nothing to do with phosphorus (whose
                    luminosity in the dark is due to slow oxidation), but it is merely a species of
                    fluorescence which lasts for a much longer time after the excitation has ceased
                    than does that just described. Pliny speaks of various gems which shine with a
                    light of their own, and Albertus Magnus knew that the diamond becomes
                    phosphorescent when moderately heated. But the first discovery of phosphorescent
                    substances, such as are now so common, belongs to the early part of the 17th
                    century. During that century the Bologna stone (sulphide of barium) and
                    Homberg’s phosphorus (chloride of calcium) were discovered. Can ton’s phosphorus
                    (sulphide of calcium) dates from 1768. To the substances mentioned may now be
                    added sulphide of strontium. Any of these sulphides, which must be carefully
                    preserved from the air in sealed glass tubes, appears brilliantly luminous when
                    carried from sunlight into a dark room, and for a long time after presents the
                    general aspect of a hot body cooling. The rays which excite their luminosity are
                    (as with the generality of fluorescent bodies) those of higher refrangibilities;
                    but the colours of the phosphorescent light are of the most varied kind, even in
                    specimens of almost precisely the same chemical composition, but prepared at
                    different times. The causes of this strange diversity are as yet quite unguessed
                    at; but the property has been taken advantage of for the production of what are
                    called <hi rend="italic">luminous paints.</hi> The behaviour of these substances
                    is one of the most singular phenomena in optics. How they manage to store up so
                    large a supply of energy during a short exposure to bright light, and to dole it
                    out continuously for so long a time and mainly in the form of light, is
                    exceedingly puzzling,— especially as no other physical or chemical change has
                    yet been found to accompany the process. Another curious fact connected with
                    their behaviour was discovered by Becquerel. He found that the less refrangible
                    rays have in some cases the power of arresting the emission of light from these
                    bodies when they have been previously excited by higher rays.</p>
                <p>The chemical effects of light will be treated under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Photography, so</hi> far as they are connected with decomposition. Its effects
                    in causing combination, as of hydrogen and chlorine, have already been treated
                    under <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Undulatory Theory
                    of Light.</hi></p>
                <p>The explanation of the fundamental laws of Geometrical Optics by the wave-theory
                    requires some preliminary remarks. As the subject will be more fully discussed
                    in a special article, we confine ourselves to what is strictly necessary for the
                    immediate purposes of the present article.</p>
                <p>(a) The essential characteristic of wave-motion is that a disturbance of some
                    kind is handed on from one portion of a solid or fluid mass to another. In
                    certain cases only, this disturbance is unaltered in amount and in kind as it
                    proceeds.</p>
                <p>(δ) So far as light is concerned, the velocity with which each particular species
                    of disturbance passes in any direction through a homogeneous isotropic medium is
                    constant and is the same for all directions. When the medium is not homogeneous,
                    the velocity may vary from point to point. If the medium be not isotropic, the
                    velocity may depend upon the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of propagation.
                    Examples of each of these peculiarities will be met with presently.</p>
                <p>(c) When two or more separate disturbances simultaneously affect the same portion
                    of a medium, the effect may be very complex. But, in the case of light, it has
                    been found that a geometrical (or rather <hi rend="italic">kinematical)</hi>
                    superposition or composition agrees, at least to the degree of accuracy of the
                    experiments, with all the observed facts. This would be the case, as a dynamical
                    result, if the distortions due to wave-motion were always, even for the most
                    powerful light, exceedingly small. On this is based the whole doctrine of <hi
                    rend="italic">interference,</hi> Young’s grandest contribution to the
                    wave-theory (1801).</p>
                <p>(d) The disturbance at any point of a medium, at any instant, is that due to the
                    superposition of all the disturbances which reached it at that instant from the
                    various surrounding parts of the medium. This is (in a somewhat generalized
                    form) what is commonly known as Huygens’s principle, first enunciated in
                    1678.</p>
                <p>(e) The <hi rend="italic">front</hi> of a wave is defined at any instant as the
                    continuous locus of all portions of the medium which, at that instant, are
                    equally and similarly distorted. The word <hi rend="italic">continuous</hi> is
                    inserted because, in oscillatory wavemotion, such as that of light, a large
                    number of successive waves are exactly equal and similar to one another. Thus we
                    have a <hi rend="italic">semes</hi> of wave-fronts following one another, which
                    are not to be considered as parts of one wave-front. The distance between two
                    successive fronts in which the distortions are similar, measured in the
                    direction in which the light is travelling, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wave-lempth.</hi><hi rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">f)</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">colour</hi> of homogeneous light depends entirely on the <hi
                    rend="italic">period</hi> of a wave, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> on the time of
                    passage from one wave-front to the next. This is obviously the same thing as the
                    time of a complete vibration of any one particle of the medium—whatever be the
                    velocity of light in the medium, or the consequent wave-length.</p>
                <p>These being premised, let us take the propagation of homogeneous light from a
                    luminous point in a homogeneous<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0623-0604"/> isotropic medium. Here we have simply a
                    succession of concentric spherical wave-fronts, their radii differing by one or
                    more whole wave-lengths. The disturbance in any portion of one of these fronts
                    is propagated radially. But we may consider it from a different point of view,
                    as hinted in (&lt;7) above. Simple as this particular case is, the reader will
                    probably find that it will greatly assist him in understanding the more complex
                    ones which follow.</p>
                <p>Every disturbed portion of the medium may be looked upon as a centre of
                    disturbance from which a new set of spherical waves is constantly spreading.
                    Take then, as common radius, the space described by a disturbance in any very
                    short interval; and, with centres at every point of any one wave-front, describe
                    a series of spheres. The ultimate intersections of these spheres will lie on a
                    surface which is the <hi rend="italic">envelop</hi> of them all. In the case
                    considered, it is obviously a sphere whose radius exceeds that of the wave-front
                    from which we started by the common radius of the set of spheres. This is shown
                    in a central section in fig. 28 below, which suffices to prove that we arrive
                    <hi rend="italic">l&gt;y this mode of construction</hi> at the result which we
                    know in this simple case to be the correct one. It will be seen that the centres
                    of the construction-spheres lie on a certain part of one wave-front, while their
                    ultimate intersections lie on the <hi rend="italic">corresponding</hi> part of
                    the future wave-front. This holds for spheres of all radii, and for continually
                    increasing radii shows that a <hi rend="italic">plane</hi> wave moves
                    perpendicularly to its front. This is so important a part of Huygens’s work that
                    we give it in his own words <hi rend="italic">lfTraite de la</hi><hi

                    CE, terminé par les droites ABC, AGE. Car bien que les ondes particulières,
                    produites par les particules que comprend l’espace CAE, se repandent aussi hors

                <p>“Et d’icy l’on voit la raison pourquoy la lumiere, à moins que ses rayons ne
                    soient réfléchis ou rompus, ne se répand que par des lignes droites, en sorte
                    qu’elle n’éclaire aucun objet que quand le chemin depuis sa source jusqu’à cet
                    objet est ouvert suivant de telles lignes. Car si, par exemple, il y avoit une
                    ouverture BG, borneé par des corps opaques BH, GI; l’onde de lumiere qui sort du
                    point A sera tousjours termineé par les droites AC, AE, comme il vient d’estre

                <p>“Or quelque petite que nous fassions l’ouverture BG, la raison est tousjours la
                    mesme pour y faire passer la lumiere entre des lignes droites; parce que cette

                    de la matière etherée, qui sont d’une petitesse inconcevable; de sorte qu’il
                    paroit que chaque petite partie d’onde s’avance nécessairement suivant la ligne
                    droite qui vient du point luisant. Et c’est ainsi que l’on peut prendre des
                    rayons de lumiere comme si c’estoient des lignes droites.</p>
                <p>“Il paroit au reste, par ce qui à esté remarqué touchant la foiblesse des ondes
                    particulières, qu’il n’est pas necessaire que toutes les particules de,l’Ether
                    soient égales entre elles, quoique l’égalité soit plus propre à la propagation
                    du mouvement. Car il est vray que 1 inégalité fera qu’une particule, en poussant
                    une autre plus grande, fasse effort pour reculer avec une partie de son
                    mouvement, mais il ne s engendrera de cela que quelques ondes particulières en

                    d’onde composeé de plusieurs, comme estoit CE.</p>
                <p>“Une autre, et des plus merveilleuses proprietez de la lumiere est que, quand il
                    en vient de divers costez, ou mesme d’opposez, elles font leur effet l’une à
                    travers l’autre sans aucun empêchement. D’on vient aussi que par une mesme

                    l’autre. Or suivant ce qui a esté expliqué de l’action de la lumiere, et comment

                    elles se croisent, ces effets que je viens de dire sont aisez à concevoir. Qui
                    ne le sont nullement à mon avis selon l’opinion de Des-Cartes, qui fait
                    consister la lumiere dans une pression continuelle, qui ne fait que tendre au
                    mouvement. Car cette pression ne pouvant agir tout a la fois des deux costez
                    opposez, contre des corps qui n’ont aucune inclination à s’approcher; il est
                    impossible de comprendre ce que je viens de dire de deux personnes qui se voyent
                    les yeux mutuellement, ni comment deux flambeaux se puissent éclairer l’un
                    l’autre.”</p>
                <p>We will now, for the purposes of this elementary article, assume that something
                    similar holds in all cases, and will not trouble ourselves with the fact that
                    our construction, if fully carried out, would indicate a retrograding wave as
                    well as a progressive one. The obvious fact that a <hi rend="italic"
                    >solitary</hi> wave can be propagated in water, or along a stretched string, may
                    assist the reader in taking the bold step which we have proposed to him. And we
                    will also assume that this mode of representation leads to correct results even
                    when we do not choose a wave-front as the locus of the centres of
                    disturbance,—that in fact we may choose for our purpose <hi rend="italic"
                    >any</hi> surface through which the rays pass, provided always that the radii of
                    the spheres are so chosen that the length of each ray from some definite
                    wave-front to the centre of the sphere, together with the radius of that sphere,
                    always corresponds to a path described in a given time.</p>
                <p>We are now prepared to explain the reflexion of light, and we need do so for a
                    plane reflecting surface alone, because the length of a wave, as we shall soon
                    see, is an almost vanishing quantity in comparison with the radius of curvature
                    of any artificial mirror, be it even the smallest visible drop of mercury.</p>
                <p>Let a plane wave-front be approaching a plane mirror, and at any instant let fig.
                    29 represent a section by a plane perpendicular to each, cutting the wave-front
                    in AB and the mirror in AC. From what has been already said, the motion of every
                    part of AB is perpendicular to that line, and in the plane of the figure. During
                    the time that the disturbance at B takes to reach C, the disturbance which had
                    reached A will have (in part, for there is usually a refracted part also) spread
                    back into the medium in the form of a spherical wave whose radius, AD, is equal
                    to BC. Its section is of course a circle. That from any other point P will have
                    reached Q, and then (in part) diverged into a spherical wave whose centre is Q
                    and radius QT( = QT') = BC - PQ. Obviously all the circles which can be thus
                    drawn ultimately intersect in the straight line CD. This is a section of the
                    reflected wave-front. A plane wave, therefore, remains a plane wave after
                    reflexion, each part of it obviously moves in the plane of incidence, and the
                    similarity of the triangles ABC and CDA proves the equality of the angles of
                    incidence and reflexion, for the ray is everywhere perpendicular to the
                    wave-front. It is to be particularly noted that this is independent of the
                    velocity of the light, so that all rays are reflected alike. In this, as in the
                    preceding and the immediately following instances, the diagram has been taken
                    (with but slight change) from Huygens.</p>
                <p>This being true of any <hi rend="italic">plane</hi> wave-front, large or small in
                    area, is necessarily also true of any wave-front of finite <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n624/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0624-0605"/> curvature. Thus, if a set of rays be drawn
                    perpendicular to any wave-front, they will after reflexion be perpendicular to a
                    new wave-front; and the lengths of all the rays, from wave-front to wave-front,
                    will be equal.</p>
                <p>This is merely another way of stating that if a set of rays can be cut at right
                    angles by a surface (of finite curvature) they will always be capable of being
                    cut at right angles by such a surface, even after any number of reflexions at
                    surfaces of finite curvature, provided they move in a homogeneous isotropic
                    medium.</p>
                <p>This proposition will be seen to be capable of extension to refraction, provided
                    always that both media are homogeneous and isotropic. For a plane wave, falling
                    on a plane refracting surface, our construction (fig. 30) is as follows: —</p>
                <p>Let AB be, as before, a plane wave-front in the first medium, and AC the plane
                    surface of the second medium. As before, let BC be perpendicular to AB. Also let
                    CD' be drawn parallel toBA. With centre A and radius AD equal to the space
                    described in the second medium while BC is described in the first, let a sphere
                    be described. The disturbance at A will have diverged in this sphere, while that
                    at B has just reached C. The disturbance at any other point, as P, will have
                    passed to Q, and then have diverged into a sphere of radius QT such that</p>
                <p>QT: QT':: AD; BC.</p>
                <p>Obviously all spheres so drawn ultimately intersect along CD, which is therefore
                    the front of the refracted wave. The angles of incidence and refraction, being
                    the inclinations of the incident and refracted rays to the normal, are the
                    inclinations BAG and DCA of the incident and refracted wave-fronts to the
                    refracting surface. Their sines are evidently in the ratio of BC to AD, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> they are <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> as the
                    velocities of propagation in the two media.</p>
                <p>Hence the law of refraction also follows from this hypothesis. But there will now
                    be separation of the various homogeneous rays, because the ratio of their
                    velocities in the two media is not generally constant.</p>
                <p>Besides, it is clear from the investigation above that, in the refracting medium,
                    the rays are still perpendicular to the wave-front. Thus the proposition lately
                    given may now be extended in the following form :—</p>
                <p>If a series of rays travelling in homogeneous isotropic media be at any place
                    normal to a wave-front, they will possess the same property after any number of
                    reflexions and refractions. And it is clear from the investigations already
                    given that the <hi rend="italic">time</hi> employed by light in passing from one
                    of these wave-fronts to another is the same for every ray of the series.</p>
                <p>We now see how crucial a test of theory is furnished by the simple refraction of
                    light. On the corpuscular theory the velocity of light in water is to its
                    velocity in air as 4: 3 nearly; on the undulatory theory these velocities are as
                    3: 4, since, as we have seen, the refractive index of water is about ⅜. But
                    Foucault’s experimental method showed at once that the velocity is less in water
                    than in air. This finally disposed of the corpuscular theory. Though it had been
                    conclusively disproved long before, by certain interference experiments whose
                    nature will presently be described, the argument from these was somewhat
                    indirect and not well suited to convince the large non-mathematical class among
                    optical students and experimenters. The true author of the undulatory theory is
                    undoubtedly Huygens. Grimaldi, Hooke, and others had expressed more or less
                    obscure notions on the subject, but Huygens in 1678 first gave it in a definite
                    form, based to a great extent upon measurements of his own. It was read to the
                    French Academy, but not published till 1690, when it appeared with the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Traité de la Lumière.</hi> Huygens gives the explanation of the
                    double refraction of Iceland spar, which had been described by Bartholinus in
                    1670. Unfortunately the remarkable step taken by Newton in explaining the law of
                    refraction on the corpuscular theory—the earliest solution of a problem
                    connected with molecular forces—had for some time been before the scientific
                    world. The authority of Newton was paramount in such matters, and the work of
                    Huygens produced no effect at the time. Even the genius of Young, who at the
                    commencement of the present century recalled attention to this all-but-forgotten
                    theory, and enriched it by the addition of the principle of interference, as
                    well as by many important applications, failed to secure its recognition. It was
                    not till 1815 and subsequent years that, in the hands of Fresnel, the undulatory
                    theory finally triumphed, and, even then, the battle was won against determined
                    resistance on the part of the upholders of the corpuscular theory. Witness what

                    Young :—</p>
                <p>“J’ai reçu la lettre que vous m’avez fait l’honneur de&gt; m’écrire, et dans
                    laquelle vous cherchez à établir que, suivant le système des ondulations de la
                    lumière, les sinus d’incidence et de réfraction sont en rapport constant,
                    lorsqu’elle passe d’un milieu dans un autre. Quelque ingénieux que soit ce
                    raisonnement, je ne puis le regarder que comme un aperçu, et non comme une
                    démonstration géométrique. Je persiste à croire que le problème de la
                    propagation des ondes, lorsqu’elles traversent différens milieux, n’a jamais été
                    résolu, et qu’il surpasse peut-être les forces actuelles de l’analyse. Descartes
                    expliquoit ce rapport constant, au moyen de deux suppositions; l’une, que la
                    vitesse des rayons lumineux parallèlement a la surface du milieu refringent ne
                    changeoit point par la réfraction; l’autre, que sa vitesse entière dans ce
                    milieu étoit la même, sous toutes les incidences; mais comme il nerattachoit
                    aucune de ces suppositions aux lois de la mécanique, son explication a été
                    vivement combattue et rejettée par les plus grand nombre des physiciens jusqu’ à
                    ce que Newton ait fait voir que ces suppositions résultoient de l’action du
                    milieu refringent sur la lumière; alors on a eu une explication mathématique du
                    phénomène dans le système de l’émission de la lumière: système qui donne encore
                    l’explication la plus simple du phénomène de l’aberration, que n’explique point
                    le système des ondes lumineuses. Ainsi les suppositions de Descartes, comme
                    plusieurs aperçus de Kepler sur le système du monde, ont été vérifiées par
                    l’analyse: mais le mérite de la découverte d’une vérité appartient tout entier à
                    celui qui la démontre. Je conviens que de nouveaux phénomènes de la lumière sont
                    jusqu’ à présent très difficiles à expliquer; mais en les étudiant avec un grand
                    soin, pour découvrir les lois dont ils dépendent, ou parviendra peut-être un
                    jour à reconnaître dans les molecules lumineuses des propriétés nouvelles qui
                    donneront une explication mathématique de ces phénomènes. Remonter des
                    phénomènes aux lois et des lois aux forces, est, comme vous le savez, la vraie
                    marche des sciences naturelles.”</p>
                <p>Poggendorff remarks that there is no other instance, in the whole history of
                    modern physics, in which the truth was so long kept down by authority.
                    Poggendorff further remarks that of the six chief phenomena of light known in
                    Huygens’s time he fully explained three—reflexion, refraction, and the double
                    refraction of Iceland spar—at least so far as concerns the <hi rend="italic"
                    >direction</hi> of the reflected or refracted rays. Phenomena such as
                    diffraction, and the colours of thin plates, required the principle of
                    interference for their explanation, which was first given by Young; and
                    dispersion (not yet quite satisfactorily disposed of) was first accounted for in
                    comparatively recent times by Cauchy. Huygens himself was the discoverer of
                    polarization, but he could not account for it. Even Young also, because like
                    Huygens he supposed the undulations to be in the direction of the ray, failed to
                    account for it; and it was not explained till Fresnel reintroduced with the <pb

                    date 1672), that the vibrations of light in an isotropic medium are <hi
                    rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to the direction of the ray.</p>
                <p>Taking the undulatory theory as the only one left possible by the experiments of
                    Foucault, we will now consider the explanation it offers of various phenomena.
                    It will be remembered that <hi rend="italic">we have as yet made no assumption
                    whatever as to the precise nature of a wave</hi>; and it will be found that a
                    large class of important phenomena can be explained by it without our making any
                    such assumption, but that other classes of phenomena compel us to adopt certain
                    limitations of the very general hypothesis with which we started. As long as we
                    deal with the first class of phenomena, we may take for granted those properties
                    which are common to all ordinary forms of wave-motion, such as those in water or
                    air. In ordinary water-waves the motion of a particle is partly to and fro in
                    the direction in which a wave is travelling, partly up and down and therefore
                    perpendicular to that direction. This is obvious to every one who watches a
                    floating cork. In sound-waves, whether in air or in water, the displacement of
                    each particle of the medium is wholly in the direction in which the wave is
                    travelling. Directly connected with this there is another distinction between
                    these classes of waves. In ordinary water-waves the water-elements change only
                    their <hi rend="italic">form</hi> as the wave passes; in sound-waves there is
                    change of <hi rend="italic">volume</hi> also. A third distinction, also directly
                    connected with the first, is that sound-waves in water travel at a much greater
                    rate than the swiftest, ⅛.e,, the longest, of surface waves. But, in either
                    case, when two similar and equal series of waves arrive at a common point they
                    <hi rend="italic">interfere,</hi> as it is called, with one another, so that the
                    actual disturbance of the medium at any instant is the resultant of the
                    disturbances which it would have suffered at that instant from the two series
                    separately. Thus if crests, and therefore troughs, arrive simultaneously from
                    the two series, the result is a doubled amount of disturbance. If, on the
                    contrary, a crest of the first series arrive along with a trough of the second,
                    the next trough of the first series will arrive along with the next crest of the
                    second, and so on. One series is then said to be half a wave-length behind the
                    other. In this case, the portion of the medium considered will remain
                    undisturbed. Thus, at the port of Batsha in Tong-king, the ocean tide-wave
                    arrives by two different channels, one part being nearly six hours, or half a
                    wave-length, behind the other. As a result, there is scarcely any noticeable
                    tide at Batsha itself, though at places not very far from it the rise and fall
                    are considerable. This was known to Newton, and is noticed by him in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Principia,</hi> iii. 24. See also <hi rend="italic">Phil.
                    Trans.,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 677, for the observed facts and Halley’s comments.
                    Thus also (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Acoustics)</hi> two sounds of the same
                    wavelength and of equal intensity produce silence if they reach the external ear
                    with an interval of half a wave-length, or any odd multiple of half a
                    wave-length.</p>
                <p>It is not remarkable that Young’s Bakerian Lecture (1801), in which the principle
                    of interference is for the first time described and applied, should consist in
                    great part of extracts from the <hi rend="italic">Principia.</hi> For there are
                    many passages in Newton’s works which might have been written by an upholder of
                    the wave-theory. Unaccountably, however, Newton in the context almost always
                    brings in a reference to the “rays of light” as something different from the
                    vibrations of the ether, yet capable of being acted on by them so as to be put
                    into “fits of easy reflexion or of easy transmission.” These allusions are the
                    most obscure parts of all Newton’s scientific writings; and it is very difficult
                    to form a precise conception of what he meant to express in them.</p>
                <p>The following passage, extracted from Young’s temperate reply <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Works,</hi> vol. i. p. 202) to the violent but ignorant assault on him by Lord
                    Brougham in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> is chosen as showing
                    his own estimate of his own work and of its relation to what was already known
                    :—</p>
                <p>“It was in May 1801 that I discovered, by reflecting on the beautiful experiments
                    of Newton, a law which appears to me to account for a greater variety· of
                    interesting phenomena than any other optical principle that has yet been made
                    known. I shall endeavour to explain this law by a comparison.</p>
                <p>“Suppose a number of equal waves of water to move upon the surface of a stagnant
                    lake, with a certain constant velocity, and to enter a narrow channel leading
                    out of the lake. Suppose then another similar cause to have excited another
                    equal series of waves, which arrive at the same channel, -with the same
                    velocity, and at the same time with the first Neither series of waves will
                    destroy the other, but their effects will be combined: if they enter the channel
                    in such a manner that the elevations of one series coincide with those of the
                    other, they must together produce a series of greater joint elevations; but if
                    the elevations of one series are so situated as to correspond to the depressions
                    of the other, they must exactly fill up those depressions, and the surface of
                    the water must remain smooth; at least I can discover no alternative, either
                    from theory or from experiment.</p>
                <p>“Now I maintain that similar effects take place whenever two portions of light
                    are thus mixed; and this I call the general law of the interference of light. I
                    have shown that this law agrees, most accurately, with the measures recorded in
                    Newton’s Optics, relative to the colours of transparent substances, observed
                    under circumstances which had never before been subjected to calculation, and
                    with a great diversity of other experiments never before explained. This, I
                    assert, is a most powerful argument in favour of the theory which I had before
                    revived: there was nothing that could have led to it in any author with whom I
                    am acquainted, except some imperfect hints in those inexhaustible but neglected
                    mines of nascent inventions, the works of the great Dr Robert Hooke, which had
                    never occurred to me at the time that I discovered the law; and except the
                    Newtonian explanation of the combinations of tides in the port of Batsha.”</p>
                <p>Young’s first application of the principle of interference was made to the
                    colours of <hi rend="italic">striated surfaces,</hi> the next to the colours of
                    <hi rend="italic">thin plates.</hi> These, however, are not so easily
                    intelligible as the application to an experiment devised by Fresnel several
                    years later. We therefore commence with Fresnel’s experiment, which gives the
                    most simple arrangement yet contrived, but it must be understood that the
                    explanation is really due to Young. BCD (fig. 31) is an isosceles prism of
                    glass, with the angle at C very little less than two right angles. A luminous
                    point is placed at O, in the plane through the obtuse edge of the prism and
                    perpendicular to its base. If homogeneous light be used, the light which passes
                    through the prism will consist of two parts, diverging as if from points O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> symmetrically
                    situated on opposite sides of the line CO. Suppose a sheet of paper to be placed
                    at A with its plane perpendicular to the line OCA, and let us consider what
                    illumination will be produced at different parts of this paper. As O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> are images of O,
                    crests of waves must be supposed to start from them simultaneously. Hence they
                    will arrive simultaneously at A, which is equidistant from them, and there they
                    will reinforce one another. Thus there will be a bright band on the paper
                    parallel to the edges of the prism. If P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> be chosen
                    so that the difference between P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> and P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is half a wavelength <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> half
                    the distance between two successive crests), the two streams of light will
                    constantly meet in such relative conditions as to destroy one another. Hence
                    there will be a line of darkness on the paper, through P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>, parallel to the edges of the prism. At P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    where O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> exceeds O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> by a whole
                    wave-length, we have another <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n626/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0626-0607"/> bright band; and at P <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi>, where O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    exceeds O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> by a
                    wave-length and a half, another dark band; and so on. Hence, as everything is
                    symmetrical about the bright band through A, the screen will be illuminated by a
                    series of bright and dark bands, gradually shading into one another. If the
                    paper screen be moved parallel to itself to or from the prism, the locus of all
                    the successive positions of any one band will (by the nature of the curve)
                    obviously be an hyperbola whose foci are O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ Thus the interval between any two bands will
                    increase in a more rapid ratio than does the distance of the screen from the
                    source of light. But the intensity of the bright bands diminishes rapidly as the
                    screen moves farther off; so that, in order to measure their distance from A, it
                    is better to substitute the eye (furnished with a convex lens) for the screen.
                    If we thus measure the distance AP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> between A and
                    the nearest bright band, measure also AO, and calculate (from the known material
                    and form of the prism, and the distance CO) the distance O <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, it is obvious that we can deduce from
                    them the lengths of O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> and O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ∙ Their
                    difference is the <hi rend="italic">length of a wave</hi> of the homogeneous
                    light experimented with. Though this is not the method actually employed for the
                    purpose (as it admits of little precision), it has been thus fully explained
                    here because it shows in a very simple way the possibility of measuring a
                    wave-length.</p>
                <p>The difference between O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> P <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> and O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> P <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> becomes
                    greater as AP <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> is greater. Thus it is clear that the
                    bands are <hi rend="italic">more widely separated the longer the wave-length of
                    the homogeneous light employed.</hi> Hence when we use white light, and thus
                    have systems of bands of every visible wave-length superposed, the band A will
                    be red at its edges, the next bright bands will be blue at their inner edges and
                    red at their outer edges. But, after a few bands are passed, the bright bands
                    due to one kind of light will gradually fill up the dark bands due to another;
                    so that, while we may count hundreds of successive bright and dark bars when
                    homogeneous light is used, with white light the bars become gradually less and
                    less defined as they are farther from A, and finally merge into an almost
                    uniform white illumination of the screen.</p>
                <p>In this example, and in all others of a similar character which will be
                    introduced into this elementary article, the solution is only <hi rend="italic"
                    >approximate.</hi> The utmost resources of mathematics are in most cases
                    required for the purpose of complete solution.</p>
                <p>We are now in a position to prove that light moves slower in glass than in air,
                    by the process which was merely <hi rend="italic">indicated</hi> while we were
                    discussing the velocity of light. For, if we could slightly lengthen the paths
                    of the rays which come from O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, leaving those from O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> unaltered, the system of bands would obviously be
                    shifted in the direction from A to P in the figure. This happens if a very thin
                    film of glass be interposed in the path of the rays which appear to come from O
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>. The best mode of making the experiment is to put a
                    piece of very uniform plate glass, cut into two parts, between the prism and the
                    screen, so that rays from O <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> pass through one part
                    and those from O <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> through the other. So long as
                    these pieces are parallel, no shifting takes place. But if <hi rend="italic"
                    >one</hi> be slightly turned, so as to give the rays a longer path through it,
                    the system of bands is at once displaced to the side at which it is
                    situated.</p>
                <p>Also, we can now see how it is possible to discover whether light has its
                    velocity affected by that of the medium in which it is travelling. We know that
                    sound travels faster <hi rend="italic">with</hi> the wind, and slower <hi
                    rend="italic">against</hi> it, than it does in still air. We may, therefore,
                    suppose a disposition of the interference apparatus such that the two rays which
                    interfere have each passed through a long tube full of water. A rapid current
                    may be established, in either direction, in one or other of the tubes, or in
                    opposite directions in the two, and the shifting of the interferencebands will
                    at once indicate the nature of the effect. We cannot describe the details of the
                    process. The result, however, is analogous to that of wind on sound, but of
                    course very much smaller; and it seems that the actual change of the velocity of
                    light is <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than the velocity of the current. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ether.</hi></p>
                <p>Let us next consider the effect of a <hi rend="italic">grating,</hi> a series of
                    fine parallel wires placed at small equal intervals, or a piece of glass or of
                    speculum metal on which a series of equidistant parallel lines have been ruled
                    by a diamond point. We take only the case in which plane waves of homogeneous
                    light are incident in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the grating, and
                    when the bars and openings of the grating are all equal in breadth.</p>
                <p>Consider the effect on an eye or screen at a considerable distance, in the
                    direction BE (fig. 32). If there were no grating, practically no light would
                    reach tlae eye from the aperture AD unless ABE were very nearly a right
                    angle.</p>
                <p>This is, of course, the statement of Huygens already quoted. But Young’s
                    principle enables us to say <hi rend="italic">why</hi> this is the case. Let us
                    divide AD into a series of equal parts by lines perpendicular to BE, and distant
                    from one another by half a wave-length of the homogeneous light employed. The
                    portions coming to the eye from any two adjacent parts AB, BC will be
                    practically of the same intensity, and will exactly neutralize one another’s
                    effects on the eye. For if we take points <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> similarly situated with regard to A and B respectively, the
                    distances of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> from the eye
                    differ by half a wave-length, and rays from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> neutralize
                    those from δ. This is true wherever <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be taken between A
                    and B. Hence, under the conditions assumed, no light reaches the eye.</p>
                <p>Now suppose the alternate parts AB, CD, &amp;c., to be opaque. Similar reasoning
                    will show that the remaining rays conspire to strengthen one another. Thus, when
                    homogeneous light from a distant point falls perpendicularly on a grating in
                    which the breadth of the bars is equal to that of the interstices, it will be
                    seen brightly in a direction inclined at an angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> (ABE)
                    to the plane of the grating,—the angle <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> being such
                    that</p>
                <p>AC cos <hi rend="italic">θ=</hi> wave-length.</p>
                <p>Similar reasoning shows that the light is reinforced whenever <hi rend="italic"
                    >θ</hi> is such that</p>
                <p>AC cos <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> is an integral multiple of the wave-length. The
                    appearance presented when a long narrow slit is the luminous object, and the
                    bars of the grating are placed parallel to it, is therefore (with homogeneous
                    light) a central image with others equidistant from it on each side—their
                    angular distances from it being the values of the angle corresponding to the
                    sines</p>
                <p>Δ , ?λ <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> 3λ <hi rend="subscript"> i &amp;c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">α a a</hi></p>
                <p>Here λ is the wave-length, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the sum of the
                    breadths of a bar and an interstice. It is found in practice, and it is also
                    deducible from the complete <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0627-0608"/> theory, that the <hi rend="italic">ratio</hi> of
                    the breadths of the bar and interstice has but little effect on the result,
                    unless it be either very large or very small. Hence if λ be expressed as a
                    fraction of an inch, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be the number of lines per
                    inch in the grating, the angular deviations of the bright bands have the sines
                    <hi rend="italic">ηK,</hi> 2πλ, 3nλ, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The mean wave-length of visible rays in air is about <hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >g</hi><hi rend="subscript strikethrough"> 0</hi><hi rend="strikethrough">⅜</hi>
                    τ∏yth of an inch. Thus a grating with 5000 equidistant lines per inch will give
                    with such light an angular deviation of about 6° for the first bright
                    diffraction line.</p>
                <p>If we notice that the sine of the deviation is proportional to the wave-length,
                    it will be obvious that when white light is used the result will be a series of
                    spectra on each side of the central white image, their more refrangible ends
                    being turned towards that image. When the grating is a very regular one, and the
                    appearances are examined by means of a telescope adjusted for parallel rays, the
                    spectra formed in this way show the Fraunhofer lines with as great perfection as
                    do the best prisms. And they have one special advantage, which prisms do not
                    possess. The relative angular separation of the various colours depends solely
                    on their wave-lengths, and thus the spectra formed by different gratings are
                    practically similar to one another. There is, in fact, almost no <hi
                    rend="italic">irrationality</hi> in this kind of dispersion. In glass prisms and
                    especially in those of flint glass, the more refrangible part of the spectrum is
                    much dilated, while the less refrangible part is compressed.</p>
                <p>The counting of the number of lines per inch in a grating is not difficult, nor
                    is the accurate measurement of the angle of deviation of any particular
                    Fraunhofer line. Hence, by the help of the very simple formula given above, the
                    wave-lengths of light corresponding to the various Fraunhofer lines have been
                    determined with very great accuracy from the diffraction spectra of gratings.

                <p>For the sake of a discussion to be entered on later, we have appended the
                    refractive index from air into water for each of these rays, as given by
                    Fraunhofer himself.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Gilbert’s <hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> lvi., 1817.</p></note></p>
                <p>If now we suppose AB, CD, &amp;c., to be transparent, while BC, &lt;fcc., become
                    opaque, it is obvious that the new grating will be the <hi rend="italic"
                    >complement</hi> of the old one, and will give precisely the same appearances at
                    points outside the course of the direct beam. For when there is no grating there
                    is practically no illumination at such points. This statement of course is
                    equally true of any grating, whatever be the ratio of the breadths of the bars
                    to those of the interstices.</p>
                <p>Another very curious result of the theory of interference, fully verified by
                    experiment, is furnished by the fact that the <hi rend="italic">central</hi>
                    spot of the shadow of a small circular disk, cast by rays diverging from a
                    distant point in its axis, is as brightly illuminated as if the disk had not
                    been interposed.</p>
                <p>The final example of interference which we can give here is noteworthy on account
                    of a peculiarity which it presents. Let us consider the case of homogeneous
                    light reflected by a thin plate or film of a transparent material.</p>
                <p>Let AB (fig. 33) be the direction of the incident ray, BdE the direction in which
                    part of it is reflected to an eye E at a considerable distance: and let DE be
                    the direction in which another part escapes after refraction into the plate at B
                    and partial reflexion at the second surface of the plate at C. Then if D&lt;7 be
                    drawn perpendicular to BE, the re tardation of the wave in DE as compared with
                    that in BE will be (2μ,BCB√)∕λ wave-lengths, where <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is
                    the refractive index into the plate.</p>
                <p>If α' be the angle of refraction, and <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the thickness of
                    the plate, it is easily seen that</p>
                <p>BC cos α' <hi rend="italic">= t,</hi> and BD = 2BC sin α' = 2i tan α'.</p>
                <p>Hence 2gBC - Bd= <hi rend="italic">2μt</hi> cos <hi rend="italic">α'.</hi></p>
                <p>Hence whenever, for a given thickness of plate, α' is such that <hi rend="italic"
                    >2μt</hi> COS α'</p>
                <p>is an integral multiple of λ, the two rays should reinforce one another at E. The
                    same will happen for a given angle of incidence when the thickness of the plate
                    is such that <hi rend="italic">2μt</hi> cos α'</p>
                <p>is an integral multiple of λ. When, on either account <hi rend="italic">2 pt</hi>
                    cos <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is an odd integral multiple of λ∕2; the rays at E
                    will weaken (perhaps destroy) one another.</p>
                <p>Hence, in homogeneous light, a thin plate, turned about, alternately reflects and
                    does not reflect to an eye in a given position. And a fixed plate of non-uniform
                    thickness reflects light from some parts and not from others. When white light
                    is used there will in general be colours seen which vary with the angle of
                    incidence, and also with the thickness. If the plate is infinitely thin it would
                    appear that there should be infinitely slight retardation only, and the plate
                    should thus be bright in homogeneous light (and of course white in white light)
                    at all incidences.</p>
                <p>In general this is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the case. Thus when a soap bubble,
                    or a vertical soap-film, is screened from currents of air, and allowed to drain,
                    the uppermost <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> the thinnest) part becomes perfectly
                    <hi rend="italic">black.</hi> It can, in fact, be seen only by the feeble light
                    scattered by little drops of oil or particles of soap or dust on its surface.
                    Here, again, Young’s sagacity supplied the germ at least of the explanation. It
                    is given in the following extract from his <hi rend="italic">Theory of Light and
                    Colours,</hi> the Bakerian Lecture for 1801 already referred to :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">“Proposition</hi> IV. — <hi rend="italic">ΤVhen an
                    undulation arrives at a Surface which is the Limit of Mediums of different
                    Densities, a partial Reflexion takes place, proportionate in Force to the
                    Difference of the Densities.</hi></p>
                <p>“This may be illustrated, if not demonstrated, by the analogy ol elastic bodies
                    of different sizes. ‘ If a smaller elastic body strikes against a larger one, it
                    is well known that the smaller is reflected more or less powerfully, according
                    to the difference of their magnitudes: thus, there is always a reflexion when
                    the rays of light pass from a rarer to a denser stratum of ether, and frequently
                    an echo when a sound strikes against a cloud. A greater body striking a smaller
                    one propels it, without losing all its motion; thus, the particles of a denser
                    stratum of ether do not impart the whole of their motion to a rarer, but, in
                    their effort to proceed, they are recalled by the attraction of the refracting
                    substance with equal force; and thus a reflexion is always secondarily produced,
                    when the rays of light pass from a denser to a rarer stratum.’ But it is not
                    absolutely necessary to suppose an attraction in the latter case, since the
                    effort to proceed would be propagated backwards without <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n628/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0628-0609"/> it, and the undulation would be reversed, a
                    rarefaction returning in place of a condensation; and this will perhaps be found
                    most consistent with the phenomena.”</p>
                <p>This idea, of a rarefaction returning by reflexion when a condensation is
                    incident, is equivalent to a loss or gain of half a wave-length when light in a
                    denser body is reflected at the surface of a rarer body. Whether, then, the
                    plate be denser or rarer than the medium surrounding it, one or other of the two
                    interfering rays loses half an undulation more than the other in the mere act of
                    reflexion. This completely removes the difficulty. But Young went farther, and
                    pointed out that if a thin plate be interposed between two media, one rarer, the
                    other denser than the plate, this half wave-length effect should disappear. He
                    verified this conjecture by direct experiment, founded on a modification of a
                    process due to Newton.</p>
                <p>Newton had, long before, devised and carefully employed an excessively ingenious
                    (because extremely simple and effective) method of studying the colours of thin
                    plates. It consisted merely in laying a lens of long focus on a flat plate of
                    glass. The film of air or other fluid between the spherical surface and its
                    tangent plane has a thickness which is directly proportional to the square of
                    the distance from the point of contact When such an arrangement is looked at in
                    homogeneous light, the lens having been pressed into contact with the flat
                    plate, there is seen a central black spot, surrounded by successive bright and
                    dark rings, whose number appears to be practically unlimited. The radii of the
                    successive bright rings were found by Newton to be as the square roots of the
                    odd numbers 1, 3, 5, &amp;c. Hence the thicknesses of the film of air are
                    directly as these numbers. When rays of higher refrangibility are used the rings
                    diminish in diameter. Hence when white light is employed we have a superposition
                    of coloured rings of all sizes, but it is no longer possible to trace more than
                    four or five alternations of <hi rend="italic">bright</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dark</hi> rings—the colours being then more and more compound. This series of
                    coloured rings is named after Newton, and the successive colours, gradually more
                    and more composite, form Newton’s <hi rend="italic">scale of colours.</hi> Thus
                    we read, in books more than thirty years old, of a red or blue of the <hi
                    rend="italic">third order,</hi> meaning those colours as seen in the third
                    bright ring round the central dark spot.</p>
                <p>Many of the most vivid colours of natural and artificial bodies are due to one or
                    other of the forms of interference we have roughly explained. Thus Barton’s <hi
                    rend="italic">buttons</hi> (once employed for ornament as they produce an effect
                    very similar to that of diamonds) were simply polished metal plates stamped by a
                    die of hardened steel, on whose surface a pattern had been engraved consisting
                    of small areas ruled in different directions with close equidistant parallel
                    grooves. That the colours of a pearl and of mother-of-pearl are due to a similar
                    surface corrugation was proved by Brewster, who took impressions from such
                    substances in black wax, and found that it was thus rendered capable of giving
                    the same play of colours. The scales from the wings of butterflies owe their
                    bright colours to a delicate ribbed structure. On the other hand, the thin
                    transparent wings of the house-fly, earwig, &lt;fcc., owe their colours to their
                    thinness. The same is true of the temper colour of steel, Nobili’s rings,
                    &amp;c. Very beautiful examples of thin plates scaled off from decayed glass
                    (found in Roman excavations) have been figured, with their play of colours, by
                    Brewster. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi></p>
                <p>Here we can only say a word or two about the probable relation between the
                    wave-length of homogeneous light and its refractive index for any isotropic
                    medium. The existence of dispersion was attributed by Cauchy to the fact that
                    even the most homogeneous media, such as water, have grained or heterogeneous
                    structure of dimensions not incomparably smaller than the average length of a
                    wave of light. This grained structure has been recently proved to exist, by
                    several perfectly independent processes arising from totally unconnected
                    branches of physics; and its dimensions have been assigned, at least in a
                    roughly approximate manner. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Atom,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Constitution of Bodies.</hi></p>
                <p>It appears from the theory of disturbances in such a medium that the velocity of
                    a ray depends upon its wavelength in a manner which is expressed by a series of
                    even inverse powers of that wave-length. Hence we have a relation such as</p>
                <p>M-+f.+⅛÷</p>
                <p>in which, from our present ignorance of the precise connexion between matter and
                    ether, we must be content to find the multipliers of the various terms by direct
                    measurement. If we neglect all but the first two terms, we may determine α and
                    <hi rend="italic">β</hi> from the known wave-lengths of two of Fraunhofer’s
                    lines, and their refractive indices for a particular medium. We can then test
                    the accuracy of the formula by its agreement with the corresponding numbers in
                    the same medium for others of the fixed lines. Thus, taking the data for water
                    given above, we have, from the numbers for the two hydrogen-lines C and F, the
                    values</p>
                <p>α = 1*3243,</p>
                <p>0-0*00000000319.</p>
                <p>Calculating from these, and the wave-length of H, we have for its refractive
                    index D3447, instead of D3442 as determined by Fraunhofer. So far as we may
                    trust this theory, which certainly accords fairly with the experimental data for
                    substances of moderate dispersive powers, though by no means well with those for
                    substances of high dispersive power such as oil of cassia, the value of the
                    quantity α is the refractive index for the <hi rend="italic">longest possible
                    waves; i.e.,</hi> it is that of the inferior limit of the spectrum.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Double Refraction.</hi> —We now come to phenomena which
                    cannot be even roughly explained by processes based on the vague analogies of
                    sound and water waves which have hitherto sufficed for our elementary treatment
                    of the subject</p>
                <p>These phenomena were first observed in Iceland spar. They were described in a
                    general way by Bartholinus, who showed that one of the two rays into which a
                    single incident ray is divided by this substance follows the ordinary law of
                    refraction. Huygens, who studied the subject only eight years later, verified
                    the greater part of the results of Bartholinus, and added many new ones. From
                    his point of view it was of course obvious that the ordinary ray is propagated
                    by spherical waves, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> its velocity is the same in all
                    directions inside the crystal. To explain the extraordinary ray, he assumed that
                    it was propagated in waves of the form of an ellipsoid of revolution, the
                    simplest assumption he could make. To test its accuracy he first noticed that a
                    rhombohedral crystal of Iceland spar behaves in precisely the same way whichever
                    pair of parallel faces light passes through. Hence he acutely concluded that the
                    axes of the ellipsoids of revolution (if such were the form of the waves for the
                    extraordinary ray) must be symmetrically situated with regard to each of these
                    planes. The only such lines in a rhombohedron are parallel to that which joins
                    those corners which are formed by the meeting of three equal plane angles. In
                    the case of Iceland spar these equal angles are obtuse. Huygens then verified,
                    by experiments well contrived, though carried out by a very rough mode of
                    measurement, the general agreement of his hypothesis with the fact; and he
                    further tested it by comparing its indications as to the position of the two
                    images for any position of the crystal <pb break="no"

                    be no question that the whole investigation was, for the age in which it was
                    made, of an exceedingly high order. But it must not be left unsaid that far more
                    accurate measurements than those of Huygens were necessary before it could be
                    asserted that the form of the extraordinary wave <hi rend="italic">is</hi> an
                    ellipsoid of revolution, and not merely a surface closely resembling such an
                    ellipsoid. These improved measurements were made 1802 by Wollaston, and they
                    have recently been repeated with far more perfect optical means by Stokes,
                    Mascart, and Glazebrook. The result has been the complete verification of
                    Huygens’s conjecture. The generating ellipse of the extraordinary waves is found
                    to have its minor axis, which is that of revolution, equal to the diameter of
                    the corresponding sphere for the ordinary ray. Its major axis is to the minor
                    nearly in the ratio 1-654:1∙483.</p>
                <p>We are now in a position to trace the paths of the two rays into which a ray
                    falling in any direction on a surface of the crystal is divided by
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>Let fig. 34 represent a plane wave front AB (in air) falling on the surface AC of
                    a piece of Iceland spar cut in any way. The figure is a section perpendicular to
                    the surface, and parallel to the incident ray. The wave-front AB cuts the
                    surface of the spar in a line (not shown) at right angles to the plane of the
                    paper. Draw from A the axis Aα (not necessarily in the plane of the paper) and
                    the sphere and ellipsoid of revolution which have Aα for a common axis. Then, if
                    C be taken such that BC is to Aα as the velocity of light in air is to that of
                    the ordinary ray in the crystal, the wave-front of the ordinary ray is found by
                    drawing a tangent plane to the sphere, passing through C and perpendicular to
                    the plane of the paper. This touches the sphere in a point o (in the plane of
                    the paper) and AoO is the ordinary ray.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>This is merely a repetition of the construction we have
                    already given for singly refracting bodies.</p></note> To find the direction of
                    the extraordinary ray, a plane perpendicular to the paper, and passing through
                    C, must be drawn so as to touch the ellipsoid. Let <hi rend="italic">e</hi> be
                    the point of contact, which will in general not be in the plane of the paper
                    unless Aα is in or perpendicular to that plane; then AeE is the extraordinary
                    ray.</p>
                <p>Thus, in general, the extraordinary ray is not in the plane of incidence. Also
                    the ratio of the sines of the angles of incidence and refraction is generally
                    different for different directions of incidence, in the case of the
                    extraordinary ray.</p>
                <p>In an elementary article we cannot attempt more fully to study these phenomena;
                    so we merely state that all the observed appearances, so far as the <hi
                    rend="italic">directions</hi> of the refracted rays are concerned, are explained
                    by supposing the wave-surface in the crystal to be made up of the sphere and the
                    ellipsoid of revolution above described. Thus, when both eyes are used, the two
                    images of a plane object seen through a crystal of Iceland spar appear in
                    general to be situated at different distances above the plane. One of them
                    maintains its apparent position as the crystal is made to rotate about a
                    perpendicular to the two faces employed; the other’s position varies as the
                    crystal is turned.</p>
                <p>But we have now to inquire <hi rend="italic">why</hi> the incident ray is divided
                    into two, and why one of them follows the ordinary law of refraction. Here
                    another experimental result of Huygens comes to our assistance. We paraphrase
                    the author’s description :—</p>
                <p>“I will, before concluding, mention another remarkable phenomenon which I
                    discovered after the above was written. For, although I have not yet been able
                    to find the cause of it, I do not wish on that account to refrain from pointing
                    it out, in order that others may have an opportunity of seeking to explain it.
                    It appears that it will be necessary to make hypotheses additional to those
                    already given,—though these will lose none of their probability, confirmed as
                    they have been by so many tests. The phenomenon is that, taking two fragments of
                    the crystal (Iceland spar) and laying them on one another, or even holding them
                    apart, if all the faces of the one be parallel to those of the other, a ray of
                    light divided into two by the first fragment will not be farther subdivided by
                    the second. The ordinary ray from the first will be refracted ordinarily by the
                    second, the extraordinary ray extraordinarily. And the same thing happens not
                    only in this arrangement but in all others in which the principal sections<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Defined as passing through
                    the shorter diagonal of one of the rhombic faces of the crystal, and through the
                    edge formed by the two adjacent faces.</p></note> of the two fragments are in
                    the same plane, -whether the surfaces turned towards one another be parallel or
                    not. It is, in fact, marvellous that these rays, falling on the second fragment,
                    do not divide like the ray incident on the first. One would say that the
                    ordinary ray from the first fragment <hi rend="italic">had lost</hi> what is
                    necessary for the production of extraordinary refraction, and the extraordinary
                    ray that which is necessary for ordinary refraction; but there is something else
                    which upsets this view. For when one places the fragments so that their
                    principal sections are at right angles, whether the opposed surfaces be parallel
                    or not, the ordinary ray from the first suffers only extraordinary refraction by
                    the second, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>“But in all the infinite number of positions other than those named, both rays
                    from the first fragment are divided into two by the second. Thus the single
                    incident ray is divided into four, sometimes equally sometimes unequally bright,
                    according to the varying relative position of the crystals. But all together do
                    not seem to have more light than has the single incident ray.</p>
                <p>“When we consider that, the two rays given by the first crystal remaining the
                    same, it depends upon the position of the second crystal whether they shall be
                    divided into two or not, while the incident ray is always divided, it appears
                    that we must conclude that the waves of light which have traversed the first
                    crystal have acquired a form or disposition which in some positions enables them
                    to excite the two kinds of matter which give rise to the two kinds of
                    refraction, in other positions to excite only one of them. But I have not yet
                    been able to find any satisfactory explanation of this.”</p>
                <p>So far Huygens. His statements are perfectly in accordance with fact; and they
                    were reproduced by Newton<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Optics,</hi> Queries 25, 26.</p></note> in very nearly the
                    same form. Newton adds :—“The unusual refraction is, therefore, performed by an
                    original property of the rays. And it remains to be enquired, whether the rays
                    have not more original properties than are yet discovered. Have not the rays of
                    light several sides, endued with several original properties ?”</p>
                <p>It is very curious to notice how near each of these great men came to the true
                    explanation, and yet how long time elapsed before that explanation was found.
                    The date of Huygens’s work is 1690, that of Newton’s 1704. It was not till 1810
                    that farther information on the subject was obtained. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Then</hi> one brilliant observation opened the way for a host of discoveries in

                <p>In the last-mentioned year Malus, while engaged on the theory of double
                    refraction, casually examined through a doubly refracting prism of quartz the
                    sunlight <hi rend="italic">reflected</hi> from the windows of the Luxembourg
                    palace. He was surprised to find that the two rays alternately disappeared as
                    the prism was rotated through successive right angles, —in other words, that the
                    reflected light had acquired properties exactly corresponding to those of the
                    rays transmitted through Iceland spar. Even Malus was so imbued with the
                    corpuscular theory of light that he named this phenomenon <hi rend="italic"
                    >polarization,</hi> holding it as inexplicable on the wave theory, and as
                    requiring a species of polarity (akin to the magnetic) in the light-corpuscles—a
                    close reproduction of one of Newton’s guesses.</p>
                <p>But after a short time Hooke’s old guess was independently reproduced, and in the
                    hands of Young and others, but most especially of Fresnel, the consequences of
                    the assumption, that the vibrations of the luminiferous medium take place <hi
                    rend="italic">perpendicularly</hi> to the direction of the ray, were the almost
                    complete explanation of the cause of double refraction, and the discovery (often
                    the prediction) of a long series of the most gorgeous phenomena known to
                    science.</p>
                <p>The real difficulty in the way of this conception probably lay in the fact that
                    most of the familiar forms of wavemotion—such as sound-waves in air or in water,
                    and ordinary water waves—are not of this character. In sound-waves the
                    vibrations are wholly in the direction of the ray, while in surface-waves in
                    water they are partly parallel to and partly perpendicular to the direction in
                    which the wave is travelling. That a body may transmit waves in which the
                    vibration is perpendicular to the direction of a ray, it must have the
                    properties of an elastic <hi rend="italic">solid</hi> rather than of a fluid of
                    any kind. And our experience of the almost entire absence of resistance to the
                    planetary motion seems, at first sight at least, altogether incompatible with
                    the idea that the planets move in a jelly-like solid, filling all space through
                    which light can be propagated.</p>
                <p>Without going into difficult dynamical details, we may obtain a notion of the
                    nature of the motion now to be considered, by observing the propagation of a
                    wave when a long stretched wire or string is struck or plucked near one end.
                    Here the line of motion of each part of the wire is almost exactly perpendicular
                    to the direction of the wire, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to the line along
                    which the wave travels. (When the string is extensible there may be another
                    wave, due to extension; but this, which is analogous to sound, has its
                    vibrations <hi rend="italic">along</hi> the string, and it usually travels at a
                    very different rate from the other, so that the two are not in any way
                    associated).</p>
                <p>Now it is clear that waves of this wholly transverse character can have, in
                    Newton’s language, <hi rend="italic">sides.</hi> And it is also clear that they
                    cannot interfere so as mutually to destroy one another unless their
                    corresponding sides are parallel to one another; nor can they interfere <hi
                    rend="italic">at all</hi> if their sides are perpendicular to one another. Hence
                    a very severe test of the theory will be furnished by examining various cases of
                    interference of polarized light, which ought to present in general marked
                    differences from those of ordinary light. It was by experiments of this kind
                    that Fresnel and Arago first firmly established the bases of the theory of
                    polarization. The important fact discovered by Malus was soon generalized into
                    the following statement :—</p>
                <p>Light reflected from the surface of substances so different as water, glass,
                    polished wood, &amp;c., at a certain definite angle, which depends on the nature
                    of the substance, is found to possess all the properties of one of the rays
                    transmitted through Iceland spar. If the plane of reflexion is parallel to the
                    axis of the spar, the properties of the reflected light are those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ordinary</hi> ray; if perpendicular to it, those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">extraordinary</hi> ray.</p>
                <p>It was reserved for Brewster to discover, as the resul of an extraordinary series
                    of experimental measurements, the very simple law which follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The tangent of the polarizing angle is equal to the refractive
                    index of the reflecting substance.</hi></p>
                <p>This may be put in another form, in which its connexion with theory is a little
                    more evident :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">When the reflected ray is completely polarized, it is
                    perpendicular to the refracted ray.</hi></p>
                <p>Bearing in mind Huygens’s observations on light which has passed through two
                    crystals of Iceland spar, we can now see that a ray of light polarized by
                    reflexion is in general divided into two by a crystal of Iceland spar. But there
                    is only one ray when the principal plane of the crystal is parallel to the plane
                    of reflexion, and none when these planes are perpendicular to one another.</p>
                <p>We may now much simplify matters by suppressing the Iceland spar, and using two
                    reflecting plates of glass, so placed that a ray meets each of them in
                    succession at the polarizing angle. It is then found that when the planes of
                    reflexion are parallel the ray is reflected (almost without loss) from the
                    second plate, but when they are perpendicular to one another there is complete
                    extinction. In intermediate positions the intensity was found by Arago to be as
                    the square of the cosine of the inclination of these planes.</p>
                <p>This very simple experiment, which any one may easily make for himself, by
                    putting two pieces of glass at the proper angle in the ends of two wooden tubes
                    which fit into one another, enables us to form a general notion of the
                    modification which is called polarization. The “sides” of the reflected ray are
                    obviously in, and perpendicular to, the plane of incidence; for a ray can be
                    reflected over and over again if the successive planes of incidence are
                    parallel, but is stopped at once if one of them be perpendicular to the
                    others.</p>
                <p>Here, however, two new difficulties come in at once :— (1) Are the vibrations of
                    the reflected ray in, or perpendicular to, the plane of reflexion? (2) As
                    ordinary sun or lamp light, reflected at the proper angle from a polarizing
                    surface, shows no variation of intensity when the azimuth of the plane of
                    reflexion is changed, what can be then the direction of <hi rend="italic"
                    >its</hi> vibrations? These questions have not yet been answered in a thoroughly
                    satisfactory manner Many important phenomena are explained in terms quite
                    independent of the proper answer to (1); and, in others which do depend on the
                    answer, the theoretical differences between the results of the two hypotheses
                    are so small as to have hitherto remained undetected. In an important test,
                    suggested by Stokes, the experimental results have been at variance in a way not
                    yet explained. It is quite possible that, as is required by Clerk Maxwell’s <hi
                    rend="italic">electromagnetic theory</hi> of light (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ether),</hi> there may be simultaneous displacements, but of different
                    characters, in each of these planes, and then the question would be reduced
                    to—Which of these displacements is the luminous one? But on this theory, <hi
                    rend="italic">both</hi> are probably essential to vision.</p>
                <p>As to the second question, it may be said— <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> that, so
                    far as the test of double refraction can inform us, a polarized ray <hi
                    rend="italic">whose plane of polarization is made to rotate rapidly</hi>
                    produces precisely the same effects as a ray of ordinary light; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">secondly,</hi> that, so great is the number of vibrations even of
                    red light in one second, it would be impossible to make the plane of
                    polarization rotate fast enough to affect the circumstances of any of the
                    phenomena of interference, even when they take place between two portions of the
                    same ray, one of which is retarded <pb break="no"

                    But, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> the fact that, when homogeneous light is

                    light, they must for at least 7000 waves in succession be almost precisely
                    similar to one another. Then, for other 7000 waves or so, we may have a totally
                    different type of vibration. But, <hi rend="italic">fourthly,</hi> in the course
                    of γth of a second, at the very utmost, the vibrations must have been almost
                    uniformly distributed over all directions perpendicular to the ray. Again,
                    however, <hi rend="italic">fifthly,</hi> another quite different view may be
                    suggested. All common light has its origin from a practically infinite number of
                    sources, consisting of the vibrating particles of the luminous body. The
                    contributions from each of these sources (so far as one definite wave-length is
                    concerned) may be and probably <hi rend="italic">are</hi> at any one point as
                    different in direction of vibration as they certainly must be in phase.<note

                    the case of light radiated from a body which polarizes by absorption. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Radiation.</hi></p></note> From this point of view, which we
                    cannot develop here, the uniformity of optical phenomena becomes quite analogous
                    to the statistical species of uniformity which is now found to account for the
                    behaviour of the practically infinite group of particles forming a cubic inch of
                    gas. The reader need only think of the fact that, so numerous are those
                    particles, it is practically (though not theoretically) impossible that even a
                    cubic millimetre of air should, even for <hi rend="subscript"> τπ</hi> ⅞ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi> θth of a second, contain oxygen particles alone.</p>
                <p>When light is reflected at an incidence either less or greater than the
                    polarizing angle, it behaves as if part of it only were polarized and the rest
                    ordinary light; and it is said to be <hi rend="italic">partially polarized.</hi>
                    Tested by a crystal of Iceland spar, it gives two images in all positions of the
                    crystal; but their brightness is unequal except in the special positions where
                    they would be of equal brightness were the ray wholly polarized.</p>
                <p>From the fourth of the remarks made above regarding common light, and the facts
                    of double refraction, it follows at once that, when light is to any extent
                    polarized by reflexion, there must be an exactly equal amount of polarized light
                    in the refracted ray, and its plane of polarization must be perpendicular to
                    that of refraction. This was established by experiment soon after Malus’s
                    discovery. But as the reflected ray from glass, water, &amp;c., is in general
                    much weaker than the refracted ray, the percentage of polarized light is
                    generally much greater in the former. It was found, however, by experiment that
                    refraction at a second glass plate parallel to the first increases the
                    proportion of polarized to common light in the transmitted ray, and thus that
                    light may be almost completely polarized by transmission, at the proper angle,
                    through a number of parallel plates. The experimental data of this subject were
                    very carefully obtained by Brewster. He has found, for instance, how the angle
                    of incidence for the most complete polarization varies with the number of
                    plates. The plane of polarization of such a bundle is <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpendicular</hi> to the plane of refraction.</p>
                <p>This, however useful on many occasions, is at best a rough arrangement for
                    producing polarized light. By far the most perfect polarizer for a broad beam of
                    light is a crystal of Iceland spar, sufficiently thick to allow of the complete
                    separation of the two rays. But such specimens are rare and costly, so that the
                    polarizer in practical use is now what is called <hi rend="italic">Nicol's
                    prism,</hi> invented in 1828 <hi rend="italic">{Jameson's Journal,</hi> p. 83).
                    By cutting a rhomb of Iceland spar in two, and cementing the pieces together
                    with Canada balsam (after carefully polishing the cut faces),</p>
                <p>Nicol produced an arrangement in which one only of the two rays is transmitted,
                    the other being totally reflected at the surface of the balsam. The reason is
                    simply that the refractive index of Canada balsam is intermediate to those of
                    the ordinary and extraordinary rays in the spar. The ordinary ray, falling very
                    obliquely on a medium of a smaller refractive index, is totally reflected; the
                    extraordinary ray, falling on a medium of greater, but very little greater,
                    refractive power, is almost wholly transmitted. The only defect of the Nicol’s
                    prism is that, to secure the total reflexion, its length must be considerably
                    greater than its breadth; and thus it necessarily limits the divergency of the
                    beam it allows to pass.</p>
                <p>Certain doubly refracting crystals exert considerable absorption on one of the
                    two rays they produce, and can therefore, when in plates of sufficient
                    thickness, be employed as polarizers. This is the case with some specimens of
                    tourmaline when cut into plates parallel to the axis of the crystal. It is also
                    found in the flat crystals of several artificial salts, such as, for instance,
                    iodo-sulphate of quinine.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose that by one or other of these pieces of apparatus, say a
                    Nicol’s prism, light has been polarized. If we examine this ray by means of a
                    second Nicol, placed in a similar position to the first, it passes practically
                    unaltered. As the second Nicol is made to rotate, more and more of the light is
                    stopped, till the rotation amounts to a right angle. Two well-constructed
                    Nicols, placed in this position, are practically opaque to the strongest
                    sunlight. During the next quadrant of rotation the transmitted ray gradually
                    increases in brightness, until at 180° of rotation it passes practically
                    unaltered. Precisely the same phenomena occur in the same order during the next
                    half of a complete rotation. The reader will observe that this is merely
                    Huygens’s original statement, limited to one of the four rays which are produced
                    by passing common light successively through two crystals of Iceland spar.</p>
                <p>Whatever be the true mechanism of polarized light, there can be no doubt that its
                    vibrations are <hi rend="italic">symmetrical</hi> with respect to the ray, and
                    also with respect to the plane of polarization. Hence we may, for many important
                    purposes, symbolize them by simple harmonic vibrations taking place either id or
                    perpendicular to the plane of polarization. But, if they be supposed to take
                    place simultaneously in these two planes, their quality or nature must be
                    essentially different in the two, else the symmetry above referred to would be
                    violated. Hence it will be sufficient for the present to assume that they take
                    place perpendicular to the plane of polarization. The nature of the resulting
                    effects, so far as the eye is concerned, will not be different for the different
                    hypotheses. Also, as no instance has yet been observed, even with the most
                    intense beams of light, in which the joint effects observed are not those due to
                    simple superposition, we may assume that the elastic force of the luminiferous
                    medium, called into play by a displacement, is directly proportional to the
                    displacement, and therefore that the vibrations for each wave-length follow the
                    <hi rend="italic">simple harmonic law,</hi> that of the cycloidal pendulum.</p>
                <p>The subject of the composition of simple harmonic motions of equal period falls
                    to be discussed as an important branch of <hi rend="italic">kinematics</hi> (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics).</hi> We will therefore here assume the
                    following results,—referring to the above-quoted article for their proof :—</p>
                <p>1. Two simple harmonic motions of the same period, in lines perpendicular to one
                    another, give, in general, elliptic motion, which may be in the positive or
                    negative direction of rotation.</p>
                <p>2. The ellipse becomes a straight line, and the resultant motion therefore simple
                    harmonic, when the phases of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n632/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0632-0613"/> components are the same, or differ by an integral
                    multiple of τr.</p>
                <p>3. It becomes a circle when the amplitudes of the components are equal, and their
                    phases differ by an odd multiple of ⅜ τr. The motion takes place in one
                    direction (say right-handedly) in the circle when this multiplier is 1, 5, 9,
                    13, &lt;fcc., and in the opposite (left-handed) when it is 3, 7, 11, 15, &amp;c.
                    . .</p>
                <p>Now, suppose a plane polarized ray to fall on a plate of a doubly-refracting
                    crystal (a thin plate of mica or selenite, for instance). Within the plate it
                    will in general be divided into two, which are polarized in planes at right
                    angles to one another. The directions of vibration in these rays are determined
                    by the physical properties of the material. Let them be represented by the lines
                    Oz, Oy in fig. 35. Then, if OA represents the semiamplitude of vibration in the
                    incident ray, it may be looked on by (2) above as the resultant of two simple
                    harmonic motions of the same period, whose semiamplitudes are OM and ON, and
                    which are in the same phase. Each of these will pass through the plate of
                    crystal <hi rend="italic">unchanged.</hi> But one will, in general, travel
                    faster than the other; for the essential cause of double refraction is the
                    difference of velocities of the two rays. The portions of the two rays which
                    simultaneously escape from the crystal, and which travel together outside it,
                    will therefore <hi rend="italic">differ in phase.</hi> Hence, to find the nature
                    of the transmitted light, we must recombine the vibrations in OM, ON, taking
                    account of this difference of phase. By (1) above the result will be in general
                    elliptic motion. The ellipse will necessarily be one of the infinite number
                    which can be inscribed in the rectangle AA'BB', whose construction is obvious.
                    We have then, in general, what is called <hi rend="italic">elliptically
                    polarized light.</hi> This degenerates (by (2) above) into plane polarized <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> light, whose vibrations are along OA or OA' according
                    as the difference of phase is 0, 2π∙, 4τr, &lt;fcc., or τr, 3τr, 5τr, &lt;fcc.
                    And it will become <hi rend="italic">circularly polarized light</hi> if OM = ON
                    <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> if AO∙r = ∣τr) and the difference of phase be an
                    odd multiple of ⅜τr. By (3) above this will be right or left handed, according
                    to the value of the odd multiplier.</p>
                <p>This conclusion from the assumption above made is fully borne out by experiment.
                    When a plate of mica, of such a thickness as to retard one of the two rays a
                    quarter of a wave-length more than the other, is interposed between two Nicols,
                    we observe the following phenomena :—</p>
                <p>If the Nicols were originally placed so as to extinguish the light, the
                    introduction of the mica plate in general partially restores it. Now, let the
                    mica plate be made to rotate in its own plane. The light vanishes for successive
                    positions, differing by a quadrant of rotation, <hi rend="italic">ie.</hi>
                    whenever the directions of vibration in the crystal coincide with the principal
                    planes of the Nicols. In each of these positions the light from tlm first Nicol
                    passes unchanged through the mica, and is therefore entirely stopped by the
                    second Nicol. Half-way between these positions the light transmitted through the
                    system is at its brightest; and in these cases it is not altered in brightness
                    by rotating the second Nicol. It is then circularly polarized, and in whatever
                    direction the second Nicol is placed the component of the circular motion which
                    is ready to pass through it is of the same amplitude. Here, then, is a case in
                    which a Nicol (the second) cannot enable us to distinguish between common light
                    and light very seriously modified.</p>
                <p>In what precedes, we have assumed that <hi rend="italic">homogeneous</hi> light
                    was used. In general, a doubly-refracting plate produces a difference of phase
                    in its two rays which will depend on their wave-length; and thus when white
                    light is used we have a display of colour, sometimes extremely gorgeous, and we
                    may distinguish light thus circularly polarized from common light by slight
                    changes of colour and intensity as the second Nicol is turned.</p>
                <p>Hitherto we have spoken of the polarizing angle for light reflected in air from
                    bodies such as glass, water, &amp;c., which have a higher refractive index than
                    air, and we have seen that an equal amount of light is polarized in the
                    refracted beam. But what if there be no refracted beam? This is the case of
                    total reflexion inside the denser body. Fresnel discovered that in this case the
                    two kinds of polarized light (in planes at right angles to one another) co-exist
                    in the totally reflected ray, but that they differ in phase, and therefore in
                    general recombine into elliptically polarized light. Guided by peculiar
                    theoretical considerations, he was led to construct a piece of glass <hi
                    rend="italic">(Fresnel's rhomb),</hi> inside which light is twice totally
                    reflected at a certain angle with the result that, if it be originally polarized
                    in a plane inclined at 45° to the plane of reflexion, the emergent light is
                    circularly polarized.</p>
                <p>Reflexion from the surface of metals, and of very highly refractive substances
                    such as diamond, generally gives at all incidences elliptically polarized light.
                    Attempts have been made to determine from such effects the refractive indices of
                    metals and other opaque substances. These are all based upon theory, and cannot
                    as yet command much confidence. With certain doubly-refracting substances the
                    light reflected at a definite angle is differently polarized, and sometimes even
                    differently coloured, for different azimuths of the plane of incidence.</p>
                <p>When a thin plate of doubly-refracting crystal, which gives a bright colour when
                    placed between two Nicols, is slightly inclined to the ray, the colour changes
                    as the difference of phase of the two refracted rays is increased. If, now, we
                    take a plate of Iceland spar cut perpendicularly to the axis, no colour will be
                    produced by parallel rays passing through it perpendicularly, because both rays
                    have a common velocity parallel to the axis; but, if divergent light be used,
                    there is a gorgeous display of circular coloured rings surrounding the axis,
                    which depends upon the increasing retardation of the ordinary ray behind the
                    extraordinary as their inclination to the axis increases. When the principal
                    planes of the Nicols are at right angles, this system of rings is intersected by
                    two black diameters, in these planes respectively. When the second Nicol is
                    turned through a right angle, we have exactly the <hi rend="italic"
                    >complement</hi> of the former appearance, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a figure
                    such that, if superposed on the former, it would give an uniform field of white
                    light.</p>
                <p>It is to be noticed that none of these phenomena can be observed without the use
                    of the second Nicol. This arises from the fact that, where the vibrations in any
                    direction interfere so as to destroy one another, those in the direction
                    perpendicular to the former interfere so as to strengthen one another. The
                    second Nicol enables us to select one of these portions, and examine it
                    independently of the other.</p>
                <p>The only double refraction we have considered particularly is that of Iceland
                    spar, where everything is symmetrical about the axis of the crystal. Such
                    crystals, and they include as a rule all those of the second and third systems
                    in <hi rend="smallcaps">Crystallography</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> are
                    called <hi rend="italic">uniaxαl.</hi> Crystals of the first system are not
                    doubly refractive. But it was one of the most valuable of Brewster’s discoveries
                    that the great majority of non-isotropic substances are doubly refracting, and

                    rend="italic">conical refraction,</hi> which was experimentally verified by
                    Lloyd.</p>
                <p>Fresnel also made the striking discovery that glass and other simply refracting
                    bodies are rendered doubly refracting when in a state of strain. To this
                    Brewster added the observation that the requisite strain might be produced by
                    unequal heating instead of by mechanical stress, and also that unannealed glass
                    is usually doubly refractive. Clerk Maxwell in 1873 (Proc. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roy. Soc.)</hi> showed that shearing stress in viscous liquids, such as Canada
                    balsam, renders them temporarily doubly-refractive. This subject has been
                    elaborately investigated by Kundt <hi rend="italic">{Pogg. Ann.,</hi> 1879).</p>
                <p>The details of these subjects, with those of the polarization of light reflected
                    from small particles, the <hi rend="italic">rotatory polarization</hi> produced
                    by quartz, sugar, transparent bodies uιrder the influence of magnetism,
                    &lt;fcc., must be deferred to <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics (Physical).</hi></p>
                <p>There is, however, one elementary point which must not be omitted here, as it is
                    intimately connected with the wave-theory,—that is, the alteration which light
                    undergoes in consequence of the relative motion of the source and spectator in
                    the line of vision.</p>
                <p>When a steamer is moving in a direction perpendicular to the crests of the waves,
                    she will encounter more of them in a given time if her course is towards them
                    than if she were at rest, while, if she be moving in the same direction as the
                    waves, fewer of them will overtake her in a given time than if she were at rest.
                    The same thing is true of soundwaves. When an express train passes a level
                    crossing at full speed, the pitch of the steam whistle is higher during the
                    approach to and lower during the recess from the listener at the gate than it
                    would be if the engine were at rest. The successive sound-pulses are emitted at
                    the same intervals as before, but from points successively nearer to or farther
                    from the listener. Hence more or fewer reach his ear in a given time. The
                    principle is precisely the same as that of Romer’s observation of the frequency
                    of eclipse of Jupiter’s satellites, which we have already given: the number of
                    light-waves which reach the eye per second is increased if the -source is
                    approaching, and diminished if it be receding. We are now dealing with a
                    phenomenon which occurs some 600,000,000,000,000 times per second instead of
                    once every forty-two hours. Now, increased wave-frequency, with unaltered
                    velocity of light, certainly implies shorter wave-length and most probably
                    greater refrangibility, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> There is,
                    undoubtedly, a weak link in this reasoning, due to our ignorance of the true
                    nature of the luminiferous medium and of the species of vibration on which light
                    depends. If we knew something definite about the nature of the ether, and the
                    mechanism of its vibrations, this weakness would be at least in part got rid of.
                    Observation has not yet settled the question of the relative motion of bodies,
                    the ether they contain, and the ether in free space.</p>
                <p>This principle has been applied with success by Huggins and others to find the
                    rate at which we are approaching to or receding from different fixed stars, and
                    the rate of motion in solar cyclones; and it may even be applied, as was
                    ingeniously suggested by Fox Talbot <hi rend="italic">lβ. A. Report,</hi> 1871),
                    to determine (from the relative velocities of the components of a double star in
                    the line of sight, measured by its aid) the distance of the star itself from our
                    system.</p>
