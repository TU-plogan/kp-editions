                <p><label type="entry">LLAMA</label>, sometimes spelt <hi rend="italic">Lama,</hi> a
                    word by which the Peruvians designated one of a small group of closely allied
                    animals, which, before the Spanish conquest of America, were the only
                    domesticated hoofed mammals of the country, being kept, not only for their value
                    as beasts of burden, but also for their flesh, hides, and wool,—in fact,
                    supplying in the domestic economy of the people the place of the horse, the ox,
                    the goat, and the sheep of the Old World. The word is now sometimes restricted
                    to one particular species or variety of the group, and sometimes used in a
                    generic sense to cover the whole. Although they were often compared by early
                    writers to sheep, and spoken of as such, their affinity to the camel was very
                    soon perceived, and they were included in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Camelus</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Systema</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Natures</hi> of Linnaeus. They were, however, separated by Cuvier in 1800 under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Lama,</hi> changed by liliger in 1811 to <hi
                    rend="italic">Auchenia</hi> (in allusion to the great length of neck, <hi
                    rend="italic">aυχf]ν),</hi> a term afterwards adopted by Cuvier, and almost
                    universally accepted by systematic zoologists, although there has been of late a
                    disposition to revive the earlier name.</p>
                <p>The animals of the genus <hi rend="italic">Auchenia</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lama</hi> are, with the two species of true camels (to which the generic term
                    <hi rend="italic">Camelus</hi> is now restricted), the sole existing
                    representatives of a very distinct section of the “artiodactyle” or eventoed
                    ungulates, called <hi rend="italic">Tylopoda,</hi> or “boss-footed,” from the
                    peculiar bosses or cushions placed on the under surface of their feet, and on
                    which they tread. This section thus consists of a single family, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Camelidae,</hi> the other sections of the same great division
                    being the <hi rend="italic">Suina</hi> or pigs, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traguliηa</hi> or chevrotains, and the <hi rend="italic">Pecora</hi> or true
                    ruminants, to each of which the <hi rend="italic">Tylopoda</hi> have more or
                    less affinity, standing in some respects in a central position between them,
                    borrowing as it were some characters from each, but in others showing great
                    special modifications not found in any of the other sections.</p>
                <p>Until within the last few years the existence of two genera having so very much
                    in common as the camels and the llamas, and yet so completely isolated
                    geographically, had not received any satisfactory explanation, for the old idea
                    that they in some way “represented” each other in the two hemispheres of the
                    world was a mere fancy without philosophical basis. The discoveries made mostly
                    within the past ten years of a vast and previously unsuspected extinct fauna of
                    the American continent of the Tertiary period, as interpreted by the able
                    palaeontologists Leidy, Cope, and Marsh, has thrown a flood of light upon the
                    early history of this family, and upon its relations to other mammals. It is now
                    known that llamas at one time were not confined to the part of the continent
                    south of the Isthmus of Panama, as at the present day, for their remains have
                    been abundantly found in the Pleistocene deposits of the region of the Rocky
                    Mountains, and in Central America, some attaining a much larger size than those
                    now existing. There have also been found in the same regions many camel-like
                    animals exhibiting different generic modifications, and, what is more
                    interesting, a gradual series of changes, coinciding with the antiquity of the
                    deposits in which they are found, have been traced from the thoroughly
                    differentiated species of the modern epoch down through the Pliocene to the
                    early Miocene beds, where, their characters having become by degrees more
                    generalized, they have lost all that especially distinguishes them as <hi
                    rend="italic">Camelidae,</hi> and are merged into forms common to the anecstral
                    type of all the other sections of the Artiodactyles. Hitherto none of these
                    annectant forms have been found in any of the fossiliferous strata of the Old
                    World; it may therefore be fairly surmised (according to the evidence at present
                    before us) that America was the original home of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tylopoda,</hi> and that the true camels have passed over into the Old World,
                    probably by way of the north of Asia, where we have every reason to believe
                    there was formerly a free communication between the continents, and then,
                    gradually driven southward, perhaps by changes of climate, having become
                    isolated, have undergone some further special modifications; while those members
                    of the family that remained in their original birthplace have become, through
                    causes not clearly understood, restricted solely to the southern or most distant
                    part of the continent. There are few groups of mammals of which the
                    palaeontological history has been so satisfactorily demonstrated as the one of
                    which we are treating.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The special characters which the llamas and camels have in common, and the
                    combination of which distinguishes them from the rest of the Artiodactyles, are
                    as follows. The premaxillae have the full number of incisor teeth in the young
                    state, and the outermost is persistent through life, an isolated laniariform
                    tooth. The canines are present in both jaws, and those of the mandible are
                    differentiated from the long, procumbent, and spatulate incisors, being suberect
                    and pointed. The crowns of the true molars belong to the crescentic or
                    “selenodont” type, and are very long or “hypsodont”; but one or more of the
                    anterior premolars is usually detached from the series, and of simple pointed
                    form. The hinder part of the body is much contracted, and the femur long and
                    vertically placed, so that the knee-joint is lower in position, and the thigh
                    altogether more detached from the abdomen than in most quadrupedal mammals. The
                    limbs are long, but with only two digits (the third and fourth) developed on
                    each, no traces of any of the others being present. The trapezoid and magnum of
                    the carpus, and the cuboid and navicular of the tarsus are distinct. The two
                    metapodal bones of each limb are confluent for the greater part of their length,
                    though <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n762/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0762-0739"/> separated for a considerable distance at the
                    lower end. Their distal articular surfaces, instead of being pulley-like, with
                    deep ridges and grooves, as in other Artiodactyles, are simple, rounded, and
                    smooth. The proximal phalanges are expanded at their distal ends, and the wide,
                    depressed middle phalanges are embedded in a broad cutaneous pad, forming the
                    sole of the foot, on which the animal rests in walking instead of on the hoofs.
                    The ungual phalanges are very small and nodular, not flattened on their inner or
                    opposed surfaces, and not completely encased in hoofs, but bearing nails on
                    their upper surface only. The cervical region is long and flexuous, and the
                    vertebrae of which it is composed are remarkable for the position of the canal
                    for the transmission of the vertebral artery, which does not perforate the
                    transverse process, but passes obliquely through the anterior part of the
                    pedicle of the arch (a condition only found in two other genera of mammals, <hi
                    rend="italic">Macrauchenia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myrmecophaga).</hi> There
                    are no horns or antlers. Though these animals ruminate, the stomach differs
                    considerably in the details of its construction from that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pecora.</hi> The interior of the rumen or paunch has no villi on
                    its surface, and there is no distinct psalterium or maniplies. Both first and
                    second compartments are remarkable for the presence of a number of pouches or
                    cells in their walls, with muscular septa, and a sphincter-like arrangement of
                    their orifices, by which they can be shut off from the rest of the cavity, and
                    into which the fluid portion only of the contents of the stomach is allowed to
                    enter.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The stomach of
                    the camel inhabiting the Arabian desert is commonly looked upon as a striking
                    example of specialized structure adapted or modified in direct accordance with a
                    highly specialized mode of life; it is therefore very remarkable to find an
                    organ exactly similar, except in some unessential details, in the llamas of the
                    Peruvian Andes and the guanacos of the Pampas. No hypothesis except that of a
                    common origin will satisfactorily account for this, and granting that this view
                    is correct, it becomes extremely interesting to find for how long a time two
                    genera may be isolated and yet retain such close similarities in parts which in
                    other groups appear readily subject to adaptive modifications.</p></note> The

                    Finally, they differ not only from other ungulates, but from all other mammals,
                    in the fact that the red corpuscles of the blood, instead of being circular in
                    outline, are oval as in the inferior vertebrated classes.</p>
                <p>The following characters apply especially to the llamas. Dentition of adults
                    :—incisors ⅜, canines f, premolars ⅜, molars ⅜; total 32. In the upper jaw there
                    is a compressed, sharp, pointed laniaτiform incisor near the hinder edge of the
                    premaxilla, followed in the male at least by a moderate-sized, pointed, curved
                    true canine in the anterior j&gt;art of the maxilla. The isolated canine-like
                    premolar which follows in the camels is not present. The teeth of the molar
                    series which are in contact with each other consist of two very small premolars
                    (the first almost rudimentary) and three broad molars, constructed generally
                    like those of <hi rend="italic">Camelus.</hi> In the lower jaw, the three
                    incisors are long, spatulate, and procumbent; the outer ones are the smallest.
                    Next to these is a curved, suberect canine, followed after an interval by an
                    isolated minute and often deciduous simple conical premolar; then a contiguous
                    series of one premolar and three molars, which differ from those of <hi
                    rend="italic">Camelus</hi> in having a small accessory column at the anterior
                    outer edge. The skull generally resembles that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Camelus,</hi> the relatively larger brain-cavity and orbits and less developed
                    cranial ridges being due to its smaller size. The nasal bones are shorter and
                    broader, and are joined by the premaxillae. Vertebrae:—cervical 7, dorsal 12,
                    lumbar 7, sacral 4, caudal 15 to 20. Ears rather long and pointed. No dorsal
                    hump. Feet narrow, the toes being more separated than in the camels, each having
                    a distinct plantar pad. Tail short. Hairy covering long and woolly. Size smaller
                    and general form lighter than in the camels. At present and within historic
                    times they are entirely confined to the western side and southermost parts of
                    South America, though fossil remains have been found in the caves of Brazil, in
                    the pampas of the Argentine republic, and, as before mentioned, in Central and
                    North America.</p>
                <p>In essential structural characters, as well as in general appearance and habits,
                    all the animals of this genus very closely resemble each other, so that the
                    question as to whether they should be considered as belonging to one, two, or
                    more species has been one which has led to a large amount of controversy among
                    naturalists. The question has been much complicated by the circumstance of the
                    great majority of individuals which have come under observation being either in
                    a completely or partially domesticated state, and descended from ancestors which
                    from time immemorial have been in like condition, one which always tends to
                    produce a certain amount of variation from the original type. It has, however,
                    lost much of its import ance since the doctrine of the distinct origin of
                    species has been generally abandoned. The four forms commonly distinguished by
                    the inhabitants of South America are recognized by some naturalists as distinct
                    species, and have had specific designations attached to them, though usually
                    with expressions of doubt, and with great difficulties in defining thei r
                    distinctive characteristics. These are—( 1 ) the llama, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Auchenia glama</hi> (Linn.), or <hi rend="italic">Lama peruana</hi>
                    (Tiedemann); (2) the alpaca, <hi rend="italic">A. pacos</hi> (Linn.); (3) the
                    guanaco or huanaco, <hi rend="italic">A. lvuanacus</hi> (Molina); and (4) the
                    vicugna, <hi rend="italic">A. vicugna</hi> (Molina), or <hi rend="italic">A.
                    vicunna,</hi> (Cuv.). The first and second are only known in the domestic state,
                    and are variable in size and colour, being often white, black, or piebald. The
                    third and fourth are wild, and of a nearly uniform lightbrown colour, passing
                    into white below. They certainly differ from each other, the vicugna being
                    smaller, more slender in its propor tions, and having a shorter head than the
                    guanaco. It may, therefore, according to the usual view of species, be
                    considered distinct. It lives in herds on the bleak and elevated parts of the
                    mountain range bordering the region of perpetual snow, amidst rocks and
                    precipices, occurring in various suitable localities throughout Peru, in the
                    southern part of Ecuador, and as far south as the middle of Bolivia. Its manners
                    very much resemble those of the chamois of the European Alps; and it is as
                    vigilant, wild, and timid. The wool is extremely delicate and soft, and highly
                    valued for the purposes of weaving, but the quantity which each animal produces
                    is not great.</p>
                <p>The guanaco has an extensive geographical range, from the high lands of the
                    Andean region of Ecuador and Peru to the open plains of Patagonia, and even the
                    wooded islands of Tierra del Fuego. It constitutes the principal food of the
                    Patagonian Indians, and its skin is invaluable to them, as furnishing the
                    material out of which their long robes are constructed. It is about the size of
                    a European red deer, and is an elegant animal, being possessed of a long,
                    slender, gracefully curved neck and fine legs. Dr Cunningham,<note

                <p>“It is not easy to describe its general appearance, which combines some of the
                    characters of a camel, a deer, and a goat. The body, deep at the breast but very
                    small at the loins, is covered with long, soft, very fine hair, which on the
                    upper parts is of a kind of fawn-colour, and beneath varies from a very pale
                    yellow to the most beautiful snow-white. The head is provided with large ears,
                    in general carried well back, and is covered with short greyish hair, which is
                    darkest on the forehead. Occasionally the face is nearly black. As a rale, it
                    lives in flocks of from half a dozen to several hundreds, but solitary
                    individuals are now and then to be met with. They are very difficult to approach
                    sufficiently near to admit of an easy shot, as they are extremely wary, but, on
                    being disturbed, canter off at a pace which soon puts a safe distance between
                    them and the sportsman, even though he should be mounted. Despite their
                    timidity, however, they are possessed of great curiosity, and will sometimes
                    advance within a comparatively short distance of an unknown object, at which
                    they will gaze fixedly till they take alarm, when they effect a speedy retreat.
                    Their cry is very peculiar, being something between the belling of a deer and
                    the neigh of a horse. It would be difficult to overestimate their numbers upon
                    the Patagonian plains; for in whatever direction we walked we always came upon
                    numbers of portions of their skeletons and detached bones.”</p>
                <p>Darwin, who has given a most interesting account of the habits of the guanaco in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's Voyage,</hi> says that they readily take to
                    the water, and were seen several times at Port Valdes swimming from island to
                    island.</p>
                <p>The llama is only known as a domestic animal, and is chiefly met with in the
                    southern part of Peru. Burmeister, the latest and a very competent writer on the
                    subject,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    of the wild guanaco, an opinion opposed to that of Tschudi. It generally attains
                    a larger size than the guanaco, and is usually white or spotted with brown or
                    black, and sometimes altogether black. The earliest and often quoted account of
                    this animal by Augustin de Zarate, treasurergeneral of Peru in 1544, will bear
                    repeating as an excellent summary of the general character and uses to which it
                    was put by the Peruvians at the time of the Spanish conquest. He speaks of the
                    llama as a sheep, observing, however, that it is camel-like in shape, though
                    destitute of a hump :—</p>
                <p>“In places where there is no snow, the natives want water, and to supply this
                    they fill the skins of sheep with water and make other living sheep carry them,
                    for, it must be remarked, these sheep of Pera are large enough to serve as
                    beasts of burden. They can carry about one hundred pounds or more, and the
                    Spaniards used to ride them, and they would go four or five leagues a day. When
                    they are weary they lie down upon the ground, and as there are no means of
                    making them get up, either by beating or assisting them, the load must of
                    necessity be taken off. When there is a man on one of them, if the beast is
                    tired and urged to go on, he turns his head round, and discharges his saliva,
                    which.has an unpleasant odour, into the rider’s face. These animals are of great
                    use and profit to their masters, for their wool is very good and fine,
                    particularly that of the species called pacas, which have very long fleeces; and
                    the expense of their food is trifling, as a handful of maize suffices them, and
                    they can go four or five days without water. Their flesh is as good as that of
                    the fat sheep of Castile. There are now public shambles for the sale of their
                    flesh in all parts of Pera, which was not the case when the Spaniards came
                    first; for when one Indian had killed a sheep his neighbours came and took what
                    they wanted, aud then another Indian killed a sheep in his turn.”</p>
                <p>The disagreeable habit here noticed of spitting in the face of persons whose
                    presence is obnoxious is common to all the group, as may be daily witnessed in
                    specimens in confinement in the menageries of Europe. One of the principal
                    labours to which the llamas were subjected at the time of the Spanish conquest
                    was that of bringing down ore from the mines in the mountains. Gregory de
                    Bolivar estimated that in his day as many as three hundred thousand were
                    employed in the transport of the produce of the mines of Potosi alone, but since
                    the introduction of horses, mules, and donkeys the importance of the llama as a
                    beast of burden has greatly diminished.</p>
                <p>The alpaca is believed by most naturalists to be a variety of the vicugna; others
                    have, however, identified it with the guanaco, and some consider it as a
                    distinct species. It is usually found in a domesticated or semi-domesticated
                    state, being kept in large flocks which graze on the level heights of the Andes
                    of southern Peru and northern Bolivia at an elevation of from 14,000 to 16,000
                    feet above the sea-level, throughout the year. It is not used as a beast of
                    burdeu like the llama, but is valued only for its wool, of which the Indian
                    blankets and ponchas are made. Its colour is usually dark brown or black. The
                    characteristics of its wool, and the history of its introduction into British
                    manufacturing industry, are described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
