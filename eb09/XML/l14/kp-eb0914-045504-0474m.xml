                <p><label type="entry">LEONARDO</label> (or LIONARDO) DA VINCI was born in 1452 and
                    died in 1519, having during his life excelled in almost every honourable human
                    attainment and pursuit, the commercial and political excepted. Considering the
                    range of his speculative as well as that of his practical powers, he seems
                    certainly the man whose genius has the best right to be called universal of any
                    that have ever lived. In the fine arts, he was the most accomplished painter of
                    his generation and one of the most accomplished of the world, a distinguished
                    sculptor, architect, and musician, and a luminous and pregnant critic. In
                    inventions and experimental philosophy, he was a great mechanician and engineer,
                    an anatomist, a botanist, a physiologist, an astronomer, a chemist, a geologist
                    and geographer,—an insatiable and successful explorer, in a word, along the
                    whole range of the physical and mathematical sciences when most of those
                    sciences were new. Unfortunately he paid the penalty of his universality. The
                    multifariousness and the equal balance of his faculties caused him to labour
                    promiscuously in all fields of effort. He set himself to perform tasks and to
                    solve problems too arduous and too manifold for the strength of any single life.
                    The consequence was that in art he was able to carry few undertakings to
                    completion, and in science to bring no fully matured researches to the light.
                    But the works of art which he did produce were of an excellence unapproached by
                    his contemporaries, and only rivalled by men who came a generation after him,
                    and profited by bis example; while, in science both theoretical and applied, his
                    unpublished writings and the records of his inventions prove him to have
                    anticipated at a hundred points the great masters of <pb break="no"

                    therefore, if there has always been a mysterious attraction about his name. He
                    stands out to after times in the character of a great if only half-effectual
                    magician, one pre-eminent less by performance than by power. He has been called
                    the Faust of the Italian Renaissance. The description would be just if the
                    legend of Faust had conferred upon its hero the artist’s gift of creation, as
                    well as the ingenuity of the mechanical inventor, and the philosopher’s passion
                    for truth. As it is, these three powers, the shaping or artistic, the contriving
                    or mechanical, and the reasoning or philosophical, had never even been imagined
                    as existing, still less have they ever been known actually to exist, in
                    combination, in the same measure in which they were all combined in
                    Leonardo.</p>
                <p>The man thus extraordinarily gifted was the son of a Florentine lawyer, born out
                    of wedlock by a peasant mother. The place of his birth was Vinci, a “castle” or
                    fortified village in the Florentine territory near Empoli, from which his
                    father’s family derived its name. The Christian name of his father was Piero
                    (the son of Antonio the son of Piero the son of Guido, all of whom had been men
                    of law like their descendant). Leonardo’s mother was called Caterina. Her
                    relations with Ser Piero da Vinci seem to have come to an end almost immediately
                    upon the birth of their son. She was soon afterwards married in her own rank of
                    life. Ser Piero on his part was four times married, and had by his last two
                    wives nine sons and two daughters; but the boy Leonardo had from the first been
                    acknowledged by his father, who brought him up in his own house, principally, no
                    doubt, at Florence. In that city Ser Piero followed his profession, and was
                    after a while appointed notary to the signory, or governing council of the
                    state, a post which several of his forefathers had filled before him. The son
                    born to him before marriage grew up into a youth of manifest and shining
                    promise. To signal beauty and activity of person he joined a winning charm of
                    temper and manners, a tact for all societies, and an aptitude for all
                    accomplishments. An inexhaustible energy lay beneath this amiable surface. Among
                    the multifarious pursuits to which he set his hand, the favourite were modelling
                    and drawing. His father, perceiving this, sought the advice of an acquaintance,
                    Andrea del Verrocchio, who at once recognized the boy’s vocation, and was
                    selected by Ser Piero to be his master.</p>
                <p>Verrocchio, as is well known, although not one of the great creative or inventive
                    forces in the art of this age at Florence, was a thoroughly capable and spirited
                    craftsman alike as goldsmith, sculptor, and painter, while in teaching he was
                    particularly distinguished. In his studio Leonardo worked for several years in
                    the company of Lorenzo di Credi and other less celebrated pupils. He had soon
                    learnt all that his master had to teach—more than all, if we are to believe the
                    oft-told tale of the figure, or figures, executed by the pupil in the picture of
                    Christ’s Baptism designed by the master for the monks of Vallombrosa. The work
                    in question is now in the Academy at Florence. According to Vasari the angel
                    kneeling on the left, with a drapery over its right arm, was put in by Leonardo,
                    and when Verrocchio saw it his sense of its superiority to his own work caused
                    him to forswear painting for ever after. The latter part of the story is
                    certainly false. Moreover, a closer examination seems to detect the hand of
                    Leonardo, not only in the figure of the angel, but also in that of Christ and in
                    the landscape background, which are designed with extreme refinement, and
                    painted in the new medium of oil, while the remainder of the picture has been
                    executed by Verrocchio in his accustomed vehicle of tempera. The work was
                    probably produced between 1480 and 1482, when Leonardo was from eighteen to
                    twenty years of age. By the latter date we find him enrolled in the lists of the
                    painters’ guild at Florence. Here he continued to live and work probably for
                    eight or nine years longer. Up till 1477 he is still spoken of as a pupil or
                    apprentice of Verrocchio; but in 1478 he receives an independent commission from
                    the signory, and in 1480 another from the monks of San Donato in Scopeto. He had
                    in the meanwhile been taken into special favour by Lorenzo the Magnificent. The
                    only memorials now existing of Leonardo’s industry during this, period consist
                    of a number of scattered drawings and studies, most of them physiognomical, in
                    chalk, pen, and silver point, besides two painted panels. One of these is a
                    large and richly composed picture, or rather a finished preparation in
                    monochrome for such a picture, of the Adoration of the Kings; this may have been
                    done for the monks of San Donato, and is now in the Uffizi; the other is a
                    similar preparation for a St Jerome, now in the Vatican gallery at Rome. We
                    possess, however, the record of an abundance of other work which has perished.
                    Leonardo was not one of those artists who sought in the imitation of antique
                    models the means of restoring art to its perfection. He hardly regarded the
                    antique at all, and was an exclusive student of nature. From his earliest days
                    he had flung, himself upon that study with an unprecedented passion of delight
                    and curiosity. In drawing from life he had found the way to unite precision with
                    freedom, the subtlest accuracy of definition with vital movement and flow of
                    line, as no draughtsman had been able to unite them before. He was the first
                    painter to recognize light and shade as among the most significant and
                    attractive of the world’s appearances, and as elements of the utmost importance
                    in his art, the earlier schools having with ono consent neglected the elements
                    of light and shade in favour of the elements of colour and line. But Leonardo
                    was not a student of the broad, regular, patent appearances only of the world;
                    its fugitive, fantastic, unaccustomed appearances attracted him most of all.
                    Strange shapes of hills and rocks, rare plants and animals, unusual faces and
                    figures of men, questionable smiles and expressions, whether beautiful or
                    grotesque,, far-fetched objects and curiosities, these were the things which he
                    most loved to pore upon and keep in memory. Neither did he stop at mere
                    appearances of any kind, but, having stamped the image of things upon his brain,
                    went on indefatigably to probe their hidden laws and causes. The laws of light
                    and shade, the laws of “perspective,” including optics and the physiology of the
                    eye, the laws of human and animal anatomy and muscular movement, and of the
                    growth and structure of plants, all these and much more furnished food almost
                    from the beginning to his insatiable spirit of inquiry. The evidence of his
                    preferences and preoccupations is contained in the list of the lost works which
                    he produced during this period. One of these was a painting of Adam and Eve in
                    opaque water-colours; and in this, besides the beauty of the figures, the
                    infinite truth and elaboration of the foliage and animals in the background are
                    celebrated in terms which bring to mind the treatment of the subject by Albert
                    Dürer, in his famous engraving done thirty years later. Again, a peasant of
                    Vinci having in his simplicity asked Ser Piero to get a picture painted for him
                    on a wooden shield, the father is said to have laughingly handed on the
                    commission to his son, who thereupon shut himself up with all the noxious
                    insects and grotesque reptiles he could find, observed and drew and dissected
                    them assiduously, and produced at last a picture of a dragon compounded of their
                    various shapes and aspects, which was so fierce and so life-like as to terrify
                    all who saw it. With equal research and no less effect he painted on another
                    occasion the head of a snaky-haired<pb break="no"

                    the original of Leonardo, but is in all likelihood merely the production of some
                    later artist to whom the descriptions of his work have given the cue. In like
                    manner, the Madonna in the Borghese gallery at Rome, in which occurs the motive
                    of a bottle beaded with drops of dew, though it may well be the same painting
                    which Vasari admired in the possession of Clement VIΓ., is unquestionably the
                    work, not of Leonardo, to whom Vasari ascribes it, but of his fellow-pupil
                    Lorenzo di Credi. Altogether spurious, it may here be said, is the small Madonna
                    which is made to pass for an early work of Leonardo in the gallery at
                    Dresden.</p></note> Lastly, Leonardo is related to have modelled in clay and
                    cast in plaster, about this time, several heads of smiling women and children.
                    In addition to these labours and researches, he was full of new ideas concerning
                    both the laws and the applications of mechanical forces. His architectural and
                    engineering projects were of a daring which amazed even the fellow-citizens of
                    Alberti and Brunelleschi. History presents few figures more attractive to the
                    mind’s eye than that of Leonardo during this period of his all-capable and
                    dazzling youth. There was nothing about him, as there was afterwards about
                    Michelangelo, dark-tempered, secret, or morose; he was open and genial with all
                    men. From time to time, indeed, he might shut himself up for a season in
                    complete intellectual absorption, as when he toiled among his bats and wasps and
                    lizards, forgetful of rest and food, and insensible to the noisomeness of their
                    corruption; but anon we have to picture him as coming out and gathering about
                    him a tatterdemalion company, and jesting with them until they were in fits of
                    laughter, for the sake of observing their burlesque physiognomies <hi
                    rend="italic">; or</hi> anon as standing radiant in his rose-coloured cloak and
                    his rich gold hair among the throng of young and old on the piazza, and holding
                    them spell-bound while he expatiated on his plan for lifting the venerable
                    baptistery of St John, the <hi rend="italic">bel</hi><hi rend="italic">San
                    Giovanni</hi> of Dante, up bodily from its foundations, and planting it anew on
                    a stately basement of marble. Unluckily it is to the written biographies and to
                    imagination that we have to trust exclusively for our picture. No portrait of
                    Leonardo as he appeared during this period of his life has come down to us.</p>
                <p>The interval between 1480 and 1487 is one during which the movements of our
                    master are obscure, and can only be told conjecturally. Up to the former date we
                    know with certainty that he was working at Florence, under the patronage of
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici. By the latter date he had definitively passed into the
                    service of Duke Ludovico Sforza, called il Moro, at Milan. The main determining
                    cause of his removal would seem to have been his selection by Ludovico for the
                    task of erecting a great memorial statue in bronze to the honour of his
                    victorious father, the condottiere Francesco Sforza. The project of such a
                    monument had been already entertained by the last duke, Ludovico’s elder
                    brother. After Ludovico had possessed himself of the regency in 1480, he appears
                    to have revived the scheme, and to have invited various artists to compete for
                    its execution. One who complied with the invitation was the Florentine Antonio
                    del Pollaiuolo, by whom a sketch for the monument is still preserved at Munich.
                    It would seem as if the competition had been won by Leonardo, but a considerable
                    time had been allowed to elapse before the work was actually put in hand. The
                    question then arises, Was it during this period of postponement that Leonardo
                    went on his mysterious travels to the East! The earlier biographers know nothing
                    of these travels; recent investigation of Leonardo’s MSS. has brought them to
                    light. It has been not inaptly conjectured that the speculations of
                    transcendental Platonism, which absorbed at this time the thoughts and the
                    conversation of the Medic≡an circle, were uncongenial to the essentially
                    experimental cast of Leonardo’s mind, and that he was not sorry to escape from
                    the atmosphere of Florence. At any rate his devouring curiosity would have made
                    welcome the opportunity of enlarging his knowledge of men and countries by
                    Eastern travel, even at the cost, which to one of his freethinking habits would
                    not have been great, of a temporary compliance with Islamite observances.
                    Certain it is that he took service as engineer with the sultan of “Babylon,”
                    which in the geographical nomenclature of those days meant Cairo, and in the
                    course of his mission visited Egypt, Cyprus, Constantinople, the coasts of Asia
                    Minor, especially the Cilician region about Mount Taurus, and Armenia. This
                    biographical discovery adds to the career of Leonardo a characteristic touch of
                    adventurous and far-sought experience. Perhaps it was his acquaintance with the
                    Levant which made him adopt the Oriental mode of writing from right to left, a
                    habit which some of his biographers have put down to his love of mystification,
                    and others explain more simply by the fact (to which his friend Luca Pacioli
                    bears explicit testimony) that he was left-handed. The probable date of
                    Leonardo’s Eastern travels falls between 1480 and 1483-84. By the last-named
                    year, if not sooner, he was certainly back in Florence, whence lie wrote to
                    Ludovico il Moro at Milan a letter making him the formal offer of his services.
                    The draught of this letter is still extant. It does not altogether tally with
                    the statements of the earliest biographers, that Leonardo was recommended by
                    Lorenzo de Medici to the duke regent particularly for his accomplishments in
                    music. Vasari indeed says expressly that Leonardo was the bearer to Ludovico of
                    a lyre of his invention, ingeniously fashioned of silver in the form of a
                    horse’s head. In the autograph draft of the letter, to which we have referred,
                    Leonardo rests his own title to patronage chiefly on his capabilities in
                    military engineering. After explaining these under nine different heads, he
                    speaks under a tenth of his proficiency as a civil engineer and architect, and
                    adds a brief paragraph with reference to what he can do in painting and
                    sculpture, undertaking in particular to carry out in a fitting manner the
                    monument to Francesco Sforza. We shall probably be safe in fixing between the
                    years 1484 and 1485 as the date of his definitive removal to Milan.</p>
                <p>From this time for the next fourteen or fifteen years (until the summer of 1499)
                    Leonardo continued, with very brief intervals of absence, to reside in high
                    favour and continual employment at the court of Ludovico il Moro. His
                    occupations were as manifold as his capacities. He superintended the
                    construction of military engines, and seems to have been occasionally present at
                    sieges and on campaigns. He devised and carried out works of irrigation and
                    other engineering schemes in the territory of the duchy. He designed a cupola
                    for the cathedral of Milan, and was consulted on the works of Certosa of Pavia.
                    He managed with ingenuity and splendour the masques, pageants, and ceremonial
                    shows and festivals of the court. Withal he continued incessantly to accumulate
                    observations and speculations in natural philosophy, working especially at
                    anatomy with Marcantonio della Torre, and at geometry and optics with Fra Luca
                    Pacioli, for whose book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Divina
                    Proportione</hi> he designed the figures. He made excursions into the Alps, and
                    studied and drew with minute fidelity the distribution and formation of the
                    mountain masses. He was placed at the head of a school or “Academy” of arts and
                    sciences, where he gathered about him a number of distinguished colleagues and
                    eager disciples. His pupils in painting included the sons of several noble
                    families of the city and territory.</p>
                <p>Among the more immediate scholars of Leonardo may he mentioned Antonio
                    Boltraffio, Marco d’Oggionno, Gian Petrino, and <pb break="no"

                    or Salaino. But by far the most important painter formed under Leonardo’s
                    influence at Milan was the admirable Bernardino Luini. Other disciples or
                    adherents of his school were Bazzi of Siena, called II Sodoma, Gaudenzio
                    Ferrari, Andrea Solario, Bernardino dei Conti, and Ambrogio Breda or de Bredis.
                    Several of the pupils or adherents here mentioned belong, however, to a later
                    period of the master’s life than that with which we are now concerned.</p>
                <p>Leonardo’s own chief undertakings in art during his residence at the court of
                    Ludovico il Moro were two in number, namely, the equestrian monument of
                    Francesco Sforza and the mural painting of the Last Supper. For the former he
                    had probably made some preparatory sketches and models before he left Florence.
                    After his arrival at Milan the work seems to have proceeded with many
                    interruptions, and according to a MS. note of his own to have been finally and
                    actively resumed in 1490. In the Royal Library at Windsor are preserved a whole
                    series of small experimental studies for the monument. Leonardo was a great
                    lover and student of horses, and would never be without some of the noble race
                    in his stable. It is difficult to retrace the stages of development marked by
                    the several sketches in question, or their relations to the final design. But it
                    seems as if Leonardo had first proposed to represent his hero as mounted on a
                    charger violently prancing or rearing above a fallen enemy, and had in the end
                    decided to adopt a quieter action, more nearly resembling that of the work upon
                    which Verrocchio was simultaneously engaged at Venice. Some difficulties must
                    have been encountered in the casting, or there would have been no meaning in the
                    words of Michelangelo when twelve years afterwards he is said to have taunted
                    Leonardo with incapacity on that account. But contemporary writings are explicit
                    to the effect that the group of horse and rider, 26 feet in height, was actually
                    cast in bronze, and set up to the admiration and delight of the people, under a
                    triumphal arch constructed for the purpose, during the festivities held at Milan
                    in 1493 on the occasion of the marriage of the emperor Maximilian to a bride of
                    the house of Sforza. Within ten years the glory of that house had departed.
                    Ludovico, twice overthrown by the invaders whom he had himself called into
                    Italy, lay languishing in a French prison, and his father’s statue had served as
                    a butt to the Gascon archers of the army of Louis XII. In 1501 the duke Ercole
                    d’Este sought leave from the French governor of Milan to have the statue removed
                    to his own city; but nothing seems to have come of the project; and within a few
                    years Leonardo’s master-work in sculpture had between mischief and neglect been
                    irretrievably destroyed.</p>
                <p>Only a little less disastrous is the fate which has overtaken the second great
                    enterprise of Leonardo’s life at Milan, his painting of the Last Supper. This,
                    with the Madonna di San Sisto and Michelangelo’s Last Judgment, is the third
                    most celebrated picture of the world. It was painted, twenty years the earliest
                    of the three, on the refectory wall of the convent of Santa Maria delle Grazie
                    at Milan, where its defaced remains are still an object of pilgrimage and
                    wonder. The commission for the work came partly from the duke and partly from
                    the monks of the convent. Leonardo is said to have consumed upwards of ten years
                    upon his task, a circumstance which is not surprising when we consider his
                    fastidious spirit and the multiplicity of other calls upon his time. But the
                    monks were impatient, and could not make allowance for the intervals of apparent
                    idleness, intervals really of brooding and searching and meditation, which were
                    incidental to Leonardo’s way of work. On one occasion it became necessary for
                    the duke himself, whose dealings with his gifted servant seem to have been
                    consistently intelligent and kind, to take the painter’s part against the prior
                    of the convent. But in working out his conception of the scene, and in devising
                    the pictorial means for its presentment, Leonardo allowed his craving for
                    quintessential excellence to overmaster him. He could not rest satisfied without
                    those richnesses and refinements of effect which are unattainable in the
                    ordinary method of mural painting, that is, in fresco, but must needs contrive
                    by his chemistry a method for painting on the wall in oil. Neither could any of
                    the traditional ideals of art content him in the representation of the scene. He
                    must toil and ponder until he had realized a more absolute set of types, and
                    grouped them in more masterly and speaking actions, than had ever been attempted
                    before. The master type of all, that of Christ, it is said that he could never
                    even realize to the height of his conception at all, but left it to the last
                    uncompleted. Unhappily Leonardo’s chemistry was unequal to his purpose, and his
                    work had begun to peel and stain within a few years of its execution. The
                    operation of time and damp has since been accelerated at intervals by the
                    vandalism of men. After almost disappearing, the picture has been revived once
                    and again, latterly either from copies or from engravings taken during the
                    earlier periods of its deterioration, until now there is probably not a vestige
                    of the original workmanship remaining. Nevertheless, through all these veils of
                    injury and disguise, it is still possible in some measure to appreciate the
                    power of that creation which became from the first, and has ever since remained,
                    the typical representation for all Christendom of the sacrament of Christ’s
                    Supper.</p>
                <p>Goethe in his famous criticism has said all that needs to be said of the
                    essential character of the work. The painter has departed from precedent in
                    grouping the company of disciples, with their Master in the midst, along the far
                    side and the two ends of a long, narrow table, and in leaving the near or
                    service side of the table towards the spectator free. The chamber is seen in a
                    perfectly symmetrical perspective, its rear wall pierced by three plain openings
                    which admit the sense of quiet distance and mystery from the open landscape
                    beyond; by the central of these openings, which is the widest of the three, the
                    head and shoulders of the Saviour are framed in. On his right and left are
                    ranged the disciples in equal numbers. The serenity of the holy company has
                    within a moment been broken by the words of their Master, “One of you shall
                    betray Me.” In the agitation of their consciences and affections, the disciples
                    have started into groups or clusters along the table, some standing, some still
                    remaining seated. There are four of these gr oups, of three disciples each, and
                    each group is harmoniously interlinked by some natural connecting action with
                    the next. Leonardo, though no student of the Greeks, has perfectly carried out
                    the Greek principle of expressive variety in particulars subordinated to general
                    symmetry. The relations of his groups to one another, and of each figure within
                    the several groups to its neighbour and to the central figure of Christ, are not
                    only triumphs of technical design, they are evidences of a complete science of
                    human character, emotion, and physiognomy held at the service of a nobly
                    inspired and nobly directed art. The furniture and accessories of the chamber,
                    very simply conceived, have been rendered with scrupulous exactness and
                    distinctness; yet they leave to the human and dramatic elements the absolute
                    mastery of the scene. Neither do the academical draperies of the personages
                    impair· the sense of imaginative truth with which the representation impresses
                    us. Our first glance at the ruins of this famous picture makes us feel, and
                    study does but strengthen the conviction, that the painter rose to the height of
                    his argument, and realized worthily and for good this momentous scene in the
                    spiritual history of mankind.</p>
                <p>Of authentic preparatory studies for this work there remain but few. There is a
                    sheet at the Louvre containing some nude sketches for the arrangement of the
                    disciples about the table, and another of great interest at South Kensington, on
                    which the painter has noted in writing the several dramatic motives which he
                    proposes to embody in the disciples. At Windsor and Milan are a few finished
                    studies in red chalk for the heads. A highly-reputed series of black crayon
                    drawings of the same heads, of which the greater portion is at Weimar, has no
                    just claim to originality. Of the other pictures and sculptures which Leonardo
                    is known to have produced while in the service of the duke, such as the painting
                    of the Nativity, sent as a present to the emperor Maximilian, and the portraits
                    of Lucrezia Crivelli and Cecilia Gallerani, one of the duke’s mistresses, no
                    trace remains, nor is there sufficient reason for accepting the recently
                    suggested attribution to Leonardo of an <pb break="no"

                    Louvre, of which the features are those of Ludovico’s wife, the duchess
                    Beatrice.</p>
                <p>These services, especially the maintenance of his celebrated Academy, required on
                    the part of Leonardo no inconsiderable outlay. On the other hand, the payments
                    received by him seem to have been neither adequate nor regular, at all events
                    during the latter part of his residence at the ducal court, when the exigencies
                    of war and policy were already pressing hard upon Ludovico. Leonardo had
                    finished his Last Supper between 1497 and 1499. In the spring of the latter year
                    we find that he received, in consideration of payments due, the gift of a
                    vineyard outside the city. Within a month or two his patron had fallen. Milan
                    was taken and held in hostile occupation by the French. A contemporary historian
                    has related with what admiration the invading monarch, Louis XII., when he
                    entered the refectory of Sta Maria delle Grazie, fixed his gaze on the work of
                    Leonardo, and how he desired, were it possible, that it should be transported
                    across the Alps to France. But by this time or soon afterwards the painter
                    himself had left Milan. In the spring of 1500 we hear of him working at Venice,
                    where, among other things, he painted (not, it appears, from life) a portrait of
                    Isabella Gonzaga, marchioness of Mantua. The well-known head in the manner of
                    Leonardo at the Louvre, commonly known as the <hi rend="italic">Belle</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Ferronnière,</hi> has sometimes been identified as the portrait in
                    question; but not on sufficient grounds. Early in the next year, 1501, Leonardo
                    was once more in Florence; and thither the same marchioness, Isabella Gonzaga,
                    sent an envoy to endeavour to attach him to her service. His answer was not
                    unfavourable, but the envoy reported that, though recently engaged upon one or
                    two small pictures, he was for the moment indifferent to the brush, and wholly
                    absorbed in mathematics. In the end he attached himself, not to the court of
                    Mantua, but to the service of Caesar Borgia, then in the plenitude of his
                    criminal power, and almost within reach of the realization of his huge
                    ambitions. Leonardo’s new patron had been one of the worst enemies of the fallen
                    Ludovico, and had entered Milan as a conqueror in the suite of the French king.
                    But artists and men of letters formed, in those days, a caste apart, and changed
                    service not less readily than did the <hi rend="italic">condottieri</hi> or
                    hired military commanders. Between the beginning of 1502 and the catastrophe
                    which overtook the house of Borgia in the summer of 1503, Leonardo travelled as
                    engineer in the employ of Duke Caesar over a great part of Central Italy. In
                    Umbria and the Marches, he visited Urbino, Pesaro, Rimini, Cesena, Cesenatico,
                    Buonconvento, Perugia, and Foligno; in Tuscany, he was at Chiusi, at Siena, at
                    Piombino on the coast over against Elba, and southward at least as far as
                    Orvieto and Lake Bolsena, or even, it would appear, as far as Rome. He has left
                    notes and drawings taken at each of the stations we have named, besides a set of
                    six large-scale maps drawn minutely with his own hand, and including nearly the
                    whole territory of Tuscany and the Maremma between the Apennines and the
                    Tyrrhene Sea. His excursions seem to have come to an end early in 1503, as by
                    March of that year we find him once more in Florence.</p>
                <p>To the period of three years’ wandering which followed Leonardo’s departure from
                    Milan there ensued another period of three years, during which he lived a
                    settled life at Florence. He was now fifty-one years of age, and the most famous
                    artist of Italy, though within a year or two the young Michelangelo was destined
                    to challenge his supremacy, and the still younger Raphael to apprehend and
                    assimilate the secrets of his skill, as he did those of the skill of every great
                    predecessor and every distinguished rival in succession. The first important
                    commission put into Leonardo’s hands at Florence was that for an altarpiece for
                    the church of the Servite monks (Santa Maria delΓ Annunziata). The work had been
                    already entrusted to Filippino Lippi, who had even made some beginning with it,
                    but willingly gave up his claim in favour of his illustrious fellow-citizen. The
                    monks undertook to lodge and nourish Leonardo in their convent while he carried
                    on the work. After long premeditation he began, and prepared that admirable
                    cartoon in black chalk which is now the treasured possession of the Royal
                    Academy in London. The Virgin, partly seated on the left knee of St Anne, holds
                    by the body the infant Christ, who leans across the figure of the elder woman,
                    and lifts his hand in benediction of the little St John leaning against her
                    knee. In the lines and management of the composition there is not less charm
                    than there is research. The elder mother smiles upon her daughter, and the
                    daughter smiles upon her child, each with a look of loving prescience and rapt
                    self-congratulation which is the sweetest of all those mysterious expressions
                    that Leonardo loved to seize and to perpetuate. When the cartoon was finished
                    and exhibited, all Florence came flocking in delight to see and praise it.
                    Between fastidiousness and preoccupation Leonardo, however, carried the
                    undertaking no farther, and the work was put once more into the hands of
                    Filippino Lippi, and on his death into those of Perugino. Leonardo’s next great
                    enterprise at Florence was a historical painting for the Palace of the Signory.
                    He had been on the commission of artists appointed to determine where
                    Michelangelo’s statue of David should be placed, and now he was chosen, along
                    with his young rival∣ to finish a mural picture for the new Hall of Council.
                    Each painter chose a battle subject: Michelangelo, as is well known, the
                    surprise of the Florentine forces in the act of bathing near Pisa; Leonardo, an
                    episode in the victory of the generals of the republic over Niccolo Picciuino at
                    Anghiari, in the upper valley of the Tiber. In one of the sections of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Treatise on Painting,</hi> Leonardo has detailed at length, and
                    obviously from his own observation, the pictorial aspects of a battle. His
                    choice of such a subject was certainly not made from any love of warfare or
                    indifference to its horrors. In the writings of Leonardo there occur almost as
                    many trenchant sayings on life and human affairs as on art and natural law; and
                    of war he has disposed in two words as a “bestial frenzy” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pazziα bestialissima).</hi> In his design for the Hall of Council, Leonardo
                    set himself to depict this frenzy at its fiercest. He chose the moment of a
                    terrific struggle for the colours between the opposing sides; hence the work
                    became known in the history of art as the Battle of the Standard. Judging by the
                    accounts of those who saw it, the tumultuous entanglement of men and horses, and
                    the expressions of martial fury and despair, must in this case have been
                    combined and rendered with a mastery not less commanding than had been the looks
                    and gestures of soul’s perplexity and dismay among the peaceful company on the
                    convent wall at Milan. Leonardo had finished his cartoon in less than two years
                    (1504-1505), and when it was exhibited along with that of Michelangelo, the two
                    rival works seemed to all men a new revelation of the powers of art, and served
                    as a model and example to the students of that generation, as the frescos of
                    Masaccio in the Carmine had served to those of two generations earlier. The
                    young Raphael is well known to have been one of those who profited by what they
                    saw. Other Florentine artists who were especially influenced at this time by
                    Leonardo were Fra Bartolommeo, Jacopo da Pontormo, Ridolfo del Ghirlandajo; and
                    in sculpture Baccio Bandinelli and Rustici. He also speaks of having among his
                    pupils G. F. Penni called “Il Fattore,” a certain Lorenzo, and a German Jacopo,
                    who cannot be further identified.</p>

                <p>His favourite assistant Salai had, we know, accompanied him from Milan, and
                    remained with him.</p>
                <p>Leonardo lost no time in proceeding to the execution of his design upon the mural
                    surface; this time he had devised a technical method of which he regarded the
                    success as certain; the colours were tobe laid on a specially prepared ground,
                    and then fixed by heat, in some way analogous to the processes of encaustic or
                    enamel. When portions of the work were done the heat was applied, by means of
                    fires lighted on platforms, but it was found to take effect unequally, and the
                    result was a failure more or less complete. Leonardo abandoned the work in
                    chagrin, and presently betook himself to Milan. Payments for his great
                    battle-picture had been made to him in advance, and the gonfaliere Piero
                    Soderini complained on behalf of the signory that Leonardo had treated them ill.
                    When, however, he soon afterwards honourably offered to refund the amount, the
                    offer was not less honourably declined. The unfinished painting before long
                    disappeared from the wall. The cartoon also, no less than the competing cartoon
                    of Michelangelo, has perished. Our only memorials of the work are a few
                    preliminary sketches, an engraving executed by Lucensi in 1558, not from the
                    original but from a copy, and the far more celebrated engraving of Edelinck
                    after a study made by Rubens, in his own essentially personal, obstreperous,
                    un-Italian manner, of a portion only of the composition. During the years
                    between 1500 and 1505 Leonardo was also engaged at intervals upon the portraits
                    of two ladies of the city—Ginevra Benci, and Lisa di Antonio Maria di Noldo
                    Gherardina, the wife of Zanobi del Giocondo, commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hona {i.e.,</hi> Madonna) <hi rend="italic">Lisa or la Gioconda.</hi> The first
                    of these portraits is lost; the second was bought by Francis I. for four
                    thousand gold florins, and is now one of the glories of the Louvre. In Madonna
                    Lisa Leonardo seems to have found a sitter whose features possessed in a
                    singular degree the intellectual charm in which he delighted, and in whose smile
                    was realized that inward, haunting, mysterious expression which had always been
                    his ideal. He worked, it is said, at her portrait during some portion of four
                    successive years, causing music to be played during the sittings that the rapt
                    expression might not fade from off her countenance, and labouring by all the
                    means of which he was master to bring his work to perfection. It remains perhaps
                    the most striking example of his powers. The richness of colouring on which λ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> asari expatiates has indeed flown, partly from
                    injury, partly because in his preference for effects of light and shade the
                    painter was accustomed to model his figures on a dark ground, and that in this
                    picture the ground has to a large extent come through. Nevertheless, in its
                    brown and faded state, the portrait is pre-eminent alike for fascination of
                    expression, for refinement and precision of drawing, and for the romantic
                    invention of its background, wherein a far-seen champaign with bridged rivers
                    and winding roads is bounded by a fantastic coast of islands and rock-bound
                    estuaries.</p>
                <p>Daring these years of work at Florence, Leonardo’s father died at a good old age
                    in that city. Some stray notes, in which the painter mentions a visit to
                    “Caterina” in the hospital, and inscribes the amount of expenses paid “for the
                    funeral of Caterina,” though they are of uncertain date, prove too that when
                    Leonardo’s peasant mother drew near her end her illustrious son was there to
                    tend her. From his half brothers, the legitimate children of Ser Piero, Leonardo
                    after their father’s death experienced unkindness. They were all much younger
                    than himself. One of them, who followed his father’s profession, made himself
                    the champion of the others in disputing Leonardo’s claim to his share, first in
                    the paternal inheritance, and then in that which had been left to be divided
                    between the brothers and sisters by an uncle. The litigation thus set on foot
                    lasted for several years, and the annoyances attending it, with his
                    disappointment at the failure of his great wall-painting, may have been among
                    the causes which determined Leonardo to go back to Milan. Return thither he at
                    all events did, with leave obtained from the signory, and attended by his
                    faithful Salai, in the summer of 1500. For nearly nine years after that he seems
                    to have made the Lombard city his principal home, residing sometimes on his own
                    vineyard and sometimes in the villa of a wealthy young friend and disciple,
                    Francesco Melzi. The French remained in occupation at Milan until 1513, and
                    Leonardo held the title of court painter and engineer to the French king, Louis
                    XΠ., the transfer of his services having been formally requested by that monarch
                    from the Florentine signory. The record of his occupations and performances
                    during this period is meagre. He was several times, and for considerable periods
                    at a time, in Florence, on business connected with the litigation above
                    mentioned. From thence he writes at the beginning of 1511 to the French governor
                    of Milan, asking about the payment of his salary, and saying that he means to
                    bring with him on his return two pictures of the Madonna, of different sizes.
                    But there can be no doubt that his thoughts became with his advancing years ever
                    more and more engrossed in the problems of natural science. To this time belong
                    a large proportion of the vast collections in which are accumulated the results
                    of his observation and research.</p>
                <p>There are only three extant pictures which we can with probability assign to
                    this, the second Milanese period of Leonardo’s career, and to what points within
                    the period it is hard to say. Two of these are replicas or rather variations of
                    the same theme, the Virgin and Child with St John the Baptist ami an angel, in a
                    landscape of fantastic rocks and flowery grottoes by the sea-shore. The
                    composition is known as the <hi rend="italic">Vierge</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mix</hi><hi rend="italic">Rochers.</hi> The most celebrated version of it is
                    that formerly in the collection of Francis I., and now in the Louvre. The other
                    version was painted, according to Lomazzo, for the Cappella della Concezione at
                    Milan, where it was purchased in 1796 by Gavin Hamilton, and by him sold to the
                    earl of Suffolk, from the hands of whose descendant it has lately passed into
                    the National Gallery. Both of these paintings seem to betray signs of the
                    handiwork of the master himself, assisted probably in each case by pupils. Both
                    have suffered, the French example most from repainting, the English most from
                    blackening. On the whole, of these two admirable and fascinating pictures, the
                    English example may be pronounced to be both of the higher authenticity and the
                    greater beauty, having the advantage of the French especially in the difference
                    of position in the right hand of the kneeling angel. The third picture
                    conjecturally referred to about this date is also at the Louvre, and again
                    represents a holy family. Leonardo has recurred to the motive on which he had
                    founded his design for the Church of the Servîtes at Florence, in so far as he
                    has seated the Virgin in the lap of St Anne, whom he depicts smiling at the
                    happy intercourse of her mystic grandchild and his mother. But this time the
                    Virgin stoops across as she sits, to lift the child from the ground on which he
                    stands fondling a lamb. John the Baptist is absent, and the background is a
                    pastoral landscape bounded towards the horizon by lagoons and mountains. The
                    picture is unequally finished—minutely in some parts, and in others carelessly
                    enough.</p>
                <p>A great change took place in the affairs of Milan at the close of the year 1512.
                    The French supremacy came to an end, and Maximilian Sforza, the son of Ludovico,
                    returned for a few years to rule over the reduced dominions of his father. All
                    affairs were thrown into confusion, and Milan ceased tobe a desirable place of
                    abode for Leonardo and his scholars. In the meantime Giovanni de’ Medici, the
                    son of the painter’s ancient patron Lorenzo, was elected pope under the title of
                    Leo X., and continued with still greater magnificence the encouragement of art
                    and artists of which his warlike predecessor Julius had set the example. On the
                    24th September 1514 Leonardo too set out for Rome from Milan with a company of
                    his pupils. The youngest brother of the pope, Giuliano de’ Medici, was his
                    friend, but it is not true that Leonardo, as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n480/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0480-0461"/> Vasari says, had accompanied Giuliano to Rome on
                    the occasion of his brother’s elevation to the papal chair. Hl success attended
                    the now ageing master during his stay in the shadow of St Peter’s. He is said,
                    indeed, to have delighted the pope, who was himself something of an alchemist,
                    by his experiments and ingenuities in science, and especially by a kind of
                    zoological toys, which he had invented by way of pastime, as well as mechanical
                    tricks played upon living animals. But when, having received a commission for a
                    picture, he was found distilling for himself a new medium of oils and herbs
                    before he had begun the design, the pope was convinced, not quite unreasonably,
                    that nothing serious would come of it. The hostility of Michelangelo, with whom
                    Leonardo was in competition for the façade of San Lorenzo at Florence, may also
                    have done something towards hindering the employment of the elder master on any
                    important works. At all events no such employment came to hijn, and he seems,
                    while he was at Rome, to have painted nothing but two small panels, one of a
                    child, the other of a Madonna, for an official of the papal court.</p>
                <p>By the end of the year 1515 Leonardo had left Rome and returned once more to
                    Milan. In the meantime the brief rule of Maximilian Sforza had been terminated
                    by the victory at Marignano of Francis I., who prevailed on Leonardo, by this
                    time in his sixty-fourth year, to enter his service and return with him to
                    France. It was in the beginning of 1516 that the painter crossed the Alps,
                    taking with him his friend, the youthful Francesco Melzi. The Chateau Cloux in
                    Touraine, near Amboise, was appointed for his place of residence. But his race
                    was nearly run. In France he projected some canal works, and painted two
                    pictures of classical mythology, which have been lost, a Leda and a Pomona; and
                    that was all. He desired to put in order some of his vast accumulations of MS.
                    notes and researches, but soon discovered that he who had been endeavouring so
                    insatiably for all these years, in his own words, to learn to live had only been
                    learning to die. That form of strength and beauty, and that exquisitely shaping
                    and all-searching mind, were dissolved before decay or infirmity impaired them.
                    Leonardo died at Cloux, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, on the 2d of May
                    1519. King Francis, then at his court of St Germain en Laye, is said to have
                    wept for the loss of such a servant; that he was present beside the death-bed
                    and held the dying painter in his arms is a familiar but an untrue tale.</p>
                <p>The contents of our narrative will have justified the definition of Leonardo with
                    which we set out, as a genius all but universal and a man pre-eminently great,
                    yet great rather by power than by performance. Thus, in painting, there have
                    come down to us no more than ten undisputed works from his hand; and among those
                    ten are included the picture by his master Verrocchio in which Leonardo had only
                    a share, as well as the cartoon at the Royal Academy, and the unfinished panels
                    at the Uffizi and the Borghese gallery. Of the remaining well certified works of
                    Leonardo, one is at the National Gallery (the Suffolk <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vierge</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Pochers),</hi> the others are the second <hi
                    rend="italic">Vierge</hi><hi rend="italic">aux Pochers,</hi> the Virgin and
                    Child with St Anne, the portrait of Mona Lisa, and the young John the Baptist,
                    all at the Louvre. The remains of the fresco said to have been painted by
                    Leonardo and Melzi together, in the villa which belonged to the latter at Vaprio
                    near Milan, are too fragmentary and disputable to be counted. Of works, in
                    addition to these, ordinarily claimed for Leonardo’s hand, the best and nearest
                    to his manner, if not actually his, is the portrait commonly known as <hi
                    rend="italic">La Belle Ferronniere,</hi> also at the Louvre, which students
                    conjecture to be in reality that of the marchioness of Mantua, others that of
                    Lucrezia Crivelli. Another highly reputed picture in the manner of Leonardo is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vierge au</hi><hi rend="italic">Bas-relief</hi> at Gatton
                    Park; another version, however, of the same theme, said to be in no way inferior
                    to that at Gatton, exists at Milan, and is there rightly attributed to Cesare da
                    Sesto. The multitude of smiling daughters of Herodias, allegorical Floras, and
                    the like, Ιbesides some admirable religious pictures (including the Christ
                    Preaching to the Doctors, at the National Gallery), which are currently
                    attributed in public and private galleries to Leonardo, belong really to the
                    various pupils or imitators of his school—the greatest number to Bernardino
                    Luini, who added to a peculiar grace and suavity of his own much of the great
                    master’s intellectual power and exquisiteness of choice and finish. Such as they
                    are, the meagre original remains of Leonardo’s craft in painting are enough to
                    establish his place in history as the earliest complete painter of the
                    Renaissance. In his work there are no longer to be perceived, as there are in
                    that of all his contemporaries, any of the engaging imperfections of childhood;
                    there is no longer any disproportion between the conception and its embodiment.
                    He had wrestled with nature from the cradle, and for the purposes of pictorial
                    representation had mastered her. He could draw with that ineffable left hand of
                    his (the words are those of his friend Luca Pacioli) a line firmer, finer, and
                    truer than has been drawn by the hand of any other man, excepting perhaps Albert
                    Durer. Further, Leonardo carried the refinement of solid modelling in light and
                    shade to the same high point to which he carried the refinements of linear
                    definition. Colour he left where he found it, or rather perhaps, by his
                    predilection for effects of light and shade, did something towards bringing
                    about the degradation of colour. Of character and action he was an unrivalled
                    master—preferring for his own pleasure the more far-fetched and enigmatical,
                    sometimes even the grotesque among human types and expressions, but capable on
                    occasion, as in his masterwork of the Last Supper, of laying aside curiosity and
                    strangeness, and treating a great theme in a great and classical spirit. If
                    these qualities can be sufficiently discerned in the few extant paintings of
                    this master, it is only by the study of his drawings and sketches that his
                    industry and fertility in the graphic art can be appreciated. These are very
                    numerous as well as very various in kind, and are widely scattered among
                    different possessors, occurring sometimes apart from and sometimes in connexion
                    with the sheets of his MS. notes and writings (see note below).</p>
                <p>Passing from Leonardo’s achievements in art to his attainments and inventions in
                    science, a subject on which the present writer has no authority for speaking at
                    first hand, it appears that, in this sphere also, the spirit of fanciful
                    curiosity and ingenuity coexisted in Leonardo with an incomparably just and
                    powerful grasp of natural fact and natural law. Gossiping biographers like best
                    to speak of his mechanical birds, of his mechanical walking lion stuffed with
                    lilies, of the lizard which he fitted with horns and artificial eyes and
                    oscillating wings filled with quicksilver, and the like; but serious students
                    assure us that he was one of the very greatest and most clear-sighted as well as
                    one of the earliest of natural philosophers. They declare him to have been the
                    founder of the study of the anatomy and structural classification of plants; the
                    founder, or at least the chief reviver, of the science of hydraulics; to have
                    anticipated many of the geometrical discoveries of Commandin, Autolycus, and
                    Tartaglia; to have divined or gone far towards divining the laws of gravitation,
                    the earth’s rotation, and the molecular composition of water, the motion of
                    waves, and even the undulatory theory of light and heat. He discovered the
                    construction of the eye and the optical laws of vision, and invented the camera
                    obscura. Among useful appliances he invented the saw which is still in use in
                    the marble quarries of Carrara, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n481/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0481-0462"/> and a rope-making machine said to be better than
                    any even yet in use. He investigated the composition of explosives and the
                    application of steam power; he perceived that boats could be made to go by
                    steam, and designed both steam-cannon and cannon to be loaded at the breech.
                    He,made innumerable designs for engines of war, and plans of tunnels and canals
                    for traffic. A few of his practical inventions were carried out in his time, but
                    both of these and of his speculative researches the vast majority, lying buried
                    in unpublished MSS., remained after his death unknown or forgotten. The
                    discoveries which he had made wholesale were left to be rediscovered piecemeal
                    by the men of narrower genius who came after him.</p>
                <p>»So much for the intellectual side of Leonardo’s character and career. As a moral
                    being we are less able to discern what he was like. The man who carried in his
                    brain so many images of subtle beauty, as well as half the hidden science of the
                    future, must have lived spiritually, in the main, alone. Of things communicable
                    he was at the same time, as we have said, communicative—a genial companion, a
                    generous and loyal friend, ready and eloquent of discourse, and impressing all
                    with whom he was brought in contact by the power and the charm of genius. We see
                    him living on terms of constant affection with his father, tending the last
                    hours of his mother, and in disputes with his brothers not the aggressor but the
                    sufferer from aggression. We see him open-handed in giving, not grasping in
                    getting—“poor,” he says, “is the man of many wants not prone to resentment—“the
                    best shield against injustice is to double the cloak of long suffering ';
                    zealous in labour above all men—“as a day well spent gives joyful sleep, so does
                    a life well spent give joyful death.” With these instincts and maxims, his moral
                    experience is not likely to have been deeply troubled. In matters of religion he
                    seems to have had some share of the philosophical scepticism of a later age. In
                    matters of the heart, if any consoling or any disturbing passion played a part
                    in his life, we do not know it; we know only of affectionate relations with
                    friends and pupils, of public and private regard mixed in the days of his youth
                    with dazzled admiration, and in those of his age with something of reverential
                    awe.</p>
                <p>Of the presence and aspect of this illustrious man we have, as has been said, no
                    record belonging to the earlier period of his life except that of the written
                    descriptions which celebrate his beauty. The portraits which we possess
                    represent him in after years, as he may have appeared during his second
                    residence at Milan, when the character of sage and archimage had fully imprinted
                    itself on his countenance. The features are grand, clear, and deeply lined, the
                    mouth firmly set and almost stern, the eyes strong and intent beneath their
                    bushy eyebrows, the hair long and white, descending and commingling with a
                    majestic beard. The most authentic sheet which thus represents him is a drawing
                    nearly in full face, unquestionably by his own hand, at Turin. Other studies,
                    but none of such high quality as this, represent the same features in profile.
                    On both the full-face and the profile drawings many painted portraits have been
                    founded, some of them done by nearly contemporary hands; but none can with
                    safety be attributed to the master himself.</p>
                <p>The mat. rials for a definitive life of Leonardo are at present wanting. They may
                    be expected to be in great part supplied by the promised publication of Dr J. P.
                    Richter, <hi rend="italic">The Literary Works of Leonardo da Vinci.</hi> In the
                    meantime the results of recent investigation may be best gathered from the same
                    writer's biography of the painter (London, 1880), supplemented by his
                    “Leonardo-Studien” in Lützow s <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift für

                    fact the authorities above named must be regarded as superseding all earlier

                    no contribution of importance was added until the work of Λmoretti, which lias
                    formed the foundation of all later researches (C. Amoretti, <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The celebrated <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Painting,</hi> which has hitherto
                    been the only published portion of Leonardo's writings, consists of brief
                    didactic chapters, or more properly paragraphs, of practical direction Or
                    critical remark on all the branches and all the conditions of a painter’s
                    practice. The original MS. draft of Leonardo has been lost, though a great
                    number of notes for it are scattered through the various extant volumes of his
                    MSS. The work has been printed in two different forms; one of these is an
                    abridged version consisting of 365 sections; the first edition of it was
                    published in Paris in 1551, the last, translated into English by J. F. Rigaud,
                    in London, 1877. The other is a more extended version, in 912 sections, divided
                    into eight books; this was printed in 1817 by Greg. Manzi at Rome, from a 17th
                    century MS. which he had discovered in the vatican Library; a German translation
                    from the same MS. has been edited by G. H. Ludwig in Eitelberger's series of <hi
                    rend="italic">Quellenschriften für Kunstgeschichte.</hi> On the history of the
                    book in general see Max Jordan, <hi rend="italic">Das Malerbuch</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Leonardo da Vinci,</hi> Leipsic,</p>
                <p>1873.</p>
                <p>The MSS., writings, sketches, and memoranda of Leonardo have undergone many
                    vicissitudes since they were bequeathed in the mass by their author to his
                    friend and <hi rend="italic">famulus</hi> Francesco Melzi. Within fifty years of
                    Leonardo's death the son of their inheritor had allowed them to pass out of his
                    hands, and they were in the possession partly of the sculptor Pompeo Leoni, and
                    partly in that of Dr Guido Mazenta. By 1637 a considerable portion of them were
                    again reunitedin the Ambrosian Library at Milan. During the domination of the
                    French under Bonaparte, these treasures were brought to France, and the greater
                    part of them were not reclaimed. Milan, indeed, possesses that immense composite
                    volume of Leonardo's MSS. which is perhaps the most valuable of them all, and is
                    called from its bulk the <hi rend="italic">Codice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Atlantico.</hi> Fourteen volumes more are in the library of the Institute at
                    Paris. A number of others are dispersed in various English collections—the most
                    important in the Royal Library at Windsor, some at the British Museum and South
                    Kensington, and others in the private collections of Hoikham Hall and Ashburnham
                    House. The well-known sonnet, beginning “Chi non pub quel die vuol, quel ehe pub
                    voglia,” which has been quoted since the 16th century as of Leonardo's writing,
                    has recently been proved to have been written fifty years before his time (see
                    G. Uzielli in the journal <hi rend="italic">II Buonarroti,</hi> 1875). (S.
