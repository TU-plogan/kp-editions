                    studio of Vouet. At fifteen he received commissions from Cardinal Richelieu in
                    the execution of which he displayed an ability which obtained the generous
                    commendations of Poussin himself, in whose company Le Brun started for Rome in
                    1642. In Rome he remained four years in the receipt of a pension due to the
                    liberality of the chancellor. On his return to Paris Le Brun found numerous
                    patrons, of whom the celebrated Superintendent Fouquet was the most important.
                    Employed at Vaux le Vicomte, Le Brun, who had an immense amount of worldly tact,
                    ingratiated himself with Mazarin, then secretly pitting Colbert against Fouquet.
                    Colbert also promptly recognized Le Brun’s powers of organization, and attached
                    him to his interests. Together they founded the Academy of Painting and
                    Sculpture (1648), and the Academy of France at Rome (1666), and gave a new
                    development to the industrial arts. In 1660 they established the Gobelins, which
                    at first was a great school for the manufacture, not of tapestries only, but of
                    every class of furniture required in the royal palaces. Commanding the
                    industrial arts through the Gobelins, of which he was director, and the whole
                    artist world through the Academy—in which he successively held every post— Le
                    Brun imprinted his own character on all that was produced in France during his
                    lifetime, and gave a direction to the national tendencies which endured even
                    after his death. The nature of his emphatic and pompous talent was in harmony
                    with the taste of the king, who, full of admiration at the decorations designed
                    by Le Brun for his triumphal entry into Paris (1660), commissioned him to
                    execute a series of subjects from the history of Alexander. The first of these,
                    Alexander and the Family of Darius, so delighted Louis XIV. that he at once
                    ennobled Le Brun (December 1662), who was also created first painter to his
                    majesty with a pension of 12,000 livres, the same amount as he had yearly
                    received in the service of the magnificent Fouquet. From this date all that was
                    done in the royal palaces was directed by L·e Brun. The works of the gallery of
                    Apollo in the Louvre were interrupted in 1677 when he accompanied the king to
                    Flanders (on his return from Lille he painted several compositions in the
                    Château of St Germains), and finally—for they remained unfinished at his
                    death—by the vast labours of Λ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> 'ersailles, where
                    he reserved for himself the Halls of War and Peace, the Ambassadors’ Staircase,
                    and the Great Gallery, other artists being forced to accept the position of his
                    assistants. At the death of Colbert, Louvois, who succeeded him in the
                    department of public works, showed no favour to Le Brun, and in spite of the
                    king’s continued support he felt a bitter change in his position. This
                    contributed to the illness which on 22d February 1690 ended in his death in the
                    Gobelins. Besides his gigantic labours at Versailles and the Louvre, the number
                    of his works for religious corporations and private patrons is incredible. He
                    modelled and engraved with much facility, and, in spite of the heaviness and
                    poverty of drawing and colour, his extraordinary activity and the vigour of his
                    conceptions justify his claim to fame. Nearly all his compositions have been
                    reproduced by celebrated engravers.</p>
