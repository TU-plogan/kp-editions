                    (1602-1675), an eminent rabbinical scholar, was the son of Thomas Lightfoot,
                    vicar of Uttoxeter, Staffordshire, and was born at Stoke-upon-Trent in that
                    county, on March 29, 1602. His school education was received at Morton Green
                    near Congleton, Cheshire, and in June 1617 he entered Christ’s College,
                    Cambridge, where he made great progress in Latin and Greek, and was reckoned the
                    best orator among the undergraduates. After taking his bachelor’s degree, he
                    became for some time assistant master at Repton in Derbyshire; at the canonical
                    age he received ordination, and shortly afterwards was appointed curate of
                    Norton-under-Hales in Shropshire. There he attracted the notice of Sir Rowland
                    Cotton, an amateur Hebraist of some attainments it would seem, who made him his
                    domestic chaplain at Bellaport, and was the first to awaken his taste for
                    rabbinical learning. Shortly after the removal of Sir Rowland with his family to
                    London, Lightfoot followed him thither, but for some unexplained reason soon
                    left the capital again, and, visiting his parents at Uttoxeter, took a solemn
                    leave of them, having resolved “to travel beyond the seas.” An unexpected and
                    pressing invitation induced him to change his determination, and to accept a
                    charge at Stone in Staffordshire, where he continued for about two years, and
                    where, on May 21, 1628, he married Joyce, daughter of William Crompton of Stone
                    Park, and widow of George Copwood of Delverne, Staffordshire. From Stone he
                    removed to Hornsey near London, for the sake of the library of Sion College,
                    which he often had occasion to consult; his first published work, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Erubhin, or Miscellanies, Christian and Judaical, penned for
                    recreation at vacant hours,</hi> and dedicated to Sir R. Cotton, appeared at
                    London in 1629. During the summer and autumn of 1630 he lived at Uttoxeter, and
                    in September of that year he was presented by Sir R. Cotton to the rectory of
                    Ashley in Staffordshire, where he continued to discharge his pastoral duties,
                    and to prosecute his rabbinical studies, for the next twelve years. For the more
                    uninterrupted pursuit of the latter he is said to have bought a small piece of
                    land near his parsonage, and to have built upon it a small house “containing a
                    study and withdrawing room below, and a lodging chamber above.” “Here he closely
                    followed his said studies with great delight and unwearied diligence, and did
                    choose to lodge here very often, though it were so near to his family and
                    parsonage house.” In June 1642 he left Ashley for London; the precise occasion
                    of the removal is not known, but probably it arose out of the necessity for
                    personal superintendence of the publication of his next work, <hi rend="italic"
                    >A few and new Observations upon the Book of Genesis: the most of them certain;
                    the rest, probable; all, harmless, strange, and rarely heard of before,</hi>
                    which appeared at London in that year with a dedication to “my dear and loving
                    countrymen of the county of Stafford, and other my friends residing in the city
                    of London.” Soon after his arrival in the capital he became minister of St
                    Bartholomew’s church, near the Exchange; and in 1643 he was appointed to preach
                    the sermon before the House of Commons on occasion of the public fast of March
                    29. It was afterwards published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elias</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus,</hi> the text being Luke i. 17; in it a
                    parallel is drawn between the Baptist’s ministry and the work of reformation
                    which in the preacher’s judgment was incumbent on the parliament of his own day.
                    Lightfoot was also one of the original members of the Westminster Assembly,
                    which held its first formal meeting<pb break="no"

                    Proceedings of the Assembly of Divines from January 1, 1643 to December 31,
                    1644,” now printed in the thirteenth volume of the 8vo edition of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Works,</hi> is a valuable historical source for the too brief
                    period to which it relates. He was assiduous in his attendance from the first,
                    and, though frequently standing almost or even quite alone, especially in the
                    Erastian controversy, exercised a material influence on the result of the
                    discussions of the Assembly. In 1643 Lightfoot published <hi rend="italic">A
                    Handful of Gleanings out of the Book of Exodus,</hi> dedicated to the
                    inhabitants of Bartholomew Exchange, and in the same year he was made master of
                    Catherine Hall by the parliamentary visitors of Cambridge, and also, on the
                    recommendation of the Assembly, was promoted to the rectory of Much Munden in
                    Hertfordshire; both appointments he retained until his death. In 1644 was
                    published in London the first instalment of the laborious but never completed
                    work of which the full title runs <hi rend="italic">The Harmony of the Four
                    Evangelists among themselves, and with the Old Testament, with an explanation of
                    the chiefest difficulties both in Language and Sense: Part I. From the beginning
                    of the Gospels to the Baptism of our Saviour.</hi> The second part <hi

                    our Saviour’s Baptism to the second</hi> in 1650. On August 26, 1645, he again
                    had the honour of preaching before the House of Commons on the day of their
                    monthly fast; in the discourse, which was afterwards published <hi rend="italic"
                    >(A Fast Sermon,</hi> on Rev. xx. 1, 2), after controverting as erroneous and
                    false the doctrine of the Millenaries, he goes on to urge upon the parliament
                    various practical suggestions for the repression with a strong hand of current
                    blasphemies (“I do hold it a truer point in divinity that ‘ errans conscientia
                    liganda ’ than ‘ ligat ’ ”), for a thorough revision of the authorized version
                    of the Scriptures, for the encouragement of a learned ministry, and for a speedy
                    settlement of the church. “I rejoice to see what you have done in platforming
                    classes and presbyteries, and I verily and cordially believe it is according to
                    the pattern in the mount.” In the same year appeared <hi rend="italic">A
                    Commentary upon</hi><hi rend="italic">the Acts of the Apostles, chronical and
                    critical; the Difficulties of the text explained, and the times of the Story

                    was followed in 1655 by <hi rend="italic">The Harmony, Chronicle, and Order of
                    the New Testament,</hi> inscribed to Cromwell, with an epistle dedicatory to his
                    highness’s honourable council. In the last-named year Lightfoot, who in 1652 had
                    commenced doctor of divinity, was chosen vice-chancellor of the university of
                    Cambridge, but continued to reside by preference at Munden, in the rectory of
                    which, as well as in the mastership of Catherine Hall, he was confirmed, through
                    the influence of friends, at the Restoration. The remainder of his life was
                    principally devoted to the production of the work by which his name now chiefly
                    lives, the <hi rend="italic">Horae Hebraicae et Talmudicae,</hi> in which the
                    volume relating to Matthew appeared in 1658, that relating to Mark in 1663, and
                    those relating to 1 Corinthians, John, and Luke, in 1664, 1671, and 1674
                    respectively. Towards the close of 1675, while travelling from Cambridge to Ely
                    (where he had been collated by Sir Orlando Bridgman to a prebendal stall), he
                    caught a severe cold, upon which, by an indiscretion in diet it is said, fever
                    supervened; falling afterwards into a lethargy w hich continued for about a
                    fortnight, he died at Ely on December 6, 1675. The <hi rend="italic"
