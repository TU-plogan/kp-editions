                    parents, who had some reason for fearing that he might be induced to become a
                    professed member of the Society of Jesus. But he had received at Cologne two
                    mental tendencies from which he never emancipated himself. One of these, which
                    was suppressed or suspended in middle life, asserted itself later in his return
                    to the bosom of the Catholic Church before his death. The other, derived from
                    his Jesuit· training, showed itself in his merely rhetorical or verbal viewof
                    classical literature, of which the one interest lay in its style.</p>
                <p>Lipsius rushed into print at twenty with one of those volumes of miscellaneous
                    remarks then in vogue (<hi rend="italic">Variarum Lectionum Libri Tres,</hi>
                    1567), the dedication of which to Cardinal Granvella procured him an appointment
                    as Latin secretary, and a visit to Rome in the retinue of the cardinal. Here
                    Lipsius remained two years, using his spare time in study of the Latin classics,
                    in viewing the monuments, collecting inscriptions, and handling MSS. in the
                    Vatican. A comparison of a second volume of miscellaneous criticism <hi
                    rend="italic">(Antiquarum Lectionum</hi><hi rend="italic">Libm Quinque,</hi>
                    1575), published after his return from Rome, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Variae</hi><hi rend="italic">Lectiones</hi> of eight years earlier shows that
                    he had advanced from the notion of purely conjectural emendation to that of
                    emending by collation, and that he had learnt to distinguish between a “good”
                    and a “bad” MS. In Rome he also made the acquaintance of Muretus, Paullus
                    Manutius, and the other humanists of the catholic reaction who were then in
                    credit there. He was also noticed by Cardinal Sirleto and Fulvio Orsini; but he
                    can hardly have even seen in the street Sigonio and Vettorio, and the
                    introduction of these celebrated names is perhaps only a stylistic flourish of
                    the biographer Le Mire, to whom we owe the only original account of Lipsius’s
                    life. In 1570 he wandered over Burgundy, Germany, Austria, Bohemia, in search of
                    learning<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n709/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0709-0686"/> and learned acquaintance, and was engaged for
                    more than a year as teacher in the university of Jena, a position which implied
                    an outward conformity to the Lutheran Church. On his way back to Louvain, he
                    stopped some time at Cologne, where he must again have comported himself as a
                    Catholic. Here he married, but the union was without issue, and in other
                    respects did not conduce to happiness, as we gather from various allusions
                    scattered through Lipsius’s letters. He returned to Louvain, but was soon driven
                    by the civil war to take refuge in Antwerp, where he received, in 1579, a call
                    to the newly founded university of Leyden, as professor of history.</p>
                <p>At Leyden, where he must have outwardly conformed to the Calvinistic creed and
                    worship, Lipsius remained eleven years,—years about which his Catholic
                    biographer Le Mire has nothing to tell, but speaks of the period as an enforced
                    temporary sojourn among the infidels,—till the restoration of peace allowed him
                    to return to his home in Brabant. In truth, this period of Lipsius’s life was
                    the period of his greatest productivity. It was now that he prepared his <hi
                    rend="italic">Seneca,</hi> and that he perfected, in successive editions, his
                    <hi rend="italic">Tacitus.</hi> To edit and comment on two authors of the first
                    class, such as Tacitus and Seneca, in addition to the daily drudgery of
                    teaching, might seem work enough for eleven years. But Lipsius’s industry
                    enabled him, over and above, to bring out, from the press of Plantin at Antwerp,
                    a series of works of varied character and contents, some of pure scholarship,
                    others collections from classical authors, and others again of more general
                    interest. Of this latter class was a treatise on politics <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Politicomm</hi><hi rend="italic">Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">Sex,</hi> 1589),
                    in which he let it be seen that, though a public teacher in a country which
                    professed toleration, he had not departed from the state maxims of Alva and
                    Philip II. He lays it down that a Government should only suffer one religion to
                    exist in its territory, and that dissent should be extirpated by fire and sword.
                    This frank avowal of what were known to be his real sentiments might have easily
                    had disagreeable consequences for the author, if he had not been sheltered from
                    the attacks to which it exposed him by the prudence of the authorities of
                    Leyden. Lipsius was prevailed upon to publish a declaration that his expression
                    “<hi rend="italic">Ure,secaf</hi> was not intended of material fire and sword,
                    but was only a metaphor for “vigorous treatment.”</p>
                <p>The time at last arrived when Lipsius, who had always been somewhat ill at ease
                    in his Calvinistic disguise, was to throw it off and return into the bosom of
                    the church. In the spring of 1591 he left Leyden under pretext of taking the
                    waters at Spa for the relief of a liver complaint. He went to Mainz, where he
                    was reconciled to the church by the instrumentality of the Jesuit fathers. The
                    event was one which deeply interested the Catholic world, and invitations poured
                    in on Lipsius from the courts and universities of Italy, Austria, and Spain. But
                    he preferred to remain in his own country, and after two years of unsettled
                    residence at Liége, Spa, &amp;c., settled at Louvain, as professor of Latin in
                    the Collegium Buslidianum. He was not expected to teach, and his trifling
                    stipend was eked out by the appointments of privy councillor and historiographer
                    to the king of Spain.</p>
                <p>From this time till his death Lipsius continued to publish antiquarian
                    collections and dissertations as before. But he was, in fact, lost to learning.
                    His name and fame, and his sententious and amusing style, were placed at the
                    disposal of the Jesuits, and used by them to restore the credit of two local
                    images of the Virgin, whose authentic miracles were retailed by Lipsius in two
                    tracts, <hi rend="italic">Diva Virgo Hallensis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Diva
                    Virgo Sichemensis.</hi> Joseph Hall, afterwards bishop of Norwich, was at Spa in
                    the suite of Sir E. Bacon at the time of the appearance of Lipsius’s brochures,
                    and was like to have got into trouble by disputing against them (Hall’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> cent. i. ep. 5). Lipsius died at Louvain on the 23d
                    of March 1606, at the age of fifty-eight. His Greek books and MSS. he left to
                    the Jesuit college at Louvain; the rest of his library, choice rather than
                    extensive, to a nephew. His furred doctor’s robe he ordered to be offered at the
                    shrine of the Virgin at Hall.</p>
                <p>If, according to the fancy of some biographers, Scaliger, Casaubon, and Lipsius
                    be erected into a literary triumvirate, Lipsius represents Lepidus. His
                    knowledge of classical antiquity was extremely limited. He had but slight
                    acquaintance with Greek; “pour sa provision ’ ' only, said Scaliger. He is fond
                    of adorning his letters with Greek phrases, his quotations betraying that he is
                    a stranger in that country. In Latin literature the poets and Cicero lay outside
                    his range; he had no ear for metre, and no taste for poetical expression. Where
                    he was strong was in the Latin historians and in Roman antiquities. His greatest
                    work was his edition of Tacitus. This author he had so completely made his own
                    that he could repeat the whole, and offered to be tested in any part of the
                    text, with a poniard held to his breast, to be used against him if he should
                    fail. His <hi rend="italic">Tacitus</hi> first appeared in 1575, and was five
                    times revised and corrected by the editor—the last time in 1606, shortly before
                    his death. His <hi rend="italic">Seneca</hi> is dated Antwerp, 1605. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Opera Omnia</hi> were collected in 4 vols., Antwerp, 1637, of
                    which the Wesel edition, 1675, is a verbal reprint in the same number of
                    volumes, but in a smaller form. The first volume contains also Le Mire’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Lipsius,</hi> which had appeared separately in 1607. Both
                    editions contain ten centuries of his epistles, to which additions have been
