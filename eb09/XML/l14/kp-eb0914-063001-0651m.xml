                    Artificial light is generally produced by raising some body to a high
                    temperature. If the temperature of a solid body be greater than that of
                    surrounding bodies it parts with some of its energy in the form of radiation.
                    Whilst the temperature is low these radiations are not of a kind to which the
                    eye is sensitive; they are exclusively radiations less refrangible and of
                    greater wave-length than red light, and may be called infra-red. As the
                    temperature is increased the infra-red radiations increase, but presently there
                    are added radiations which the eye perceives as red light. As the temperature is
                    further increased, the red light increases, and yellow, green, and blue rays are
                    successively thrown off. On pushing the temperature to a still higher point,
                    radiations of a wave-length shorter even than violet light are produced, to
                    which the eye is insensitive, but which act strongly on certain chemical
                    substances; these may be called ultra-violet rays. It is thus seen that a very
                    hot body in general throws out rays of various wavelength, our eyes, it so
                    happens, being only sensitive to certain of these, viz., those not very long and
                    not very short, and that the hotter the body the more of every kind of radiation
                    will it throw out, but the proportion of short waves to long waves becomes
                    vastly greater as the temperature is increased. The problem of the artificial
                    production of light with economy of energy is the same as that of raising some
                    body to such a temperature that it shall give as large a proportion as possible
                    of those rays which the eye happens to be capable of feeling. For practical
                    purposes this temperature is the highest temperature we can produce. As an
                    illustration of the luminous effect of the high temperature produced by
                    converting other forms of energy into heat within a small space, consider the
                    following statements. 120 cubic feet of 15 candle gas will, if burned in
                    ordinary gas burners, give a light of 360 standard candles for one hour. The
                    heat produced by the combustion is equivalent to about 60 million foot-pounds.
                    If this gas be burned in a gas-engine, about 8 million foot-pounds of useful
                    work will be done outside the engine, or four horse-power for one hour. This is
                    sufficient to drive an “A” Gramme machine for one hour; the energy of the
                    current will be about 6,400,000 footpounds per hour, about half of which, or
                    only 3,200,000 foot-pounds, is converted into radiant energy in the electric
                    arc, but this electric arc will radiate a light of 2000 candles when viewed
                    horizontally, and two or three times as much when viewed from below. Hence 3
                    million foot-pounds changed to heat in the electric arc may be said roughly to
                    affect our eyes six times as much as 60 million foot-pounds changed to heat in
                    an ordinary gas burner.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    from the Select Committee on Electric Lighting,</hi> 1879.</p></note> Owing to
                    the high temperature at which it remains solid, and to its great emissive power,
                    the radiant body used for artificial illumination is nearly always some form of
                    carbon.</p>
                <p>The consideration of electric lighting naturally divides into two parts—the
                    production of suitable electric currents, and the conversion of the energy of
                    such currents into radiations. Although electric lights were first produced from
                    currents generated by batteries, they have only attained commercial importance
                    by the use of machines for converting mechanical energy into electric
                    current.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dynamo-Electric Machines.—</hi> In the widest sense a
                    dynamo-electric machine may be defined as an apparatus for converting mechanical
                    energy into the energy of electrostatic charge, or mechanical power into its
                    equivalent electric current through a conductor. Under this definition would be
                    included the electrophorus and all frictional machines; but the term is used in
                    a more restricted sense for those machines which produce electric currents by
                    the motion of conductors in a magnetic field, or by the motion of a magnetic
                    field in the neighbourhood of a conductor. The general laws of electromagnetic
                    induction need not be set forth here; as they are fully explained in the article
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Electricity,</hi> they will be assumed in all that follows.
                    Since, if the current in a closed circuit be in one direction when the number of
                    lines of force is increasing, it will be in the opposite direction when they are
                    diminishing, it is clear that the current in each part of the circuit which
                    passes through the magnetic field must be alternate in direction. Hence also the
                    current in the wire outside the machine must also be alternate, unless something
                    of the nature of a commutator be employed to reverse the connexions of the
                    internal wires, in which the current is induced, and the external circuit. We
                    have then broadly two classes of dynamo-electric machines:—the simplest, the

                <p>Hence we see the current is diminished either by increasing 7 or increasing R,
                    also that the moment of reversal of current is not coincident with that of no
                    electromotive force, but occurs after that time by an amount depending on the
                    relative magnitudes of 7 and R. This explains in a general way what is known as
                    the lead of the brushes in a continuous current machine. If we wished to apply a
                    commutator to the Siemens alternate current machine for the purpose of producing
                    an external current constant in direction, the change effected by the commutator
                    should occur at an epoch after that of greatest electromotive force, an epoch
                    which, with varying external resistance or varying speed, will depend on the
                    resistance and speed.</p>

                <p>In what precedes it has been assumed that the copper wires are the only
                    conducting bodies moving in the magnetic field. In most cases the moving wire
                    coils of these machines have iron cores, the iron being in some cases solid, in
                    others more or less divided. It is found that if such machines are ran on open
                    circuit the iron becomes hot, very much hotter than when the circuit of the
                    copper wire is closed; in some cases the phenomenon is so marked that the
                    machine actually takes more to drive it when the circuit is quite open than when
                    the machine is short-circuited. The explanation is that on open circuit currents
                    are induced in the iron cores, but that when the copper coils are closed the
                    current in the latter by its induction diminishes the current in the iron. The
                    effect of currents in the iron cores is not alone’to waste energy and heat the
                    machine; the current produced is also actually less for a given intensity of
                    field and speed of revolution. The cure of the evil is to subdivide the moving
                    iron as much as possible in directions perpendicular to those in which the
                    current tends to circulate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continuous or Direct Current Machines.—</hi> It has been shown
                    that to produce a continuous current a commutator is needed. If there is but a
                    single wire in the armature, or if there are more than one, but all are under
                    maximum electromotive force at the same time, the current outside the machine,
                    though always in the same direction, will be far from uniform. This irregularity
                    may be reduced to any extent by multiplying the wires of the armature, giving
                    each its own connexion to the outer circuit, and so placing them that the
                    electromotive force attains a maximum successively in the several circuits. A
                    practically uniform electric current was first commercially produced with the
                    ring armature of Pacinotti as perfected by Gramme. Suppose a straight bar
                    electromagnet surrounded by a coil of copper wire from end to end. Let the
                    electromagnet be bent with the copper wire upon it until its ends meet and it
                    forms an annulus or anchor ring. Let the two ends of the copper wire be
                    connected, so that the iron core is surrounded by an endless copper wire, and
                    you have the Pacinotti or Gramme ring. This ring rotates about its axis of
                    figure between two diametrically opposed magnetic poles of opposite name. The
                    ring may at any instant be supposed divided in halves by a diameter
                    perpendicular to the diameter joining the centre of the poles. Equal and
                    opposite electromotive forces act on the copper wire of the two halves, giving
                    two opposite electric poles half way between the magnetic poles. If electric
                    connexions could be maintained with these two points as the ring revolves, a
                    continuous current would be drawn off. In practice this is only approximated to.
                    The copper wire is divided into a series of equal sections, and at the point of
                    junction of each section with its neighbour a connexion is made with a plate of
                    a commutator, having as many divisions as there are divisions of the copper
                    coil. Collecting, brushes bear upon the commutator plates, which are connected
                    to the coil nearest to the point of maximum potential. Owing to the
                    self-induction and mutual induction of the several coils of the armature, this
                    point is displaced in the direction of rotation when a current is being drawn
                    off, to an extent greater as the current is greater in relation to the strength
                    of the magnetic field. The magnetic field in the Gramme and other continuous
                    dynamo-electric machines may be produced in several ways.<note anchored="true"

                    advantageous to divide the current from the armature, sending the greater part
                    through the external circuit, and a smaller portion through the electromagnet,
                    which is then of very much higher resistance, as the electromagnet is a shunt to
                    the external circuit. Machines so arranged are sometimes called shunt
                    dynamos.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For experiments

                    initiate the current, and below a certain speed of rotation give no practically
                    useful electromotive force.</p>
                <p>In discussing the comparative efficiency of dynamomachines there are two points
                    to be examined—(1) how much of the power applied is converted into energy of
                    current in the whole circuit, whether external or in the wires of the armature
                    or of the electromagnets, and (2) how much of the power is available outside of
                    the machine. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n653/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0653-0632"/> practical sources of loss are friction of
                    bearings, and of the brushes on the commutator, electric currents induced in the
                    iron of the machine, production of heat in the copper wire of the armature due
                    to its resistance, and production of heat in the wire of the electromagnet due
                    to its resistance. There is also a certain loss in sparks upon the commutator.
                    The currents in the iron are reduced by dividing the iron by insulating surfaces
                    perpendicular to the electromotive force tending to produce such currents. The
                    loss by resistance of wire in armature and magnets greatly depends on the
                    dimensions of the machine. For imagine two exactly similar dynamo-electric
                    machines, the one being <hi rend="italic">n</hi> times the dimensions of the
                    other, we have the following relations between them, assuming the same magnetic
                    field per square centimetre, and the same speed of rotation :—</p>
                <p>The electric resistances of the several parts are as 1: <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Current round magnets required to produce the field as <hi rend="italic"
                    >n.</hi></p>
                <p>Thus the work wasted in heating the wire of the electromagnets varies as the
                    linear dimensions of the machine. The current which the armature can carry with
                    safety to the insulation will increase more rapidly than the linear dimensions
                    of the machines, but less rapidly than the square of the linear dimensions. If
                    the current vary as the linear dimensions n, the whole electric work done by the
                    machine will vary as its weight n <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi>, and the work

                    passing it through a considerable resistance in such small compass that the
                    conductor becomes intensely hot. It is of course necessary that the conductor
                    shall be able to endure a very high temperature without injury. Iridium and
                    platinumiridium wire have been employed, but are too expensive for commercial
                    use. Hitherto the only available substance is carbon, in the form of a thread or
                    filament. This carbon must be protected from the air by enclosing it in a glass
                    globe from which every trace of air has been removed. An electric current
                    passing through a carbon filament obeys Ohm’s law, as through a metallic wire.
                    But in metals the resistance increases as the temperature rises, in carbon it
                    diminishes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thomson, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tel. Jour.,</hi> ix. 378.</p></note> The filament or thread of
                    carbon being enclosed in a vacuous space, the energy of current converted into
                    heat in the filament only leaves it in the shape of radiations. To light
                    economically, it is necessary to heat the filament to such a temperature that
                    the greatest possible proportion of these radiations shall belong to that part
                    of the spectrum to which the eye is sensitive, <hi rend="italic">ue.,</hi> to
                    the highest temperature the filament will stand. The fundamental problem of
                    incandescent electric lighting is to produce a carbon thread the substance of
                    which shall permanently stand the highest possible temperature, to make good
                    electrical connexion between the ends of the filament and the conducting wires,
                    and above all to secure that the thread shall be uniform throughout its length,
                    for the current which can be safely used is limited by the weakest point of the
                    filament. Several inventors have recently succeeded in meeting these conditions,
                    but their relative merit and priority cannot be discussed here.<note

                    Humphry Davy discovered that if two pieces of carbon were placed in contact with
                    each other, and the current from a battery of a sufficient number of elements
                    were passed from one piece to the other, the current did not cease when the
                    carbons were slightly parted, but that the current passed across the intervening
                    space, causing an intensely high temperature and consequently brilliant light.
                    The pieces of carbon gradually burned away, the positive carbon being consumed
                    more rapidly than the negative. When an electric current passes through a
                    conducting solid body maintained at a constant temperature, the difference of
                    potential on the two sides of the body has a constant ratio to the current
                    passing through; this constant ratio is known as the electric resistance of the
                    body at its then temperature. No such constant ratio exists in the case of the
                    electric arc. If you increase the current passing between two carbons at a small
                    distance apart, you do not materially change the difference of potential at the
                    two ends of the electric arc. It is, therefore, not strictly appropriate to
                    speak of the resistance of the electric arc; the appropriate constant, or
                    approximate constant, for an electric arc is the difference of potential between
                    the two sides of the arc.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    1868.</p></note> However near the carbons approach without touching, this does
                    not fall below a certain minimum value, and as the carbons are separated its
                    value increases. In ordinary practice with continuous currents the potential of
                    the electric arc may be taken as ranging from 35 to 45 volts. If the current in
                    amperes be multiplied by the difference of potential in volts, and the product
                    be divided by 746, we have the power used in the are itself in horse-power, that
                    is, the power effectively used in lighting. The mechanism of an electric lamp
                    has two functions to perform, it has first to bring the carbons into contact and
                    then part them, or simply part them if they are initially in contact when the
                    light is started, or when it is accidentally extinguished (this is called
                    striking the arc); it has also to bring the carbons together as they are
                    consumed. The former function is always accomplished by an electromagnet or
                    solenoid. In the electric candles, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> those of
                    Jablochkoff, Rapieff, Wilde, or Siemens, the carbons are approximately parallel,
                    and they burn down as does a candle,—the arc being forced to the ends of the
                    carbons by the repulsion of the current in the carbons on the electric arc.<note

                    have their axes in the same line, and their approach or recession must be
                    controlled by the current passing through, by the difference of potential, or by
                    both combined. When the same current passes through a succession of lamps in
                    series, it is clear that the regulation cannot be by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n654/mode/1up"

                    lamps, and might be maintained constant by the adjustment of any one only of the
                    lamps. When lamps are burned in series, it is essential that the difference of
                    potential shall be an element in the control This is done by using an
                    electromagnet bound by fine wire so as to have a resistance of some hundreds of
                    ohms, and connecting it to the two sides of the arc. In the Siemens differential
                    lamp, and in some others, a potential or shunt coil and a current coil oppose
                    each other <hi rend="italic">; as</hi> the arc lengthens the current becomes
                    less, and the potential greater, each acting to cause the carbons to approach.
                    It will be seen that the possible combinations of mechanisms and electromagnets
                    for adjusting an electric arc are endless; and so also are the patents for such
                    combinations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See for

                    phenomena are much more complicated, owing to the difference of potential being
                    a discontinuous function of the time. The difference of potential will be (say)
                    40 volts in one direction for a certain fraction less than half of the periodic
                    time of the current; the current then entirely ceases, generally for a finite
                    time, and is then reversed with a sudden reversal of difference of
                    potential.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Joubert, <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal de Physique,</hi> ix. 297.</p></note> The work done in the
                    arc is measured by the time integral of the product of difference of potential
                    and current passing. A knowledge of neither the mean strength of the current,
                    nor of the difference of potential, nor of both, gives the means of ascertaining
                    the work done in an arc with alternate current. The only satisfactory electrical
                    method is the quadrant electrometer suitably connected, and this is open to the
                    objection that a considerable resistance must be introduced into the
                    circuit.</p>

                    admit that green light is not measurable in terms of red light; a mixture of red
                    and green is not measurable in terms 0«. another mixture in which the
                    proportions of the colours are wholly different. Again, the intensity of the
                    light obtained from an arc light depends greatly on the direction in which it is
