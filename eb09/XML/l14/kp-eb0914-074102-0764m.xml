                    has gradually become one of the greatest and most perfect organizations in the

                    Street, in the very centre of that portion of the old city of London most
                    frequented by merchants of the highest class. Shortly after this event Mr Lloyd
                    gave another proof of his enterprise and intelligence by the establishment of a
                    weekly newspaper furnishing commercial and shipping news, in those days an
                    undertaking of no small difficulty. This paper took the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lloyd's News,</hi> and, though its life was not a prolonged one,
                    it was destined to be the precursor of the now ubiquitous <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lloyd's List,</hi> the oldest existing paper, the <hi rend="italic">London
                    Gazette</hi> excepted, of the present day. In Lombard Street the business
                    transacted at Lloyd’s coffee-house steadily grew in extent and importance, but
                    it does not appear that throughout the greater part of the 18th century the
                    merchants and underwriters frequenting the rooms were bound together by any
                    rules, or acted under any organization. By and by, however, the rapid increase
                    of marine insurance business made a change of system and improved accommodation
                    absolutely necessary, and accordingly, after finding a temporary resting-place
                    in Pope’s Head Alley, the underwriters and brokers finally settled down in the
                    Royal Exchange in March 1774. One of the first improvements in the mode of
                    effecting marine insurance springing out of this new state of things was the
                    introduction of a printed form of policy. Hitherto various forms had been in
                    use; and, to avoid the numerous disputes consequent on a practice so loose and
                    unsatisfactory, the committee of Lloyd’s proposed a general form, which was
                    finally adopted by the members on the 12th of January 1779, and which remains in
                    use, with only a few slight alterations, to this day. The two most important
                    events in the history of Lloyd’s during the present century are the
                    reorganization of the association in 1811, and the passage of an Act in 1871
                    granting to Lloyd’s all the rights and privileges of a corporation sanctioned by
                    parliament. According to this Act of Incorporation, the three main objects for
                    which the society exists are—first, the carrying out of the business of marine
                    insurance; secondly, the protection of the interests of the members of the
                    association; and thirdly, the collection, publication, and diffusion of
                    intelligence and information with respect to shipping. In the promotion of the
                    last-named object, obviously the foundation upon which the entire superstructure
                    rests, an intelligence department has been gradually developed which for
                    wideness of range and efficient working has no parallel among private
                    enterprises in any country.</p>
                <p>The rooms at Lloyd’s are available only to subscribers and members. The former
                    pay an annual subscription of five guineas without entrance fee, but have no
                    voice in the management of the institution. The latter consist of
                    nonunderwriting members, who pay an entrance fee of twelve guineas, and of
                    underwriting members, who pay a fee of one hundred pounds. Underwriting members
                    are also required to deposit securities to the value of .£5000 to .£10,000,
                    according to circumstances, as a guarantee for their engagements. The management
                    of the establishment is delegated by the members to certain of their number
                    selected as a “committee for managing the affairs of Lloyd’s.” With this body
                    lies the appointment of all the officials and agents of the institution, the
                    daily routine of duty being entrusted to a secretary and a large staff of clerks
                    and other assistants. The mode employed in effecting an insurance at Lloyd’s is
                    very simple. The business is done entirely by brokers, who write upon a slip of
                    paper the name of the ship and shipmaster, the nature of the voyage, the subject
                    to be insured, and the amount at which it is valued. If the risk is accepted,
                    each underwriter subscribes his name and the amount he agrees to take or
                    underwrite, the insurance being effected as soon as the total value is made up.
                    The sum paid by the insured to the underwriters is denominated the premium, a
                    tax upon the profits of the merchant which the progress of science, of the art
                    of shipbuilding, and of navigation has in these days reduced to a very moderate
                    figure. (w. p. H.)</p>
