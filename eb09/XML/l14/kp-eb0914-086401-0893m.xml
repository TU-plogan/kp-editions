                    fervour, flourished in the 3d century, and is known to have perished under
                    sentence of the emperor Aurelian in 273 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> He forms
                    one of the last brilliant cluster of pagan literati; and Porphyry, round whom it
                    centred, was the pupil of Longinus. As Porphyry is known to have been born in
                    233, it is probable that his preceptor, who could not have been less than twenty
                    years his senior, may have been born about 210 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi>
                    The main authority for the facts of his life is a notice in Suidas, where we
                    find it stated in a preface to a list of his writings that “Longinus Cassius,
                    philosopher, preceptor of Porphyry the philosopher, a learned scholar and
                    critic, lived in the time of the emperor Aurelian, and was cut off by him as
                    having conspired with Zeuobia, the wife of Odenathus.” From the same authority
                    we learn that Phronto, the rhetorician of Emesa in Syria, was his uncle, and
                    that Phrontonis, sister of Phronto, was mother to Longinus, who thus became heir
                    to his uncle Phronto. As to his birthplace there is no tradition, but it is
                    probable that he was a native of Syria, possibly of Emesa, to which his uncle
                    belonged. He tells us, as we learn from fragments of his works, that he enjoyed
                    great advantages in travel and education, that his parents, being rich, took him
                    to travel and he saw much of the world, and that he studied at Athens under
                    Phronto, at Alexandria under Ammonius Saccas and the pagan Origenes, and at Rome
                    under Plotinus and Amelius. The Neo-Platonic philosophy was then in the
                    ascendant, but Longinus did not embrace the new speculations which Plotinus was
                    then developing, and continued a Platonist of the old type. Hence the sting of a
                    sarcasm attributed to Plotinus—“Longinus may be a philologer, but he is no
                    philosopher.” Longinus does not appear to have reciprocated the sarcastic
                    feeling, for we have still extant a fragment of a letter in which he asks
                    Porphyry to come to Phoenicia and to bring with him the treatises of Plotinus,
                    for, he observes, though he does not feel much attraction for the subjects, he
                    yet likes the man. The reputation which Longinus acquired by his learning was
                    immense; it was of him that Eunapius first used the expression that has since
                    become proverbial “a living library ”—in modern phrase, a walking
                    encyclopaedia.</p>
                <p>The most conspicuous event of his life was also the most tragic in its
                    consequences. He became secretary to Zenobia, the widowed queen of Palmyra, who
                    acquired from him a knowledge of Greek, and made him her chief counsellor in
                    state affairs. In this capacity he favoured the policy by which she aimed at
                    independence of the Roman empire, encouraged, doubtless, to do so by the recent
                    fate of Valerian, and by the feebleness of the tenure by which Rome held the
                    Syrian provinces. Aurelian, however, crushed the pretension, and, while Zenobia
                    lost her power and wasled captive to Rome, Longinus paid the forfeit of his
                    life. According to Zosimus, Zenobia sought to exculpate herself with Aurelian by
                    laying the whole blame on her adviser. He died bravely, not seeking to escape
                    his fate by suicide as a Stoic might have done, but following the example of
                    Socrates and the precept of Plato, to whose philosophy he adhered.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is probable that he owed
                    part of his political fervour to the influence or inheritance of the name
                    “Cassius,” from whatever source this surname was derived. The associations of
                    this name were distinctly anti-imperial and even regicidal, as seen in Caius
                    Cassius and in Cassius Chaerea.</p></note></p>
                <p>The remains of Longinus that have come down to us, unfortunately scanty, are
                    partly fragments of letters and extracts from criticisms on points of diction;
                    and they bear out the impression we derive from the historical notices of the
                    man. He is vivid and yet minute, lively and penetrating, and his observations
                    show taste, learning, and judgment. Among the most notable of the fragments we
                    have a defence of the Platonic doctrine of the soul as a distinct essence from
                    the body, which defines clearly his philosophical position.</p>
                <p>It only remains to advert in a few words to the remarkable production called the
                    <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Sublime,</hi> which has usually passed current
                    as a work of Longinus. This remarkable work, which is among the most notable
                    productions of ancient criticism, second only in importance to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Poetics</hi> of Aristotle, and superior to that work in luminous
                    beauty and sense of form, cannot be with certainty ascribed to Longinus,
                    although the internal evidence favours the usual ascription. Of the two most
                    startling difficulties the first is the absence of any mention of a treatise
                    πepl <hi rend="italic">iiψoυs</hi> in the list by Suidas. The enumeration is,
                    however, incomplete, and the phrase “many other works,” with which it closes,
                    may be held to cover much. A more formidable difficulty is the circumstance that
                    in the most important <pb break="no"

                    of the 10th century) the heading is <hi rend="italic">Διονυσίου</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">t) ∆oyyivoυ,</hi> giving thus an alternative author “Dionysius,”
                    and in the other important MS., the Laurentian at Florence, the title is <hi
                    rend="italic">'∆vωviμoυ,</hi> implying that the author was unknown. According to
                    Vaucher <hi rend="italic">(Études,</hi> p. 134) this title is not the original
                    one, and there are traces of an earlier title <hi rend="italic">∆oyyivoυ,</hi>
                    which had formed the superscription. Full information as to the critical
                    question will be found in the editions of A. E. Egger <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Longini</hi><hi rend="italic">quae</hi><hi rend="italic">supersunt,</hi>
                    Paris, 1837), Vaucher’s <hi rend="italic">Études</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Sublimitate Libellus,</hi> Bonn, 1867. Vaucher ascribes the
                    treatise to Plutarch, but the evidence negatives that supposition, and, although
                    there are difficulties in ascribing the work absolutely to Longinus, as Boileau
                    and Gibbon and the critics of last century traditionally assumed, there is no
                    other name than that of Longinus that presents so many concurring circumstances,
                    to justify provisionally the current ascription. The fragments that remain of
                    the undoubted works of Longinus are largely characterized by the same lively
                    force and epigrammatic terseness which distinguish the treatise, “On the
                    Sublime.” The translations of this treatise into all the European tongues have
                    been almost innumerable, including the famous one by Boileau, which rendered the
                    work the favourite text-book of the bellelettristic critics in the last century.
                    The most important English translations are by William Smith, 1739, frequently
                    reproduced; Hathaway, 1834; Spurdens, 1836. (W. D. G.)</p>
