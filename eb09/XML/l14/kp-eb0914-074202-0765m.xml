                    falls into Chilunga Bay in 4° 9' S. lat., and was formerly considered the
                    northern boundary of the Loango kingdom. In a narrower sense it is the country
                    bounded on the S. by the Luemma, and on the N. by the Kuilu,—the district
                    between the Luemma andtheChiloango being known as Chiloango or Little Loango,
                    that between the Chiloango and the Congo as Kakongo and Angoy, and that to the
                    north of the Kuilu as Chilunga. The whole country between 6° and 4° may be
                    described as the lowland portion of the seaward versant of the Serra do Crystal
                    or Serra Complida, a range running almost parallel with the coast, from which
                    its spurs and underfalls are distant only 30 or 40 miles. It has an irregularly
                    undulating or hilly surface, slowly rising in somewhat indefinite terraces, and
                    is traversed from north-east to south-west by a number of considerable streams
                    flowing in well-marked valleys. The coast-line in some stretches is low and
                    swampy, while in others, as along Loango and Kabinda Bays, it presents a series
                    of cliffs 40 to 50 feet high. Behind the region of alluvial deposits which
                    prevails for some distance inland there is a broken belt of Tertiary rocks; but
                    these soon give place to laterite, and beyond the laterite lie the micaschists,
                    talcs, and gneiss of which the mountains are composed. Of the Loango rivers the
                    best explored is the Kuilu or Quillu. At its mouth, in 4° 29' S. lat., it is a
                    noble stream 1100 feet wide, but the bar has hitherto proved an insuperable
                    obstacle to the entrance of sea-going ships; near the Mayombe factory, which may
                    be reached in fifteen hours from the coast, it begins to take the character of a
                    mountain stream. Its principal affluent is the Nanga. Farther south are the
                    Songolo and the Luemma. Of greater importance as a navigable route towards the
                    interior is the Chiloango or Loango Luse (sometimes erroneously called the
                    Kakongo), which disembogues in 5° 12' S. lat. and 12° 5' E. long., and is formed
                    about 15 miles inland by the junction of the Loango and the Lukula, of which the
                    one separates Loango proper from the Osobo country and the other the Osobo
                    country from Kakongo.</p>
                <p>Though a large proportion of the Loango coast region is occupied by primeval
                    forest, with trees rising to a height of 150 and 200 feet, there is considerable
                    variety of scenery—open lagoons, mangrove swamps, scattered clusters of trees,
                    park-like reaches, dense walls of tangled underwood along the rivers, prairies
                    of tall grass through which no pathway can be driven, and patches of
                    cultivation. Among the more characteristic forms of vegetation are baobabs,
                    silkcotton trees, screw-pines, and palms—especially <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hyphaene</hi><hi rend="italic">guineensis</hi> (a fan-palm), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Raphia</hi> (the wine-palm), and <hi rend="italic">Elaeis g urne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ensis</hi> (the oil-palm). Anonaceous plants (notably <hi
                    rend="italic">Anona senegalensis)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >↑λιεpallabanda,</hi> an olive-myrtle-like tree, are common in the prairies; the
                    papyrus shoots up to a height of 20 feet along the rivers (particularly the
                    Luemma); the banks are fringed by the cottony <hi rend="italic">Hibiscus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tiliaceus,</hi> ipomaeas, and fragrant jasmines; and the thickets
                    are bound together in one inextricable mass by lianas of many kinds. Among the
                    fruit trees are the mango and the papaw; the orange has been successfully
                    introduced at Vista and Kabinda; and the lemon continues to flourish well up the
                    country. Negro-pepper (a variety of capsicum) and ginger grow wild; the natives,
                    in addition to manioc (their staple sustenance) and bananas, cultivate
                    groundnuts and tobacco; and the planters have European vegetables in their
                    gardens.</p>
                <p>The crocodile, thehippopotamus, andseveralkindsof apes—including the chimpanzee
                    and the rare gorilla—are the most noteworthy larger animals; the birds are
                    various and beautiful—grey parrots, shrikes, fly-catchers, rhinoceros birds,
                    weaver birds (often in large colonies on the palm-trees), ice-birds, from the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cecyle Sharρii</hi> to the dwarfish <hi rend="italic">Alcedo
                    cristata,</hi> butterfly-finches, and helmet-birds <hi rend="italic">CΓuracus
                    giganteus),</hi> not to mention doves, snipes, and other more familiar types.
                    Snakes are extremely common— <hi rend="italic">Caucus rhombeatus, Atractaspis
                    irregularis, Dendraspis Jamesonii, Dasypeltis palmarum,</hi> &amp;c.; but they
                    give comparatively little trouble. The curious climbing-fish, which frequents
                    the mangroves, the <hi rend="italic">Pteropterus</hi> or lung-fish, which lies
                    in the mud in a state of lethargy during the dry season, the strange and
                    poisonous <hi rend="italic">Tetrodon guttifer,</hi> and the herring-like <hi
                    rend="italic">Bellona africana,</hi> often caught in great shoals—are the more
                    remarkable of the fishes. Oysters are got in abundance from the lagoons, and the
                    Portuguese fatten the huge <hi rend="italic">Cardisoma</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >armatum</hi> or heart-crab for table. Fireflies and unfortunately also
                    mosquitoes and sandflies are among the most familiar forms of insect life; the
                    bird spider among the rarer. A kind of ant builds very striking pent-house or
                    umbrella-shaped nests rising on the tree trunks one above the other like the
                    roofs of a Chinese pagoda.</p>
                <p>Well-built and tall (average height of the men 5’5 feet, of the women 5 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 2), strongly dolichocephalous and very thick of
                    skull, never black but of various shades of warm brown with the faintest
                    suggestion of purple, the Bafiote (as the natives of the Loango coast call
                    themselves) are on the whole very favourable specimens of the Negro stock to
                    which they belong. Their black curly hair never becomes white with age, and grey
                    only in the case of very old people. Baldness is quite unknown, and many of the
                    men wear beards. Physical deformity is extremely rare. Like the west-coast
                    negroes in general the Bafiote have a ghastly and grotesque belief in fetiches
                    and witchcraft; and their gangas or priests employ the cassa (nkassa) <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n766/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0766-0743"/> ordeal with such recklessness that for every
                    grown-up person who dies a natural death three or four, it is estimated, perish
                    by this judgment of the invisible powers. A custom which readily catches the eye
                    of the foreigner is that of setting their marriageable maidens forth to view in
                    a little bower specially erected in front of the parents’ dwelling—their skins
                    stained red with a peculiar powder. Near Chinchoxo there is a curious tribe, the
                    Mavumbu or Umwambu, known to Europeans as Black Jews on account of their
                    strikingly Semitic features. The coast people proper or Bavilli look down on
                    their more inland neighbours as less civilized; and these in their turn pay the
                    same compliment to those beyond,—the Bayombe and Bayaka, who occupy the
                    mountainous woodland on the borders of Loango, being reckoned as genuine
                    savages.</p>
                <p>The people are scattered throughout the country in small villages; Nkondo,
                    probably the largest, contains only 350 to 400 huts, though it is the seat of
                    one of the most influential “princes.” There is no town or village of
                    Loango,—the place of that name on Loango Bay being a mere group of factories.
                    Buri, Boari, or Boali, was the name of the former capital; Loangiri or Loangele
                    (visited in 1873 by Bastian) was the burial-place of the ancient kings; and
                    Lubu, which is still neutral in war, is that of the “princes.” At one time
                    included in the great Congo kingdom, Loango became independent about the close
                    of the 16th century, and was still of considerable importance in the days of
                    Abbé Proyart (1750), though Kakongo and other districts were practically
                    independent. At present there is no central authority in the country; the petty
                    local chiefs are local chiefs and nothing more; but the members of the blood
                    royal are still honoured with special privileges, a large number of nominal
                    titles remain in use, and a common tradition of greatness gives a sort of
                    cohesion to the political conglomerate.</p>
                <p>The slave trade was longer maintained in Loango than anywhere else on the West
                    African seaboard; and since its extirpation palm oil and india-rubber have been
                    the main objects of commerce. Perfect freedom of trade prevails; and there are
                    Dutch, Portuguese, German, French, and English factories on the coast and up the
                    rivers. The Portuguese have made considerable efforts to secure territorial
                    supremacy; but they have hitherto failed, partly owing to direct French
                    opposition, partly to the state of the country.</p>
                <p>The following are the principal stations of European trade :— Banana at the mouth
                    of the Congo, the central post of the Rotterdam African Trading Company, whose
                    comptoirs are scattered along a vast extent of the west coast; Muanda, with one
                    of the best of the native villages; Vista; Kabinda, the natives of which are
                    known as far south as Mossamedes for their enterprise and skill as car-? enters,
                    tailors, &amp;c.; Landana, the seat of Dutch, French, and 'ortuguese factories,
                    and of a French mission from the Gaboon; and Chincho or Tchinchotcho (5° 9' 14"
                    S. lat., 12°3' 45" E. long.) the post occupied by the German Exploring
                    Expedition in 1873-76.</p>
