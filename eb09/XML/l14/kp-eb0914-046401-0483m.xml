                    of his physical and mental health. His family was ancient and patrician, but so
                    deeply embarrassed as to be only rescued from ruin by the energy of his mother,
                    who had taken the control of business matters entirely into her own hands, and
                    whose engrossing devotion to her undertaking seems to have almost dried up the
                    springs of maternal tenderness. Count Monaldo Leopardi, the father, a mere
                    nullity in his own household, secluded himself in his extensive library, to
                    which his nervous, sickly, and deformed son had free access, and which absorbed
                    him exclusively in the absence of any intelligent sympathy from his parents, any
                    companionship except that of his brothers and sister, or any recreation in the
                    dullest of Italian towns. The lad spent his days over grammars and dictionaries,
                    learning Latin with little assistance, and Greek and the principal modern
                    languages with none at all. Any ordinarily clever boy would have emerged from
                    this discipline a mere pedant and bookworm. Leopardi came forth a Hellene, not
                    merely a consummate Greek scholar, but penetrated with the classical conception
                    of life, and a master of antique form and style. At sixteen he composed a Latin
                    treatise on the Roman rhetoricians of the 2d century, a commentary on Porphyry’s
                    life of Plotinus, and a history of astronomy; at seventeen he wrote on the
                    popular errors of the ancients, citing more than four hundred authors. A little
                    later he imposed upon the first scholars of Italy by two odes in the manner of
                    Anacreon. At eighteen he produced a poem of considerable length, the
                    “Appressamento alla Morte,” which, after being lost for many years, has recently
                    been discovered and published by Signor Zanino Volta. It is a vision of the
                    omnipotence of death, modelled upon Petrarch, but more truly inspired by Dante,
                    and in its conception, machinery, and general tone offering a remarkable
                    resemblance to Shelley’s “Triumph of Life,” written six years subsequently, and
                    of which Leopardi probably never heard. This juvenile work was succeeded (1819)
                    by two lyrical compositions which at once placed the author upon the height
                    which he maintained ever afterwards. The ode to Italy, and that on the monument
                    to Dante erected at Florence, gave voice to the dismay and affliction with which
                    Italy, aroused by the French Revolution from the torpor of the 17th and 18th
                    centuries, contemplated her forlorn and degraded condition, her political
                    impotence, her degeneracy in arts and arms, and the frivolity or stagnation of
                    her intellectual life. They were the outcry of a student who had found an ideal
                    of national existence in his books, and to whose disappointment everything in
                    his own circumstances lent additional poignancy. But there is nothing unmanly or
                    morbid in the expression of these sentiments, and the odes are surprisingly
                    exempt from the failings characteristic of young poets. They are remarkably
                    chaste in diction, close and nervous in style, sparing in fancy, and almost
                    destitute of simile and metaphor, antique in spirit, yet pervaded by modern
                    ideas, combining Laudor’s dignity with a considerable infusion of the passion of
                    Byron. These qualities continued to characterize Leopardi's poetical writings
                    throughout his life. A third ode, on Cardinal Mai’s discoveries of ancient MSS.,
                    lamented in the same spirit of indignant sorrow the decadence of Italian
                    literature. The publication of these pieces widened the breach between Leopardi
                    and his father, a well-meaning but apparently dull and apathetic man, who had
                    lived into the 19th century without imbibing any of its spirit, and who provoked
                    his son’s contempt by a superstition unpardonable in a scholar of real learning.
                    Very probably from a mistaken idea of duty to his son, very probably, too, from
                    his own entire dependence in pecuniary matters upon his wife, he for a long time
                    obstinately refused Leopardi funds, recreation, change of scene, everything that
                    could have contributed to combat the growing pessimism which eventually became
                    nothing less than monomaniacal. The affection of his brothers and sister
                    afforded him some consolation, and he found intellectual sympathy in the eminent
                    scholar and patriot Pietro Giordani, with whom he assiduously corresponded at
                    this period, partly on the ways and means of escaping from “this hermitage, or
                    rather seraglio, where the delights of civil society and the advantages of
                    solitary life are alike wanting.” This forms the keynote of numerous letters of
                    complaint and lamentation, as touching but as effeminate in their pathos as
                    those of the banished Ovid. It must be remembered in fairness that the weakness
                    of Leopardi’s eyesight frequently deprived him for months together of the
                    resource of study. At length (1822) his father allowed him to repair to Rome,
                    where, though cheered by the encouragement of Bunsen and Niebuhr, he found
                    little satisfaction in the trifling pedantry that passed for philology and
                    archaeology, while his sceptical opinions prevented his taking orders, the
                    indispensable condition of public employment in the papal states. Dispirited,
                    and with exhausted means, he returned to Recanati, where he spent three
                    miserable years, brightened only by the production of several more lyrical
                    masterpieces, which appeared in 1824. The most remarkable is perhaps the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bruto</hi><hi rend="italic">Minore,</hi> the condensation of his
                    philosophy of despair. In 1825 he accepted an engagement to edit Cicero and
                    Petrarch for the publisher Stella at Milan, and took up his residence at
                    Bologna, where his life was for a time made almost cheerful by the friendship of
                    the countess Malvezzi. In 1827 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Operette</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Morali,</hi> consisting principally of dialogues and his imaginary
                    biography of Filippo Ottonieri, which have given him a fame as a prose writer
                    hardly inferior to his celebrity as a poet. Modern literature has few
                    productions so eminently classical in form and spirit, so symmetrical in
                    construction and faultless in style. Lucian is evidently <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n484/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0484-0465"/> the model; but the wit and irony which were
                    playthings to Lucian are terribly earnest with Leopardi. Leopardi’s invention is
                    fully equal to Lucian’s, and his only drawback in comparison with his exemplar
                    is that, while the latter’s campaign against pretence and imposture commands
                    hearty sympathy, Leopardi’s philosophical creed is a repulsive hedonism in the
                    disguise of austere stoicism. His Icelander rebuking Nature for his cruelty and
                    inhospitality, his Soul protesting against the original wrong of creation, his
                    Familiar Spirit explaining the impossibility of making his master happy for a
                    single instant—all, in fact, of the chief interlocutors in these dialogues
                    profess the same unmitigated pessimism, claim emancipation from every illusion
                    that renders life tolerable to the vulgar, and assert or imply a vast moral and
                    intellectual superiority over unenlightened mankind. When, however, we come to
                    inquire what it is the privation of which renders them miserable, we find it is
                    nothing but pleasurable sensation, fame, fortune, or some other external thing
                    which a lofty code of ethics would deny to be either indefensibly due to man or
                    essential to his felicity. A page of <hi rend="italic">Sartor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Resartus</hi> scatters Leopardi’s sophistry to the winds, and
                    leaves nothing of his dialogues but the consummate literary skill that would
                    render the least fragment precious. As works of art they are a possession for
                    ever, as contributions to moral philosophy they are worthless, and apart from
                    their literary qualities can only escape condemnation if regarded as lyrical
                    expressions of emotion, the wail extorted from a diseased mind by a diseased
                    body. “Filippo Ottonieri” is a portrait of an imaginary philosopher, imitated
                    from the biography of a real sage in Lucian’s <hi rend="italic">Demonax.</hi>
                    Lucian has shown us the philosopher he wished to copy, Leopardi has truly
                    depicted the philosopher he was. Nothing can be more striking or more tragical
                    than the picture of the man superior to his fellows in every quality of head and
                    heart, and yet condemned to sterility and impotence because he has, as he
                    imagines, gone a step too far on the road to truth, and illusions exist for him
                    no more. The little tract is full of remarks on life and character of surprising
                    depth and justice, manifesting what powers of observation as well as reflexion
                    were possessed by the sickly youth who had seen so little of the world.</p>
                <p>Want of means soon drove Leopardi back to Recanati, where, deaf, half-blind,
                    sleepless, tortured by incessant pain, at war with himself and every one around
                    him except his sister, he spent the two most unhappy years of his unhappy life.
                    In May 1831 he escaped to Florence, where he formed the acquaintance of a young
                    Swiss philologist, M. de Sinner. To him he confided his unpublished philological
                    writings, with a view to their appearance in Germany. Sinner showed himself
                    culpably remiss in the executiou of his trust, and it is no adequate extenuation
                    of his negligence that these treatises were of less value than Leopardi may have
                    thought. Though continually reclaimed by the latter’s friends after his death,
                    they were never published by Sinner, but were purchased after his decease by the
                    Italian Government, and, together with Leopardi’s correspondence with the Swiss
                    philologist, have been partially edited by M. Aulard. In 1831 appeared a new
                    edition of Leopardi’s poems, comprising several new pieces of the highest merit.
                    These are in general less austerely classical than his earlier compositions, and
                    evince a greater tendency to description, and a keener interest in the works and
                    ways of ordinary mankind. “The Resurrection,” composed on occasion of his
                    unexpected recovery, is a model of concentrated energy of diction, and “The Song
                    of the Wandering Shepherd in Asia” is one of the highest flights of modern lyric
                    poetry. The range of the author’s ideas is still restricted, but his style and
                    melody are unsurpassable. Shortly after the publication of these pieces (October
                    1831) Leopardi was driven from Florence to Rome by an unhappy attachment, the
                    history and object of which have remained unknown. His feelings are powerfully
                    expressed in two poems, “To Himself” and “Aspasia,” which seem, however, to
                    breathe wounded pride at least as much as wounded love. In 1832 Leopardi
                    returned to 1 lorence, and there formed acquaintance with a young Neapolitan,
                    Antonio Ranieri, himself an author of merit, and destined to enact towards him
                    the part performed by Severn towards Keats, an enviable title to renown if
                    Ranieri had not in his old age tarnished it by assuming the relation of Trelawny
                    to the deceased Byron. Leopardi accompanied Ranieri and his sister to Naples,
                    and under their care enjoyed four years of comparative tranquillity. He made the
                    acquaintance of the German poet Platen, his sole modern rival in the classical
                    perfection of form, and composed “La Ginestra,” the most consummate of all his
                    lyrical masterpieces, strongly resembling Shelley’s “Mont Blanc,” but more
                    perfect in expression. He also wrote at Naples “The Sequel to the Battle of the
                    Frogs and Mice,” his most sustained effort, a satire in ottava rima on the
                    abortive Neapolitan revolution of 1820, clever and humorous, but obscure from
                    the local character of the allusions. The more painful and distasteful details
                    of his Neapolitan residence may be found by those who care to seek for them in
                    the deplorable publication of Ranieri’s peevish old age <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sette</hi><hi rend="italic">Anni di Sodalizio).</hi> The decay of his
                    constitution continued; he became dropsical; and a sudden crisis of his malady,
                    unanticipated by himself alone, put an end to his life-long sufferings on June
                    15, 1837.</p>
                <p>Leopardi’s sole but sufficient apology for the effeminacy of endless complaints,
                    and an extremely low view of the conditions of human happiness, is to have been
                    a poor invalid tortured by incessant pain, who in demanding pleasurable
                    sensations for mankind was but craving what was indeed an absolute necessity for
                    himself. With all his dramatic skill in dialogue, the cast of his mind was
                    essentially subjective; he was wholly incapable of placing himself at any other
                    point of view than his own. His philosophical opinions accordingly possess
                    merely a personal interest, and are valueless except as illustrations of human
                    nature in abnormal circumstances. The patriotic spirit of his earliest poems,
                    the brief gleam of happiness he enjoyed in female society at Bologna, reveal how
                    different might have been his history and the spirit of his writings had his
                    physical organization qualified him for either love or action. Bereft of every
                    possibility of healthy energy, it is no wonder that he should have sunk into a
                    despairing quietism, a solace probably to himself, and only hurtful to others if
                    represented as a powerful intellect’s deliberate and unbiassed solution of the
                    problem of the universe. Leopardi’s perfect literary expression owes nothing to
                    the nature of the ideas it is employed in embellishing, and is, indeed, most
                    conspicuous when he stands upon common ground with other poets. Thus the
                    magnificent description of the setting of the moon in “Il Tramonto della Luna”
                    is finer than the reflexions it ushers in, and his crowning work, “La Ginestra,”
                    owes most of its impressiveness to the assemblage of noble and picturesque
                    objects which the poet summons as witnesses to the frailty of man. In the
                    presence of Vesuvius and Pompeii such meditations seem natural, and, after all,
                    the association of the destinies of mankind with the revolutions of nature
                    produces rather a sentiment of grave and chastened exaltation than the
                    self-abasement enforced by the poet. This natural and moral sublimity raises it
                    above Leopardi’s other lyrics, which in point of poetical feeling and literary
                    λvorkmanship are for the most part nearly on a par. They are truly classic—not,
                    as with Platen, by a laborious imitation of antique metres, but, as with Shelley
                    and Landor and the English neo-classic poets, by a perfect appropriation of the
                    classical spirit. As with the ancients, their range of sentiment is narrow but
                    their form perfect; there is probably no other modern writer in whom it would be
                    so impossible to alter a line without detriment. The same perfection
                    characterizes Leopardi’s prose writings, and his letters would be hardly less
                    admirable but for the hollow professions and inflated compliments exacted by the
                    conventional proprieties of Italian correspondence. The insincerity of his
                    letters to his father is especially painful; and his professed yearning for
                    death is strangely associated with a frantic dread of cholera. Censure, however,
                    is silent in the contemplation of his moral and physical sufferings; and his
                    intimates unanimously attest the attractiveness of his personal character save
                    for some infirmities that should never have been dragged to light. As a

                    be compared to Pascal, whom he greatly resembles in many respects.</p>
                <p>The poems which constitute Leopardi’s principal title to immortality are only
                    forty-one in number, and some of these are merely fragmentary. They may for the
                    most part be described as odes, meditative soliloquies, or impassioned
                    addresses, generally couched in a lyrical form, although a few are in
                    magnificent blank verse. Some idea of the style and spirit of the former might
                    be obtained by imagining the thoughts of the last book of Spenser’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Faerie Qu,eene</hi> in the metre of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epithalamium.</hi> They were first edited complete by Ranieri at Florence in
                    1845, forming, along with the <hi rend="italic">Oper</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >elle</hi><hi rend="italic">Morali,</hi> the first volume of a proposed edition
                    of Leopardi’s works, which does not, however, include the “Sequel to the Battle
                    of the Frogs and Mice,” first printed at Paris in 1842, nor the recently
                    discovered writings. Vols, ii.-iv. contain the philological essays and
                    translations, with some letters, and vols. v. and vi. the remainder of the
                    correspondence. The juvenile essays preserved in his father’s library at
                    Recanati were edited by Cugnoni in 1879, with the consent of the family.
                    Leopardi’s biography is mainly in his letters, which his recent historians
                    (Brandes, Bouehé-Leclercq, Rosa) have merely wrought up with the addition of
                    criticisms, excellent in their way, more particularly Brandes's, but generally
                    much overrating his significance in the history of human thought. Mr Gladstone’s
                    essay <hi rend="italic">{Quart. Rev.,</hi> 1850), since reprinted in vol. ii. of
                    the author’s <hi rend="italic">Gleanings,</hi> is, on the other hand, too much
                    pervaded by the theological spirit, but is in the main a pattern of generous and
                    discriminating eulogy. Ranieri’s infelicitous contribution to his friend’s
                    biography has been mentioned; a recent publication by the countess Teresa
                    Leopardi, widow of Leopardi’s brother Carlo, has done much to correct
                    misconceptions respecting the circumstances and feelings of his family. There
                    are excellent German translations of his poems by Heyse and Brandes; it is very
                    improbable that there will ever be an adequate one in English. A translation of
                    his essays and dialogues by Mr C. Edwards has, however, just appeared (1882),
                    and most of the dialogueshave been rendered into our language with extraordinary
                    felicity by Mr James Thomson, author of <hi rend="italic">The City of Dreadful
                    Night.</hi> It is much to be hoped that these versions may ere long be
                    disinterred from the files of the <hi rend="italic">National Reformer,</hi> and
                    made generally accessible. ∙(R. G.)</p>
