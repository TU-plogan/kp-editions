                    at the point where it is joined by the Orbiquet, 24 miles above Trouville. The
                    Paris and Caen Railway has a branch from Lisieux to Honfleur and Trouville, and
                    another to Orbec. The cathedral church, dedicated to St Peter, founded about
                    1045, and finished in 1233, which has recently been restored, is the most
                    interesting specimen to be found in Normandy of the transition from the Roman to
                    the Ogival style. It is 360 feet in length, 90 in breadth, and 65 in height; the
                    south tower rises to 230 feet. The nave is remarkable for harmony of proportion,
                    purity of design, and unity of style. The church of St Jacques, built at the end
                    of the 15th century, contains some beautiful glass of the Renaissance, some
                    remarkable woodwork and old frescos, and a curious picture on wood, restored in
                    1681. The old episcopal palace (Lisieux ceased to be a bishopric in 1801) near
                    the cathedral is now used as a court-house and prison. In the court-house is a
                    beautiful hall called the Salle Dorée. The town still retains quaint examples of
                    the wooden houses of the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries; and there are some
                    elegant modern villas. It also possesses a charming public garden and a small
                    museum. The confluence of the two rivers renders it subject to disastrous
                    inundations; but its commerce and industry cause it, notwithstanding, to rank
                    among the richest towns of Normandy. There is a large cattle trade, and the
                    arrondissement has nearly three hundred factories, employing about ten thousand
                    workmen in the manufacture of cloth and cretonnes. Connected with this industry
                    are numerous spinning-mills, bleach-fields, and dye-works; and there are besides
                    wool-mills, chemical works, tanneries, saw-mills, and the like, which bring up
                    the trade of Lisieux to an annual aggregate of upwards of 50 million francs. The
                    population in 1876 was 18,400.</p>
                <p>In the time of Caesar, Lisieux, by the name of <hi rend="italic">Noviomagus,</hi>
                    was the capital of the Lexovii. Though destroyed by the barbarians, by the 6th
                    century it had become one of the most important towns of Neustria. Its bishopric
                    is said to date from the 3d or 4th century. In 877 it was pillaged by the
                    Normans; and in 911 we find it included in the duchy by the treaty of St
                    Clair-sur-Epte. Civil authority was exercised by the bishop as count of the
                    town. In 1136 Geoffrey Plantagenet laid siege to Lisieux, which had taken the
                    side of Stephen of Blois. The war lasted five years, and reduced Lisieux and its
                    neighbourhood to the direst extremities of famine. In 1152 the marriage of Henry
                    II. of England to Eleanor of Guienne, which added so largely to his dominions,
                    was celebrated in the cathedral. Thomas à Becket took refuge here, and some
                    vestments used by him are still shown in the hospital chapel. Taken by Philip
                    Augustus and reunited to France in 1203, the town was a frequent subject of
                    dispute between the contending parties during the Hundred Years’ War, the
                    religious wars, and those of the League.</p>

                <p>Among the bishops of Lisieux may be mentioned Nicholas Oresme, who died in 1382,
                    and Pierre Cauchon, the judge of Joan of Arc, who occupied this see after he had
                    been driven from that of Beauvais.</p>
