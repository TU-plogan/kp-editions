                <p><label type="entry">LATHE</label>. In its simplest form—a form which is still
                    employed by the natives of India—the lathe consists of two upright posts each
                    carrying a fixed pin or dead centre, between which the work in hand is caused to
                    revolve by an assistant pulling alternately the two ends of a cord passed round
                    it. A tool held firmly on a bar which forms a “rest” then attacks in succession
                    the projecting parts, and in this way the entire surface is brought to an equal
                    distance from the central axis; in other words, the cross section becomes
                    everywhere circular.</p>
                <p>Fig. 1 shows a “dead-centre lathe” of the kind used in Europe during the 18th
                    century, in which the centres are carried by “puppets” or “poppets” which can be
                    adjusted to suit the length of the work, the turner giving the rotation by means
                    of the treadle and spring-lath attached to the ceiling. This lath, having
                    immortalized itself by giving its name to the “lathe,” has now almost entirely
                    disappeared, the waste of time in its upward stroke (during which the work
                    revolves in the wrong direction) being a fatal objection to its use in an age in
                    which economy in that respect is of such importance. Dead-centre lathes
                    themselves are now almost things of the past, though within their own
                    limits,—which are of course confined to such articles as are turned on the
                    outside only, and can be supported at the ends (such as fig. 2)—they offer a
                    steadiness of support and a freedom of rotation which others seldom equal and
                    never surpass. The system, however, still survives in the small lathes or
                    “throws” used by watch and clock makers; and for their purposes it is not likely
                    to be soon superseded.</p>
                <p>The lathe seems to have but tardily developed into the “foot-lathe,” the
                    application to it of a fly-wheel worked by a crank and treadle having been
                    exceptional rather than usual even in the early part of the present century,
                    though a separate fly-wheel turned by an assistant had long previously been
                    employed, and must have rendered possible the turning of heavy work which could
                    not have been attempted without it. The naves of cart wheels were doubtless a
                    case in point, and for these as well as for many other purposes detached
                    fly-wheels still render good service where steam or other motive power is not
                    available.</p>
                <p>The early attempts at modifying the dead-centre lathe so that articles such as
                    fig. 3 could be turned “en l’air,” or without the support of a “back-centre,”
                    cannot have been very encouraging. The introduction of a spindle or mandrel
                    carrying a pulley for the lathe band and screwed at one <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n341/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0341-0324"/> end so that the work could be attached to it
                    was a tolerably obvious mode of effecting it, a “headstock” resembling fig. 4
                    being the result. But the discarding of the dead-centre point and the
                    substitution of a front bearing—a step which was essential to setting free the
                    end of the mandrel, and so enabling it to carry the work—must have been
                    accompanied by a loss of power and an amount of unsteadiness which quite account
                    for the tenacity with which the simple pole-lathe and the very similar
                    “spring-bow lathe” survived, and make it improbable that the mandrel was at
                    first ever used in cases for which the older form was admissible. For even if it
                    had been possible with the then existing means to render a mandrel sufficiently
                    true, and to obtain an accurate fit between it and the bearing in which it
                    revolved, wrong ideas prevailed as to the best form to be given to it,—the
                    question indeed having only become a settled one within the memory of persons
                    now living, after various unsatisfactory patterns had been tried and discarded.
                    It is a matter of great importance, since the proper performance of a lathe is
                    mainly dependent on the mandrel’s maintaining a thoroughly good fit.</p>
                <p>The types of modern lathes are as various as are the occupations of those who use
                    them. The mechanic, the soft-wood turner, and the amateur, for instance, differ
                    so greatly in their requirements that a lathe which woħld be well suited to the
                    one would be very ill adapted, even if not wholly useless, to the other. Thus
                    the professional turner of soft wood, with a lathe of which the frame and even
                    the fly-wheel are of timber (its value in shillings being not very different
                    from the price of an amateur’s lathe in pounds) will use a high rate of speed
                    and sharp tools and light cuts, and so obtain results with which the owner of an
                    elaborate instrument cannot at all compete. A modern mechanic’s lathe on the
                    other hand, such as fig. 5, has very different demands made upon it. For this
                    the greatest possible steadiness in all the working parts is the main
                    desideratum, and it is of great advantage to have the means of obtaining a slow
                    speed, so as to be able to take the heaviest cuts which its strength and the
                    power available warrant. Timber has accordingly given place either to cast iron
                    or gun-metal or steel in almost every part of a lathe of this class, the
                    resulting increase of weight and firmness enabling the hand turner successfully
                    to operate on small sizes of wrought iron or even steel, notwithstanding that in
                    driving the fly-wheel his force can be applied only during a portion of each
                    revolution.</p>
                <p>In turning hard materials such as these it is of primary importance that the tool
                    should be held more rigidly than it can with the hand when no support is
                    available except that of a narrow T-headed rest. The difficulty of doing this
                    was to some extent got over formerly by employing “heel tools,” which
                    transferred most of the strain directly to a flat-topped rest and made
                    correspondingly reduced demands upon the arm of the turner; but it was never
                    completely overcome till the introduction of the “slide-rest” placed the
                    movement of the tool under complete control, and grasped it in a hand that never
                    tires. Fig. 6 shows a slide-rest such as would be used with the lathe in the
                    previous engraving, for which purpose simplicity of construction and steadiness
                    in all its parts are the points chiefly aimed at. Slide-rests designed for
                    amateurs’ use are sometimes very different from this in respect of complication
                    and the number of different movements of which they are capable, but each
                    increase in the number of parts intervening between the lathe-bed and the tool
                    is a source of possible unsteadiness which should not be introduced without
                    reason.</p>
                <p>Foremost amongst the more complicated lathes both in utility and in the date of
                    their introduction stand “screwcutting lathes,” in which a regular spiral can be
                    traced upon the work by self-acting means. The traversing mandrel, in which this
                    end was formerly attained by giving a longitudinal motion to the mandrel and the
                    work attached to it, and keeping the tool stationary, is now but little used,
                    the modern plan of causing the slide-rest to travel along the bed automatically
                    being more convenient in most instances. It involves, however, an amount of
                    gearing almost inadmissible in a foot-lathe, and it is for those driven by
                    steam-power that it is chiefly employed. These, being machine tools, do not come
                    within our present subject. It should be mentioned that screws can be cut in
                    foot-lathes by hand-chasing tools without any special arrangement, and they are
                    done in this way to a great extent by telescope makers and others with beautiful
                    regularity.</p>
                <p>“Chucks”—a term which embraces most of the contrivances by which the turner
                    establishes connexion between his work and the mandrel—have been made to
                    contribute in various ways to the production of abnormal forms. The oval chuck
                    is used (as its name implies) for giving an elliptical path to the work in lieu
                    of a circular one. The eccentric chuck enables any point or any series of points
                    in succession to be brought into a line with the axis of the mandrel. With the
                    former chuck, therefore, a fixed tool can trace an ellipse on the face of the
                    work, and with the latter a series of intersecting or adjacent circles can be
                    described by it. In this way a great variety of intricate <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n342/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0342-0325"/> “engine-turned” patterns can be produced in
                    the lathe, some idea of which may be gathered from the comparatively simple one
                    shown in fig. 7. To the complicated apparatus known as the geometric chuck
                    neither straight lines nor irregular curves are impossible. The “roseengine” is
                    a very old device for producing a somewhat similar kind of ornament, such as
                    fig. 8, by giving a chattering motion to the mandrel, which is specially mounted
                    on a vibrating frame for that purpose. The wavy lines on the backs of watches
                    are engraved in this way, the curvature of the case not preventing the use of
                    the rose-engine, as it would that of the eccentric chuck. But it is probable
                    that these methods of producing facework ornament will gradually disappear, and
                    that all who still have leisure for doing them will prefer to use elliptic and
                    eccentric and rose cutters fixed in the slide-rest and driven independently of
                    the mandrel by overhead motion. With these similar results can be obtained, and
                    the tool only instead of the entire mass of the work has to follow the desired
                    curve.</p>
                <p>Sketches of a few characteristic turning tools are given in fig. 9: A, a chisel,
                    and B, a gouge, for soft wood; C, a heel tool for wrought iron; D, E, the
                    enlarged ends of a pair of chasing tools for cutting outside and inside
                    screw-threads; and F, G, two slide-rest tools. Of these last F is forged from a
                    square bar of steel (an operation which must be repeated from time to time as
                    the edge gets worn away), and G has an iron shank made once for all, from which
                    the steel-cutting portion can be removed for the purpose of sharpening or
                    renewal. The saving of tool-steel thus ettected is of course no great
                    consideration in the case of these small tools, but it is very considerable in
                    the large sizes used with the power lathes of the present day. Examples of these
                    will be found under the heading <hi rend="smallcaps">Machine Tools</hi> (y.u).
