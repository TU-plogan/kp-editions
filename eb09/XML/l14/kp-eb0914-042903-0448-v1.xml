                    the second town of the kingdom of Saxony in size, and the first in commercial
                    importance, is situated in a large and fertile plain, in 51 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 20' 6" N. lat. and 12° 23' 37' ’ E. long., about
                    65 miles northwest of Dresden and 6 miles from the Prussian frontier. It stands
                    just above the junction of three small rivers, the Pleisse, the Parthe, and the
                    Elster, which flow in various branches through or round the town, and
                    afterwards, under the name of Elster, discharge themselves into the Saale.
                    Though of unimposing exterior, Leipsic is one of the most prosperous and
                    enterprising of German towns. Besides being the most important commercial city
                    in Germany next to Hamburg, it possesses the second largest German university,
                    is the headquarters of the supreme courts of the empire, and forms one of the
                    most prominent literary and musical centres in Europe. It consists of the old or
                    inner city, surrounded by a wide and pleasant promenade laid out on the site of
                    the old fortifications, and of the very much more extensive inner and outer
                    suburbs. Beyond the last is a fringe of thriving suburban villages, such as
                    Reudnitz, Volkmarsdorf, Gohlis, Eutritzsch, Plagwitz, and Lindenau, which are
                    gradually becoming absorbed by the growth of the town. On the north-west the
                    town is bordered by the fine public park and woods of the Rosenthal.</p>
                <p>The old town, with its narrow streets and numerous houses of the 16 th and 17th
                    centuries, still preserves much of its quaint mediaeval aspect. The most
                    interesting of its buildings are the Rathhaus, a Gothic edifice built by
                    Hieronymus Lotter in 1556 (now doomed to demolition), and the Fürstenhaus, with
                    its curious projecting balconies. The Pleissenburg, or citadel, now used for
                    barracks and public offices, also dates from the middle of the 16th century.
                    Auerbach’s Keller, a curious old wine-vault, is interesting for the use made of
                    it by Goethe in his <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>; it contains a series of mural
                    paintings of the 16th century, representing the legend on which the play is
                    based. The business of Leipsic is chiefly concentrated in the inner city; but
                    the headquarters of the book trade lie in the east suburb. The streets of the
                    suburbs are mostly broad and well built. The most notable modern buildings are
                    the new theatre, an imposing Renaissance structure designed by Langhans, and the
                    museum, which stand facing each other at opposite ends of the spacious
                    Augustus-Platz. Most of the west side of the same square is occupied by the
                    Augusteum, or main building of the university, which, however, also possesses
                    several special institutes in another part of the town. The new district law
                    courts are contained in a large and substantial though not specially imposing
                    building, and the municipal hospital and the hospital of St John are also
                    handsome edifices. The so-called Roman House, with loggie and frescos in the
                    Italian style, is the only private dwelling demanding remark. The churches of
                    Leipsic are comparatively uninteresting. The oldest, in its present form, is the
                    Paulinerkirche or university church, built in 1229-40, and the largest is the
                    Thomaskirche, dating from 1496. The university of Leipsic, founded in 1409 by a
                    secession of two thousand German students from Prague, has long ranked among the
                    most important in Germany. A few years ago it was also the most numerously
                    attended, but it is now outstripped by Berlin, which has about four thousand
                    students as compared with thirty five hundred at Leipsic (1882). The professors
                    and “Privatdocenten,” or lecturers, number about one hundred and seventy. The
                    university library contains 350,000 volumes and 4000 manuscripts; it occupies
                    the Paulinum, a characteristic specimen of old monastic architecture, dating in
                    part from <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n449/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0449-0430"/> 1229-1240. The other educational institutions
                    of Leipsic include three gymnasia, two “Realschulen,” a commercial academy <hi
                        rend="italic">{Handelsschule),</hi> a high school for girls, another for
                    boys, and a large number of admirable public and private schools of a lower
                    grade.</p>
                <p>The number of literary, scientific, and artistic institutions in Leipsic is
                    unusually large for the size of the town. One of the most important is the
                    museum, which contains about four hundred modern paintings, a large number of
                    casts, a few pieces of original sculpture, and a well-arranged collection of
                    drawings and engravings. The art-industrial museum, the collection of the
                    historical society, and the ethnographical museum are also of considerable
                    interest, and will be still more useful when they are united in the large
                    building to be erected for them with part of the munificent bequest made to the
                    town by Herr Grassi in 1881. As a musical centre Leipsic is known all over the
                    world for its excellent conservatorium, founded in 1843 by
                    Mendelssohn-Bartholdy. The series of concerts given annually in the old
                    Gewandhaus, or Drapers’ Hall, is also of world-wide reputation, and the operatic
                    stage of Leipsic is deservedly ranked among the finest in Germany. A further
                    stimulus to the musical taste of the inhabitants is afforded by the numerous
                    vocal and orchestral societies, some of which have brought their art to a very
                    high pitch of perfection. The prominence of the publishing interest (more fully
                    noticed below) has attracted to Leipsic a large number of gifted authors, and
                    made it a literary centre of considerable importance. About two hundred and
                    seventy newspapers and periodicals are published here, including several of the
                    most widely circulated in Germany.</p>
                <p>The outstanding importance of Leipsic as a commercial town is mainly derived from
                    its three great fairs, which annually attract a concourse of about forty
                    thousand merchants from all parts of Europe, and from Persia, Armenia, and other
                    Asiatic countries. The most important fairs are held at Easter and Michaelmas,
                    and are said to have been founded as markets about 1170. The smaller New Year’s
                    fair was established in 1458. In 1268 Margrave Dietrich granted a safe-conduct
                    to all frequenters of the fairs, and in 1497 and 1507 the emperor Maximilian
                    greatly increased their importance by prohibiting the holding of annual markets
                    at any town within a wide radius of Leipsic. During the Thirty Years’ War, the
                    Seven Years’ War, and the troubles consequent upon the French Revolution, the
                    trade of the Leipsic fairs considerably decreased, but it recovered itself after
                    the accession of Saxony to the German Customs Union <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Zollverein)</hi> in 1833, and for the next twenty years rapidly and
                    steadily increased. Since then, owing to the greater facilities of communication
                    and consequent alterations in the mode of conducting business, the transactions
                    at the fairs may be said to have diminished in relative though they have
                    increased in actual value. Wares that can be safely purchased by sample appear
                    at the fairs in steadily diminishing quantities, while others, such as hides,
                    furs, and leather, which require to be actually examined, show as marked an
                    increase. It is impossible to give accurate statistics of the business done at
                    the fair, but the value of the sales considerably exceeds £10,000,000 sterling
                    per annum. The principal commodity is furs (chiefly American and Russian), of
                    which about one and a quarter million pounds worth are annually disposed of;
                    next in order come leather, hides, wool, cloth, linen, and glass. The Leipsic
                    wool-market, held for two days in June, is also important.</p>
                <p>In the trades of bookselling and publishing Leipsic occupies a unique position,
                    not only taking the first place in Germany, but even surpassing London and Paris
                    in the number and total value of its sales (Hasse, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Leipzig</hi><hi rend="italic">und ihre Umgebung,</hi> p. 236). There are
                    upwards of three hundred publishers and booksellers in the town, and about five
                    thousand firms in other parts of Europe are represented here by commissioners.
                    About 2500 books, or one-sixth of the total production of Germany, are published
                    in Leipsic annually. Several hundred booksellers assemble in Leipsic every year
                    at Jubilate, and settle their accounts at their own exchange <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Buchhändler-Börse).</hi> Leipsic also contains seventy printing-works,
                    some of great extent, and a corresponding number of type-foundries,
                    binding-shops, and other kindred industries. The so-called “polygraphic”
                    industries give employment to nearly ten thousand hands.</p>
                <p>As a manufacturing town Leipsic is important rather for the variety than for the
                    magnitude of its industries. The great manufacturing staples, such as iron and
                    the textile fabrics, are scarcely represented at all, but in certain
                    specialities, such as etheric oils, artificial flowers, and perfumes, it ranks
                    before any other town in Germany. In absolute value the most important articles
                    of manufacture are pianos and other musical instruments, tobacco and cigars,
                    spirits, chemicals, scientific instruments, and waxcloth. Wool-combing has also
                    of late years been extensively carried on. Upwards of fifty thousand workpeople
                    are employed in the factories in and around Leipsic.</p>
                <p>The population of Leipsic has been quintupled within the present century, rising
                    from 31,887 in 1801 to 153,988 in 1881, and has of late increased at the rate of
                    between 3 and 4 per cent, per annum. With the suburban villages the population
                    amounts to 220,000. While the dwelling-houses in the suburbs have been
                    multiplied sixfold in the last two hundred years, the number in the inner town
                    has remained almost stationary for the same period, the business part of Leipsic
                    thus exhibiting the same phenomenon as in other large cities. The vast majority
                    of the population (upwards of 90 per cent.) belongs to the Lutheran Church,
                    while the religious bodies next in numerical order are the Roman Catholics
                    (4288), the Reformed (3368), and the Jews (3179). The annual death-rate is 23 to
                    24 per 1000, in which Leipsic, thanks in part to its excellent system of
                    drainage, compares favourably with other large German towns. It is remarkable
                    that the proportion of suicides to population is larger in Leipsic than in any
                    other European town. In the five years 1876-80 no fewer than 332 persons
                    voluntarily put an end to their lives, being at the rate of 62 per annum, or 1
                    suicide to every 30 deaths of adults.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Though recent discoveries point to the
                    conclusion that the site of Leipsic was inhabited even during the Stone Age, the
                    history of the present town begins with the foundation of a Sorbian fishing
                    village at the junction of the Pleisse and the Parthe, which derived its name of
                    Lipzk from the Slavonic <hi rend="italic">lip</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >lipa,</hi> a lime-tree. This settlement was probably already in existence
                    when the emperor Henry I. built a castle here about 920. The Slavonic language
                    long continued to be spoken in Leipsic, and was legal in the courts of law down
                    to 1327. The first historical mention of Leipsic occurs in a writing of the
                    beginning of the 11th century, when it is spoken of as an “urbs,” or fortified
                    place. In 1134 it came into the possession of Conrad of Wettin, margrave of
                    Meissen, and under Margrave Otho the Rich (1156-89) it received many important
                    privileges, and became a flourishing town of 5000 to 60(ft) inhabitants. Its
                    favourable situation, almost equidistant from the Baltic Sea and the Alps, the
                    Rhine and the Oder, in the midst of a fertile plain intersected by the principal
                    highways of central Europe from north to south and east to west, co-operated
                    with the fostering care of the margraves in raising it in the 15th century to
                    the position of one of the most important commercial towns in Germany. The
                    growth of its fairs, which of course were mainly instrumental in producing this
                    result, has been above described. The famous conference between Luther and Dr
                    Eck, held in the Leipsic Pleissenburg in 1519, did much for the spread of the
                    Reformation, but it was not till twenty years later that Leipsic formally
                    espoused the Protestant cause. In 1547, in the war of the Smalkaldic league, the
                    town was besieged and the suburbs reduced to ashes, and during the Thirty Years’
                    War it suffered six sieges and was four times occupied by hostile troops. Its
                    commerce was also greatly interrupted by the Seven Years’ War. The publishing
                    trade of Leipsic began to grow important towards the end of the 17th century,
                    when the severity of the censorship at Frankfort-on-the-Main caused many of its
                    booksellers to emigrate to Leipsic. The preliminary years of the French
                    Revolutionary wars were not unfavourable to the commerce of Leipsic, but in 1813
                    and 1814 the town suffered greatly. Its accession to the Zollverein in 1833 and
                    the establishment of the German system of railways (of which Leipsic is an
                    important centre) inaugurated a period of great prosperity, which has continued
                    to the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n450/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0450-0431"/> present day. The revolutionary riots of
                    1848-49 and the Prussian occupation in 1866-67 were merely passing shadows. In
                    1879 Leipsic acquired a new importance by becoming the seat of the supreme
                    courts of the German empire.</p>
                <p>The immediate neighbourhood of Leipsic has been the scene of numerous battles,
                    two of which are of more than ordinary importance, viz., the battle of
                    Breitenfeld in 1631 (vol. xi. p. 334), and the great battle of Leipsic, known in
                    Germany as the <hi rend="italic">Völkerschlacht,</hi> fought in 1813 between
                    Napoleon and the allied forces of Russia, Germany, and Austria.</p>
                <p>Towards the middle of last century Leipsic was the seat of the most influential
                    body of literary men in Germany, over whom <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Gottsched</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.</hi>), like his contemporary Samuel
                    Johnson in England, exercised a kind of literary dictatorship. Then, if ever,
                    Leipsic deserved the epithet of a “Paris in miniature” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Klein-Paris'),</hi> assigned to it by Goethe iu his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Faust.</hi> The young Lessing produced his first play in the Leipsic
                    theatre, and the university counts Goethe, KIopstock, Jean Paul Richter, the
                    Schlegels, Fichte, Schelling, and numerous other eminent writers and thinkers
                    among its quondam alumni. Schiller also resided for a time in Leipsic, and
                    Sebastian Bach, Hiller, and Mendelssohn all filled musical posts there. Among
                    the famous natives of the town are the philosopher Leibnitz and the composer
                    Wagner.</p>
