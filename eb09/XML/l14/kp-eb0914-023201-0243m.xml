                <p><label type="entry">LAMARTINE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphonse Marie Louis de Prat
                    de</hi></label> (1790-1869), poet, historian, and statesman, was born at Mâcon
                    on the 21st of October 1790, and died at Passy on the 1st of March 1869. The
                    family of Lamartine was good, and the title of Prat was taken from an estate in
                    Franche Comté. His father was imprisoned during the Terror, and only released
                    owing to the events of the 9th Thermidor. Subsequently the family returned to
                    the country. Lamartine’s early education was received from his mother. He was
                    sent to school at Lyons in 1805, but not being happy there was transferred to
                    the care of the Pères de la Foi at Belley, where he remained until 1809. For
                    some time afterwards he lived at home, reading romantic and poetical literature,
                    but in 1811, being then tv/enty years old, he set out on his travels for Italy,
                    where he seems to have sojourned for nearly two years. His family having been
                    steady royalists, he entered the Gardes du corps at the return of the Bourbons,
                    and during the Hundred Days he sought refuge first in Switzerland and then at
                    Aix en Savoie, where he fell in love, with abundant results of the poetical
                    kind. After Waterloo he returned to Paris, and mixed a good deal in society. In
                    1818-19 he revisited Switzerland, Savoy, and Italy, the death of his beloved
                    affording him new subjects for verse. He had now got together a considerable
                    body of poetry, and after some difficulties he got his first book, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meditations,</hi> published (1820). It was exceedingly popular,
                    and helped him to make a position. He had left the army for some time, and he
                    now entered the diplomatic service and was appointed secretary to the embassy at
                    Naples. On his way to his post he married at Geneva a young English lady,
                    Marianne Birch, who had both money and beauty (1823), and in the same year his
                    <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Méditations</hi> appeared. In 1824 he was
                    transferred from Naples to Florence, where he remained for fivef years. His <hi
                    rend="italic">Last Canto of Childe Harold</hi> appeared in 1825, and he had to
                    fight a duel with an Italian officer, Colonel Pepe, in consequence of a phrase
                    in it. The <hi rend="italic">Harmonies</hi><hi rend="italic">Politiques et
                    Religieuses</hi> appeared in 1829, when he had left Florence. Having refused an
                    appointment at Paris under the Polignac ministry (destined to be fatal to
                    legitimism), he went on a special mission to Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, who
                    was not yet king of the Belgians, but was talked of as king of Greece. The next
                    year he was elected to the Academy. Lamartine was in Switzerland, not in Paris,
                    at the time of the Revolution of July, and, though he put forth a pamphlet on
                    <hi rend="italic">Rational Policy,</hi> he did not take any active part in
                    politics. In 1832 he set out with his wife and daughter for Palestine, having
                    been unsuccessful in his candidature for a seat in the chamber. His daughter
                    Julia died at Beyrout, and <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0244-0233"/> before long he received the news of his election
                    by a constituency (Bergues) in the department of the Nord. He returned through
                    Turkey and Germany, and made his first speech shortly after the beginning of
                    1834. Thereafter he spoke constantly, and acquired considerable reputation as an
                    orator,—bringing out, moreover, many books in prose and verse. His Eastern
                    travels <hi rend="italic">(Souvenirs d'Orient)</hi> appeared in 1835, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Jocelyn</hi> in 1836, his <hi rend="italic">Chute</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">d'un</hi><hi rend="italic">Ange</hi> in 1838, and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Recueillements,</hi> the last remarkable volume of his poetry, in
                    1839. As the reign of Louis Philippe went on, Lamartine, who had previously been
                    a liberal royalist, something after the fashion of Chateaubriand, became more
                    and more democratic in his opinions. He set about his greatest prose work, the
                    <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Girondins,</hi> which at first appeared periodically, and was published as a
                    whole in 1847. Like many other French histories, it was a pamphlet as well as a
                    chronicle, and the subjects of Lamartine’s pen became his models in politics. At
                    the revolution of February Lamartine at once became one of the most important
                    personages in France. He was one of the first to declare for a provisional
                    government, and became a member of it himself, with the post of minister for
                    foreign affairs. He was elected for the new constituent assembly in ten
                    different departments, and was chosen one of the five members of the Executive
                    Committee. For a few months indeed Lamartine, who for nearly sixty years had
                    been a distinguished man of letters, an official of inferior rank in diplomacy,
                    and an eloquent but unpractical speaker in parliament, became one of the
                    foremost men in Europe. His own inexperience in the routine work of government,
                    the utterly unpractical nature of his colleagues and of the constitution which
                    they endeavoured to carry out, and the turbulence of the Parisian mob proved
                    fatal to his chances. During his brief tenure of office Lamartine gave some
                    proofs of statesmanlike ability, notably in his reply to the deputation of
                    United Irishmen who visited him in the hope that the new French democracy would
                    take up the old hatred of the republic against England; and his eloquence was
                    repeatedly called into requisition to pacify the Parisians. But no one can
                    permanently carry on the government of a great country by speeches from the
                    balcony of a house in the capital, and Lamartine found himself in a dilemma. So
                    long as he held aloof from Ledru-Rollin and the more radical of his colleagues,
                    the disunion resulting weakened the Government; as soon as he effected an
                    approximation to them, the middle classes, who more in France than any where
                    else were and are the arbiters of Governments, fell off from him. The quelling
                    of the insurrection of the 15th May was his last successful act. A month later
                    the renewal of active disturbances brought on the fighting of June, and
                    Lamartine’s influence was extinguished in favour of Cavaignac. There is hardly
                    another instance on record of so sudden an elevation and so rapid a fall. Before
                    February in 1848 Lamartine was, as has been said, a private person of talent and
                    reputation; after June in the same year he was once more the same, except that
                    his chance of political pre eminence was gone. He had been tried and found
                    wanting, having neither the virtues nor the vices of his situation. In January
                    1849, though he was nominated for the presidency, only a few thousand votes were
                    given to him, and three months later he was not even elected to the legislative
                    assembly.</p>
                <p>The remaining story of Lamartine’s life is somewhat melancholy. He had never been
                    a rich man, nor had he been a saving one, and during his period of popularity
                    and office he had incurred great expenses. He now set to work to repair his
                    fortune by unremitting literary labour. He brought out in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Presse</hi> a series of <hi rend="italic">Confidences,</hi> and somewhat later
                    a kind of autobiography, entitled <hi rend="italic">Raphael,</hi> which treated
                    his own experiences in romantic fashion. He began and finished several
                    historical works of more or less importance, the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    the Revolution of</hi> 1848, <hi rend="italic">The History of the Restoration,
                    The History of Turkey, The History of Russia,</hi> besides a very large number
                    of small biographical and miscellaneous works. In 1858 a subscription was opened
                    for his benefit. Two years afterwards, following the example of Chateaubriand,
                    he supervised an elaborate edition of his own works in forty-one volumes. This
                    occupied five years, and while he was engaged on it his wife died (1863). He was
                    now a man of more than seventy years old; his powers had deserted him, and even
                    if they had not the public taste had entirely changed, and was no longer
                    disposed to welcome or enjoy his sentimental fashion of handling prose and
                    poetry. His efforts had not succeeded in placing him in a position of comfort
                    and independence; and at last, in 1867, the Government of the empire (from which
                    he had perforce stood aloof, though he never considered it necessary to adopt
                    the active protesting attitude of Quinet and Victor Hugo) came forward to his
                    assistance, a vote of twenty thousand pounds being proposed in April of that
                    year for his benefit by M. Emile Ollivier. In no other country than France would
                    this have been anything but creditable to both parties, for Lamartine, both as a
                    distinguished man of letters and as a past servant of the state, had every claim
                    to the bounty of his country. But the bitter party feeling which animated the
                    later years of the reign of Napoleon III. made the grant something of a party
                    matter, and Lamartine was reproached for accepting it by the extreme republicans
                    and irreconcilables. He did not enjoy it long, dying, as has been said, on the
                    1st of March 1869, two years before the collapse of the empire.</p>
                <p>As a statesman Lamartine was placed during his brief tenure of office in a
                    position from which it would have been almost impossible for any man who was not
                    prepared and able to play the dictator to emerge with credit. At no time in
                    history, not even in the great revolution of sixty years earlier, were
                    unpractical crotchets so rife in the heads of men as in 1848, and at no time was
                    there such an absence of what may be called backbone in a nation as then in
                    France. But Lamartine could hardly have guided the ship of state safely even in
                    much calmer weather. Personally he was amiable and even estimable, the chief
                    fault of his character being vanity and an incurable tendency towards theatrical
                    elΓect, which makes his travels, memoirs, and other personal records as well as
                    his historical works radically untrustworthy. Nor does it appear that he had any
                    settled political ideas. He was first an ardent legitimist, then a liberal
                    royalist, then a constitutionalist of an indefinite type, then a republican; and
                    it does not appear that any of these 1)hases was the result of reasoned
                    conviction, but rather of a vague ûnd of sentiment and of the contagion of
                    popular and prevalent ideas. In regard to money he was entirely disinterested,
                    never obtaining or seeking any lucrative office. That he was quite so
                    disinterested in the matter of personal vanity and ambition cannot perhaps be
                    safely affirmed. He did good by moderating the revolutionary and destructive
                    ardour of the Parisian populace in 1848; but he had been perhaps more
                    responsible than any other single person for bringing about the events of that
                    year by the vague and frothy republican declamation of his Histoire des
                    Girondins. Altogether little more can be said of his political career than that
                    he was the most striking if not the most successful instance of the French
                    system, which has prevailed since the downfall of the first empire, of making
                    literary success a direct road to political eminence.</p>
                <p>More must be said of his literary position. Lamartine had the advantage of coming
                    at a time when the literary field, at least in the departments of belles
                    lettres, was almost empty. The feeble school of descriptive writers, epic poets
                    of the extreme decadence, fabulists, and miscellaneous verse-makers which the
                    empire had nourished could satisfy no one, though its members still continued
                    with unceasing fidelity to copy themselves and their models. Madame de Stael was
                    dead; Chateaubriand, though alive, was something of a classic, and had not
                    effected a full revolution. Lamartine did not himself go the complete length of
                    the romantic revival, but he went far in that direction. He availed himself of
                    the reviving interest in legitimism and Catholicism which was represented by
                    Bonald and Joseph &lt;le Maistre, of the nature worship of Rousseau and
                    Bernardin de St Pierre, of the sentimentalism of Madame de Stael, of the
                    mediaevalism and the romance of Chateaubriand and Scott, of the maladie du
                    siècle of Chateaubriand and Byron. Perhaps if his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n245/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0245-0234"/> matter be very closely analysed it will be found
                    that he added hardly anything of his own. But if the parts of the mixture were
                    like other things the mixture itself was not. It seemed indeed to the immediate
                    generation so original that tradition has it that the Méditations were refused
                    by a publisher because they were in none of the accepted styles. They appeared,
                    as has been said, in 1820, that is to say, when Lamartine was nearly thirty
                    years old. The best of them and the best thing that Lamartine ever did is the
                    famous Lac, describing his return to the little mountain tarn of Le Bourget
                    after the death of his mistress, with whom he had visited it in other days. The
                    verse is exquisitely harmonious, the sentiments conventional but refined and
                    delicate, the imagery well chosen and gracefully expressed. There is indeed an
                    unquestionable want of vigour, but to readers of that day the want of vigour was
                    entirely compensated by the presence of freshness and grace. Lamartine’s chief
                    misfortune in poetry was that not only was his note a somewhat weak one, but
                    that he could strike but one. The four volumes of the Méditations, the
                    Harmonies, and the Recueillements, which contained the prime of his verse, are
                    perhaps the most monotonous reading to be found anywhere in work of equal bulk
                    by a poet of equal talent. They contain nothing but meditative lyrical pieces,
                    almost any one of which is typical of the whole, though there is of course
                    considerable variation of merit. The two narrative poems which succeeded the
                    early lyrics, Jocelyn and the Chute d <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> un Ange,
                    were, according to Lamartine’s original plan, parts of a vast ‘ ‘ Epic of the
                    Ages,” some further fragments of which survive, especially one of not a little
                    merit which was published four years after the author’s death in company with
                    some youthful attempts at the classical tragedy and a few miscellanea. Jocelyn
                    had at one time more popularity in England than most French verse. La Chute d'un
                    Ange, in which the Byronic influence is more obvious than in any other of
                    Lamartine’s works, is more ambitious in theme and less regulated by scrupulous
                    conditions of delicacy in handling than most of its author’s poetry. It does,
                    however, little more than prove that such audacities were not for him.</p>
                <p>As a prose writer Lamartine was, as may be seen from what has been said (and many
                    of his works have not been mentioned), very fertile. His characteristics in his
                    prose fiction and descriptive work are not very different from those of his
                    poetry. He is always and everywhere sentimental, though very frequently, as in
                    his shorter prose tales (The Stone Mason of St Point, Graziella, &amp;c. ), he
                    is graceful as well as sentimental. In his histories, the style being one for
                    which he was radically unfitted, the effect is worse. It has been hinted that
                    Lamartine’s personal narratives are doubtfully trustworthy; indeed with regard
                    to his Eastern travels some of the episodes were stigmatized as mere inventions
                    by persons who had every reason to be well informed and none to bear false
                    witness. In his histories proper the special motive for
                    embellishment—falsification would be too rough a word—for the most part
                    disappears, but the habit of inaccuracy remains. Lamartine as an historian
                    belongs exclusively to the rhetorical school as distinguished from the
                    philosophical on the one hand and the documentary on the other.</p>
                <p>It is not surprising when these characteristics of Lamartine’s work are
                    appreciated, to find that his fame has declined with singular rapidity in
                    France. As a poet indeed he had lost his reputation many years before he died.
                    He was entirely eclipsed by the brilliant and vigorous school who succeeded him
                    with Victor Hugo at their head. It is possible that the Chute d’un Ange was an
                    effort to compete with them on their own ground; if so, it was an entire
                    failure. Lamartine’s power of initiative in poetry was very small, and the range
                    of poetic ground which he could cover strictly limited. He did not attempt the
                    great task of the day, the freeing of the Alexandrine from the restraints
                    imposed upon it, and the devising or reviving of new lyric metres to refresh and
                    invigorate French poetic style. He could only carry the picturesque
                    sentimentalism of Rousseau, Bernardin de St Pierre, and Chateaubriand a little
                    further, and clothe it in language and verse a little less antiquated than that
                    of Chênedollé and Millevoye. He has been said to be a French Cowper, and the
                    parallel holds good in respect of versification and of his relative position to
                    the more daringly innovating school that followed, though not in respect of
                    individual peculiarities. Lamartine in short occupied a kind of half-way house
                    between the 18th century and the Romantic movement, and he never got any
                    further. When a living English critic questioned·his importance in conversation
                    with Sainte-Beuve, the answer was, “He is important to us,” and it was a true
                    answer; but his importance is now chiefly historical, even to Frenchmen.</p>
                <p>The already mentioned edition is the most complete one of Lamartine, but there
                    are many issues of his separate works. Since his death, besides the poems
                    already mentioned, some Mémoires Inédits of his youth have been published, and
                    also two volumes of correspondence. (G. SA.)</p>
