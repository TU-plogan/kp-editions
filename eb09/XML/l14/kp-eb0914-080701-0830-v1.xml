                <p><label type="entry">LOIRE</label>, a department of central France, made up of the
                    old district of Forez and portions of Beaujolais and Lyonnais, all formerly
                    included in the province of Lyonnais, lies between 45° 15' and 46° 15' N. lat.
                    and between 3° 40' and 4° 45' E. long., and is bounded on theN. by the
                    department of Saône-et-Loire, on the E. by those of Rhone and Isère, on the S.
                    by Ardèche and Haute-Loire, and on the W. by Puy de Dôme and Allier. Its extreme
                    length is 78 miles from north-west to south-east, and its extreme breadth from
                    east to west is about 43 miles, the area being 1838 square miles. Until 1790 it
                    constituted a single department along with that of Rhone. About an eighth part
                    of the whole area belongs to the basin of the Rhone. The Loire, which has a fall
                    within the department from 1365 feet to 886 feet, traverses alternately a series
                    of narrow gorges and of broad plains, the beds of ancient lakes, including that
                    of Forez between St Rambert and Feurs, and, lower down, that of Roanne. Of its
                    affluents the most important are the Lignon du Nord, the beautiful valley of
                    which has been called “La Suisse Forezienne,” and the Aix on the left, and on
                    the right the Ondaine (on which stand the industrial towns of
                    Chambon-Feugerolles and Firminy), the Furens, and the Rhin. To the Rhone the
                    department contributes the Gier, upon which are situated the industrial towns of
                    St Chamond and Rive de Gier, and which forms a navigable channel to the Rhone at
                    Givors. From Mont Pilat descends the Deôme, in the valley of which the workshops
                    of Annonay begin. In the west are the Forez mountains, which separate the Loire
                    basin from that of the Allier; their highest point (Pierre sur Haute, 5381 feet)
                    is 12 miles west from Montbrison. They sink gradually towards the north, and are
                    successively called Bois Noirs (4239 feet), from their woods, and Monts de la
                    Madeleine (3600 to 1640 feet). In the east the Rhone and Loire basins are
                    separated by Mont Pilat (4705 feet) at the north extremity of the Cevennes, and
                    by the hills of Lyonnais, Tarare, Beaujolais, and Charolais, none of which rise
                    higher than 2950 or 3280 feet. The climate of the department varies according to
                    the elevation: on the heights it is cold and healthy, unwholesome in the marshy
                    plain of Forez, mild in the valley of the Rhone. The annual rainfall is 39 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 37 inches on the Forez mountains, but only 24 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 79 at Roanne. More than half of the area consists
                    of arable lands; one-seventh is occupied by forests, and one-seventh by
                    meadows.</p>
                <p>The plains of Forez and Roanne are the two most important agricultural districts,
                    but the total production of grain within the department is insufficient for the
                    requirements of the population. The pasture lands of Forez support a large
                    number of horned cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. Fairly good red wine is also
                    grown within the department; potatoes, leguminous plants, beetroot, hemp, and
                    colza are also cultivated. Poultry are reared, and bee-keeping is a considerable
                    industry. Among the hills replantation has been set on foot. The Bois Noir
                    forests yield good-sized pines and large quantities of wood for mining purposes.
                    The so-called Lyons chestnuts are to a large extent obtained from Forez; the
                    woods and pasture lands of Pilat yield medicinal plants, such as mint. The chief
                    wealth of the department, however, lies in the coal deposits in the St Etienne
                    basin, the second in importance in France. The basin, which stretches from
                    south-west to north-east between Firminy and Rive de Gier, is about 20 miles in
                    length and 5 in breadth. In 1881 the output amounted to 3,454,612 tons of coal
                    and anthracite, giving employment to 12,000 workmen below and 5000 above. The
                    presence of coal has naturally encouraged various forms of the metal-working
                    industries. At St Étienne there is a national factory of arms, in which as many
                    as 6000 have been employed; apart from other factories of the same kind carried
                    on by private individuals, the production of hardware occupies 7000 persons;
                    locks, common cutlery, chain cables for the mines, files, and nails are also
                    made. Cast steel is largely manufactured, the aggregate production of all sorts
                    of steel amounting in 1880 tβ 114,629 tons; the Loire workshops supply the
                    heaviest constructions required in naval architecture. The glass industry has
                    its centre at Rive de Gier. St Étienne employs more than 60,000 persons in the
                    fabrication of silk ribbons, to an annual value of £4,000,000; over and above
                    this must be reckoned the manufacture of elastic ribbons and laces, and the
                    dressing of raw silks. The arrondissement of Roanne manufactures cotton stuffs
                    upon 11,000 looms, each employing three persons. That of Montbrison produces
                    table linen. In the mountains between Haute-Loire and Puy de Dôme the women make
                    black laces and embroidery. The department has numerous flour-mills, paper
                    works, tanyards, boatbuilding yards, silk-spinning works, and velvet, plush, and
                    hat factories. There are three arrondissements—St Étienne, Montbrison, and
                    Roanne. The capital is St Étienne. The population, 290,903 in 1801, was 590,613
                    in 1876.</p>
