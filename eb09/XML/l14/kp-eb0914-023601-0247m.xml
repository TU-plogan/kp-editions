                    (1728-1777), physicist and mathematician, was born at Mulhausen, Alsace, August
                    29, 1728. He was the son of a tailor; and the slight elementary instruction he
                    obtained at the small free school of his native town was supplemented altogether
                    by his own private reading. Having cultivated a good style of penmanship, he
                    became book-keeper at Montbéliard ironworks, and subsequently (1745) secretary
                    to Professor Iselin, the editor of a newspaper at Basel, who three years later
                    recommended him as private tutor to the family of President A. von Salis of
                    Coire. Coming thus into virtual possession of a good library, Lambert had
                    peculiar opportunities for improving himself in his literary and scientific
                    studies. In 1759, after completing with his pupils a lengthened tour of two
                    years’ duration through Gδttingen, Utrecht, Paris, Marseilles, and Turin, he
                    resigned his &lt;utorship and settled at Augsburg. Munich, Erlangen, Coire, and
                    Leipsic became for brief successive intervals his home. Finally in 1764 he
                    removed to Berlin, where he received many favours at the hand of Frederick, was
                    elected a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences, and ultimately (1774)
                    undertook the editing of the astronomical almanac. On September 25, 1777, he
                    died of consumption, the natural result of a life spent in excessive application
                    to all kinds of mental labour. Seventeen hours dιily were devoted by him to
                    reading and writing; and, as might have been expected in the case of one who
                    wrote so much, many of his numerous publications are of little permanent
                    interest. Not a few, however, are very valuable, and show him to have been a man
                    of original and active mind with a singular facility in applying mathematics to
                    practical questions.</p>
                <p>Lambert’s most important work, Pyrometric (Berlin, 1779), is a systematic
                    treatise on heat, containing the records and full discussion of many of his own
                    experiments. Worthy of special notice also are Photometria, Augsburg, 1760;
                    Insigniores orbitae Cometarum proprietates, Augsburg, 1761; and Beiträge zum
                    Gebrauche der Mathematik und deren Anwendung, 4 vols., Berlin, 1765-72.</p>
                <p>The Memoirs of the Berlin Academy from 1761 to 1784 contain many of his papers,
                    which treat of such subjects as resistance of fluids, magnetism, comets,
                    probabilities, the problem of three bodies, meteorology, &amp;c. In the Acta
                    Helvetica (1752-60) and in the Nova Acta Erudita (1763-69) several of his
                    contributions appear. In Bode’s Jahrbuch (1776-80) he discusses nutation,
                    aberration of light, Saturn’s rings, and comets; in the Nova Acta Helvetica
                    (1787) he has a long paper “Sur le Son des Corps Elastiques”; in Bernoulli and
                    Hindenburg’s Magazin (1787-88) he treats of the roots of equations and of
                    parallel lines; and in Hindenburg’s Archives (1798-99) he writes on optics and
                    perspective. Many of these pieces were found among his effects after his death,
                    and published posthumously. Recognized as among the first mathematicians of his
                    day, he was also widely known for the universality and depth of his philological
                    and philosophical knowledge. The most valuable of his logical and philosophical
                    memoirs were published collectively in 2 vols., 1782. See Huber’s Lambert nach
