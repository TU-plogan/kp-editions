                    the wider application of the name, the whole series extending in a northeast and
                    south-west direction from the southern end of Kiushiu in Japan proper to the
                    north-east of Formosa. Within the northern group lies the intersection of 130°
                    E. long, and 30° N. lat.; and in the southern group that of 125° E. long, and
                    25° N. lat. The islands, however, to the north of 29° are not unfrequently
                    considered, by Europeans as well as Japanese, to belong in part to Japan proper,
                    and in part to constitute the separate group of the Linschotens, Shichi-to, or
                    Cecille Archipelago.</p>
                <p>The following, according to Doederlein, are the recognized subdivisions and areas
                    of the whole archipelago:—(1) <hi rend="italic">The Northern Islands</hi>
                    (attached to Satsuma or Kiushiu Osumi, 398 square miles): Tanega(189 square
                    miles), Make, Yakuno (172 square miles), Take, Yuo or Iwoga, Kuro, Kose or
                    Kowose, and Kuchino-Erabu or Nagarobe; (2) <hi rend="italic">Shichi-to</hi> (43
                    square miles): Kuchino, Gaza or Yebi, Naka-no (the largest, 13 square miles),
                    Hira or Fira, Suwase, Akuseki, Takara, and Yoko; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hokubn-Shoto</hi> (515 square miles): Oshima (302 square miles), Kagerurna or
                    Katona (40 square miles), Yoro, Uke or Uni, Kitai, Tokono or Kakirouma (92
                    square miles), Naka Erabu, and Yoron or Yori; (4) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chubu-Shoto</hi> (592 square miles): Tori or I wo, Eheya or Tebeya, Isona, lye,
                    Awakuni or Agunyeh, Tonashi, Kuιne, Kerama or Amakirima, and Okinawa (520 square
                    miles); (5) <hi rend="italic">Nambu-Shoto</hi> or the Meiakoshima Group (315
                    square miles): Miyako orTy-pin-san (57 square miles), Misuna and Tarama,
                    Ishigaki or Pat-chung-san (104 square miles), Take⅛oma or Robertson Island,
                    0hama or Kubah, Kuro or Baugh, Iriomoto Nishiomoto or Koo-Kien-San, Aragusuku or
                    Chung-chi, Hateruma or Hasyokan, Yonakuni or Kumi.</p>
                <p>The area of the Lew-chews proper is thus 1423 square miles, that of the whole
                    chain 1864 square miles. The largest islands are Okinawa (often called Great
                    Lew-chew) and Oshima, the former being also the political centre of the whole
                    archipelago. The Lew-chews consist in the main of crystalline rocks—gneiss,
                    hornblende, and granite —upheaved at a very remote date, and only partially
                    covered by severely weathered sedimentary strata seldom left in their original
                    horizontal position. Coralline limestone is found in great abundance even on the
                    tops of the hills, and the coasts are often fringed by coral reefs. In <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n509/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0509-0490"/> Okinawa a soft argillaceous rock occupies a large
                    part of the surface. Though the existence of Sulphur Island with its smoking
                    crater towards the north-west shows that volcanic activity is still going on at
                    no great distance, the main islands at least seem to bear no trace of recent
                    subterranean disturbance. Their surface is very irregular: Okinawa consists for
                    the most part of a succession of rounded swelling hills, 300 to 500 feet in
                    height, broken towards the centre by more precipitous crags, and Oshima may be
                    best described as a cluster of steep mountains reaching in Yowangatake a height
                    of about 2100 feet. Of the many streams a few attain considerable dimensions,
                    and serve to carry the timber from the highlands; and all round the coasts are
                    excellent harbours. The mildness and humidity of climate, which is the natural
                    consequence of the geographical position of the archipelago, is further enhanced
                    by the neighbourhood of the Kuro-Siwo or Pacific gulf-stream. Snow never falls
                    on the tops even of the highest hills; but at the same time even in summer the
                    heat is seldom extreme. Three days seldom pass without rain; sudden downpours
                    are not unfrequent, and wet weather often lasts for several days on end. The
                    boundary between the Palaeoarctic and Oriental regions passes to the north of
                    Oshima, which is the northern limit of many southern forms at once of vegetable
                    and animal life both on land and sea. Sago trees and other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cycadaceae,</hi> banyans, and pine trees (resembling the cedar of Lebanon) are
                    abundant, and the natives, who succeed well both as farmers and as gardeners,
                    grow wheat, rice, bananas, tarro <hi rend="italic">(Colocasia),</hi> sweet
                    potatoes, maize, millet, sugar-cane, eggplants, &lt;fcc. There is a small but
                    excellent breed of cattle (usually black); and ponies, pigs, goats,and poultry
                    are kept.</p>
                <p>Part of the population of the northern Lew-chews is evidently Japanese, but the
                    aboriginal and preponderating element is of quite another type, in some points
                    similar to the Ainos. The striking features, according to Doederlein, are a
                    comparatively narrow face ending in a pointed chin, large European-looking eyes,
                    thin lips, thin and rather convex nose, strongly developed beard, and a
                    luxuriant growth of hair over breast, arms, and legs. The women are (or were,
                    for the practice is forbidden by the Japanese) accustomed to tattoo the back of
                    the hands with a special pattern in a dark blue colour. Though closely allied to
                    Japanese, the native language is a genuinely independent form, containing
                    obsolete words only found in the ancient monuments of Japanese literature, and
                    showing the greatest resemblance to the Satsuma dialect. The use of Japanese and
                    Chinese by the learned has prevented it being used for literary purposes; and
                    the version of the Bible prepared by the missionary Dr Bettelheim (sent out in
                    1845) is really in Japanese. There was neither printing press nor bookshop in
                    the islands as late as 1876 (see G. W. Aston in <hi rend="italic">Church Miss.
                    TntcU.,</hi> 1879). The lowest class of the population have neither civil rights
                    nor personal freedom; next in order come the peasants, who rent the land from
                    the Government; and above all are the literati or governing class. Rank is
                    indicated by various symbols, particularly by the kind of metal of which the
                    hair-pins are made, and by the colour of the robes and head-dress. Confucianism
                    and Buddhism seem to have had considerable influence on the upper classes at
                    least in Okinawa; in Oshima there is neither temple nor priest, and the people
                    say they pray to no god. The sole objects of worship (if worship it be) are the
                    manes of one’s immediate ancestors. To the dead great respect is shown in both
                    islands,—the wealthier people building on the hillsides large and handsome
                    tombs, which from a distance look like dwelling-houses. The body is buried in a
                    coffin in a sitting posture, and after seven years the bones are collected and
                    placed in an urn.</p>
                <p>The population of Okinawa was estimated by the American expedition at from
                    150,000 to 200,000. Doederlein was informed by the officials that Amami Oshima
                    contained 50,000 souls, but thinks 30,000 a more probable conjecture. Besides
                    Napa or Napa-Kiang the capital, and Shui the royal residence, there are some
                    thirty-six towns in Okinawa, with about 6000 inhabitants each; in the other
                    island Nase the chief town (comprising Itsubemura and Kanekumura) has not more
                    than 2000, and only five or six of the other villages exceed 500.</p>
                <p>Though Captain Broughton visited Napa in 1797, it was not till the Alceste and
                    Lyra expedition in 1816-17 that detailed information about the Lew-ehews was
                    obtained. The people at that time showed a curious mixture of courtesy and
                    shyness. Her British Majesty’s ship “Sphinx” visited Okinawa in 1852; and the
                    American expedition under Commodore Perry (1852-54) added very largely to our
                    knowledge of the island, and concluded a treaty of friendship with its
                    Government, securing for the United States the right of using Tamui near Napa as
                    a coaling depot.</p>
                <p>Theen-sun, “Grandson of Heaven,” is the mythical founder of the Lew-chew
                    monarchy. Towards the close of the 12th century, his descendants were driven
                    from the throne by a usurper Le-yung; but the old national party soon found a
                    victorious leader in Sun-thien-ong son of Tametomo, a member of the famous
                    Yoritomo family, who, having been expelled from Japan, had come to Lew-chew and
                    married the youngest sister of Ansoo, governor of Oho-prto. The introduction of
                    the arts of reading and writing are assigned to Sun-thien-ong’s reign. Chinese
                    invasions of Lew-chew may be traced back to the 6th century, but they did not
                    result in annexation; and it was Hung-woo, the founder of the Ming dynasty, who
                    first in 1395 obtained from the Lew-chew ruler recognition of Chinese supremacy.
                    The earliest notice of intercourse with Japan belongs to the year 1441, when a
                    voluntary gift of copper money (at that time extremely scarce in Japan) was made
                    by the Lew-chewans to the tenno Go-Hanazono; but for a long time afterwards the
                    relations of the two powers continued to be of the friendliest description. In
                    the beginning of the 17th century the Lew-chew minister Yana, anxious to gain
                    favour with the Chinese Government, persuaded his king to break off all
                    connexion with Japan, and when the prince of Satsuma sent to remonstrate against
                    this course of conduct his envoys were maltreated. For this insult the prince
                    exacted signal vengeance. With the permission of his liege lord he invaded the
                    islands with 8000 men, took the capital by storm, and captured the king and
                    carried him off to Kagoshima. A few years later the unfortunate Seang-leng was
                    restored to his throne, but only on condition that he and his successors should
                    receive reinvestiture on the accession of each new shogun, and that each new
                    king of Lew-chew should send an embassy to Yedo. The Lew-chewans nevertheless
                    continued to pay tribute to China, and Chinese commissioners were despatched to
                    attend the installation of their kings. Particular interest in the islands was
                    displayed by the emperor Kang-hi, whose memory is still cherished by the natives
                    as that of a great benefactor; he built them a temple in honour of Confucius,
                    founded a Chinese school, and, when they were in great distress through
                    hurricanes, plague, and famine, contributed liberally for their relief.
                    Su-pao-Koang, from whose report was derived the first information about the
                    islands which found its way to Europe, was Kang-hi’s commissioner in the year
                    1719. When in 1859 the house of Seang became extinct in the direct line,
                    Sho-tai, a descendant of Satto, governor of Urasoyé, was called to the throne.
                    On the establishment of the imperial authority of the mikado he received the
                    title of sovereign prince of Lew-chew; but at the same time his territory was
                    declared first a <hi rend="italic">hαn</hi> or feudal dependency and afterwards
                    a <hi rend="italic">ken</hi> or province of the Japanese monarchy. In 1873,
                    according to a custom with which the lords of Satsuma had not interfered, the
                    people of Lew-chew sent to pay their biennial tribute to China. This was
                    forbidden by the mikado; and it was in vain that they urged—“For five hundred
                    years China has protected us: we regard China as our father, and Japan as our
                    mother.” The Japanese Government insisted on its exclusive rights, and undertook
                    to settle the difficulty with China. Its claims were formally recognized by the
                    treaty of Peking in 1874, and the islands are treated as an integral part of the
                    empire.</p>
