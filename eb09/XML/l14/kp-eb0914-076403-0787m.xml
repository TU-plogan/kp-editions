                    Epicnemidii, so called from Mount Cnemis, and the southern Locri Opuntii, whose
                    chief town was Opus; but the name Opuntii is applied to the whole district by
                    Thucydides, Herodotus, &amp;c. Homer knows no distinction of tribes among the
                    Locri. They were considered by Aristotle to be a Lelegian tribe; but they became
                    Hellenized at an early time, and rank in Homer along with the other Greek tribes
                    before Troy. Their national hero is Ajax Oileus, who often appears on coins. The
                    Locri Ozolae on the Corinthian Gulf were a rude and barbarous race who make no
                    appearance in Greek history till the Peloponnesian War. It is said that they
                    separated from the eastern Locri four generations before the Trojan war, but
                    Homer does not mention them. The most probable view is that the Locri were once
                    a single race spread from sea to sea, that subsequent immigrations forced them
                    into two separate districts, and that the eastern Locri advanced with the growth
                    of civilization, while the remote Ozolae remained ignorant and barbarous.</p>
                <p>A colony of Locrians, probably Opuutians, though Strabo expressly calls them
                    Ozolae, settled at the southwest extremity of Italy about the end of the 8th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> They are often called Locri Epizephyrii
                    from the promontory Zephyrion 15 miles south of the city. The earliest and most
                    famous event recorded in the history of the Italian Locri is the legislation of
                    Zaleucus about the middle of the 8th century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> The
                    Locri boasted that Zaleucus was the first of the Greeks to promulgate a written
                    code of laws. A body of laws under his name existed in the city throughout the
                    historical period, but the name of Zaleucus is almost as much surrounded with
                    legend as that of Lycurgus. The Locrians are said to have defeated the people of
                    Crotona in a great battle at the Sagras, perhaps some time in the 6th century
                    B,c., and in this flourishing period they founded colonies along the south coast
                    of the peninsula. Their nearest neighbour was Rhegium, and the continual wars
                    that raged between the two cities often drew other states into their quarrels.
                    They sent ships to aid Sparta in the Lacedaemonian war. They were allied with
                    the elder Dionysius of Syracuse, who gave them great accessions of territory
                    (389-88 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>); the younger Dionysius ruled them as
                    tyrant (356 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.).</hi> They admitted a Roman garrison
                    before the expedition of Pyrrhus, but sided against the Romans with him and with
                    Hannibal (216 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> The town was finally captured by
                    Scipio (205 B.C.). From this time we hear little of Locri. It seems still to
                    have existed in the 6th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> but in the
                    Middle Ages it had disappeared entirely. The site and remains have been
                    described by the Due de Luynes <hi rend="italic">(Ann. Inst. Arch.,</hi> ii.).
                    It possessed a famous temple of Proserpine. The town is celebrated by Pindar,
