                        Lancaster</hi></label>, a maritime county in the north-west of England, lies
                    between 54° 40' and 55° 33' N. lat., and between 3° 15' and l <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 0</hi> 58' W. long. A detached portion in the north,
                    known as Furness, is situated between Cumberland and Westmoreland. The remainder
                    of the county, separated from Furness by Morecambe Bay, is bounded N. by
                    Westmore-lιnd, E. by Yorkshire, S. by Cheshire, and W. by the Irish Sea, which
                    forms also the southern boundary of Furness. The outline of the county is
                    irregular. Its greatest length is 76 miles; south of the Ribble the average
                    breadth is about 40 miles, while to the north it is only about 10 miles. The
                    total area is 1,207,926 acres, or 1887 square miles. With the exception of a
                    narrow tract of country along the s?uth coast, the Furness division consists of
                    hilly moorlands, a continuation of the Cumberland mountains, intersected by deep
                    valleys. The highest summits of this region are Coniston Old Man (2633 feet) and
                    Seathwaite Fells (2537 feet). A similar elevated district, forming part of a
                    mountainous chain stretching from the Scottish border, runs along the whole
                    eastern boundary of the main portion of the county, and to the south of the
                    Ribble occupies more than half the area, stretching west nearly to Liverpool.
                    The moorlands in the southern districts are covered chiefly with heather.
                    Towards the north the scenery is frequently picturesque and beautiful, the green
                    rounded elevated ridges being separated by pleasant cultivated valleys
                    variegated by woods and watered by rivers. None of the summits of the range
                    within the boundaries of Lancashire attain an elevation of 2000 feet, the
                    highest being Blackstone Edge (1323 feet), Pendle Hill (1831 feet), and
                    Boalsworth Hill (1700 feet).</p>
                <p>Along the sea-coast from the Mersey to Lancaster there is a continuous plain
                    occupied at one time by peat mosses, many of which have, however, been
                    reclaimed. The largest is Chat Moss between Liverpool and Manchester. In some
                    instances these mosses have exhibited the phenomenon of a moving bog. A large
                    district in the north belonging to the duchy of Lancaster was at one time
                    occupied by forests, but these have wholly disappeared. The coast is very
                    irregular in outline, the principal inlets being the estuaries of the Mersey and
                    Ribble, Lancaster Bay, and Morecambe Bay. To the south of Furness, between
                    Morecambe Bay and the estuary of the Duddon, there is a small group of islands,
                    the largest of which is Walney, 9 miles long, and with a breadth varying from a
                    quarter to three-quarters of a mile. The principal river is the Mersey, which
                    divides the county from Cheshire, and flowing by Stockport and Warrington opens
                    into a fine estuary before reaching the sea at Liverpool. It drains an area of
                    580 square miles, and receives on its north bank the Trwell and the Sankey. For
                    large vessels it is navigable to Warrington, and for smaller vessels to
                    Stockport, the Irwell being navigable to Manchester. The Ribble, which rises in
                    the mountains of the West Riding, forms for a few miles the boundary between
                    Lancashire and Yorkshire, and then flows south-west to Preston, receiving the
                    Hodder from the north and the Calder and Darwen from the south. The Wyre enters
                    Morecambe Bay at Fleetwood. The Lune rises in Westmoreland, and falls into the
                    sea at Lancaster Bay. The Winster separating LancashireandWestmoreland,the Leven
                    from Lake Windermere, the Crake from Lake Coniston, all flow south into
                    Morecambe Bay; and the Dudd∩n forming the boundary of the county with
                    Westmoreland enters the Irish Channel. Windermere, the largest and most
                    beautiful of English lakes, is partly included in the county. Some miles to the
                    west and parallel with Windermere is Coniston Lake, 5∣ miles long and 2 miles
                    broad; and between the two larger lakes is Esthwaite Water, 12 miles in length
                    by half a mile in breadth.</p>
                <p>About the middle of last century the Sankey Canal, 10 miles long, the first in
                    Britain, was constructed to bring coals from St Helens to Liverpool. Shortly
                    afterwards the duke of Bridgewater projected the great canal, completed in 1761,
                    from Manchester across the Irwell to Worsley. The Leeds and Liverpool Canal,
                    begun in 1770, connects Liverpool and other important towns with Leeds by a
                    circuitous route of 130 miles. The other principal canals are the Rochdale
                    Canal, the Manchester Canal, between Manchester and Huddersfield, the Lancaster
                    Canal, and the Ulverstone Canal.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology and Minerals.—</hi> The greater part of Furness is
                    occupied by slaty Silurian rocks belonging to the mountain formations of
                    Cumberland and Westmoreland. This is mingled occasionally with Carboniferous
                    Limestone, and in the lower region along the coast there is an Old Red Sandstone
                    district and also a very rich deposit of iron ore. To the north of the Lune the
                    country is occupied with Carboniferous Limestone. Near the sea are some low Old
                    Red Sandstone cliffs, and the formation is also seen on the borders of
                    Westmoreland, near Kirkby Lonsdale. South of the Lune the greater part of the
                    higher ground is formed of Millstone Grit. Along the valley of the Mersey there
                    is an extensive bed of New Red Sandstone, containing rocksalt, and the same
                    formation occurs along the western boundaries of the county, but it is covered
                    for the most part by the glacial drift deposits, which occupy nearly all the low
                    ground, and in some cases fill up the valleys between the mountains. The
                    coal-field of Lancashire occupies an irregular area of 217 square miles lying
                    between the Ribble and the Mersey, its length being about 30 miles and its
                    average breadth about 7 miles. The field extends into Cheshire and North Wales,
                    and is separated from the Yorkshire field by the Millstone Grit which crops out
                    beneath the Coal-measures. To the south of the Lune, near Ingleton, there is
                    also a small coal-field which extends into Yorkshire. The upper Coal-measures
                    consist chiefly of shales, sandstones, and limestones, with a bed of blackband
                    ironstone. The middle measures contain a considerable variety of workable seams,
                    the lowest being very valuable, and there is an important mine of cannel coal.
                    The lower measure consists of flags, shales, and thin seams of coal, with
                    gannister floors and roofs of slate. This coal is extensively mined in the
                    mountain districts to the northeast of the bed. The coal district is traversed
                    by immense dislocations which divide the field into several belts. Nearly all
                    the marine fossils obtained are molluscs allied to <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The available coal supply of Lancashire is estimated at 5,165,000,000 tons. The
                    amount raised in 1852 was 8,225,000 tons; in 1871 it was 13,851,000 tons, but

                    reached 19,120,294 tons. The amount of coal carried from Lancashire is about
                    11,000,000 tons, of which about 7,000,000 tons are shipped. The produce of the
                    West Lancashire coal-field in 1880 was—coal 9,600,436 tons, fireclay 18,960
                    tons, and iron 1540 tons, the latter being obtained from the rubbish sent out of
                    the pits. The coal is produced in the neighbourhood of Wigan, St Helens, and
                    Prescot, and the fireclay in the St Helens district. In the North and East
                    Lancashire district 9,519,858 tons of coal were raised, 110,379 tons of
                    fireclay, 4830 of alum shale, and 579 of copperas lumps. Through the kindness of
                    Mr Joseph Dickinson, inspector of mines for this district, we are enabled to
                    give the produce of the field in seven principal divisions, viz.:—(l)the small
                    uetached field of Lunedale (lowerseries of measures), coal 410 tons; (2) the
                    Burnley coal-field (lower and middle series), coal 1,036,015, fireclay 15,279;
                    (3) an adjoining field lying south-east of a line drawn from Chorley to
                    Blackburn (lower series), coal 388,274, fireclay 45,749; (4) a group lying
                    further south-east and extending to Bacup, Rochdale, and Littleborough (lower
                    series), coal 309,388, fireclay 13,298; (5) the part west of Chorley and
                    southwards adjoining the Wigan coal-field (lower series), coal 2,030,027,
                    copperas lumps 579; (6) the part east of the former division (middle and upper
                    series), coal 4,789,495, fireclay 19,217; (7) the extreme south-east part, south
                    of Rochdale, and east of the city of Manchester (lower and middle series), coal
                    966,249, fireclay 16,836, alum shale 4830. Rich red haematitic iron is obtained
                    in great abundance in the district of Furness, the quantity raised in 1871 being
                    931,048 tons, and in 1880 it was 1,188,543 tons. Only a small quantity of
                    sulphur-ore is raised, 2000 tons in 1879, valued at £900. Some copper is
                    obtained in the Furness district, but the total quantity of ore raised in 1880
                    was only 442 tons. There are in various districts of the county large quarries
                    for freestone and flagstone, the quantity raised in 1880 being 2404 tons. A fine
                    blue slate is obtained in Furness. As much as 2973 tons of hydraulic limestone
                    was in 1880 dug out of the Ardwiek mine near Manchester. There is a mine of
                    native oxide of iron at Warton, near Carnfortb, from which, in 1880, 189 tons
                    were obtained. Lead-ore and zinc ore are being explored between Clitheroe and
                    Chatbum, and rocksalt at Preesal near Fleetwood.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate in the hilly
                    districts is frequently cold, but in the more sheltered parts lying to the south
                    and west it is mild and genial. From its westerly situation and the attraction
                    of the mountains there is a very high rainfall, an average of nearly 50 inches
                    annually being reached in the mountainous districts, while the average for the
                    other districts is about 35. The soil after reclamation and drainage is fertile;
                    but, as it is for the most part a strong clayey loam, it requires a large amount
                    of labour. In some districts it is more of a peaty nature, and in the Old Red
                    Sandstone districts of the Mersey there is a tract of light sandy loam, which is
                    easily worked, and well adapted for wheat and potatoes. A considerable portion
                    of country is still under peat, but the reclamations within late years have been
                    very large, and at the same time great advances have been made in the methods of
                    culture. In some districts the ground has been rendered unfit for agricultural
                    operations by the rubbish from coalpits. A very large area is in pasturage, and
                    dairy farming, owing to the populous character of the district, is very
                    common.</p>

                <p>The county in 1872-73 was divided among 88,735 proprietors, possessing 1,011,769
                    acres, with an annual valuation of £13,878,277. Of the owners 76,177, or 87 per
                    cent., possessed less than 1 acre, and the average value, including minerals,
                    was£13, 14s. 4d. peracre. Nineteen proprietors owned upwards of 5000 acres, the
                    largest proprietor being the earl of Derby, who possessed 47,269 acres, with a
                    rental of £156,735. Among other large proprietors are the duke of Bridgewater’s
                    trustees, the duke of Devonshire, the Marquis de Casteja, the earl of Stamford
                    and Warrington, the earl of Wilton, the earl of Sefton, Lord Lilford, and Lord
                    Skelmersdale.</p>
                <p>Manufactures.—Lancashire is the principal seat of the cotton manufacture, not
                    only in England, but in the world. The history of the industry in the county,
                    and statistical details regarding it, will be found in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Cotton,</hi> vol. vi. 489 sq. In 1879 the total number of
                    factories was close on 2000, and the number of persons employed in these was
                    nearly 370,000. The centre of the industry is Manchester and the neighbouring
                    towns, especially Oldham. Previous to the American war it employed nearly
                    100,000 more persons than at present. The woollen, silk, and linen manufactures
                    employed in 1879 about 50,000 persons. There are a great variety of industries
                    dependent on these staple manufactures, such as bobbin making, the preparation
                    of dyes, calico printing, and the manufacture of machinery and of steam engines.
                    Barrow-in-Furness is noted for the manufacture of iron and steel. Warrington has
                    a large trade in sole leather. St Helens is celebrated for its crown, sheet, and
                    plate glass, and Prescot for its watches. Chemicals are largely manufactured in
                    several towns. The principal seaports are Liverpool, Barrow, Ulverstone,
                    Lancaster, Fleetwood, and Preston, to the separate articles on which the reader
                    is referred for particulars regarding shipping, trade, and shipbuilding. The
                    principal watering-places are Blackpool, Lytham, Morecambe, and Southport.</p>
                <p>Railways.—The London and North-Western, Midland, and Lancashire and Yorkshire
                    Railways pass through the county, and it is intersected in all directions by a
                    network of branch lines.</p>
                <p>Population and Administration.—The population in 1881 was more than five times as
                    great as in 1801. In that year it was 673,486, or only a little more than the
                    population of Liverpool at the present time. In 1861 it amounted to 2,429,440,
                    in 1871 to 2,819,495, and in 1881 to 3,454,225, of whom 1,667,979 were males and
                    1,786,246 females. The population of the northern parliamentary division was
                    273,417, of the north-eastern division 238,544, of the south-eastern 534,963,
                    and of the south-western division 482,148, —the population outside the limits of
                    parliamentary boroughs being thus 1,529,072, and that of the parliamentary
                    boroughs 1,925,153. Liverpool (552,425) is represented by three members,
                    Manchester (population of municipal borough 341,508, of parliamentary 393,676)
                    by three members, Salford (176,233) by two, Oldham (mun. 111,343, pari. 152,511)
                    by two, Bolton (mun. 105,422, pari. 105,973) by two, Preston (mun. 96,532, pari.
                    93,707) by two, Blackburn (mun. 104,012, pari. 100,618) by two, Wigan (48,196)
                    by two, Burnley (mun. 58,882, pari. 63,502) by one, Rochdale (68,865) by one,
                    Bury (mun. 51,582, pari. 49,746) by one, Ashton-under-Lyne (mun. 37,027, pari.
                    43,389) by one, Warrington (mun. 41,456, pari. 45,257) by one, and Clitheroe
                    (mun. 10,177, pari. 14,463) by one. As each division of the county has also two
                    members, the total representation for the county is thirty-two members. The
                    parliamentary boroughs of Staleybridge and Stockport are chiefly in Cheshire.
                    The other principal municipal boroughs are Accrington (31,435),
                    Barrow-in-Furness (47,111), Blackpool (14,448), Bootle-cum-Linacre (27,112),
                    Heywood (23,050), Lancaster (20,724), Over Darwen (29,747), St Helens (57,234),
                    Southport (32,191), Swinton and Pendlebury (18,108), and Todmorden, chiefly in
                    Yorkshire (23,861). There are besides a large number of other towns of over
                    10,000 inhabitants. The county Eιlatine comprises six hundreds. It is attached
                    to the duchy of ancaster and so to the crown. It is in the northern circuit, and
                    assizes are held for North Lancashire at Lancaster, and for South <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0269-0254"/> Lancashire at Liverpool and Manchester. The
                    county has one court of quarter sessions, and is divided into twenty sessional
                    divisions. The city of Manchester and the boroughs of Bolton, Liverpool, and
                    Wigan have commissions of the peace and separate courts of quarter sessions; and
                    the boroughs of Ashton-under-Lyne, Blackburn, Bromley, Lancaster, Oldham,
                    Preston, Rochdale, Salford, and Warrington have commissions of the peace. There
                    are ten police divisions. Most of the municipal boroughs have their own police.
                    The county is chiefly in the diocese of Manchester, formed in 1847; but the
                    northern portion of Furness is in Carlisle, a portion formerly in Chester is now
                    part of the newly formed diocese of Liverpool, and a small portion adjoining
                    Yorkshire is in Ripon. The chancery of the duchy of Lancaster, still a crown
                    office, was at one time a court of appeal for the chancery of the county
                    palatine, but now even its jurisdiction in regard to the estates of the duchy is
                    merely nominal. The chancery of the county palatine has concurrent jurisdiction
                    with the High Court of Chancery in all matters of equity within the county
                    palatine, and independent jurisdiction in regard to a variety of other
                    matters.</p>
                <p>History and Antiquities. —Before the Roman invasion Lancashire formed part of the
                    extensive northern province of the Brigantes, of whose occupation a few names
                    and earthworks are the chief remains. The Romans held the district for th√ee
                    centuries and a half, and erected various camps or stations at Manchester,
                    Ribchester, Lancaster, Colne, &amp;c. They also constructed various roads, one
                    entering the county at Warrington, and passing almost north to Carlisle.
                    Manchester appears to have been the chief centre of this district, as the roads
                    branched out thence in every direction,—into Cheshire by Stockport, by
                    Stretford, and by Warrington, to Yorkshire by Littleborough or by Overborough
                    near Colne, by Ribchester to Lancaster, by Kirkham to the Wyre, and by
                    Westhaughton and Blackrod to Preston. The Roman remains found within the county
                    are thus summarized by Mr W. T. Watkin in.the Transactions of the Historic
                    Society of Lancashire and Cheshire for 1880, p. 89:—</p>
                <p>“Excluding perhaps Northumberland, I doubt whether any English county has
                    produced so many elaborate articles in the precious metals and in bronze of the
                    Roman period. The silver arm from Littleborough, the gold bullae from Manchester
                    and Overborough, the gold rings from Standish, the silver ⅛up from Emmott, the
                    rich ‘ find ’ of silver articles from walmersley, the bronze shield umbo from
                    Kirkham, and the beautiful helmet from Ribchester, with the gold cup from the
                    same place, form an almost unequalled collection of Britanno-Roman works of
                    art.”</p>
                <p>After the departure of the Romans Lancashire was included in the kingdom of
                    Strathclyde, which for some time retained its independence; but, although King
                    Arthur, according to some authorities, fought several battles against them on
                    the banks of the Douglas at Wigan, the Saxons gradually occupied the whole
                    county, and during the Heptarchy it formed part of the kingdom of Northumbria.
                    How extensive was their occupation may be judged of from the Saxon names of
                    towns and villages remaining to the present day. Towards the end of the 9th
                    century, however, the Danes invaded and permanently settled in the Furness
                    district, and also in the south-west coast of the county, and in the opposite
                    peninsula of Wirral in Cheshire, in all which places many Danish names of
                    villages are still found.</p>
                <p>In Domesday the portion of Lancashire between the Ribble and the Mersey was
                    included in Cheshire and the remainder in Yorkshire. A great part of the lands
                    between the Ribble and Mersey was granted by the Conqueror to Roger de Poictou
                    of the family of Montgomery. It was then conferred by Henry I. on Stephen de
                    Blois, afterwards king, on the decease of whose brother William it reverted to
                    the crown, and was granted to one of the earls of Chester. That line becoming
                    extinct in 1232, it passed to William de Ferrers, and after the second revolt of
                    Robert do Ferrers, King Henry III. granted it to his younger son Edmund
                    Crouchback, and with it the earldom of the county. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Lancaster, House of. )</hi> In 1351 the county became a palatinate, and
                    again, after sixteen years abeyance, in 1377. Henry IV., soon after ascending
                    the throne, passed an Act declaring that the inheritance and titles of the duchy
                    of Lancaster should remain to him and his heirs for ever a distinct and separate
                    inheritance from the lands and possessions of the crown; and from the reign of
                    Henry V. the sovereigns of England have held the duchy, as well out of as within
                    the county palatine. At the Reformation most of the leading families of the
                    county adhered to the Catholic faith, and a few, as the Blundels of Little
                    Crosby and the Harringtons of Huyton, never left it. During the civil wars they
                    were ardent supporters of the royalist cause, especially the Derby family, and
                    the county was frequently the scene of sieges, as at Manchester, Liverpool,
                    Warrington, Lathom House, &amp;c., and of battles, as at Atherton Moor, Wigan,
                    Preston, and Winwick.</p>
                <p>The Cistercian abbey of Furness is perhaps one of the finest and most extensive
                    ecclesiastical ruins in England. Whalley abbey, first founded at Stanlawe in
                    Cheshire in 1178, and removed in 1296, belonged to the same order. There was a
                    priory of Black Canons at Burscough, founded in the time of Richard I., one at
                    Conishead dating from Henry II.’s τeign, and one at Lancaster. A convent of
                    Augustinian friars was founded at Cartmel in 1188, and one at Warrington about
                    1280. There are some remains of the Benedictine priory of Upholland, changed
                    from a college of secular priests in 1318; and the same order had a priory at
                    Lancaster founded in 1094, a cell at Lytham, of the reign of Richard I., and a
                    priory at Penwortham, founded shortly after the time of the Conqueror. The
                    Premonstratensians had Cockersa·nd Abbey, changed in 1190 from a hospital
                    founded in the reign of Henry II., of which the chapter-house remains. At
                    Kersal, near Manchester, there was a cell of Cluniae monks founded in the reign
                    of John, while at Lancaster there were convents of Dominicans and Franciscans,
                    and at Preston a priory of Grey Friars built by Edmund, earl of Lancaster, son
                    of Henry III.</p>
                <p>Besides the churches mentioned under the several towns, the more interesting are
                    those of Aldingham, Norman doorway’; Aughton; Cartmel priory church, with choir
                    and transepts of the Transition between Norman and Early English, south chapel
                    Decorated, and nave and windows Perpendicular; Hawkshead; Heysham, Norman with
                    traces of Saxon; Hoole; Huyton; Kirkby, rebuilt, with very ancient font; Kirkby
                    Ireleth, late Perpendicular, with Norman doorway; Leyland; Meiling (in
                    Lonsdale), Perpendicular, with stained glass windows; Middleton, rebuilt in
                    1524, but containing part of the old Norman church and several monuments;
                    Ormskirk, Perpendicular with traces of Norman, having two towers one of which is
                    detached and surmounted by a spire; Overton, with Norman doorway; Radcliffe,
                    Norman; Sefton, Perpendicular, with fine brass and recumbent figures of the
                    Molyneux family, also a screen exquisitely carved; Stidd, near Ribchester,
                    Norman arch and old monuments; Tunstall, late Perpendicular; Upholland priory
                    church, Early English, with low massy tower; Urswick, Norman, with embattled
                    tower and several old. monuments; Walton, anciently the parish church of
                    Liverpool; Walton-le-Dale; Warton, with old font; Whalley abbey church,
                    Decorated and Perpendicular, with Runic stone monuments.</p>
                <p>The principal old castles are those of Lancaster, noticed below; Dalton, a small
                    rude tower occupying the site of an older building; two towers of Gleaston
                    Castle, built by the lords of Aldingham in the 14th century; the ruins of
                    Greenhalgh Castle, built by the first earl of Derby, and demolished after a
                    siege by order of parliament in 1649; the ruins of Fouldrey in Peel Island near
                    the entrance to Barrow, erected in the reign of Edward III., now a most
                    dilapidated ruin, but “massive, great, and impressively solemn.” There are many
                    old timber houses and mansions of special interest, as well as numerous modern
                    seats.</p>
                <p>The principal histories of Lancashire are those by Edward Baines (1824, 2d ed.
                    1836, edited by Harland, 1868-70) and by Thomas Baines (1868-69). Many
                    interesting papers on special subjects will be found in the 110 volumes issued
                    by the Chetham Society, instituted at Manchester in 1843, and in the 32 volumes
                    of Transactions of the Lancashire and Cheshire Historic Society, also in the
                    Palatine Note-Book for 1881. For a fuller list of the bibliography of the county
