                    home he employed his time in repeating, as far as the means at hiscommιnd
                    admitted, the experiments he found described in books, and thus while still a
                    boy attained a theoretical and practical knowledge of chemistry comparable with
                    that of many full-grown professors of the science. He determined to be a
                    chemist, to devote his life to the pursuit of science. The only kind of chemist
                    available for teaching purposes was the chemist and druggist, and accordingly
                    Liebig, at the age of fifteen, entered the shop of an apothecary at Heppenheim
                    near Darmstadt to study chemistry. He soon found out how great is the difference
                    between practical pharmacy and scientific chemistry, and returned to Darmstadt,
                    after ten months, to look for another and more likely way of attaining his
                    object. After some months spent in study at home he entered the university of
                    Bonn, which lie soon left for Erlangen. There he attended the lectures of
                    Kastner on chemistry, and, besides the study of allied sciences, devoted some
                    time to make up for the -almost total neglect of school work caused by his early
                    love of chemistry. He was much influenced by the metaphysical speculations of
                    Schelling, and in after life referred to this influence as injurious to him as a
                    scientific investigator. In those days there were no laboratories accessible to
                    ordinary students, and Liebig had to content himself with what the university
                    could give him in the lecture-room and in the library. Both at Bonn and at
                    Erlangen he formed a students’ chemical and physical society for the discussion
                    of new discoveries and speculations as these appeared in scientific books or
                    periodicals. In 1822 he left Erlangen with the degree of Γh,D. By means of the
                    liberality of Louis I., grand-duke of Hesse-Darmstadt, Liebig was enabled to
                    continue his chemical studies in Paris. There he made the acquaintance of Runge,
                    Mitscherlich, and Gustav Rose. He attended the lectures of Gay-Lussac, Thenard,
                    and Dulong, and, while carrying on the investigation into the composition and
                    properties of the fulminates which he had already partly published, he
                    attempted, as at Erlangen, to work up his neglected school studies. The results
                    of his work on the fulminates were communicated to the Academy of Sciences, and
                    attracted the favourable attention of Humboldt, who was at that time in Paris.
                    Humboldt introduced Liebig to Gay-Lussac, who admitted him into his private
                    laboratory as a pupil. Here he had Opportunities of learning all the mysteries
                    of the art from cue of the most skilful and ingenious of experimenters. It v.as
                    on the advice of Humboldt that Liebig determined to become a teacher of
                    chemistry, but difficulties stood in his way. As a native of Hesse-Darmstadt, he
                    ought, according to the academical rules of the time, to have studied and
                    graduated at the university of Giessen, and Humboldt had to use his influence to
                    induce the authorities to forgive his having attended the foreign university of
                    Erlangen. After examination his Erlangen degree was recognized, and in 1824, in
                    his twenty-first year, he was appointed extraordinary professor of chemistry in
                    the university of Giessen. Two years later he was promoted to the post of
                    ordinary professor, which he held for twenty-five years, notwithstanding the
                    most tempting offers from other universities. It was here, in the small town and
                    small university of Giessen, that by far the most of Liebig’s work was done. He
                    began by remedying the evil which as a student he had himself felt. He induced
                    the Darmstadt Government to build a chemical laboratory in which any student of
                    the university might obtain a thorough practical training. It is difficult for
                    us, who live in a time when nearly every university and many schools possess
                    well-arranged and often well-endowed laboratories, to understand how great a
                    revolution was made in the practical teaching of physical science by the
                    foundation of the Giessen laboratory. We can form some idea of it by reading
                    Liebig’s articles on the condition of chemistry in Austria and Prussia, in which
                    he goes over in detail the means of teaching afforded in the various
                    universities of those great countries. He tells us that in 1838 two young
                    Prussians came to Giessen to study chemistry, unable to obtain entrance to a
                    laboratory in their own country, but were ordered back again by the Prussian
                    Government. Fortunately other Governments were less strict, or other students
                    were less obedient, and crowds of young men anxious to study chemistry came to
                    Giessen, and carried home the light there acquired. Partly by Liebig’s urgent
                    appeals to the interests and to the shame of the great German states, partly by
                    the influence of his pupils, a great reform was effected, and German
                    universities now vie with one another in offering opportunities of practical
                    instruction in chemistry and the other physical sciences.</p>
                <p>The amount and the importance of the laboratory work done by Liebig in Giessen
                    were very great Without considering here the work done by his students under his
                    direction, of which no doubt a very large part was conceived by him, and in the
                    execution of which he constantly contributed his assistance and advice, we shall
                    look only at what appears under his own name. During the twenty-six years he
                    spent at Giessen as ordinary professor, he contributed to scientific journals
                    more than two hundred papers, about twenty of which were records of joint work,
                    chiefly with Wöhler. During the same time he published his works on organic
                    analysis, organic chemistry, chemistry applied to physiology and agriculture,
                    his <hi rend="italic">Chemical Letters,</hi> and many smaller treatises. From
                    1832 he was joint editor of the <hi rend="italic">Annalen der</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pharmacie,</hi> from 1837 of the <hi rend="italic">Handwörterbuch
                    der reinen und angewandten Chemie,</hi> and from 1847 to 1856 of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Jαhresbeι∙icht</hi><hi rend="italic">der Chemie.</hi> These
                    statements give some idea of the amount of his work; of its importance and of
                    its effect on the history of science we shall speak later.</p>
                <p>In 1845 he was raised to the hereditary rank of baron under the title of Freiherr
                    von Liebig. In 1852 he accepted the invitation of the Bavarian Government to the
                    ordinary professorship of chemistry in the university of Munich. This office he
                    held till his death in 1873.</p>
                <p>In private life Liebig was hospitable, courteous, and kindly. Honoured by all the
                    great scientific societies of the world, and regarded by almost every one as the
                    great authority in chemistry, he assumed no airs of superiority, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n585/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0585-0566"/> and lived the simple and quiet life of a German
                    professor. Liebig’s influence on the history of chemistry may be considered
                    under five heads :—(1) the effect of the opening of the Giessen laboratory, and
                    of Liebig’s constant efforts to induce other universities to follow this
                    example; (2) the improvements introduced by him in methods of investigation and
                    in apparatus; (3) the discovery of new facts; (4) the development of theory; and
                    (5) the application of chemistry to physiology, agriculture, and the arts.</p>
                <p>We have already spoken of the first. Under the second head by far the most
                    important change introduced by Liebig was his method of organic analysis.
                    Organic substances were analysed, and analysed with accuracy, before 1830, but
                    such analyses could then be carried out only by highly skilled chemists, and
                    involved great labour and the use of cumbrous apparatus. Liebig’s method of
                    organic analysis, which was published in all its details in 1831, and which
                    (with important but secondary improvements) is that still used, made it easy for
                    any advanced student to make a fairly accurate and very useful analysis of an
                    organic substance. Analysis is to the chemist what astronomical methods for
                    determining longitudes and latitudes are to the geographical explorer. Without
                    it many interesting and useful discoveries may be made, but it is only when
                    complete and accurate analyses are made of all the new substances produced in
                    the course of a research that the research becomes fully available to other
                    explorers. If Liebig had contributed nothing to organic chemistry but his method
                    of analysis, he would still have been in a perfectly true sense the founder of
                    modern organic chemistry. Many other improvements of apparatus are due to him;
                    we need only mention the simple form of condenser called by his name, and
                    constantly used by every chemist, and the easy and accurate method for
                    determining the quantity of urea in a solution, which was the first step towards
                    introducing precise chemical methods into practical medicine. This is also the
                    proper place to refer to his analyses of the natural alkaloids» and his
                    discovery of the method of determining their equivalents by the analysis of
                    their chloroplatinates. In the third place we have to consider the new facts
                    discovered by Liebig. The very great addition to our knowledge of organic
                    chemistry made by Liebig naturally throws into the shade his contributions to
                    inorganic chemistry, but we ought to remember his numerous analyses of mineral
                    waters and his contributions to the difficult question of the accurate
                    separation of cobalt and nickel. It is, however, in organic chemistry that
                    Liebig’s great discoveries were made. These discoveries are so intimately
                    connected with his chemical theories that we may most conveniently consider them
                    along with the fourth head, his contributions to the development of chemical
                    theory.</p>
                <p>The notion of compound radicals is to be found in chemistry as far back at least
                    as the time of Lavoisier. Lavoisier says, “Some experiments of my own and some
                    made by Μ. Hassenfratz have convinced me that in general nearly all the
                    vegetable acids, such as tartaric, oxalic, citric, malic, acetic, pyrotartaric,
                    pyromucic acids, have for their radical hydrogen and carbon, but united so as to
                    form a single base, that all these acids differ from one another by the
                    difference in proportion of these two substances and the degrees of oxidation.”
                    Berzelius adopted this view and expressed it thus,— “We find the difference
                    between organic and inorganic bodies to be that, while in inorganic nature all
                    the oxidized substances have a simple radical, all the organic substances have
                    compound radicals. Just as ammonia is an alkali with a compound radical, but
                    possessing nevertheless the greatest analogies with the mineral alkalies which
                    have simple radicals, so we find the greatest analogy between the mineral and
                    the organic acids, so that the relations of potash and soda to acetic, oxalic,
                    citric acids are the same as their relations to sulphuric, nitric, phosphoric
                    acids.” These views were published by Berzelius in 1817. In 1815 Gay-Lussac had
                    discovered cyanogen, and shown that this compound of carbon and nitrogen is the
                    radical of prussic acid and its salts, in the same sense as chlorine is the
                    radical of hydrochloric acid and the chlorides. Ampere had indicated a theory of
                    the constitution of the ammonia salts, which Berzelius worked out in detail,
                    according to which those salts contain a compound radical, ammonium, playing in
                    them the part of potassium in the potash salts. Finally, Davy suggested in 1815
                    that the hydrated acids which correspond in function to hydrochloric acid should
                    be regarded as the true acids, and proposed to represent them as compounds of
                    hydrogen with a radical.</p>
                <p>Such were the knowledge and the theoretical position of chemists on this question
                    when Liebig became professor; the dates to which we have referred correspond to
                    the time when as a schoolboy he was devouring the contents of chemical journals
                    at Darmstadt, and no doubt he then became acquainted at first hand with the
                    discoveries and speculations of Ampere, Davy, Gay-Lussac, and Berzelius.</p>
                <p>We have seen that his first investigation referred to the fulminates. He
                    continued his researches upon the compounds of cyanogen and the substances
                    connected with them formed frequent subjects of his researches during his whole
                    life. In this region of organic chemistry he made many important discoveries, of
                    which the limits of this article do not allow a detailed account; we can only
                    mention melone, mellam, ammeline, ammelide, and melanine, as substances
                    discovered and investigated by him. In the course of these investigations he
                    discovered the precise nature of the chemical changes which occur in the
                    manufacture of bromide of potash. In 1831 he examined the action of chlorine
                    upon alcohol, among other substances discovered chloral, and commenced the
                    series of investigations into the derivatives of alcohol and ether to which we
                    shall refer immediately. In 1832 Wohler and Liebig published the results of
                    their joint research on the oil of bitter almonds and its derivatives. This
                    research may be said to stand at the head of modern organic chemistry. For
                    elegance of method and for clearness of insight it is unrivalled, and will
                    always remain a model of what such an investigation should be. They showed in
                    the clearest manner that the compound C <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 8</hi> O (here and elsewhere in this article we use the
                    symbols now in common use, instead of those employed by the authors), to which
                    they gave the name of benzoyl, is the constant part, or radical, of a great
                    series of compounds. The importance of this investigation was generally
                    recognized. Berzelius hailed it as the advent of real daylight on the subject of
                    organic chemistry, and even suggested the names proin or orthrin (from <hi
                    rend="italic">πρωί</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hpθpos)</hi> for the newly
                    discovered radical.</p>
                <p>We now come to the long controversy as to the constitution of alcohol and ether,
                    which engaged so much of Liebig’s time and energy. Gay-Lussac had shown in 1815
                    that alcohol and ether might, as far as their composition is concerned, be
                    represented as compounds of olefiant gas and water, and further that, if we
                    represent the quantities by volume of gas or vapour, ether contains one volume
                    of olefiant gas and half a volume of water vapour, while alcohol contains equal
                    volumes of the two. In 1828 Dumas and Boullay published an elaborate memoir on
                    the preparations and properties of the ethers, in which they further developed
                    the ideas suggested by Gay-Lussac. They regarded olefiant gas as the radical of
                    all the etherial compounds, as ammonia is of the ammoniacal salts, and
                    formulated them thus :—</p>

                <p>We have given only a sample of their tables, leaving out among others some
                    substances in reference to the composition of which they had fallen into error,
                    error which Liebig detected and used as an argument, valid enough then no doubt,
                    but of little interest now.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Liebig proposed a quite different theory, one which stands to Dumas and
                    Boullay’s in the same relation which the ammonium theory holds to the ammonia
                    theory of the constitution of the ammoniacal salts. Just as Ampère and Berzelius
                    regarded salammoniac, not as NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>,HC1, but as NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,C1, so Liebig proposed for muriatic ether the formula C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>,C1 instead of C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>,HC1, The really cogent
                    argument which he brought forward, the argument which we can now best
                    appreciate, is that, while alcohol contains combined water, ether does not.
                    According to Dumas and Boullay alcohol and ether are both hydrates, but in
                    Liebig’s view ether is (C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    6</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O and alcohol (C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>) <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O,H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O. If we wish to understand this argument we must
                    recollect that to the chemists of that time oxidized hydrogen was water, and
                    Liebig’s arguments are as sound now as they were then, for the most recent views
                    represent alcohol as C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    5</hi> —0—H, and this contains oxidized hydrogen, or, as we may say, half a
                    molecule of water, and Liebig’s tests do not distinguish preformed water, but
                    hydrogen and oxygen combined as they are in water. Much debate and investigation
                    followed, in the course of which the relations of all the substances derived
                    from alcohol were thoroughly and practically studied in a fuller and more
                    careful manner than would have been possible had there not been a theoretical
                    point to defend and to attack. The enormous number of facts discovered by Liebig
                    put him in" a very favourable position as the advocate of his theory. Chemists
                    could not do without <hi rend="italic">a</hi> knowledge of these facts, and they
                    could only get this knowledge through Liebig’s papers, in which the facts were
                    expressed in the language of his theory.</p>
                <p>In 1835 Régnault began a series of most important researches into the compounds
                    derived from olefiant gas. He showed that many of these substances might be
                    classified and their relations explained by the assumption of a radical C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, to which he gave the
                    name of aldehydene. Liebig saw that according to his view of the meaning of the
                    word radical, as “the unchanging constituent in a series of compounds,” the same
                    radical may be assumed in alcohol and in acetic acid, and in 1839, in a note
                    published in the <hi rend="italic">Annalen,</hi> he puts the matter in a very
                    clear light. He says, “Ether and ammonia have in their compounds a certain
                    resemblance which was·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n586/mode/1up"

                <p>first indicated by Dumas and Boullay, and the view of the constitution of the
                    ammonia salts which is generally held in France was the reason why ether was
                    considered the first hydrate of olefiant gas, alcohol as the second hydrate,
                    &amp;c.; in Germany and other countries the water necessary for the constitution
                    of the salts of ammonia with oxygen acids was considered as an integral part of
                    the base; it was assumed that this water forms with the ammonia oxide of
                    ammonium (NHA <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, and this view in a certain sense
                    smoothed the way for another, according to which the existence of organic
                    oxides, capable of neutralizing acids, appeared very probable, as a necessary
                    complement to the organic acids which chemists had long been inclined to regard
                    as oxides of organic radicals. Ether was in these countries regarded as an
                    organic oxide, and this difference of view excited a ten years’ strife, as an
                    immediate result of which· we may regard the discovery of a great number of
                    compounds which enriched science with innumerable important observations. No
                    region of organic chemistry has been so thoroughly and so completely studied as
                    the compounds connected with ether; and now, when the existence of organic
                    oxides is no longer denied, the support of the opposite opinion has come to an
                    end, although it cannot be said that the question itself has been experimentally
                    decided. If we compare in the light of our present knowledge the ammonia
                    compounds with the ether compounds, we at once see that the opposing views were
                    fundamentally the same in the two cases. The disputes took place because we were
                    not at one as to the interpretation of the phenomena. The etherand ammonia
                    compounds assume in fact the same form if amidogen is regarded as the
                    unchangeable radical of the ammonia compounds, and acetyl [Regnault’s
                    aldehydene] as the starting point of the ether compounds. The two sets of
                    compounds differ only in so far as we must ascribe to acetyl the power of
                    forming acids, a power which amidogen does not possess?’</p>
                <p>He then gives a table containing in two columns the ammonia and the ether
                    compounds, in which C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript">
                    3</hi> corresponds to NH <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> II <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> to NH <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, and C
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> to NH <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi>, and adds, “These formulae require no explanation; they
                    have been developed in order to show the extraordinary resemblance of the
                    ammonia and the ether compounds, and to show why it was that many chemists
                    regarded olefiant gas as the first member of the series of ether compounds. Both
                    of the formerly antagonistic theories have, as may be easily seen, from this
                    point of view the same foundation, and all further questions as to the truth of
                    the one or other view is thus of course set at rest.”</p>
                <p>It was during the course of the controversy which then closed that Liebig had
                    discovered aldehyde, chloral, and, simultaneously with Soubeiran, chloroform,
                    besides numerous other substances of less general interest, and developed the
                    theory now generally received of the formation of ether by the action of
                    sulphuric acid on alcohol.</p>
                <p>In the very short sketch given above of the discussion as to the constitution of
                    ether, we mentioned that Liebig’s ethyl theory was to some extent borrowed from
                    Berzelius. Berzelius had suggested that ether was the oxide of a radical
                    (Liebig’s ethyl), but he was at first inclined to regard alcohol, not as the
                    hydrate oxide of the same radical, but rather as the oxide of another one, which
                    with our symbols would be written C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> ∙ But there was a deeper difference than this between
                    the radical theories of Berzelius and Liebig. This essential difference first
                    clearly showed itself in the notes which Liebig added to two letters from
                    Berzelius to Wohler, published in the <hi rend="italic">Annalen</hi> in 1839. In
                    these letters Berzelius gives his views of the constitution of oxychlorides,
                    with which he classes such bodies as trichloracetic acid. All those bodies he
                    represents as compounds of oxides and chlorides, in harmony with the dualistic
                    system.</p>
                <p>Thus, instead of SO <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> C1 <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>,
                    C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> HC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, &amp;c., he writes SC1 <hi rend="subscript"> 6</hi> +
                    2SO <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> Cl <hi
                    rend="subscript"> β</hi> + C <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"
                    > 3</hi>, &amp;c. (taking the anhydrous acid). In his second letter on
                    Malaguti’s chlorinated ethers he naturally arrives at formulae of extreme
                    complexity. In his notes Liebig states that he does not agree with Berzelius,
                    and that the analogy first pointed out by Berzelius between inorganic and
                    organic compounds and his theory of organic radicals had been a guiding star in
                    a labyrinth in which previously no one could find the way. “But, while there are
                    points of resemblance, there are very many points of difference; we should
                    follow a theory as long as it gives us light and explains facts; up to a certain
                    point the principles of inorganic chemistry help us in organic chemistry, beyond
                    it they leave us, and produce instead of removing complications; beyond this
                    point we require new principles.”</p>
                <p>These new principles were supplied by Liebig’s radical theory. As Liebig showed,
                    abstract discussions as to the truth of a theory are out of place in an
                    experimental science; the question is not as to their essential truth but as to
                    their practical fruitfulness. Do they help us to understand old and to discover
                    new facts? If they do, the morrow may take thought for its own theories. These
                    are not Liebig’s words, but they seem to express his ideas.</p>
                <p>Liebig early expressed his approval of Davy’s views as to the constitution of
                    acids, but he rarely used the language or the notation corresponding to that
                    view. This divergence between his theory and his habitual language is
                    interesting as showing that he held that the same truth may be expressed in more
                    than one way, and that where no immediate point is to be gained it is well to
                    employ the language best understood by those whom we address. In tnis, as in his
                    preference for what was called the equivalent system of notation over that of
                    Berzelius, he showed his sound practical judgment and common sense. We now see
                    that the notation of Berzelius was nearer the truth, but its advantages could
                    not be felt until chemistry had advanced further, and its retention would have
                    led to complications of formulae and obscuring of relations. The resemblance
                    indeed of our present notation to that of Berzelius is to a great extent
                    accidental, and the advance was hastened rather than hindered by what now looks
                    like a retrograde step.</p>
                <p>There is one other point which we have to mention under the present head. Liebig
                    at once saw the importance of Graham’s researches on the phosphates. He applied
                    Graham’s idea of polybasicity to organic acids, and satisfactorily proved,
                    notwithstanding the opposition of Berzelius, that tartaric acid is dibasic and
                    citric acid tnbasic.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto said nothing as to the relation of Liebig’s theories to those at
                    present held by chemists. On this subject a word may suffice. The great revolt
                    against the radical theory led by Laurent and Gerhardt produced a long and
                    acrimonious controversy. In that controversy Liebig took his part, and many hard
                    and some unfair things were said by him. The controversy itself was of course
                    the means of producing a vast amount of thorough research, and was thus, like
                    all such contests, of direct use; it also led to the revision of all theoretical
                    opinions from a totally new point of view. From this ordeal the radical theory
                    has emerged, not very different in appearance. But it has undergone a profound
                    change. Its foundations have been immensely strengthened, it has been to a great
                    extent explained. Some chemists seem to think that this makes it an entirely new
                    theory. We cannot share this view. Our reasons for believing in ethyl and
                    benzoyl differ from the reasons adduced by Wöhlerand Liebig only in this that we
                    have arguments which they had not; their arguments remain. We now know something
                    of the reason why such radicals exist; we can, to a certain extent, deduce their
                    properties from those of the elements which they contain, but explanation is
                    something different from refutation; the theory has grown, but still remains the
                    same theory.</p>
                <p>Liebig all his life showed a special predilection for the study of the immediate
                    products of animal life. He investigated with untiring zeal the substances
                    contained in urine and in the juice of flesh. In these researches he discovered
                    many new substances, and cleared up doubts and difficulties as to their
                    relations to one another and to other bodies. Late in life he expressed the most
                    lively interest in Volhardt’s synthesis of sarcosin and creatine, substances
                    with the preparation of which he had long before been engaged. In this connexion
                    it is right that we should mention his elaborate investigation on uric acid and
                    its derivatives. This line of study led him to interest himself in the chemistry
                    of food, and the importance of his work in this direction can scarcely be
                    overestimated. We do not refer alone to his methods of preparing the extract of
                    meat and the food for infants, which have perhaps spread his fame more widely
                    than his strictly scientific work could have done; we refer rather to the
                    influence which his analyses and calculations have had on medical opinion and
                    practice. And this leads us to our fifth head, Liebig’s influence on the
                    application of chemistry to physiology, agriculture, and the arts.</p>
                <p>Before Liebig undertook his investigations into the chemistry of vegetation, the
                    views (they can scarcely be called theories) held as to the manner in which
                    plants are nourished were vague in the extreme. The only point satisfactorily
                    made out was that under the influence of light the green parts of plants are
                    capable of decomposing carbonic acid, giving off oxygen and retaining the
                    carbon. Saussure, to whose careful experiments the establishment of this fact,
                    first noticed by Priestley, is mainly due, believed that the nitrogen of the
                    plant came from soluble organic substances absorbed by the roots, and expressly
                    says that the main use of ammonia in manure is as a solvent of humus, which he
                    supposed to be one source of the carbon in plants; and, although the ashes of
                    the various plants had been analysed, the importance of the mineral constituents
                    of vegetables was not at all recognized. Liebig undertook the investigation of
                    this question in 1840. He showed that the plant derives its nourishment partly
                    from the air, partly from the soil; the carbonic acid and water, the ammonia and
                    nitric acid, which he showed to be the sources of the plant’s nitrogen, come
                    from the atmosphere; while the potash, soda, lime, iron, magnesia, sulphuric
                    acid, phosphoric acid, and silica come from the soil. No exhaustion can take
                    place of the former, but the soil contains only a limited amount of the latter
                    in a soluble state, and when this is used up the soil becomes barren. Not only
                    so, but the absence of any one of the necessary substances makes the soil
                    barren. He showed how manure acts by restoring these deficient ingredients, and
                    how, when the land is left fallow, atmospheric influences decompose the
                    insoluble minerals and supply the soil with what has been removed. He further
                    showed that plants use and therefore remove from the soil the articles of plant
                    food in various proportions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n587/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0587-0568"/> and thus explained the advantage of a rotation of
                    crops. The artificial manures which he introduced contained the essential
                    mineral substances, and a small quantity of ammoniacal salts, because he held
                    that while the air supplies ammonia it does not always supply it fast enough,
                    particularly to the less leafy plants. He bought a field near Giessen for his
                    experiments, and treated it with the artificial manure, but the result was
                    disappointing. The manure was not inactive, but not nearly so active as it
                    should have been. It was many years before he detected the cause. To prevent the
                    rain washing away the alkalies in the manure, he had taken great pains to render
                    them insoluble. Way’s experiments on the absorption of manure by soils (1850)
                    occurred to him as suggesting an explanation, and in 1857 he made a number of
                    experiments on the retention of various substances by earth. In these he
                    confirmed and extended Way’s observations, and thus saw that his effort to make
                    his manure better had made it worse. As he says, “I had sinned against the
                    wisdom of the Creator, and received my righteous punishment. I wished to improve
                    His work, and in my blindness believed that, in the marvellous chain of laws
                    binding life on the earth’s surface and keeping it always new, a link had been
                    forgotten which I, weak powerless worm, must supply.”</p>
                <p>Now, just as he showed that plants require certain—often small— quantities of
                    particular substances, else they will not grow at all, however great may be the
                    quantities of other kinds of food supplied, so he showed that animals also
                    require, not only a proper quantity of food, but also the right proportion of
                    the different kinds of food, mineral as well as organic. In the classification
                    of the kinds of organic food into heat-producing and blood-forming, it was
                    necessary to examine whether the carbohydrates, starch, sugar, &amp;c., should,
                    be placed alongside of fat. He was thus led to inquire into the power of the
                    animal body to produce fat from starch or sugar, and came to the conclusion,
                    contrary to the opinion of Dumas and Boussingault, that this transformation does
                    take place.</p>
                <p>Liebig’s investigations into the relations of organic chemistry to physiology led
                    him to the conviction that the only source of animal heat is the heat produced
                    by the oxidation of the tissues, and, strange as it may appear, he had to defend
                    this view against what he truly enough, though perhaps somewhat impolitely,
                    called the absurd nonsense of his medical opponents. He also succeeded in
                    demolishing, it is to be hoped finally, the ridiculous belief in the possibility
                    of the spontaneous combustion of the human body.</p>
                <p>t Liebig’s theory of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fermentation</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >{g.v.)</hi> aimed at explaining the phenomena on purely chemical principles. He
                    ridiculed the physiological theories, and looked upon the growth of fungi rather
                    as incident of the fermentation, adducing the fermentative changes of amygdaline
                    and similar substances as cases of fermentation without life.</p>
                <p>We have still to notice one of Liebig’s chemical discoveries, of secondary
                    interest chemically, but of great practical importance. This is his discovery of
                    a method for depositing a uniform film of metallic silver on smooth clean
                    surfaces. This method may render it possible to use reflectors for astronomical
                    telescopes of a size unattainable with the old speculum metal.</p>
