                <p><label type="entry">LESLIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas Edward
                    Cliffe</hi></label> (1827-1882), one of the ablest and most original English
                    economists of the present century, was born in the county of Wexford in (as is
                    believed) the year 1827. He was the second son of the Rev. Edward Leslie,
                    prebendary of Dromore, and rector of Annahilt, in the county of Down. His family
                    was of Scotch descent, but had been connected with Ireland since the reign of
                    Charles I. Amongst his ancestors were that accomplished and energetic prelate,
                    John Leslie, bishop first of Raphoe and afterwards of Clogher, who, when holding
                    the former see, offered so stubborn a resistance to the Cromwellian forces, and
                    the bishop’s son Charles, the well-known nonjuror. Cliffe Leslie received his
                    elementary education from his father, who resided in England, though holding
                    church preferment as well as possessing some landed property in Ireland; by him
                    he was taught Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, at an unusually early age; he was
                    afterwards for a short time under the care of a clergyman at Clapham, and was
                    then sent to King William’s College, in the Isle of Man, where he remained
                    until, in 1842, being then only fifteen years of age, he entered Trinity
                    College, Dublin. He was a distinguished student there, obtaining, besides other
                    honours, a classical scholarship in 1845, an&lt;l a senior moderatorship (gold
                    medal) in mental and moral philosophy at his degree examination in 1846. He
                    became a law student at Lincoln’s Inn, was for two years a pupil in a
                    conveyancer’s chambers in London, and was called to the English bar. But his
                    attention was soon turned from the pursuit of legal practice, for which he seems
                    never to have had much inclination, by his appointment, in 1853, to the
                    professorship of jurisprudence and political economy in Queen’s College,
                    Belfast. The duties of this chair requiring only short visits to Ireland in
                    certain terms of each year, he continued to reside and prosecute his studies in
                    London, and became a frequent writer on economic and social questions in the
                    principal reviews and other periodicals. In 1870 he collected a number of his
                    essays, adding several new ones, into a volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Land
                    Systems and Industrial Economy of Ireland, England, and Continental
                    Countries.</hi> J. S. Mill gave a full account of the contents of this work in a
                    paper in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review,</hi> in which he pronounced
                    Leslie to be “one of the best living writers on applied political economy.” Mill
                    had sought his acquaintance on reading his first article in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Macmillaη</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Magazine</hi>; he admired his talents and
                    took pleasure in his society, and treated him with a respect and kindness which
                    Leslie always gratefully acknowledged.</p>
                <p>In the frequent visits which Leslie made to the Continent, especially to Belgium
                    and some of the less-known districts of France and Germany, he occupied himself
                    much in economic and social observation, studying the effects of the
                    institutions and system of life which prevailed in each region, on the material
                    and moral condition of its inhabitants. In this way he gained an extensive and
                    accurate acquaintance with Continental rural economy, of which he made excellent
                    use in studying parallel phenomena at home. The accounts he gave of the results
                    of his observations were among his happiest efforts; “no one,” said Mill, “was
                    able to write narratives of foreign visits at once so instructive and so
                    interesting.” In these excursions he made the acquaintance of several
                    distinguished persons, amongst others of M. Léonce de Lavergne and M. Émile de
                    Laveleye. To the memory of the former of these he afterwards paid a graceful
                    tribute in a biographical sketch <hi rend="italic">(Fortnightly Review,</hi>
                    February 1881); and to the close of his life there existed between him and M. de
                    Laveleye relations of mutual esteem and cordial intimacy.</p>
                <p>Two essays of Leslie’s appeared in volumes published under the auspices of the
                    Cobden Club, one on the “Land System of France” (2d ed., 1870), containing an
                    earnest defence of <hi rend="italic">la petite culture</hi> and still more of
                    <hi rend="italic">la petite</hi><hi rend="italic">propriété·,</hi> the other on
                    “Financial Reform” (1871), in which he exhibited in detail the impediments to
                    production and commerce arising from indirect taxation. Many other articles were
                    contributed by him to reviews between 1875 and 1879, including several
                    discussions of the history of prices and the movements of wages in Europe, and a
                    sketch of life in Auvergne in his best manner; the most important of them,
                    however, related to the philosophical method of political economy, notably a
                    memorable one which appeared in the Dublin University periodical, <hi
                    rend="italic">Hermathena.</hi> In 1879 the provost and senior fellows of Trinity
                    College published for him a volume in which a number of these articles were
                    collected under the title of <hi rend="italic">Essays in Political and Moral
                    Philosophy.</hi> These and some later essays, which ought one day to be united
                    with them, together with the earlier· volume on <hi rend="italic">Land
                    Systems,</hi> form the essential contribution of Leslie to our economic
                    literature. He had long contemplated, and had in part written, a work on English
                    economic and legal history, which would have been his <hi rend="italic">magnum
                    opus—</hi> a more substantial fruit of his genius and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n497/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0497-0478"/> his labours than anything he has left to us. But
                    the MS. of this treatise, after much pains had already been spent on it, was
                    unaccountably lost at Nancy in 1872; and, though he hoped to be able speedily to
                    reproduce the missing portion and finish the work, it is feared that but a small
                    part of it, if any, has been left in a state fit for publication. What the
                    nature of it would have been may be gathered from an essay on the “History and
                    Future of Profit” in the <hi rend="italic">Fortnicjhtly Review</hi> for November
                    1881, which is believed to have been in substance an extract from it.</p>
                <p>That he was able to do so much may well be a subject of wonder when it is known
                    that his labours had long been impeded by a painful and depressing malady, from
                    which he suffered severely at intervals, whilst he never felt secure from its
                    recurring attacks. To this disease he in the end succumbed at Belfast, whither
                    he had gone to discharge his professorial duties, on the 27th of January 1882,
                    in the fifty-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Leslie’s work may be distributed under two heads, that of applied political
                    economy, and that of discussion on the philosophical method of the science. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Land Systems</hi> belonged principally to the former division.
                    The author perceived the great and growing importance for the social welfare of
                    both Ireland and England of what is called “the land question,” and treated it
                    in this volume at once with breadth of view and with a rich variety of
                    illustrative detail. His general purpose was to show that the territorial
                    systems of both countries were so encumbered with elements of feudal origin as
                    to be altogether unfitted to serve the purposes of a modern industrial society.
                    The policy he recommended is summed up in the following list of requirements, “a
                    simple jurisprudence relating to land, a law of equal intestate succession, a
                    prohibition of entail, a legal security for tenants’ improvements, an open
                    registration of title and transfer, and a considerable number of peasant
                    properties.” The volume is full of practical good sense, and exhibits a thorough
                    knowledge of home and foreign agricultural economy; and in tlιe handling of the
                    subject is everywhere shoλvιι the special power which its author possessed of
                    making what he wrote interesting as well as instructive. The way in which
                    sagacious observation and shrewd comment are constantly intermingled in the
                    discussion not seldom reminds us of Adam Smith, whose manner was more congenial
                    to Leslie than the abstract and arid style of Ricardo.</p>
                <p>But what, more than anything else, marks him as an original thinker, and gives
                    him a place apart among contemporary economists, is his exposition and defence
                    of the historical method in political economy. Both at home and abroad there has
                    for some time existed a profound and growing dissatisfaction with the method and
                    many of the doctrines of the hitherto dominant school, which, it is alleged,
                    under a “fictitious completeness, symmetry, and exactness” disguises a real
                    hollowness and discordance with fact. It is urged that the attempt to deduce the
                    economic phenomena of a society from the so-called universal principle of “the
                    desire of wealth.” is illusory, and that they cannot be fruitfully studied apart
                    from the general social conditions and historic development of which they are
                    the outcome. Of this movement of thought Leslie was the principal
                    representative, if not the originator, in England. There is no doubt, for he has
                    himself placed it on record, that the first influence which impelled him in the
                    direction of the historical method was that of Sir Henry Maine, by whose
                    personal teaching of jurisprudence, as well as by the example of his writings,
                    he was led ‘ ‘ to look at the present economic structure and state of society as
                    the result of a long evolution.” The study of those German economists who
                    represent similar tendencies doubtless confirmed him in the new line of thought
                    on which he had entered, though he does not seem to have been further indebted
                    to any of them except, perhaps, in some small degree to Roscher. And the
                    writings of Comte, whose “prodigious genius,” as exhibited in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">Positive,</hi> he admired and
                    proclaimed, though he did not accept his system as a whole, must have powerfully
                    co-operated to form in him the habit of regarding economic science as only a
                    single branch of sociology, which should always be kept in close relation to the
                    others. The earliest writing in which Leslie’s revolt against the so-called
                    “orthodox school” distinctly appears is his <hi rend="italic">Essay on
                    Wages,</hi> which was first published in 1868, and was reproduced as an appendix
                    to the volume on <hi rend="italic">Land Tenures.</hi> In this, after exposing
                    the inanity of the theory of the wage-fund, and showing the utter want of
                    agreement between its results and the observed phenomena, he concludes by
                    declaring that “political economy must be content to take rank as an inductive,
                    instead of a purely deductive science,” and that, by this change of character,
                    “it will gain in utility, interest, and real truth far more than a full
                    compensation for the forfeiture of a fictitious title to mathematical exactness
                    and certainty.” But it is in the essays collected in the volume of 1879 that his
                    attitude in relation to the question of method is most decisively marked. In one
                    of these, on “the political economy of Adam Smith,” he exhibits in a very
                    interesting way the co-existence in the <hi rend="italic">Wealth of Nations</hi>
                    of historical-inductive investigation in the manner of Montesquieu with <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> speculation founded on theologico-metaphysical
                    bases, and points out the error of ignoring the former element, which is the
                    really characteristic feature of Smith’s social philosophy, and places him in
                    strong contrast with his <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi> followers of the
                    school of Ricardo. The essay, however, which contains the most brilliant polemic
                    against the “orthodox” school, as well as the most luminous account and the most
                    powerful vindication of the new direction, was that of which we have above
                    spoken as having first appeared in <hi rend="italic">Hermathena.</hi> It may be
                    recommended as supplying the best extant presentation of one of the two
                    contending views of economic method. On this essay mainly rests the claim of
                    Leslie to be regarded as the founder and first head of the English historical
                    school of political economy. How far his opinions on the philosophical
                    constitution of the science are destined to prevail must for the present remain
                    doubtful. Those who share his views on that subject regard the work he did,
                    notwithstanding its unsystematic character, as in reality the most important
                    done by any recent English economist. But even the wannest partisans of the
                    older school are ready to acknowledge that he has done excellent service by
                    insisting on a kind of inquiry, heretofore too much neglected, which is of the
                    highest interest and. value, in whatever relation it may be supposed to stand to
                    the establishment of economic truth. The members of both groups alike recognize
                    his great learning, his patient and conscientious habits of investigation, and
                    the large social spirit in which he treated the problems of his science. (J. K.
