                    be loose, and then it is called a padlock, which is internally like other locks,
                    but externally has a half link or <hi rend="italic">boιv</hi> turning on a hinge
                    at one end, while the other, after being put through a chain or staple on the
                    door, enters the lock and is fastened by the bolt therein. The bolt may be moved
                    by the key, or may close by a spring, but require a key to open it, as in the
                    case of handcuffs, which are a pair of padlocks of this kiud united by a short
                    chain. A common door lock also comprises a spring latch which opens by a handle,
                    and sometimes a small bolt held by friction either shut or open, which is moved
                    by a smaller handle inside the room only; but neither of these is the lock
                    proper, any more than a hook or a button, or a common lifting latch. Therefore,
                    omitting them, a lock is as defined above.</p>
                <p>The earliest lock of which the construction is known is the Egyptian, which was
                    used four thousand years ago. In fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">aa</hi> is the body
                    of the lock, <hi rend="italic">bb</hi> the bolt, and <hi rend="italic">cc</hi>
                    the key. The three pins <hi rend="italic">p, r&gt;, p</hi> drop into three holes
                    in the bolt when it is pushed in, and so hold it fast; and they are raised again
                    by putting in the key through the large hole in the bolt and raising it a
                    little, so that the pins in the key push the locking pins up out of the way of
                    the bolt. The security of this is very small, as it is easy enough to find the
                    places of the pins by pushing in a bit of wood covered with clay or tallow, on
                    which the holes will mark themselves; and the depth can easily be got by
                    trial.</p>
                <p>Mr Chubb, the well-known lock-maker, used to show a wooden Chinese lock very
                    superior to the Egyptian, and, in fact, founded on exactly the same principle as
                    the Bramah lock, which long enjoyed the reputation of being the most secure lock
                    ever invented; for it has sliders or tumblers of different lengths, and cannot
                    be opened unless they are all raised to the proper heights, and no higher. Until
                    about a century ago no lock so good as this was known in England. The locks then
                    in use (fig. 2) were nothing better than a mere bolt, held in its place, either
                    shut or open, by a spring <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which pressed it down, and
                    so held it at either one end or the other of the convex notch <hi rend="italic"
                    >aa ·</hi> and the only impediment to opening it was the wards which the key had
                    to pass before it could turn in the keyhole. But it was always possible to find
                    the shape of the wards by merely putting in a blank key covered with wax, and
                    pressing it against them; and when this had been done, it was by no means
                    necessary to cut out the key into the complicated form of the wards (such as
                    fig. 3), because no part of that key does any work except the edge <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> farthest from the pipe <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> and so a
                    key of the form fig. 4 will do just as well; and a small collection of skeleton
                    keys, as they are called, of a few different patterns, were all the stock in
                    trade that a lock-picker required.</p>
                <p>The common single-tumbler lock (fig. 5) was rather better than this, as it
                    requires two operations instead of one to open it. The tumbler <hi rend="italic"
                    >at</hi> turns on a pivot at <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and has a square pin at
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which drops into a notch in the bolt <hi rend="italic"
                    >bb,</hi> when it is either quite open or quite shut, and the tumbler must be
                    lifted by the key before the bolt can be moved again. But this also is very
                    easy, unless the lock is so made that the tumbler will go into another notch in
                    the bolt if it is lifted too high, as in the lock we shall now describe, which
                    was the foundation of all the modern improvements in lock-making.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Barr oris Locle.—</hi> This was the first lock with several
                    tumblers. It was patented in 1778. Fig. 6 is a front view, and fig. 7 a
                    horizontal section. First consider it with reference to one tumbler <hi
                    rend="italic">at</hi> only. Unless the square pin <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    lifted by the key to the proper height, and no higher, the bolt cannot move, and
                    that alone adds very considerably to the difficulty of picking, except by a
                    method not discovered for many years after. But Barron added another tumbler,
                    and unless both were raised at once to the proper height, and no higher, the
                    lock could not be opened. The face, or working edge, of the key of a
                    many-tumblered lock assumes this form (fig. 8), the steps corresponding to the
                    different heights to which the tumblers have to be raised, and one of them
                    acting on the bolt, and they may have a much wider range of difference than in
                    this figure. The key here drawn is also one with the wards of such a shape that
                    no skeleton except itself can pass them. The form, however, can be got in the
                    usual way by a wax impression; and as it weakens the key very much, and is
                    expensive to cut, it is not often used.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Bramah’s Lock.—</hi> The next lock of any importance was the
                    celebrated one patented ten years after Barron’s, by Joseph Bramah (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Bramah).</hi> In figs. 9 and 10 <hi rend="italic">aaαa</hi> is
                    the outer barrel of the lock, which is screwed to, or cast with, the plate; <hi
                    rend="italic">cece</hi> is a cylinder, or inner barrel, turning within the
                    other. It is shown separately<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n768/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0768-0745"/> at fig. 11; and fig. 12 is a cross section of it,
                    the black ring bein' the keyhole, and the light spot in the middle the
                    drill-pin, which goes into the key. The short pin <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    figs. 9, 10, 11 is set in the end of the cylinder, near its edge; and, when the
                    cylinder turns round, that pin shoots or draws the bolt, by acting in a slit of
                    the form shown in fig. 13. The security of the lock depends upon a number of
                    sliders, <hi rend="italic">s, s, of</hi> which the shape is shown in fig. 14,
                    and the cross section in fig. 12. They are made of plates of steel doubled, and
                    sprung open a little, so as to make them move with a little friction in the
                    slits of the cylinder or revolving barrel in which they lie, and are pressed up
                    against the cap of the lock by a spiral spring. They are shown so pressed up in
                    fig. 9, and pressed down by the key in fig. 10. There is a deep groove cut round
                    the barrel, and in each of the sliders there is a deep notch which can be pushed
                    down to that place in the barrel by a key slit to the proper depth; and it is
                    evident that when all the sliders are pushed down to that position the barrel
                    will present the appearance of having no sliders on it. A steel plate (fig. 15),
                    made in two pieces in order to get it on, embraces the barrel at the place where
                    the groove is, having notches in it corresponding to the sliders, and is fixed
                    to the body of the lock by two screws marked &lt;Z, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in
                    figs. 9, 10, and 15. When the sliders are pushed up by the spring they fill the
                    notches in the plate, and prevent the barrel from turning; but when they are
                    pushed down by the key the notches in the sliders all lie in the plane of the
                    plate, and so the barrel can turn with the key, and the pin <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> in the end of it drives the bolt as before described. The key has a bit,
                    <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> sticking out from the pipe, the use of which is to fix
                    the depth to which it is to be pushed in, and then, as the bit slips under the
                    cap of the lock, it keeps the key at the same depth while it is being
                    turned.</p>
                <p>This was the construction of the lock for a good many years, and Bramah
                    pronounced it in that state “not to be within the range of art to produce a key,
                    or other instrument, by which a lock on this principle can be opened.” It was
                    found, however, long before the defeat of the improved challenge Bramah lock by
                    Mr Hobbs in 1851, that the inventor had made the common mistake of pronouncing
                    that to be impossible which he only did not see how to do himself. As it has
                    been generally supposed that what is called the tentative method of lock-picking
                    was unknown in England before it came over from America in the year of the
                    Exhibition of 1851, we must remind our readers that it was described in the 7th
                    edition of this work fifty years ago, though the lock-picking fraternity were
                    not of sufficiently literary habits to make themselves acquainted with it. Mr
                    Hobbs, it is true, carried the process further than had been supposed possible
                    before; but all the Barron and Chubb and other many-tumblered locks, which were
                    supposed impregnable, might long ago have been opened by anybody who had paid
                    attention to the method by which the Bramah locks were known to have been picked
                    some seventy years ago, before the introduction of the false notches designed in
                    1817 by Mr Russell, then one of Mr Bramah’s workmen. If you apply backward
                    pressure to the bolt of a tumbler lock when locked, or twisting pressure to the
                    barrel of a Bramah lock, first pressing down the spiral spring, there will be a
                    greater pressure felt against some of the tumblers or sliders than against
                    others, in consequence of inevitable inequalities of workmanship; and if you
                    keep the pressure up, and gently move any of the tumblers or sliders on which
                    the pressure is felt, you will at last get it to some point where it feels
                    loose. That may or may not be the exact place to which the key ought to lift it;
                    but as soon as you feel it loose leave it alone, it will not fall again, as the
                    friction is sufficient to prevent it; and, if necessary, you may fix it there by
                    a proper instrument, or measure the depth and keep the measure till you begin
                    again. Then try another tumbler which feels tight, and raise it till it also
                    feels loose. And if you go on in that way, always leaving the loose tumblers
                    alone, and raising the one which feels tight, they will at last all be got into
                    the position of complete freedom, t,e., to the place where the stump of the bolt
                    can pass them. The operation is just the same in principle in the Bramah lock
                    and in tumbler locks; only, as all the sliders are acted on by one spring in the
                    Bramah as now made, you need only just push down that spring, and hold it there,
                    and then the sliders may be moved freely either way by means of a hook or a
                    small pair of self-acting forceps to pull them up if they accidentally get
                    pushed too far. At first each slider had a separate spring.</p>
                <p>But if the sliders have some false notches in them not so deep as the true ones
                    (see fig. 14), and the corners of the notches in the plate <hi rend="italic"
                    >dd</hi> are cut out a little (as in fig. 15), then you might by trial get all
                    the sliders into such a position that the barrel could turn a very little, but
                    no more; and when it is turned that little, you cannot push the sliders iu any
                    further, and so (as was long supposed) the tentative process is defeated; and
                    undoubtedly it is made much more troublesome, but it only requires more time and
                    patience. You can still feel that the pressure is greater against some one or
                    more of the tumblers or sliders than against others, and, wherever that is the
                    case, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n769/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0769-0746"/> you know that it must be at a false notch, and
                    not the true one, for a true one gives no pressure at all. Proceeding in this
                    way, Mr Hobbs opened the challenge lock with eighteen sliders, or guards, which
                    had hung in Messrs Bramah’s window for many years, in nineteen hours, and would
                    have done it sooner, but that one of his instruments broke in the lock. He
                    afterwards repeated the operation three times within the hour, in the presence
                    of the arbitrators; and a more recent one with eight sliders he opened in four
                    minutes, by means of an instrument which is equivalent to a Bramah key with
                    adjustable slits, which are set to the sliders as the operation of feeling them
                    and getting their depths goes on. It is, moreover, to be remembered that thieves
                    do not always confine themselves to the conditions of a challenge, in which
                    force and injury to the lock are of course prohibited; and, if a lock can be
                    easily opened by tearing out its entrails, it is of very little use to say that
                    it would have defied all the arts of polite lock-picking. In this respect the
                    Bramah lock is singularly deficient; for if the exposed cap or nozzle of the
                    keyhole is cut off, as it easily may be, or if the hole is widened out by a
                    centre-bit, the sliders can all be pulled out, and there is an end of the
                    lock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inside and Outside Locks.—</hi> Locks for drawers, closets,
                    iron chests, and the like are only required to lock on one side, and their keys
                    are therefore generally made with a pipe, which slips on to a pin in the lock
                    called the drill-pin, and turns on it. Doors which have to be locked sometimes
                    on one side and sometimes on the other cannot have their keys made in this way;
                    the key is st&gt;lid, and its plug or stem, being thicker than the flat part or
                    web, acts as an axis fitting into the upper part of the keyhole, though that
                    hole does not completely enclose it. All keys for these inside and outside locks
                    must be symmetrical, or alike on each side of a line through their middle, in
                    order to fit the lock either way, which limits the variety of the tumblers in
                    the case of many-tumblered locks. A Bramah lock, to open on both sides, must be
                    made double, with one set of sliders to push in from one side of the door, and
                    the other set from the other side; and, consequently, they are very seldom used
                    for this purpose. It may be convenient to observe that when we use the term
                    Bramah lock we mean a lock of that construction; for, the patent having long ago
                    expired, such locks may be made by anybody, only Bramah’s name must not be used.
                    Messrs Mordan’s locks are the same as Bramah’s, except that they make the number
                    of sliders odd, while Messrs Bramah make it even.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Letter Locks.—</hi> At one time it used to be supposed that
                    locks which could only be opened by setting a number of rings or disks to a
                    particular combination of letters could not possibly be opened by anybody who
                    was not in possession of the secret; and hence they were also called
                    puzzle-locks. At first they were made with a fixed combination, which could not
                    be changed. Afterwards the rings were made double, the inner one having the
                    notch in it which the bolt had to pass, and the outer one capable of being
                    fitted on to the inner in any position, by unscrewing some part of the lock, so
                    that you might set them to any combination desired. This was the first instance
                    of a changeable lock, of which we shall have more to say further on. But it was
                    afterwards found that these puzzle-locks have just the same vulnerable point as
                    all our locks had until lately, viz., that the pressure of the bolt can be felt
                    on some of the rings more than on the others; and Mr Hobbs says emphatically, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Rudimentary Treatise on Locks,</hi> “wherever that is the
                    case, that lock can be picked.” Apart from this defect, these locks have very
                    much gone out of use on account of their being troublesome to handle, and
                    perhaps also from the risk of forgetting the combination to which the lock was
                    set last, if it has been left for some time; and therefore we do not think it
                    necessary to go farther into the details of their construction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chubb’s Locks.—</hi> Of the multitude of locks which have been
                    made on the many-tumbler principle invented by Barron, none enjoyed so much
                    celebrity before Hobbs’s as Chubb’s. This was partly due to superior workmanship
                    and use of more tumblers than usual, and perhaps still more to the inventor
                    having had the good fortune to hit upon the name “detector” for a certain part
                    of the machinery, which, besides adding to the security against any mode of
                    picking then known, also captivated the public with the idea of discovering if
                    anybody had been tampering with the lock, though the operator might depart in
                    ignorance that he had left any trace of his attempt behind him. It is remarkable
                    that the detector was not even then a new invention; for a lock exactly the same
                    in principle, but slightly different in arrangement, had been previously made by
                    a Mr Ruxton, and is described in Price’s treatise on <hi rend="italic">Locks and
                    Keys,</hi> &amp;c., 1856. In the same way false notches were used in Strutt’s
                    tumbler lock above thirty years before they were reinvented, by Chubb and
                    others, with the idea of defeating the tentative method of picking by them. In
                    all lever or tumbler locks there is a square pin B, called the stump, rivetted
                    to the bolt, which has to clear the passage in the tumblers called the gating.
                    The original form of Chubb’s detector is shown in fig. 16 by the lever DT, which
                    turns on a pin in the middle, and is acted upon at its end T by a spring S,
                    which will evidently allow some play to the lever on either side of the corner
                    X, but the moment it is pushed past that point the spring will carry it further
                    in the same direction, like what is called in clock-work a jumper. In its proper
                    position that end always remains above the turning-point; but, if any one of the
                    tumblers is raised too high, the other end D of the detector, which reaches over
                    all the tumblers, is lifted so far that the end T is sent down below the corner,
                    and the tooth T then falls into a notch in the bolt, and so prevents it from
                    being drawn back, even though all the tumblers are raised properly by the right
                    key, which at once reveals that somebody has been trying to pick the lock. The
                    way to open it then is to turn the key the other way, as if to overlock the
                    bolt; you observe a short piece of gating near the end of the tumblers, to allow
                    the bolt to advance just far enough to push the tooth of the detector up again
                    by means of its inclination there, and then the lock can be opened as usual. In
                    some more recent locks the tumbler is made in another form. The back tumbler, or
                    the one which has to be raised highest, has a pin <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    reaching over all the others, and if any of them are overlifted that back
                    tumbler is also, and then a square corner <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in it gets
                    past the end of the detector spring <hi rend="italic">ks,</hi> and is held up.
                    It is set right by overlocking the bolt as before, the bolt itself raising the
                    end <hi rend="italic">k</hi> of the spring, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n770/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0770-0747"/> letting the tumbler fall. This form of detector
                    is, however, inferior to the other, as it informs the picker what he has done,
                    by the back tumbler itself being held up, which he can feel directly.</p>
                <p>But since Mr Hobbs’s mode of picking locks became known all these detectors have
                    become useless. Some persons have even gone so far as to say that the detector
                    may be made a guide to picking. Whether this be so or not, the detector does not
                    act unless some of the tumblers are raised too high, which they never are by a
                    skilful operator on this plan, nor does it act (even if thrown by accident)
                    against picking backwards, or feeling the way to shoot the bolt a little
                    further, as if to free the detector; and in this way the measure of the key can
                    be taken without any hindrance from the detector. Before 1851 tumbler locks were
                    seldom made with false notches, except Strutt’s, in which the tumblers were in
                    the form of quadrants, with a very large angular motion, and a number of short
                    or false notches and one deep one. But after that year Chubb and other makers of
                    tumbler locks adopted false notches, together with revolving curtains, which
                    cover the straight part of the keyhole as soon as the key is turned, and barrels
                    going down from the back of the curtain to prevent a false key or pick from
                    turning without turning the curtain; other obstacles were added, of which the
                    object is in all cases to prevent the maintaining of pressure of the stump upon
                    the tumblers at the same time that the tumblers themselves are moved, or, as Mr
                    Hobbs called it, tickled, by some other instrument. These provisions undoubtedly
                    make the locks more difficult to pick, but it is by no means safe to assume that
                    a lock will never be picked, merely because it would take a first-rate hand a
                    long time to do it or gradually make his key.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hobbs's Lock.—</hi> The invention which most directly meets the
                    defect of all previous locks is Mr Hobbs’s “movable stump,” which is not
                    rivetted into the bolt as usual, but is set on the end <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    of a bent lever <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> (fig. 17) which lies in a hollow of
                    the bolt A behind it, turning on a pivot in the bolt itself, and kept steady by
                    a small friction-spring <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The stump comes through a hole
                    in the bolt large enough to let it have a little play; and the long end <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> of the lever stands just above the edge of a square pin <hi
                    rend="italic">d,</hi> which is fixed in the back plate of the lock. When the
                    lock is locked, if you push the bolt back, you produce no sensible pressure on
                    the tumblers, but only just enough to turn this protector lever, as Mr Hobbs
                    calls it, on its pivot <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> and so bring down its end <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> in front of the square pin, and then the bolt can no more
                    be pushed back than when held by Chubb’s detector. The protector is set free
                    again by merely pushing the bolt forward with the key, without reference to the
                    tumblers. It was found, however, that in this state the protector could be
                    prevented from acting by a method used by the inventor himself for another
                    purpose, viz., pushing a piece of watch-spring through the keyhole, and up
                    behind the bolt, so as to reach the protector at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and
                    keep it up while you push the bolt back, or, again, by pushing up the
                    watch-spring between any two of the tumblers, and holding the end <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> of the protector with it, so as to press the stump against
                    the tumblers. Both these devices, however, are prevented now by letting in a
                    feather FF in a groove between the bolt and the back of the lock, which no
                    watch-spring can pass, and also bringing a piece of the feather forward through
                    the front gating of the tumblers just under the stump. In this form the lock is
                    safe against any mode of picking at present known, unless the keyhole happens to
                    be large enough to admit the inspecting method, which is this. A person
                    intending to pick the lock goes beforehand and smokes the bellies, or lower
                    edges of the tumblers, through the keyhole^ When the key comes, it wipes off the
                    black on each tumbler, according to the length of the bit which raises it; and
                    then, when the picker returns, he throws a strong light into the keyhole, and,
                    by means of a narrow reflector put into it, reads off, as it were, the length of
                    bit required to raise each tumbler to the proper height. This operation may
                    sound impossible; but it is an established method of lock-picking in America. It
                    requires a largish keyhole however, and it may be prevented by any kind of
                    revolving cylinder which will conceal the view of the tumblers while the keyhole
                    is open. The inspecting method might also be frustrated by making the acting
                    part of the bellies of all the tumblers no longer than would be reached by the
                    shortest bit in the key. In that case, the long bits would not begin to act at
                    their points, but on their sides, and would leave no measure of their length
                    upon the tumblers.</p>
                <p>A multitude of other many-tumbler locks acted on by springs, and with various
                    kinds of detectors and revolving curtains, all more or less upon the same
                    principles, may be seen described in Price’s book above-mentioned, but we are
                    not aware that any of them have ever come into general use, or are superior to
                    Chubb’s or equal to Hobbs’s protector locks. There is another group of locks
                    which involve fanciful and thick ugly keys, and for that or other reasons have
                    not got much beyond patents and exhibitions. “Revolving curtains” have been
                    proved to be less serious impediments to picking than they would seem, inasmuch
                    as they must leave room for an instrument no thicker than the key itself to
                    turn. The only kind of curtain that is not open to this objection must be one
                    that absolutely prevents any touching of the bolt while any instrument at all is
                    within the lock, and projects at all outside. Mr Hobbs accomplished that by the
                    odd-looking contrivance of a key consisting only of its web, or flat or acting
                    part, which is pushed into the lock, and then carried round by a fixed handle in
                    another place, which closes the keyhole until it has come round again and
                    delivered the key-web ready to be taken out by a proper hook. But this was too
                    troublesome for common use. The same object is effected in another way by Sir E.
                    Beckett’s lock, which we shall presently describe.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Tucker’s Locks.—</hi> There have been several locks on the disk
                    principle invented in succession by Mr Tucker of Fleet Street, London, the first
                    two of which had revolving disks; and in the last and more simple one, patented
                    in 1855, though the disks no longer revolve, they slide between fixed plates
                    without springs, and do not turn on a pin like common tumblers, and will stand
                    in differently any where. It will be sufficient to describe the last of these
                    inventions, as Mr Tucker himself states it to possess all the elements of
                    security of the former ones, with the advantages of being much cheaper, because
                    more simple in construction. In fig. 18 TT is one of the sliders, which are
                    separated by thin fixed plates, and slide upon the guide-pins at TT, and have
                    also friction-springs X pressing on them to keep <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n771/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0771-0748"/> them steady. S is the bolt stump, which can only
                    enter I, the gating of the tumblers, when they are pushed the proper distance
                    towards the left, which the key will do as soon as it turns towards the left, in
                    the usual way of unlocking. But something else still prevents the bolt from
                    falling, and that is the flat curtain C, which turns with the key, and has also
                    a barrel B, as in several of the other locks we have spoken of. This curtain
                    prevents the stump from being pressed against the tumblers, being just big
                    enough to keep it from touching them until it has turned nearly three quarters
                    round, when the pin S, which stands up on the stump, can enter the opening D in
                    the curtain (shown by a dotted line in the drawing, to prevent confusion). But
                    by the time the curtain has got so far round, any instrument in the keyhole
                    would be prevented by the barrel from reaching the tumblers so as to push them
                    back and feel the pressure of the stump; at least so the inventor asserts, and
                    we do not venture to contradict him; but it must be remembered that no revolving
                    curtain and barrel have yet been able to prevent the instruments of the American
                    lock-pickers from reaching and moving the tumblers at the same time that the
                    barrel is being pressed the other way in order to keep up pressure on the
                    bolt.</p>
                <p>We have not yet explained how the bolt in this lock is drawn back when the
                    curtain has got into the proper position for it. It is not done by the last bit
                    in the key acting directly on the bolt as usual, but by a <hi rend="superscript"
                    > -</hi> bit P fixed on the curtain itself, which acts upon the notch B in the
                    bolt, as the key usually does. And this same bit P performs another function in
                    locking, viz., shooting all the tumblers into the position here shown by
                    striking against a pin which is set in the bottom one, and comes up to the
                    curtain, and so carries all the others with it by means of the square notch
                    which is cut in all of them, except the one which has the pin in it. It must be
                    observed that the curtain does not lie close upon the tumblers, but there is the
                    thickness of the bolt, or of the bit P, between them. A spring locks into the
                    curtain and prevents it from being turned, except when this spring is pressed
                    down by putting a key into the keyhole. One object of making the curtain, and
                    not the key, to lock and unlock the bolt is that you guard against the risk of
                    what is called short-locking, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> sending the bolt in
                    any common tumber-lock not quite far enough for the tumblers to drop. There are
                    means by which a person intending afterwards to pick a lock might cause it to
                    lock short, if he had previous access to it, or possession of the key, at least
                    as locks are generally made, and then, of course, he has only to pull the bolt
                    back, the tumblers having never fallen. Moreover, this arrangement in Tucker’s
                    lock allows it to be locked by any key that will turn in the keyhole, though it
                    cannot be unlocked by any but the true key, or one which will move all the
                    tumblers to the right place for the stump to enter them. Mr Tucker has also
                    applied the curtain in his padlocks in such a way that the shackle has a tail
                    reaching inwards and resting against the curtain at all times, except when it is
                    in the proper position for opening, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> when this tail
                    is opposite to a segment cut out of the curtain corresponding to the opening D
                    in the lock just now described, but much larger. The object of this is to obtain
                    greater strength than usual to resist all attempts to force the shackle open.
                    The cheapness of these locks is due to the circumstance that all the principal
                    parts can be stamped out of sheet brass, the curtain alone being cast with the
                    barrel and bit P on it, and its face turned, which is a cheaper operation than
                    filing. In this respect it approaches to Mr Hobbs’s style of lock-making; only
                    he has carried the stamping and machine-finishing system much further; indeed,
                    it is hardly exaggerating to say that he has abolished the use of the file, and
                    left nothing to hand labour except the mere fitting of the pieces together, and
                    putting the tumblers in the right position to have the gating cut according to
                    the key.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nettlefold’s Bolt.—</hi> We have already alluded to padlocks,
                    and we shall do so no farther, because they are generally of exactly the same
                    internal construction as other locks of the same maker. And, for the same
                    reason, it is unnecessary to describe the various modifications of the fastening
                    part of locks to adapt them to peculiar uses or positions; but there is one
                    which does seem to be worth a short notice, viz., an invention of Mr Nettlefold,
                    patented in 1839, for making the bolt hook into the striking plate, against
                    which it locks. Fig. 19 will explain the nature of the contrivance at once. We
                    have inserted no tumblers, because it may be used with one kind of lock as well
                    as another. It is convenient for writing-desks, sliding cupboards, and even for
                    drawers, which can often be prized open by merely putting in a screwdriver above
                    the lock, and forcing up the piece over it just enough to let the bolt, which is
                    generally short, pass. There are other ways of doing the same thing, such as
                    making the bolt itself hooked, and giving it two motions, first vertical, to
                    shoot it out, and then horizontal, to hook it into the striking plate; and some
                    Bramah locks are made with a kind of annular bolt, which forms a rim to the
                    cylinder, with a segment cut off in one place to let the striking plate come
                    down, which is then taken hold of by the other part of the ring as it revolves.
                    Bramah locks of portfolios, and articles of that kind, are usually made in this
                    way, which is very cheap and simple.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Master-Keys.—</hi> It is often convenient to have a set of
                    locks so arranged that the key of one will open none of the others, and yet the
                    owner of the whole may have one master-key that will open them all. In the old
                    locks with fixed wards this was done by making the wards of a slightly different
                    form, and yet such that one skeleton will pass them all, just as the
                    skeleton-key in fig. 4 will serve for the warded key of fig. 3, and a multitude
                    of others. In locks with sliders or tumblers, the way is to make one tumbler in
                    each lock with a wider gating, so as not to require lifting so high as it does
                    in the other locks of the set; then the key of that lock will raise that tumbler
                    in that lock high enough to clear the stump, and yet the master-key, which has a
                    longer bit in that place, will not raise it too high, because the gating is.
                    wide enough for both; but the special key of that lock will not open any other
                    of the set which has not the same tumbler widened in the gating. Mr Chubb, many
                    years ago, made a set of locks for the Westminster Bridewell, with keys for the
                    different grades of officers. The owner of the head key can stop out any of the
                    under keys; and if any attempt is made to pick any lock, and the detector is
                    thrown, it cannot be released by any of the subordinate keys, though they can
                    open the lock in its normal state, and consequently the governor must be
                    acquainted with it. There are a variety of other forms of many-tumblered locks,
                    but none of them involve any novelty in principle, and they are all capable of
                    being dealt with in the same way; and therefore we shall at once pass on to
                    another class of locks, viz., those which shut of themselves, and are
                    called—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spring or Latch Locks.—</hi> These locks we chiefly notice
                    because they require a particular provision to make them in the smallest degree
                    secure, and are, nevertheless, often left without it, by way of saving a
                    shilling or two in their price, and multitudes of street-door robberies are
                    committed in consequence. The former of these two names is <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n772/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0772-0749"/> generally used for a lock which shuts of itself
                    on a box or drawer, or articles of that kind; and the latter for street or
                    room-door locks which shut of themselves, and open with a handle on the inside,
                    but only with a key on the outside. In the simplest and cheapest form of these
                    locks there is no pretence of any security except a few fixed wards, which the
                    key has to pass; and, as before explained, that is no security at all against
                    anybody with the smallest dexterity, and with a serious intention of opening the
                    lock. Next to them, or rather below them, pretending to be what they are not,
                    come the locks which lock a certain distance themselves by means of a spring,
                    but can be locked further by the key, and have tumblers, but no fixed wards
                    (which a good tumbler-lock does not require). But though this kind of lock
                    cannot be opened when it is thus double locked, except by the key, or some
                    efficient inode of picking, yet when they are only self-locked the tumblers are
                    of no more use than if they did not exist, and the lock can be opened by any bit
                    of bent wire that will go into the keyhole. It should be remarked, however, that
                    the Bramah lock is just as secure as usual when used for a spring or latch lock,
                    because the key cannot turn at all without pushing in the sliders properly. But
                    in this, as in all latch-locks, it is very unsafe to "have a handle which pulls
                    back, as it can easily be reached by a wire put through a hole in the door; the
                    handle should always be made to turn, like a common room-door handle.</p>
                <p>There are two ways in which spring-locks with tumblers are made as safe as the
                    same lock with an ordinary bolt. One is to make a click or catch fall into the
                    bolt when it is drawn back, and not to make the tumblers to fall when the bolt
                    is drawn back; in the shutting of the door this catch is pushed back by some
                    knob projecting for the purpose, and then the tumblers fall and hold it fast.
                    Prison locks are made in that way. But this will not do for a latch-lock which
                    is intended to open by a handle on one side of the door. For that purpose the
                    proper plan is that which is now adopted in all good latch and spring locks, not
                    to let the key act directly on the bolt, which has no stump, but on the false
                    bolt which lies on the top of the real one, and has the stump fixed in it. When
                    the real bolt is shut by the spring it carries the false one with it, and that
                    is then locked by the tumblers. But the real bolt can be pushed back by the door
                    shutting, or pulled back by the handle, without moving the false bolt, though it
                    cannot be reached through the keyhole. In buying a lock, the test of this is to
                    see whether the stump moves as you push or pull the bolt back. If it does the
                    lock is good for nothing, unless it is on some other peculiar construction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Latches and Latch Locks.—</hi> The latter of these, so called
                    by Mr Chubb, is substantially on the principle just now described, and so is
                    Hobbs’s and Hart’s latch lock, which also has the protector stump, and therefore
                    is as unpickable as their other locks, provided neither the handle nor the bolt
                    can be got at. Chubb’s latch (not his latch-lock) consists only of four
                    tumblers, which come out and form the bolt, and fit between a sort of mouth in
                    the striking-plate on the door post, and have all to be lifted to the same
                    height by the key; but that can easily be picked by the tentative method, though
                    it might delay a common street thief for an inconvenient time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spring Curtain.—</hi> All latch locks for street doors are
                    liable to stick fast through dirt getting between the tumblers, especially in a
                    smoky town. They will keep clean much longer if the keyhole is protected by Sir
                    E. Beckett^s self-acting spring curtain, which can be added to any lock which is
                    worth it. It consists only of a small thin steel plate, sliding on the key-pin,
                    and another pin just below the keyhole to guide it, with a slight spring behind,
                    for which there is room in any latch lock with a sliding locking plate over the
                    bolt They are not patented, and the cost is quite insignificant, and it is odd
                    they are not more commonly insisted on by purchasers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Safe Locks -with Small Keys. —</hi> In all the locks we have
                    yet mentioned the bolt is acted on by the key, even though the key may not touch
                    it; the key must therefore be strong enough to move the bolt besides lifting the
                    tumblers, or whatever is substituted for them, and this makes the key for a
                    large lock too large and heavy to be conveniently carried in the pocket, and a
                    bunch of such keys impossible. To get over this difficulty, most of the makers
                    of iron safes have adopted the plan (we do not know by whom invented) of
                    shooting a large bolt, or a number of bolts, by means of a handle, and then a
                    small lock with a small key locks into one of them, and thus fastens them all.
                    The security then depends upon the impregnability of the small lock against
                    fraudulent picking or forcible evisceration. There are certain thieves’
                    instruments by which a force sufficient to tear open the inside of a lock can be
                    inserted through a keyhole of the common size. This, however, is now defeated by
                    cutting out a piece of the back plate, and then screwing it on again with only a
                    few small screws; and so that alone gives way under any bursting pressure,
                    whether from the instrument called the jack-in-the-box, or from gunpowder, which
                    is another of the thieves’ methods for cutting the knot which they cannot untie.
                    If the small lock, therefore, cannot be picked, or forced, this mode of locking
                    the bolts of a large door is quite safe, and you have the advantage of a very
                    powerful lock with nothing to carry in your pocket larger than a small desk
                    key.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sir E. Beckett's Lock.—</hi> A lock was invented by Sir Edmund
                    Beckett (formerly Denison) in 1852, but not patented, which combines the
                    advantages of large and strong works with a keyhole so narrow that no instrument
                    strong enough to injure the lock could be got in, nor a reflector to observe the
                    bellies of the tumblers; and the bolt is not only shot by turning the handle,
                    but locked besides, without using any key at all. This lock enjoys the
                    distinction of being the only one of English invention which was pronounced
                    secure against any known method of picking, by Messrs Hobbs and Tomlinson, in
                    the treatise before referred to.</p>
                <p>In fig. 20 are shown the tumblers T, turning on a pin at or near the middle of
                    their length, so as to be nearly balanced, though in small locks this is
                    unnecessary. Between every two adjacent tumblers, and between the bolt and the
                    tumbler next to it, there is a thin steel plate, which occupies the position
                    shown by the dotted lines PP. These plates have one edge lying against the upper
                    side of the lock, so that they cannot turn at all on the tumblerpin, which goes
                    through them quite loosely. One or two of the plates should be bent a little to
                    make them act as friction springs on the tumblers when the cap of the lock <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n773/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0773-0750"/> is on, so that they will stand indifferently in
                    any position. In the figure they are drawn all pressed down, so as to prevent
                    the stump S from entering the gating, and this has been done by the long tail Y
                    of the handle, which, it is easy to see, will raise the left end of the
                    tumblers, and depress the right, after the fan-tailed piece X of the handle has
                    shut the bolt. After the tumblers have been raised to the proper height by
                    turning the key half round (where it may be stopped by the plates P, P), the
                    stump can enter the gatings, and the bolt can be drawn back by the handle, the
                    tail Y then doing nothing. So far as we have yet gone, the lock would possess no
                    greater security than any other many-tumblered lock; but there is a steel
                    curtain CC, which does not revolve as usual, but slides on two pins set in the
                    back of the lock, and is pressed up against the front plate by two spiral
                    springs, so as to close the keyhole completely, except when it is pressed in.
                    From the back of the curtain there goes a kind of square plug (shown in section
                    at fig. 21), which can be pushed through a hole in the back plate, and has a
                    notch in it just in the plane of the bolt, and the bolt itself has a corner
                    there; in this way, when the curtain is up, the bolt can be drawn back through
                    the notch in the curtain plug; but when the plug is pushed in ever so little the
                    bolt cannot be drawn back, because its corner cannot pass the curtain plug, and
                    in this position the stump cannot be made to touch the tumblers, except one of
                    them, which is made a little longer than the rest (as shown at T in fig. 20), in
                    order to keep the bolt steady. It is evident then that as soon as the curtain is
                    pushed in, to admit any instrument whatever, the bolt is held fast, and it
                    becomes impossible to put any pressure of the stump upon the tumblers; in other
                    words, the tentative mode of picking is impossible. In small locks the curtain
                    has no plug, but merely works against the edge of a second stump of the bolt,
                    which can only pass when the curtain is up, and it slides on the drill-pin and
                    another pin below it.</p>
                <p>The security of the lock is farther increased by the addition (DEG) of what may
                    be called a detector, as it does detect if the bolt has not been shot far enough
                    by the person who locked it, and, what is of more consequence, prevents it from
                    being opened in that state. It turns on a hinge or pin at G, and is held up or
                    down by a jumperspring at E, as in Chubb’s first detector. In fig. 20 it is
                    shown as held down, or out of the way of the bolt; but, as the handle turns back
                    again and draws back the bolt, the pin below X raises the detector a little, and
                    then the spring is ready to throw its tooth into the notch in the bolt as soon
                    as it is shot only about half-way. In that state the bolt cannot be drawn back
                    without turning the handle far enough for the fan-tail X to send the detector
                    down again below the corner of the spring, and by doing that you will also have
                    locked all the tumblers, and so made the lock fast until the key comes to open
                    it. And it is to be observed that the curtain cannot be pushed in until the bolt
                    is fully shot, so that no exploration of the lock can take place while it is
                    open, or even partially open. By adding a spring catch under the curtain, to be
                    freed by one of the tumblers when it is fully locked, it may be arranged, if
                    required, that the curtain could not be pushed in, not only uni il the bolt is
                    shot, but until the tumblers are locked also.</p>
                <p>The following, therefore, are the advantages of this lock. 1. A yerj large lock,
                    with all its parts strong, only requires a very small key, not weighing above a
                    quarter of an ounce. 2. No key is required to lock it, and you cannot leave the
                    key in the lock (a fruitful source of mischief), and yet it is free from the
                    inconvenience of spring-locks, which sometimes shut themselves when not
                    intended, and moreover, when large, require large and strong keys to open them.
                    3. It cannot get out of order from the usual causes of the tumblers sticking
                    together, or tumbler-springs breaking, because there are none, and the tumblers
                    do not touch each other, but the friction-plates between them. 4. The keyhole
                    being always quite closed by the curtain, except while the key is in, the lock
                    is protected from dirt and from the effects of a damp or smoky atmosphere, which
                    injures other locks. 5. The smallness of the keyhole prevents the insertion of
                    any instrument strong enough to force the lock, and also prevents inspection. 6.
                    It is pronounced by the highest authority to be secure against any known mode of
                    picking.</p>
                <p>7. It requires no delicacy of construction or high finish in any of the parts,
                    and the moving parts are few—in fact, the whole of them together are fewer than
                    the number of springs alone in the great American lock of Day &amp; Newell. 8.
                    It is free from the incumbrance of a patent, the inventor being one of those who
                    agree with the opinion of the jury on philosophical instruments in the
                    exhibition of 1851, and with many of the first engineers and most scientific
                    men, that “patents are a great obstruction to the progress of science,” and
                    waste, on the whole, more money than they gain for real inventors.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Changeable Key Locks.</hi></p>
                <p>Any lock with many tumblers may be changed by taking it off and transposing any
                    two or more of the tumblers; but it will then want a different key, and the
                    process is too troublesome to be resorted to except when there is reason to
                    apprehend that the original key has fallen into bad hands, or had a copy taken
                    of it. A lock which can be locked by a great number of keys, but can only be
                    opened by the one which locked it last, is evi dently an immense addition to
                    security. Those keys may either be all distinct, or there may be a great number
                    of different webs, or stepped parts, fitting to a common handle; or each bit or
                    step may be separate, and all screwed together into the key frame as shown in
                    fig 22.</p>

                    the right one.</p>
                <p>The first changeable key lock known in England was Day &amp; Newell’s ‘‘
                    Parautoptic” (inspection-defying) lock,whichwasbrought from America by Mr Hobbs
                    at the time of the 1851 Exhibition, and has been largely used since for banks
                    and other safes. It was fully described in the last edition of this work, and in
                    the books above referred to; but in this place we will describe instead a much
                    simpler form of it, since introduced by Mr Hart of the firm of</p>
                <p>Hobbs, Hart, &amp; Co, The principle of all changeable key locks is that instead
                    of a single stump fixed to the bolt, there are as many stumps as tumblers, and
                    each one is the projecting part S of a slider PPS which can ride up and down on
                    two pins PP in the bolt, and will stay at any height where it is left when the
                    bolt B is shot. Fig. 23 shows the lock open and the slider stumps lying in the
                    jaws or gating of the tumblers ready to be raised to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n774/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0774-0751"/> any height. In fig. 24 the holt has been shot,
                    and the sliders carried forward with it. Just before they leave the tumblers
                    they are received by the two small teeth C, C on the frame of the lock, holding
                    each slider at whatever height it may then be; those teeth go right down to the
                    thin part of the bolt or as deep as the sum of all the tumblers and sliders. In
                    this figure the topmost slider is received at its third notch, and each of those
                    below it at some other notch. The tumblers having fallen behind all the stumps,
                    the sliders cannot move until the tumblers are all raised again to the various
                    heights at which they left them, which is possible only by the key that locked
                    the lock. These locks have</p>
                <p>Hobbs’s protector behind the bolt; ana the bit which moves the bolt is behind a
                    revolving curtain (the darkest circle) which is kept steady by one of the
                    tumblers resting on its flattened top. The bellies of the tumblers are
                    shortened, to obviate a certain trick by which one of Newell’s locks was picked,
                    but which it is not necessary now to explain. So far as we can judge, this lock
                    has more than all the advantages of that, as it is much less complicated and
                    liable to get out of order from any cause except that to which all locks with
                    spring tumblers are liable, viz., from two tumblers getting stuck together by
                    dirt, so that one of them rises too high with its neighbour. Oiling tumblers is
                    accordingly fatal to them, though it is necessary in other parts of a lock.</p>
                <p>The keys of these locks are practically made not of distinct bits screwed into a
                    key frame as in fig. 22, which is the plan used in the Day &amp; Newell lock,
                    and makes a heavy thing to carry, but separate webs are made, each complete in
                    itself, and fitting into a thickish key pipe which need not be carried about.
                    You may leave it near the safe, and lock up therein, or keep somewhere else, all
                    the bits except the one you use for the day, and carry that in your waistcoat
                    pocket. For such a lock as that described you may have as many of the sixty
                    million bits as you like, and may get new ones from time to time. Or you may
                    have separate bits, as in the parautoptic lock, but in that case you must take
                    good care of the key whenever the lock is shut.</p>
                <p>The risk of tumblers sticking together in a changeable lock, or any other, may be
                    obviated by not using springs but putting thin plates between the tumblers, as
                    in Sir E. Beckett’s lock, giving the tumblers tails coming down on the right of
                    the keyhole in figs. 23, 24, and making the revolving curtain act on all the
                    tails just before the key comes out, by means of an intermediate lever, or else
                    by a small handle which might at the same time bring an escutcheon or external
                    curtain over the keyhole.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Yale Lock.</hi></p>
                <p>This American lock is remarkable for the smallness of its key, which is shown
                    from <hi rend="italic">k</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in fig. 25, full size,
                    and is a thin flat piece of steel weighing only ’ 1 of an ounce. The narrowness
                    of the keyhole would be an impediment to introducing a picking instrument
                    together with any other intended at the same time to give a twisting pressure to
                    the small barrel <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> which has to turn, as in the Bramah
                    lock, in order to move the bolt, which is not shown in these figures. That may
                    be done either as in Bramah locks or by a tongue or bit attached to the end <hi
                    rend="italic">ab</hi> of the barrel as in several other locks. The barrel is
                    prevented from being turned, except by the proper key, thus. The (apparently)
                    five plugs with spiral springs over them in fig. 25 are really all divided at
                    the cross line <hi rend="italic">be,</hi> being all now lifted to the proper
                    height by the key. Consequently the barrel <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> can turn
                    round, as there is no plug either projecting from it or projecting into it. But
                    when the key is out, all the plugs are pushed down by the springs, and so the
                    upper ones descend into the barrel and hold it fast. And again, if any of the
                    steps of a false key are too high, some of the lower plugs will be pushed up
                    beyond the baιτel into the holes above them, and so the barrel cannot turn. The
                    bevelled end of the key near <hi rend="italic">a</hi> enables it to be pushed in
                    under the plugs, though with some friction and resistance. It does not appear,
                    however, to be any more secure than the Bramah lock, except by virtue of the
                    smallness of its keyhole. Nor is the flatness and thinness of the key of any
                    particular value on a bunch of keys, though very convenient for a single, latch
                    key to be carried in the waistcoat pocket, as extreme security is not requisite
                    for latch locks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Yale Time Lock.</hi></p>
                <p>The same company have an entirely different kind of lock from all the preceding
                    ones; it consists of a watch in a case enclosed within the safe door, and has a
                    dial with pins marked for every hour, something like a “tell-tale clock.” Any
                    number of these pins can be pulled out a little, and the watch will let a
                    weighted lever fall against the bolts of the safe during all those hours, and
                    hold it up during all the other hours, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> For
                    security the case contains two such watches, so that one may do the work if the
                    other happens to fail. Thus no key is used (except the watch key for winding),
                    but the safe can be opened by a handle moving its bolts at such hours as the
                    watch is set for, and at no other.</p>
                <p>It should be added that Mr Hobbs introduced into England in 1851 the American
                    system of manufacturing every part of a lock by machinery, so that all similar
                    locks of a given size are exactly alike, except the keys, and the gating in the
                    tumblers, which is cut when they are lifted by the key; and even those are done
                    by machinery adjustable to secure what may be called an infinite number of
                    variations. The same system has been adopted in the Government rifle
                    manufactories, and for clocks and watches; and no hand-work can compete with it.
