                <p><label type="entry">LITHGOW, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (c.
                    1583-c. 1660), a noted Scottish traveller, was born in Lanark, where his father
                    was a burgess, possessed of considerable heritable property. The date generally
                    assigned to his birth is 1583; and he was educated at the grammar school of his
                    native town, then celebrated as a seminary of learning. His natural disposition
                    was probably active and restless, as even in his boyhood he tells us that he
                    made voyages to both the Orkneys and the Shetlands, and somewhat later travelled
                    through the Low Countries, Germany, Bohemia, and Switzerland. The final
                    impelling cause of his leaving Scotland, however, appears to have been some
                    savage outrage committed either upon himself or on one nearly connected with
                    him, arising, it is thought, from some love affair, which gave him an
                    intolerable disgust to home. He left his native country about 1608 or 1609, and
                    proceeded to Paris, where he remained ten months, and then crossed the Alps to
                    Rome and Naples; after which he wandered through Istria, Dalmatia, Albania,
                    Greece, Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, Palestine, and Egypt, most of his
                    journey having been performed on foot. In the course of his travels he escaped
                    innumerable dangers from robbers, and hardships from exposure to inclement
                    weather. He returned to England by Sicily and Paris. Another tour which he made
                    lay through Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, Tripoli, Hungary, Germany, and Poland. On
                    his arrival in London he became an object of interest to King James, who, on the
                    spirit of travel again returning upon him, furnished him with commendatory
                    letters to all kings, princes, dukes, &lt;fcc., whose territories he might
                    desire to visit. In 1619, accordingly, he went over to France, and thence passed
                    through Portugal and Spain as far as Malaga. There he was apprehended as a spy,
                    and after suffering the most excruciating tortures, first in prison and
                    afterwards in the Inquisition, he was at length released on the interference of
                    the English consul, and allowed to return to England in 1621. The minute
                    description which he gives of the terrible torture to which he was subjected is
                    almost unequalled for horror, and, when he arrived in London, he had the
                    appearance of a man more dead than alive. He was carried on a feather bed to
                    Theobald’s in order that King James might be an eyewitness of what he called his
                    “martyred anatomy.” The whole court crowded to see him. The king commanded that
                    the greatest care should be taken of him, and he was twice sent to Bath at his
                    Majesty’s expense. On recovering his health, he was desired by James to apply to
                    Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, for recovery of the money and other valuables
                    of which he had been plundered by the governor of Malaga, and for a thousand
                    pounds in reparation of his injuries. Gondomar gave fair promises that all his
                    demands should be granted, but nothing was done. Whereupon, having met the
                    ambassador at the royal levee, and reproached him with his perfidy, after high
                    words on both sides, Lithgow furiously assailed him with his fists, in the
                    presence of the king, the imperial ambassador, and the knights and gentlemen of
                    the court. This, of course, was an offence which could not be passed over, and,
                    though his boldness was generally commended, he had to suffer an imprisonment of
                    nine weeks in the Marshalsea. His latter years are understood to have been spent
                    in his native town, and he is said to have died somewhere about 1660.</p>
                <p>A portion of his travels appeared in a small volume in London in 1614, but the
                    complete work was not published till 1632. It has been repeatedly reprinted. It
                    was also translated into Dutch and published at Amsterdam in his lifetime. His
