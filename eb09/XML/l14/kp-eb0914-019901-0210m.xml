                    lake of northern Russia, situated between 59° 56' and 61° 46' N. lat., and 29°
                    53' and 32° 50' E. long., surrounded by the governments of St Petersburg,
                    Olonetz, and Wiborg. It has the form of a quadrilateral, elongated from
                    north-west to south-east. Its eastern and southern shores are flat and marshy,
                    whilst the north-western margin is craggy and fringed by numerous small rocky
                    islands, the largest of which are Valaam and Konevetz, and which occupy
                    altogether an area of 223 square miles. Lake Ladoga is 7000 square miles in
                    area, that is, thirty-one times as large as the Lake of Geneva; but, its depth
                    being less, it contains only nineteen times as much water as the great lake of
                    Switzerland. The greatest depth, 244 yards, is in a cavity situated in the
                    north-western part of the lake, the average depth not exceeding 100 yards. The
                    level of Lake Ladoga is 55 feet above the Gulf of Finland, but it rises and
                    falls about 7 feet according to atmospherical conditions. The western and
                    eastern shores consist of boulder clay, as well as a narrow strip on the
                    southern shore, south of which runs a ridge of crags of Silurian sandstones; the
                    hills of the northwestern shore afford a variety of granites and crystalline
                    slates of the Laurentian system, whilst the Valaam island is made up of a rock
                    which Russian geologists describe as orthoclastic hypersthenite. The granite and
                    marble of Serdobol, and the sandstone of Poutilovo, are much used for buildings
                    at St Petersburg; copper and tin from the Pitkaranda mine are exported. No less
                    than sixty rivers enter Lake Ladoga, pouring into it the waters of numberless
                    smaller lakes which lie at higher levels around it. The Volkhov, which conveys
                    the waters of Lake Ilmen, is the largest; Lake Onega discharges its waters by
                    the Svir; and the Saima system of lakes of eastern Finland contributes the
                    Wuoxen and Taipala rivers; the Syass brings the waters from the smaller lakes
                    and marshes of the Valdai plateau. Lake Ladoga discharges its surplus water by
                    means of the Neva, which flows from its southwestern corner into the Gulf of
                    Finland, rolling down its broad channel 104,000 cubic feet of water per second.
                    The water of Lake Ladoga is very pure and cold; in May its temperature on the
                    surface does not exceed 36° Fahr., and even in August it reaches only 50° and
                    53°, the average yearly temperature of the air at Valaam being 36° <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 8. The lake begins to freeze in October, but it is
                    only about the end of December that it is frozen in its deeper parts; and it
                    remains under the ice covering until the end of March, whilst wide icefields
                    continue to float in the middle of the lake until they are broken up by gales
                    and scattered on the shores. Only a small part of the Ladoga ice is discharged
                    by the Neva; but it is enough to produce in the middle of June a return of cold
                    in the northern capital. The thickness of the ice does not exceed 3 or 4 feet;
                    but during the alternations of cold and warm weather, with strong gales, in
                    winter, heaps of ice, 70 and 80 feet high, are raised on the banks and on the
                    icefields. The water of the lake is in continuous rotatory motion, being carried
                    along the western shore from north to south, and along the eastern from south to
                    north. The vegetation on the shores is poor; immense forests, which formerly
                    covered· them, are now mostly destroyed; but the fauna of the lake is somewhat
                    rich; a species of seal which inhabits its waters, as well as several arctic
                    species of crustaceans, recall its former connexion with the Arctic Ocean. The
                    great variety of sweet water <hi rend="italic">Diatomaceae</hi> which are found
                    in the ooze of the deepest parts of the lake has also an arctic character.
                    Fishing is very extensively carried on. Navigation on the lake, which is
                    practicable for only one hundred and eighty days in the year, is rather
                    difficult owing to fogs and gales, which are often accompanied, even in April
                    and September, with snow storms. The prevailing winds are north-west and
                    south-west; northeast winds cause the water to rise in the south-western part of
                    the lake, sometimes from 3 to 5 feet. A phenomenon very similar to the <hi
                    rend="italic">seiches</hi> of the Lake of Geneva is observed in connexion with
                    the rise and fall of the barometer. Steamers ply regularly in two directions
                    from St Petersburg—to the monasteries of Konevetz and Valaam, and to the mouth
                    of the Svir, whence they go up that river to Lake Onega and Petrozavodsk; and no
                    less than from 600 to 800 small vessels transport timber, firewood, planks,
                    iron, kaolin, granite, marble, fish, hay, and various small wares from the
                    northern shore to Schlüsselburg, and thence to St Petersburg. The rivers
                    Volkhov, Syass, and Svir being parts of the three great systems of canals which
                    unite the upper Volga with the Gulf of Finland, and the navigation on Lake
                    Ladoga being too dangerous for small craft, three canals with an aggregate
                    length of 70 miles were dug along the southern shore of Lake Ladoga, uniting the
                    mouths of these three rivers with the Neva at Schlüsselburg; thousands of
                    vessels pass yearly along them on their way to St Petersburg. The population on
                    the shores of the lake is sparse, and the towns Schlüsselburg, with 6000
                    inhabitants, New Ladoga (4500), Kexholm (1000), and Serdobol (800) are poor;
                    many small villages are situated on the southern, north-eastern, and western
                    shores, but the total population of the shores of Lake Ladoga does not exceed
                    35,000. The monasteries of Valaam, founded in 960, on the island of same name,
                    and Konevskiy, on the Konevetz island, founded in 1393, are highly venerated,
                    and are visited every year by many thousands of pilgrims.</p>
