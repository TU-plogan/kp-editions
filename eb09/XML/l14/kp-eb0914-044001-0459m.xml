                <p><label type="entry">LEMUR</label>, a term applied by Linnaeus to a group of
                    mammals, and suggested by the nocturnal habits and strange ghost-like appearance
                    of some of its members. As they had previously no vernacular appellation in
                    English, it has been generally adopted, and is now completely anglicized, making
                    “lemurs” in the plural. The French call them <hi rend="italic">Makis,</hi> the
                    Germans <hi rend="italic">Halbaffen,</hi> in allusion to their forming, in
                    appearance at least, a transition from monkeys to ordinary quadrupeds. For the
                    same reason they are called <hi rend="italic">Prosimiae</hi> by some systematic
                    writers. When the name was bestowed by Linnaeus, only five species were known,
                    of which one, <hi rend="italic">L.</hi><hi rend="italic">volans,</hi> Linn., <hi
                    rend="italic">Galeoprithecus</hi><hi rend="italic">volans</hi> of modern
                    writers, is now removed by common consent from the group. Notwithstanding the
                    discovery of many new and curious forms, the lemurs remain a very natural and
                    circumscribed division of the animal kingdom, though no longer considered a
                    single genus, but divided up into many genera and even families.</p>
                <p>The Lemurs, or Lemuroid animals as they ought more properly to be called, were
                    formerly associated with the monkeys in the Linnaean order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Primates,</hi> and afterwards in the <hi rend="italic">Quadrumana</hi> of
                    Cuvier, forming in that order the third main division, called by Geoffroy St
                    Hilaire <hi rend="italic">Strepsirhνna,</hi> on account of the twisted form of
                    the external nostrils, a division equivalent in value to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catαrhiηa</hi> or Old World and the <hi rend="italic">Platyrhina</hi> or New
                    World monkeys. As more complete knowledge of their organization has been
                    gradually attained, the interval which separates them structurally from the
                    monkeys has become continually more evident, and they are now considered either
                    as a distinct suborder of the <hi rend="italic">Primates,</hi> or even as
                    forming an order apart, without any very near affinities with the animals with
                    which they have hitherto been so closely associated.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The existing species are not numerous, and do not diverge widely in their
                    organization or habits, being all of small or moderate size, all adapted to an
                    arboreal life, climbing with ease, and, as they find their living, which
                    consists of fruits, leaves, birds’ eggs, small birds, reptiles, and insects,
                    among the branches of the trees, they rarely have occasion to descend to the
                    ground. None are aquatic, and none burrow in the earth. Many of the species, but
                    by no means all, are nocturnal in their habits, spending the day in sleeping in
                    holes, or rolled up in a ball, perched on a horizontal branch, or in the fork of
                    a tree, and seeking their food by night. Their geographical distribution is very
                    peculiar; by far the larger proportion of species, including all those to which
                    the term “lemur” is now especially restricted, are exclusively inhabitants of
                    Madagascar, where they are so abundant and widely distributed that it is said by
                    M. Grandidier, who has contributed more than any other traveller to enrich our
                    knowledge of the structure and manners of these animals, that there is not a
                    little wood in the whole island in which some of them cannot be found. From
                    Madagascar as a centre a few species less typical in character extend through
                    the African continent westward as far as Senegambia, and others are found in the
                    Oriental region as far east as the Philippine Islands and Celebes.</p>
                <p>The following are the essential anatomical characters common to the whole group
                    :—</p>
                <p>Teeth heterodont, or divided by their form into incisors, canines, and molars,
                    and diphyodont, or consisting of a first and second set. Molars multicuspidate.
                    Skull with complete bony margin to the orbits, which communicate freely (except
                    in <hi rend="italic">Tarsias')</hi> with the temporal fossae. Lacrymal foramen
                    outside the margin of the orbit. Clavicles well developed. Radius and ulna
                    distinot. Scaphoid, lunar, and central bones of the carpus almost always
                    separate. Five digits on the manus and pes, though the index of the manus may be
                    rudimentary. Pollex (or thumb) and hallux (or great toe) always well
                    developed—the latter especially large, opposable to the other digits, and with a
                    flat nail. The index or second digit of the pes always terminating in a long
                    pointed claw. The fingers and toes generally not tapering towards their
                    extremities, but (except in <hi rend="italic">Chiromys)</hi> dilated, flattened,
                    and rounded at the tips. Cerebral hemispheres not completely overlapping the
                    cerebellum, and but little convoluted. Stomach simple. Caecum always present,
                    generally large. The middle or transverse portion of the colon almost always
                    folded or convoluted on itself. Uterus bicornuate. Placenta non-deciduate,
                    diffused or bell-shaped—the whole of the chorion, except the cephalic pole,
                    being covered with villosities. Allantois of great size.</p>
                <p>In subdividing the group for the purpose of a more detailed description of the
                    different animals of which it is composed, it must first be noted that there are
                    two very aberrant forms, each represented by a single species—(1) the little <hi
                    rend="italic">Tarsius</hi> of the Indian archipelago, and (2) the singular <hi
                    rend="italic">Chiromys</hi> or aye-aye, which, though an inhabitant of the
                    headquarters of the order, Madagascar, and living in the same forests and under
                    the same external conditions as the most typical lemurs, exhibits a most
                    remarkable specialization in the structure of its limbs and teeth, the latter
                    being modified so as to resemble, at least superficially, those of the rodents,
                    an order in which it was once placed. The differences between these two forms
                    and the remaining lemurs is so great that the whole order naturally divides
                    itself into three families, the first of which may be again divided into four
                    subfamilies, which with the genera they contain may be thus arranged :—</p>

                <p>Upper incisors two on each side, small and separated by an interval in the middle
                    line. Upper canines large, conical, compressed, and pointed. Premolars two or
                    three, molars three on each side above and below, with numerous, more or less
                    pointed, cusps. In the front of the lower jaw are on each side two or three
                    closely approximated, long, slender teeth lying almost horizontally and
                    projecting forwards. These are generally considered to represent the incisors
                    and canines, but there is some doubt about their homologies, and they may be all
                    considered as incisors, the canine being absent. The first lower premolar larger
                    than those behind it, and shaped like a canine. The orbit and temporal fossa
                    widely continuous beneath the bar of bone (formed by the frontal and malar)
                    constituting the posterior boundary of the former cavity. The fibula well
                    developed and distinct from the tibia. All the digits of both feet (except the
                    second of the hind foot) with flat nails, and corresponding form of ungual
                    phalanges.</p>
                <p>I. Subfamily Indrisinae. —The dentition of the adult consists of thirty teeth,
                    usually expressed by the formula tf, <hi rend="italic">c⅛, p⅛,</hi> &gt;n⅜; but.

                    true molars of course not being represented, but there are two additional teeth
                    in the fore part of the lower jaw which have no successors in the permanent
                    series. Hind limbs greatly developed, but the tarsus normal. Hallux of large
                    size, and very opposable. The other toes united at their base by a fold of skin,
                    which extends as far as the end of the first phalanx. Mammae two, pectoral.
                    Caecum very large, and colon extremely long and spirally coiled.</p>
                <p>The animals of this group are, as their organization indicates, essentially
                    arboreal, and feed exclusively on fruit, leaves, buds, and flowers. When they
                    descend to the ground, which is but seldom, they sit upright on their hind legs,
                    and move from one clump of trees to another by a series of short jumps, holding
                    their arms above them in the air. They are restricted geographically to the
                    island of Madagascar. Among them are the largest members of the order. A very
                    detailed and beautifully illustrated account of their characters, external and
                    internal, and distribution and habits, is given in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Histoire Naturelle</hi><hi rend="italic">de Madagascar,</hi> by A. Grandidier
                    and Alphonse Milne-Edwards (1875). The species are not numerous and are
                    distributed into three genera.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Indris,</hi> Geoff.—Upper incisors subeqnal in size. Upper
                    canine larger than the first premolar, muzzle moderately long, ears exserted.
                    Carpus without an os centrale. Tail rudimentary. Vertebrae: C7, D12, L9, S4,
                    C9.</p>
                <p>The only well-established species is the indris (Z. <hi rend="italic"
                    >brericaudatus,</hi> Geoff., fig. 1), discovered by Sonnerat in 1780. It is the
                    largest of the lemurs, the length of the head and body being about 2 feet, and
                    the tail 2 inches. It is very variable in oolour, for although usually nearly
                    black, marked with whitish spots principally in the lumbar region and fore arm,
                    individuals have been found quite white. It inhabits exclusively the forests of
                    a part of the east coast of Madagascar, living in small troops of four or five
                    in number, and resembling in most of its habits the animals of the next
                    genus.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Propithecus,</hi> Bennett.—Second upper incisor much smaller
                    than the first. Upper canine larger than the first premolar. Muzzle rather
                    short. Ears short, concealed by the fur. An os centrale in the carpus. Tail
                    long. Vertebrae: C7, Dl 2, L8, S3, C28.</p>
                <p>The species are all subject to great variations in colour, which has led to much
                    difficulty in discriminating them, and to much confusion of synonymy. Grandidier
                    and Milne-Edwards recognize three as certainly distinct:— <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">diadema,</hi><hi rend="italic">P. verreauxii,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic">coronatus</hi> (fig. 2). Some of
                    these are to be found in almost every part of the island of Madagascar, living
                    in the woods in small bands of six or eight together, and feeding exclusively on
                    buds, flowers, and berries. Their powerful hind limbs enable them to leap from
                    tree to tree, often to a distance of ten yards, without any apparent effort,
                    seem ing to fly through the air. When obliged to descend to the ground to pass
                    from one clump of trees to another, they do not run on all fours, but stand
                    erect, and throwing their arms above their heads, progress by a series of short
                    jumps, producing an effect which is described by travellers who have seen them
                    thus in their native haunts as exceedingly ludicrous. They are not nocturnal,
                    but most active in the morning and evening, remaining seated or coiled up among
                    the branches during the heat of the day. They are naturally of a quiet and
                    gentle disposition, and do not show much intelligence. They are also less
                    vociferous than the tnιe lemurs, only when alarmed or angered making a noise
                    which has been compared to the clucking of a fowl. Like the rest of the
                    subfamily they never have more than one young one at a time.</p>

                    first. Upper canine scarcely larger than the first premolar. Muzzle very short.
                    Ears very small and hidden in the fur, which is very soft and woollv. Carpus
                    without os centrale. Tail long. Vertebrae: C7, Dll, L9, S3, C23.</p>
                <p>One species, <hi rend="italic">A.</hi><hi rend="italic">laniger</hi> (Gmelin),
                    the woolly lemur, or avahis, considerably smaller than any of the last group. It
                    differs from them in its habits, being quite nocturnal, and not associating in
                    small troops, but being always met with either alone or in pairs. It is very
                    slow in its movements, and rarely descends to the ground, but when it does it
                    walks upright like the other <hi rend="italic">Indrisinae.</hi> It is found
                    throughout the forests which clothe the mountains on the east coast of
                    Madagascar, and also in a limited district on the north-west coast, the
                    specimens from which locality are of smallersize and rather different in
                    colour.</p>
                <p>II. Subfamily Lernurinae.—The dentition in the adult consists of thirty-six
                    teeth, which as usually enumerated are ⅛, c∣, <hi rend="italic">p⅜,</hi> wιf. In
                    the forepart of the lower jaw are on each side three elongated, compressed,
                    procumbent teeth, of which the outer, usually considered the homologue of the
                    canine, is larger than the others. All have long tails. Hind limbs not of the
                    same disproportionate size as in the last group; and the caecum much less
                    developed. Tarsus but slightly elongated, the os calcis being always less than
                    one-fourth the length of the tibia. Toes of the hind feet free to the base.
                    Habitat, Madagascar and some of the adjacent Comoro islands.</p>
                <p>This group contains the typical lemurs, or those to which the term is now chiefly
                    restricted. Two rather aberrant members make it necessary to divide it into
                    three genera.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Lemur,</hi> Linn.—Upper incisors separated by an interval in
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n461/mode/1up"

                    canine, in front of which they are both placed. Muzzle elongated. Ears
                    conspicuous and tufted. Mammae two, pectoral. Vertebrae: C7, D12, L7 (or D13,
                    L6), S3, C27.</p>
                <p>Animals much about the size of a common cat, with fox-like faces, soft thick fur,
                    and long tails well clothed with hair. Not having the same disproportionate size
                    of the limbs as the last group, they are much more quadrupedal in their actions,
                    walking on the ground or running along the branches of trees on all four feet,
                    but also jump ing with marvellous agility. They are gregarious, living in small
                    troops, are diurnal in their habits, but most active towards evening, when they
                    make the woods resound with their loud cries, and feed, not only on fruits and
                    buds, but also on eggs, young birds, and insects. When at rest or sleeping, they
                    generally coil their long, bushy tails around their bodies, apparently for the
                    sake of the warmth it affords. They have usually either one or two young ones at
                    a birth, λvhich are at first nearly naked, and are carried about, hanging close
                    to and almost concealed by the hair of the mother’s belly. After a while they
                    change their position and mount upon the mother’s back, where they are carried
                    about until they are able to climb and leap by themselves. Though no member of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Indrisinae</hi> has as yet lived long enough in captivity
                    to be brought alive to Europe, the lemurs are commonly seen in menageries, and
                    often breed in England. They present a great tendency to variation in their
                    colouring, in consequence of which many nominal species have been made. The most
                    distinct, and at the same time most beautiful, is the ring-tailed lemur (Z. <hi
                    rend="italic">caitcι,</hi> Linn., fig. 4), of a delicate grey colour, and with a
                    long tail marked with alternating rings of black and white. This is said by Mr
                    G. A. Shaw (Proc. <hi rend="italic">Zooh Soc.,</hi> 1879, p. 132)</p>
                <p>to be an exception to all the other lemurs in not being arboreal, but living
                    chiefly among rocks and bushes. Pollen, however, says that it inhabits the
                    forests of the south-west parts of Madagascar, living, like its congeners, in
                    considerable troups, and not differing from them in its habits. He adds that it
                    is extremely gentle, and active and graceful in its movements, and utters at
                    intervals a little plaintive cry like that of a domestic cat. All the others
                    have the tail of uniform colour. The largest species is <hi rend="italic"
                    >L.</hi><hi rend="italic">varius,</hi> Geoff., the ruffed lemur, sometimes black
                    and white, and sometimes reddish-brown, the variation apparently not depending
                    on sex or age, but on the individual. In <hi rend="italic">L. macaco</hi> the
                    male is black and the female red. <hi rend="italic">L. mongoz,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">L. collaris,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. albifrons</hi> are
                    other well-known species.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Hapalemur,</hi> Is. Geoff.—Upper incisors very small,
                    subequal, separated widely in the middle line. Those of each side in contact
                    with each other and with the canine, the posterior one being placed on the
                    inside, and not in front of the latter. Muzzle very short and truncated. Mammae
                    four. There is apparently but one species, <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">griseus,</hi> smaller than any of the true lemurs, of a dark grey
                    colour, with round face and short ears. It is quite nocturnal, and lives chiefly
                    among bamboos, subsisting on the young shoots. A second species has been named
                    <hi rend="italic">H. simus,</hi> but it is doubtful if it is not only a
                    variety.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Lcpilemur,</hi> Is. Geoff.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcpidolcmur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Myxocebus,</hi> Peters. —Upper incisors
                    absent or only two in number and very small. Muzzle more elongated than in the
                    last. No distinct os centrale in the carpus. <hi rend="italic">L.
                    mustelinus</hi> is the best known species. It has, at all events when adult, no
                    upper incisors. It is rare, and like <hi rend="italic">Hapalemur</hi> nocturnal
                    in its habits. A second closely allied species, but with better developed
                    premaxillae, containing a pair of small styliform incisors, has been described
                    by Peters under the name of <hi rend="italic">Myxocebus caniceps {Monatsb.
                    Berlin. Akad.,</hi> 1874, p. 690).</p>
                <p>III. Subfamily Galaginae.—Dentition as in <hi rend="italic">Lemurinae,</hi> from
                    which they are distinguished by the elongation of the tarsus, caused by a
                    peculiar modification of the os calcis and the naviculare, the distal portion of
                    the former and the whole of the latter having the form of nearly cylindrical
                    rods placed side by side, while the other bones retain nearly their normal form
                    and proportion.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Chirogaleus,</hi> Geoff.—Third upper premolar very much
                    smaller than the first molar, and with only one external cusp. The animals
                    included under this name appear to form a transition between the true lemurs and
                    the galagos. The genus was originally established by Geoffroy St Hilaire in 1812
                    for the reception of three animals only known at that time by drawings made in
                    Madagascar by the traveller Commerson. Subsequent discoveries have brought to
                    light several species that may be refeιτed to it, including one or two which are
                    sometimes considered as forming a genus apart under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Microccbus.</hi> They are all small, some being less than a rat in
                    size, long-tailed, and nocturnal in their habits. One of the largest, <hi
                    rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">furcifer,</hi> is of a reddish-grey
                    colour, and is distinguished by a dark median stripe on its back which divides
                    on the top of the head into two branches, one of which passes forwards above
                    each eye. The most interesting peculiarity of these animals, a knowledge of
                    which we owe to Μ. Grandidier, is that certain species (∂. <hi rend="italic"
                    >samati, G. gliroidcs,</hi><hi rend="italic">C. milii,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >&amp;c.</hi>) during the dry season coil themselves up in holes of trees, and
                    pass into a state of torpidity, like that of the hibernating animals in the
                    winter of northern climates. Before this takes place, an immense deposit of fat
                    accumulates upon certain parts of the body, especially upon the basal portion of
                    the tail, which has then dimensions corresponding to that of the well known
                    fat-tailed sheep of the Cape, but which by the time they emerge from their
                    torpor has acquired its normal proportions. The smallest species, to which many
                    names have been given (C ’. <hi rend="italic">pusillus, rufus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">smithii,</hi> &amp;c.), lives among the small branches on the tops
                    of the highest trees, feeding on fruit and insects, and making nests which
                    resemble those of birds.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Galago,</hi> Geoff. = <hi rend="italic">Otolicnus,</hi>
                    liliger.—Third upper premolar with two large external cusps, and nearly
                    equalling the first molar in size. Os calcis about one-third the length of the
                    tibia, and the naviculare much longer than the cuboid. Vertebrae: C7, D13, L6,
                    S3, C22-26. Tail long, and generally bushy. Ears large, rounded, naked, and
                    capable of being folded at the will of the animal. Mammae four, two pectoral and
                    two inguinal.</p>
                <p>The galagos differ from all the lemuroids previously mentioned, inasmuch as they
                    are all inhabitants, not of Madagascar, but of the African continent, being
                    widely distributed in the wooded districts from Senegambia in the west to
                    Abyssinia in the east, and as far south as Natal. They pass the day in sleep,
                    but are very active at night, feeding on fruit, insects, and small birds. When
                    they descend to the ground they sit upright, and move about by jumping with
                    their hind legs, like jerboas and kangaroos. They are pretty little animals,
                    varying in size from that of a small cat to less than a rat, with large eyes and
                    ears, soft woolly fur, and long tails. There are several species, of which <hi
                    rend="italic">G. crassicaτιdatus,</hi> from Mozambique, is the largest. A
                    similar species, or perhaps variety, from Angola is <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">montiert.</hi><hi rend="italic">G. garnetti, allcni, maholi,

                    brought from Senegal by Adanson, and described in 1796 by Geoffroy, who adopted
                    the name <hi rend="italic">Galago,</hi> by which it was said to be called by the
                    natives.</p>
                <p>IV. Subfamily Lorisinae.—Dental formula as in <hi rend="italic">Lemurinae.</hi>
                    Index finger veιy short, sometimes rudimentary and nailless. Fore and hind limbs
                    nearly equal iu length. Tarsus not specially elongated. Pollex and hallux
                    diverging widely from the other digits, the hallux especially being habitually
                    directed backwards. Tail short or quite rudimentary. Mammae two, pectoral.</p>
                <p>A small group of very peculiar animals, of essentially nocturnal habits, and
                    remarkable for the slowness of their movements. They are completely arboreal,
                    their limbs being formed only for climbing and clinging to branches, not for
                    jumping or running. They have rounded heads, very large eyes, short ears, and
                    thick, short, soft fur. They feed, not only on vegetable substances, but, like
                    many of the <hi rend="italic">Lemuridae,</hi> also on insects, eggs, and birds,
                    which they steal upon while roosting at night. N one of the species are found in
                    Madagascar. One of the greatest anatomical peculiarities of these animals is the
                    breaking up of the large arterial trunks of the limbs into numerous small
                    parallel branches, constituting a <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile,</hi> which is
                    found also in the true sloths, with which the loris are sometimes confounded on
                    account of the slowness of their movements. The animals of this group are
                    usually divided into four genera, though the characters by which they are
                    separated are very trivial. There are more properly two natural divisions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A.</hi> Characterized by the index finger being small, but
                    having the complete number of phalanges, and by their Asiatic habitat.</p>
                <p>These form the genus <hi rend="italic">Loris</hi> of Geoffroy St Hilaire (1796),
                    <hi rend="italic">Stcnops</hi> of liliger (1811), but they were in 1812 divided
                    by Geoffroy into two genera, <hi rend="italic">Nycticebus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Loris,</hi> a division which has been accepted by most modern
                    zoologists.</p>
                <p>Genus <hi rend="italic">Nycticebus,</hi> Geoff.—First upper incisor larger than
                    the second, which is often early deciduous. Inner margin of the orbits separated
                    from each other by a narrow flat space. Nasal and premaxillary bones projecting
                    but very slightly in front of the maxillae. Body and limbs stout. No tail.
                    Vertebrae: C7, D17, L6, S3, C12. The species are W. <hi rend="italic"
                    >tardigradus,</hi> the common slow lemur or loris, of the Malay countries,
                    Sumatra, and Borneo; <hi rend="italic">N. javanicus,</hi> of Java; and A <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>. <hi rend="italic">cinereτιs</hi> (fig. 5), of Siam
                    and Cochin China. The habits of all are much alike. They lead a solitary life in
                    the recesses of large forests, chiefly in mountainous districts, where they
                    sleep during the day in holes or fissures of large trees, rolled up into a ball,
                    with the head between the hind legs. On the approach of evening they awake; and
                    during the night they ramble among the branches of trees, slowly and quietly, in
                    search of their food, which consists of tender leaves and fruit, small birds,
                    insects, and mice. When in quest of living prey, they move noiselessly till
                    quite close, and then suddenly seize it with one of their hands. The female
                    produces but one young one at a time. <hi rend="italic">L. tardigradus</hi> was
                    placed by Linnaeus at the head of the list of species of his genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lemur,</hi> and its habits doubtless suggested the generic name
                    which was transferred by Geoffroy to the less nocturnal and spectre-like
                    Madagascar members of the group.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    discovered by Sonnerat in 1780. The specimen brought to Paris by that traveller
                    was the only one known until 1860. Since then many others have been obtained,
                    and one has lived for several years in the gardens of the Zoological Society of
                    London. Like so many of the lemurs, it is completely nocturnal in its habits,
                    living either alone or in pairs, chiefly in the bamboo forests. Observations
                    upon captive specimens have led to the conclusion that it feeds principally on
                    succulent juices, especially of the sugar cane, which it obtains by tearing open
                    the hard woody circumference of the stalk with its strong incisor teeth. It is
                    said also to devour certain species of wood-boring caterpillars, which it
                    obtains by first cutting down with its teeth upon their burrows, and then
                    picking them out of their retreat with the claw of its attenuated middle finger.
                    It constructs large, ball-like nests of dried leaves, lodged in a fork of the
                    branches of a large tree, and with the opening on one side. The resemblance of
                    its teeth to those so characteristic of the <hi rend="italic">Rodentia</hi>
                    caused it to be placed formerly in that order, and it was only when its
                    anatomical characters were fully known that its true affinities with the lemurs

                    passed in the progress of their development, make the consideration of their
                    ancient history one of great interest. Until very recently fossil lemurs were
                    quite unknown; at all events the affinities of certain remains provisionally
                    assigned to the group were much questioned; but within the last few years the
                    existence of lemuroid animals in Europe during the later Eocene and early
                    Miocene periods has been perfectly established, and remains of a large number of
                    animals attributed, though with less certainty, to the group have been found in
                    beds of corresponding age in North America. In 1862 Rütimeyer described the
                    fragment of a right maxilla and three molars from a sidero-litic deposit
                    (Bohnerz) at Egerkingen, near Soleure, under the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    subsequently, at the same place, a portion of a ramus of a mandible of
                    apparently the same species of animal. These were described by M. Delfortrie in

                    anterior part, containing the incisor and canine teeth, has been broken off. Its

                    shown by the general form of the cranium, the large size and anterior direction
                    of the orbits, the small and narrow muzzle, and the position of the lacrymal
                    foramen outside the anterior edge of the orbit. In size the fossil is
                    intermediate between the potto <hi rend="italic">{Ρerodiciicus potto)</hi> and

                <p>M. Delfortrie’s announcement of a fossil lemur from the south of France was soon

                    considerably larger size, <hi rend="italic">A. magnus,</hi> Filhol, was added to
                    the group; the latter, of which the skull is upwards of 4 inches in length,
                    resembles M. Delfortrie’s in its general characters, but modified much in the
                    way that the skulls of larger animals differ from the smaller ones of the same
                    natural group. The brain-chamber and orbits are relatively smaller, the face
                    larger, the muscular crests more developed, and the constriction between the
                    cerebral and facial portion of the skull more marked. These modifications remove
                    the skull in its general characters still further from the existing lemurs—so
                    much so that M. Filhol refers it and the other species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Adapis</hi> to a distinct and hitherto unknown zoological type, intermediate
                    between the lemurs and the pachyderms, to which he gives the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Pachylemur.</hi> On the other hand he considers the <hi
                    rend="italic">Hecrο-lemur</hi><hi rend="italic">antiquus</hi> found at St
                    Antonin, which is a very small species, to be a true lemuroid, more nearly
                    resembling <hi rend="italic">Galago senegalensis</hi> than any existing species.
                    Unfortunately in all these specimens the anterior part of the skull is so much
                    injured that the character and numbers of the incisor teeth cannot be
                    ascertained, a great want in determining the affinities of these animals. And
                    even if the whole of the skulls were found, as long as nothing is known of the
                    limbs, or of any other bones of the skeleton, the determination of their actual
                    zoological position can only be considered as provisional. All the existing
                    lemurs and pachyderms, or ungulates as they are now generally termed, are so
                    essentially different in structure and mode of life that it is difficult to
                    conceive of a transition from one to the other, and therefore any such forms
                    when found will be full of interest. In skull and teeth characters, as far as
                    they are yet known, these ancient lemur-like animals from France do not deviate
                    sufficiently from the existing lemuroids to justify their separation, but it
                    remains to be proved whether they had the opposable hallux and unguiculate toes
                    of the forms which now inhabit the world, <pb break="no"

                    type. The discussions which have taken place on their nature at all events show
                    how li≠tle reliance can be placed upon the characters of the molar teeth alone
                    in judging of the affinities of an extinct animal.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most important of all the numerous recent palaeontological
                    discoveries in the Tertiary beds of the rocky mountain district of North America
                    has been that of animals which their describers believe to be low and
                    generalized forms of the order <hi rend="italic">Primates.</hi> Their existence
                    was not suspected till 1872, in which year Professor Marsh and Professor Cope
                    almost simultaneously announced the fact. Since that time numerous genera have
                    been assigned to the group, including five which were previously described by
                    Leidy from teeth alone, the nature of which he did not venture to determine.
                    These are nearly all from the Eocene or lowest Miocene formations. Until we
                    receive fuller information regarding the remains of these animals, it is
                    premature to speculate upon their real character or affinities. The difficulty
                    of doing so is at present enhanced by their describers in the provisional
                    accounts already given adopting the old assumption that lemurs and monkeys are
                    animals of the same general type, and speaking of them sometimes as one and
                    sometimes as the other. It is possible that these animals, or some of them, may
                    have been monkeys, in which case they were not lemurs; or they may have been
                    lemurs, in which case they were not monkeys. It is possible also that they may
                    form a connecting link between the two, and so justify their old association in
                    one group. The recently described <hi rend="italic">Anaptomorphus
                    homunculus</hi> from the Lower Eocene of Wyoming, an animal smaller than <hi
                    rend="italic">Tarsius spectrum,</hi> is considered by Cope to be “the most
                    simian lemur yet discovered, and probably representing the family from which the
                    true monkeys and men were derived” <hi rend="italic">{Palaeontological
                    Bulletin,</hi> No. 34, February 20, 1882). In this case the lemurs, which,
                    judging by their present distribution, appear to have spread east and west from
                    Madagascar, may have had quite a different origin.</p>
