                    familiar to all the races among whom human civilization took its origin, and its
                    strongly marked physical and moral characteristics have rendered it proverbial,
                    perhaps to an exaggerated degree, and have in all ages afforded favourite types
                    for poetry, art, and heraldry.</p>
                <p>The literature of the ancient Hebrews abounds in allusions to the lion; and the
                    almost incredible numbers that are stated to have been provided for exhibition
                    and destruction in the Roman amphitheatres (as many as six hundred on a single
                    occasion by Pompey, for example) show how abundant these animals must have been
                    within accessible distance of the capital of the world.</p>
                <p>The geographical range of the lion was once far more extensive than at present,
                    even within the historic period covering the whole of Africa, the south of Asia,
                    including Syria, Arabia, Asia Minor, Persia, and the greater part of northern
                    and central Hindustan, and also the south-eastern portion of Europe, as shown by
                    the well-known story told by Herodotus of the attacks by lions on the camels
                    which carried the baggage of the army of Xerxes on its march through the country
                    of the Paeonians in Macedonia. The very circumstantial account of Herodotus
                    shows that the animal at that time ranged through the country south of the
                    Balkans, through Roumania to the west of the river Carasu, and through Thessaly
                    as far south as the Gulf of Lepanto and the Isthmus of Corinth, having as its
                    western boundary the river Potamo and the Pindus mountains. The whole of the
                    evidence relating to the existence of lions in Europe, and to their retreat from
                    that continent shortly before the commencement of the Christian era, has been
                    collected in the article on “Felis spelaea” in Boyd Dawkins and Sanford’s <hi
                    rend="italic">British Pleistocene Mammalia,</hi> 1868. Fossil remains attest a
                    still wider range, as it is shown in the same work that there is absolutely no
                    osteological or dental character by which the well-known cave lion <hi
                    rend="italic">(Felis</hi><hi rend="italic">spelaea</hi> of Goldfuss), so
                    abundantly found in cave deposits of the Pleistocene age, can be distinguished
                    from the existing <hi rend="italic">Felis leo.</hi> There are also remains found
                    in North America of an animal named <hi rend="italic">Felis atrox</hi> by Leidy,
                    which the palaeontologists just quoted attribute to the common lion; but, as
                    they are very fragmentary, and as the specific characters by which most of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> are distinguished are more dependent on external
                    than on anatomical conformation, this determination cannot be so absolutely
                    relied upon.</p>
                <p>At the present day the lion is found in localities suitable to its habits, and
                    where not exterminated (as it probably was in Europe) by the encroachments of
                    man, throughout Africa from Algeria to the Cape Colony, and in Mesopotamia,
                    Persia, and some parts of the north-west of India. According to Blanford,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Zoology and
                    Geology of Eastern Persia,</hi> 1876.</p></note> lions are still very numerous
                    in the reedy swamps bordering the Tigris and Euphrates, and also occur on the
                    west flanks of the Zagros mountains and the oak-clad ranges near Shiraz, to
                    which they are attracted by the immense herds of swine which feed on the acorns.
                    The lion nowhere exists in the table-land of Persia, nor is it found in
                    Bahïchistân. In India it appears now to be confined to the province of Kathiawar
                    in Gujerat, though within the present century its range extended through the
                    north-west parts of Hindustan, from Bahâwaipur and Sind to at least the Jumna
                    (about Delhi), southward as far as Khândesh, and in Central India through the
                    Sagur and Nerbudda territories, Bundelkund, and as far east as Palamau. It was
                    extirpated in Hariâna about 1824. One was killed at Rhyli, in the Dumaoh
                    district, Sagur and Nerbudda territories, so late as in the cold season of
                    1847-48; and about the same time a few still remained in the valley of the Sind
                    river in Kotah, Central India (Blyth).</p>
                <p>The great variations in external characters which different lions present,
                    especially in the colour and the amount of mane, has given rise to the idea that
                    there are several species, or at all events distinct varieties peculiar to
                    different localities. It was at one time supposed, on the authority of Captain
                    Walter Smee,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions of the Zoological Society,</hi> vol. i. p. 165,
                    1835.</p></note> that the lion of Gujerat differed essentially from that of
                    Africa in the absence of mane, but subsequent evidence has not supported this
                    view, which was probably founded upon young specimens having been mistaken for
                    adults. Lions from that district as well as from Babylonia, which have lived in
                    the gardens of the London Zoological Society, have had as <pb break="no"

                    species. Mr F. C. Selous<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">A Hunter's Wanderings in Africa,</hi> 1881, p.
                    258.</p></note> has shown that in South Africa the so-called black-maned lion
                    and others with yellow scanty manes are found, not only in the same locality,
                    but even among individuals of the same parentage.</p>
                <p>The lion belongs to the very natural and distinctly defined group constituting
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi> of Linnaeus (for the characters and
                    position of which see article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia),</hi> a genus held
                    by Pallas and other philosophical naturalists as a model of what a genus ought
                    to be, although recent writers have divided and subdivided it into as many as
                    thirteen sections, on each of which a new generic term has been imposed. Among
                    these sections is one containing the largest members of the group, and differing
                    from the others in the well-marked anatomical character that the anterior cornu
                    of the hyoid arch is but little ossified, and by the less important one that the
                    pupil of the eye when contracted is a circular hole, instead of a vertical slit
                    as in the cat. The lion agrees with the tiger and the leopard in these respects,
                    but differs from them in its uniform style of colouring, and from all the other
                    <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> in the arrangement of its hairy covering, the
                    hair of the top of the head, chin, and neck, as far back as the shoulder, being
                    not only very much longer, but also differently disposed from the hair
                    elsewhere, being erect or directed forwards, and so constituting the
                    characteristic ornament called the mane. There is also a tuft of elongated hairs
                    at the end of the tail, one upon each elbow, and in most lions a copious fringe
                    along the middle line of the under surface of the body, wanting, however, in
                    some examples.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr
                    Selous, whose opportunities for obtaining evidence upon this subject were very
                    large, says that in the region of South Africa, between the Zambesi and the
                    Limpopo rivers, he never saw a lion with any long hair under the body, and that
                    the manes of the wild lions of that district are far inferior in development to
                    those commonly seen in menageries in Europe.</p></note> It must, however, be
                    observed that these characters are peculiar to the adults of the male sex only,
                    and that, even as regards their coloration, young lions show indications of the
                    darker stripes and mottlings so characteristic of the greater number of the
                    members of the genus; just as the young of nearly all the plain-coloured species
                    of deer show for a time the lightcoloured spots which are met with in the adults
                    of only some of the species. The usual colour of the adult lion is
                    yellowish-brown, but it may vary from a deep red or chestnut brown to an almost
                    silvery grey. The mane, as well as the long hair of the other parts of the body,
                    sometimes scarcely differs from the general colour, but it is usually darker and
                    not unfrequently nearly black. The mane begins to grow when the animal is about
                    three years old, and is fully developed at five or six.</p>
                <p>In size the lion is only equalled or exceeded by the tiger among the existing <hi
                    rend="italic">Felidae</hi>; though both species present great variations, the
                    largest specimens of the latter appear to surpass the largest lions. A
                    full-sized South African lion, according to Selous, measures slightly less than
                    10 feet from nose to tip of tail, following the curves of the body. Harris gives
                    10 feet 6 inches, of which the tail occupies 3 feet. The lioness is about a foot
                    less.</p>
                <p>The internal structure of the lion, except in slight details, resembles that of
                    the other <hi rend="italic">Felidae,</hi> the whole organization being that of
                    an animal modified to fulfil, in the most perfect degree yet attained, an
                    active, predaceous mode of existence. The teeth especially exemplify the
                    carnivorous type in its highest condition of development. The most important
                    function they have to perform, that of seizing and holding firmly animals of
                    considerable size and strength, violently struggling for life, is provided for
                    by the great, sharp-pointed, and sharp-edged canines, placed wide apart at the
                    angles of the mouth, the incisors between them being greatly reduced in size and
                    kept back nearly to the same level, so as not to interfere with their action.
                    The jaws are short and strong, and the width of the zygomatic arches, and great
                    development of the bony ridges on the skull, give ample space for the attachment
                    of the powerful muscles by which they are closed. In the molar series of teeth
                    the sectorial or scissor-like cutting function is developed at the expense of
                    the tubercular or grinding, there being only one rudimentary tooth of the latter
                    form in the upper jaw, and none in the lower. They are, however, sufficiently
                    strong to break bones of large size. The dental formula is expressed as follows
                    :—incisors ⅞, canines ⅛, premolars ⅜, molars ⅜ = ⅜; total, 30. The tongue is
                    long and flat, and remarkable for the development of the papillae of the
                    anterior part of the dorsal surface, which (except near the edge) are modified
                    so as to resemble long, compressed, recurved, horny spines or claws, which, near
                    the middle line, attain the length of one-fifth of an inch. They give the part
                    of the tongue on which they occur the appearance and feel of a coarse rasp, and
                    serve the purpose of such an instrument in cleaning the flesh from the bones of
                    the animals on which the lion feeds. The vertebral <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0704-0681"/> column is composed of seven cervical, thirteen
                    dorsal, seven lumbar, three sacral, and about twenty-six caudal vertebrae. The
                    clavicles are about 3 inches in length, embedded loosely in the muscles, and not
                    directly connected either with the sternum or the scapula. The limbs are
                    digitigrade, the animal resting upon round soft pads or cushions covered with
                    thick, naked, skin, one on the under surface of each of the principal toes, and
                    one larger one of trilobed form, behind these, under the lower ends of the
                    metacarpal and metatarsal bones, which are placed nearly vertically in ordinary
                    progression. The fore feet have five toes, of which the third and fourth are
                    nearly equal and longest, the second being slightly and the fifth considerably
                    shorter. The first or pollex (corresponding to the human thumb) is much shorter
                    than the others, and does not reach to the ground in walking. The hind feet have
                    only four toes, the third and fourth being the longest, the second and fifth
                    somewhat shorter and nearly equal. The first or hallux (or great toe) is
                    represented only by a rudimentary metatarsal bone. The claws are all very large,
                    strongly compressed, very sharp, and exhibit the retractile condition in the
                    highest degree, being drawn backwards and upwards into a cutaneous sheath by the
                    action of an elastic ligament so long as the foot is in a state of repose, but
                    exserted by muscular action when the animal strikes its prey. By this remarkable
                    piece of animal mechanism their edges and points are always kept sharp and
                    unworn.</p>
                <p>The habits of the lion in a state of nature are fairly well known from the united
                    observations of numerous travellers and sportsmen who have explored those
                    districts of the African continent in which it is still common. It lives chiefly
                    in sandy plains and rocky places interspersed with dense thorn-thickets, or
                    frequents the low bushes and tall rank grass and reeds that grow along the sides
                    of streams and near the springs where it .dies in wait for the larger
                    herbivorous animals on which it feeds. Although it is occasionally seen abroad
                    during the day, especially in wild and desolate regions, where it is subject to
                    but little molestation, the night is, as in the case of so many other predaceous
                    animals, the period of its greatest activity. It is then that its characteristic
                    roar is chiefly heard, as thus graphically described by Gordon Cumming :—</p>
                <p>“One of the most striking things connected with the lion is his voice, which is
                    extremely grand and peculiarly striking. It consists at times of a low deep
                    moaning, repeated five or six times, ending in faintly audible sighs; at other
                    times he startles the forest with loud, deep-toned, solemn roars, repeated in
                    quick succession, each increasing in loudness to the third or fourth, when his
                    voice dies away in five or six low muffled sounds very much resembling distant
                    thunder. At times, and not unfrequently, a troop may be heard, roaring in
                    concert, one assuming the lead, and two, tlιree, or four more regularly taking
                    up their parts, like persons singing a catch. Like our Scottish stags at the
                    rutting season, they roar loudest in cold frosty nights; but on no occasions are
                    their voices to be heard in such perfection, or so intensely powerful, as when
                    two or three troops of strange lions approach a fountain to drink at the same
                    time. When this occurs, every member· of each troop sounds a bold roar of
                    defiance at the. opposite parties; and when one roars, all roar together, and
                    each seems to vie with his comrades in the intensity and power of his voice. The
                    power and grandeur of these nocturnal concerts is inconceivably striking and
                    pleasing to the hunter’s ear.”</p>
                <p>“The usual pace of a lion,” C. J. Andersson<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">The Lion and the Elephant,</hi> 1873, p.
                    19.</p></note> says, “is a walk, and, though apparently rather slow, yet, from
                    the great length of his body, he is able to get over a good deal of ground in a
                    short time. Occasionally he trots, when his speed is not inconsiderable. His
                    gallop—or rather succession of bounds—is, for a short distance, very fast,—
                    nearly or quite equal to that of a horse. Indeed, unless the steed has somewhat
                    the start when the beast charges, it will be puzzled to escape. Many instances
                    are on record of horsemen who have incautiously approached too near to the lion,
                    prior to firing, who have been pulled down by him before they could get out of
                    harm’s way. Happily, however, the beast soon tires of the exertion of galloping,
                    and unless his first rush succeeds he, for the most part, soon halts and beats a
                    retreat.” “The lion, as with other members of the feline family,” the same
                    writer tells us, “seldom attacks his prey openly, unless compelled by extreme
                    hunger. For the most part he steals upon it in the manner of a cat, or ambushes
                    himself near to the water, or a pathway frequented by game. At such times he
                    lies crouched upon his belly in a thicket until the animal approaches
                    sufficiently near, when, with one prodigious bound, he pounces upon it. In most
                    cases he is successful, but should his intended victim escape, as at times
                    happens, from his having miscalculated ’the distance, he may make a second or
                    even a third bound, which, however, usually prove fruitless, or he returns
                    disconcerted to his hidingplace, there to wait for another opportunity.” His
                    food consists of all the larger herbivorous animals of the country in which he
                    resides,—buffaloes, various kinds of antelopes, zebras, giraffes, or even young
                    elephants or rhinoceroses, though the adults of these latter he dare not attack.
                    In cultivated districts the cattle, sheep, and even human inhabitants are never
                    safe from his nocturnal ravages. He appears, however, as a general rule, only to
                    kill when hungry or attacked, and not for the mere pleasure of killing, as with
                    some other carnivorous animals. He, moreover, by no means limits himself to
                    animals of his own killing, but, according to Selous, often prefers eating game
                    that has been killed by man, even when not very fresh, to taking the trouble to
                    catch an animal himself. All books of African travel and sport abound with
                    stories, many of which are apparently well authenticated, of the lion’s
                    prodigious strength, as exemplified by his being able to drag off a whole ox in
                    his mouth to a long distance, even leaping fences and dykes withit.</p>
                <p>The lion appears to be monogamous, a single male and female continuing attached
                    to each other irrespectively of the pairing season. At all events the lion
                    remains with the lioness while the cubs are young and helpless, and assists in
                    providing her and them with food, and in educating them in the art of providing
                    for themselves. The number of cubs at a birth is from two to four, usually
                    three. They are said to remain with their parents till they are about three
                    years old. The following account by an eyewitness gives a good idea of lion
                    family life<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hon. W. H.

                <p>“I once had the pleasure of, unobserved myself, watching a lion family feeding. I
                    was encamped on the Black Umfolosi in Zululand, and towards evening, walking
                    out, about half a mile from camp, I saw a herd of zebra galloping across me, and
                    when they were nearly 200 yards off, I saw a yellow body flash towards the
                    leader, and saw him fall beneath the lion’s weight. There was a tall tree about
                    60 yards from the place, and anxious to see what went on, I stalked up to it,
                    while the lion was still too much occupied to look about him, and climbed up. He
                    had by this time quite killed the beautifully striped animal, but instead of
                    proceeding to eat it, he got up and roared vigorously, until there was an
                    answer, and in a few minutes a lioness, accompanied by four whelps, came
                    trotting up from the same direction as the zebra, which no doubt she had been to
                    drive towards her husband. They formed a fine picture, as they all stood round
                    the carcase, the whelps tearin" it and biting it, but unable to get through the
                    tough skin. Then the lion lay down, and the lioness driving her offspring before
                    her did the same 4 or 5 yards off, upon which he got up, and commencing to eat,
                    had soon finished a hind-leg, retiring a few yards on one side as soon as he had
                    done so. The lioness came up next and tore the carcase to shreds, bolting huge
                    mouthfuls, but not objecting to the whelps eating as much as they could find.
                    There was a good deal of snarling and quarrelling among these young lions, and
                    occasionally a stand-up fight for a minute, but their mother did not take any
                    notice of them, except to give them a smart blow with her paw if they got in her
                    way. . . . There was now little left of the zebra but a few bones, which
                    hundreds<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n705/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0705-0682"/> of vultures were circling round waiting to pick,
                    while almost an equal number hopped awkwardly about on the ground within 50 or
                    60 yards of it, and the whole lion family walked quietly away, the lioness
                    leading, and the lion, often turning his head to see that they were not
                    followed, bringing up the rear.”</p>
                <p>Though not strictly gregarious, lions appear to be sociable towards their own
                    species, and often are found in small troops, sometimes consisting of a pair of
                    old lions, with their nearly full-grown cubs, but occasionally of adults of the
                    same sex; and there seems to be good evidence that several lions will associate
                    together for the purpose of hunting upon a preconcerted plan. As might be
                    supposed, their natural ferocity and powerful armature are sometimes turned upon
                    one another; combats, often mortal, occur among male lions under the influence
                    of jealousy; and Andersson relates an instance of a quarrel between a hungry
                    lion and lioness over the carcase of an antelope which they had just killed, and
                    which did not seem sufficient for the appetite of both, ending in the lion not
                    only killing, but even devouring his mate. Old lions, whose teeth have become
                    injured with constant wear, often become “man-eaters,” finding their easiest
                    means of obtaining a subsistence in lurking in the neighbourhood of villages,
                    and dashing into the tents at night and carrying off one of the sleeping
                    inmates. Lions differ from most of the smaller <hi rend="italic">Felidae</hi> in
                    never climbing trees; indeed, as mentioned before, they are rarely found in
                    forests.</p>
                <p>With regard to the character of the lion, those who have had opportunities of
                    observing it in its native haunts differ greatly. The exaggerated accounts of
                    early writers as to its courage, nobility, and magnanimity have led to a
                    reaction, which causes some modern authors to speak of it in language quite the
                    reverse, and to accuse it of positive cowardice and all kinds of meanness.
                    Livingstone goes so far as to say, “nothing that I ever learned of the lion
                    could lead me to attribute to it either the ferocious or noble character
                    ascribed to it elsewhere,” and he adds that its roar is not distinguishable from
                    that of the ostrich. Of course these different estimates depend to a great
                    extent upon the particular standard of the writer, and also upon the
                    circumstance that lions, like other animals, undoubtedly show considerable
                    individual differences in character, and behave differently under varying
                    circumstances. They are certainly not so reckless as to be entirely devoid of
                    the instinct of self-preservation, and if one, perhaps satiated with a good meal
                    the night before, unexpectedly disturbed in the day time, will occasionally
                    retreat when confronted, even by an unarmed man, that is scarcely a reason for
                    assigning cowardice as one of the characteristics of the species. The latest
                    authority, Selous, while never denying the daring courage of the lion when
                    hungry or provoked, and vindicating the awe-inspiring character of the roar of
                    several lions in unison, when heard at close quarters, as the grandest sound in
                    nature, says with regard to its outward aspect :—</p>
                <p>“It has always appeared to me that the word ‘majestic’ is singularly inapplicable
                    to the lion in its wild state, as when seen by daylight he always has a stealthy
                    furtive look that entirely does away with the idea of majesty. To look majestic
                    a lion should hold his head high. This he seldom does. When walking he holds it
                    low, lower than the line of his back, and it is only when he first becomes aware
                    of the presence of man that he sometimes raises his head and takes a look at the
                    intruder, usually lowering it immediately, and trotting away with a growl. When
                    at bay, standing with open mouth and glaring eyes, holding his head low between
                    his shoulders, and keeping up a continuous low growling, twitching his tail the
                    while from side to side, no animal can look more unpleasant than a lion; but
                    there is then nothing maiestic or noble in his appearance.”</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this evidently truthful description of the animal when seen under
                    what maybe called unfavourable circumstances, no one with an eye for beauty can
                    contemplate the form of a fine specimen of a lion, at all events in a state of
                    repose, even though in the confinement of a menagerie, without being impressed
                    with the feeling that it is a grand and noble-looking animal. (w. H. <hi
