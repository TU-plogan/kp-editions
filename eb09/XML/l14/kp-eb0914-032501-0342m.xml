                    Reformation in England, was a native of Thurcaston, Leicestershire, and the son
                    of a yeoman, who rented a farm “of three or four pounds by year at the
                    uttermost.” Of this farm he “tilled as much as kept half a dozen men,” retaining
                    also grass for a hundred sheep and thirty cattle. The year of Latimer’s birth is
                    not definitely known. In the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> by Gilpin it is given
                    as 1470, a palpable error, and possibly a misprint for 1490.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The only reasons for
                    assigning an earlier date are that he was commonly known as “Old Hugh Latimer,”
                    and that Bernher, his Swiss servant, states incidentally that he was “above
                    threescore and seven years” in the reign of Edward VI. Bad health and anxieties
                    probably made him look older than his years, but under Edward VI. his powers as
                    an orator were in full vigour, and he was at his book winter and summer at two
                    o’clock in the morning.</p></note> Foxς states that at “the age of fourteen
                    years he was sent to the university of Cambridge,” and as he was elected fellow
                    of Clare in 1509, his year of entrance was in all likelihood 1505. Latimer
                    himself also, in mentioning his conversion from Romanism about 1523, says that
                    it took place after he was thirty years of age. According to Foxe, Latimer went
                    to school “at the age of four or thereabout.” The purpose of his parents was to
                    train him up “in the knowledge of all good literature,” but his father “was as
                    diligent to teach him to shoot as any other thing.” As the yeomen of England
                    were then in comparatively easy circumstances, the practice of sending their
                    sons to the universities was quite usual; indeed Latimer mentions that in the
                    reign of Edward VI., on account of the increase of rents, the universities had
                    begun wonderfully to decay. He graduated B.A. in 1510, and M.A. in 1514. Before
                    the latter date he had taken holy orders. While a student he was not
                    unaccustomed “to make good cheer and be merry,” but at the same time he was a
                    punctilious observer of the minutest rites of his faith and “as obstinate a
                    Papist as any in England.” So keen was his opposition to the new learning that
                    his oration on the occasion of taking his degree of bachelor of divinity was
                    devoted to an attack on the opinions of Melanchthon. It was this sermon that
                    determined Bilney to go to Latimer’s study, and ask him “for God’s sake to hear
                    his confession,” the result being that “from that time forward he began to smell
                    the word of God, and forsook the school doctors and such fooleries.” Soon his
                    discourses exercised a potent influence on learned and unlearned alike; and,
                    although he restricted himself, as indeed was principally his custom through
                    life, to the inculcation of practical righteousness, and the censure of clamant
                    abuses, a rumour of his heretical tendencies reached the bishop of Ely, who
                    resolved to become unexpectedly one of his audience. Latimer on seeing him enter
                    the church boldly changed his theme to a portrayal of Christ as the pattern
                    priest and bishop. The points of comparison were of course deeply distasteful to
                    the prelate, who, though he professed his “obligations for the good admonition
                    he had received,” informed the preacher that he “smelt somewhat of the pan.”
                    Latimer was prohibited from preaching in the university or in any pulpits of the
                    diocese, and on his occupying the pulpit of the Augustinian monastery, which
                    enjoyed immunity from episcopal control, he was summoned to answer for his
                    opinions before Wolsey, who, however, was so sensible of the value of such
                    discourses that he gave him special licence to preach throughout England. At
                    this time Protestant opinions were being disseminated in England chiefly by the
                    surreptitious circulation of the works of Wickliffe, and especially of his
                    translations of the New Testament. The new leaven had begun to communicate its
                    subtle influence to the universities, but was working chiefly in secret and even
                    to a great extent unconsciously to those affected by it, for many were in
                    profound ignorance of the ultimate tendency of their own opinions. It was
                    perhaps, as regards England, the most critical conjuncture in the history of the
                    Reformation, both on this account and on account of the position in which Henry
                    VIII. then stood related to it. In no small degree its ultimate fate seemed also
                    to be placed in the hands of Latimer. In 1526 the imprudent zeal of Barnes had
                    resulted in an ignominious recantation, and in 1527 Bilney, Latimer’s <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0343-0326"/> most trusted coadjutor, incurred the displeasure
                    of Wolsey, and did humiliating penance for his offences. Latimer however,
                    besides possessing far-seeing sagacity, quick insight into character, and a
                    ready and formidable wit which thoroughly disconcerted and confused his
                    opponents, had naturally a distaste for mere theological discussion, and the
                    truths he was in the habit of inculcating could scarcely be controverted,
                    although, as he stated them, they were diametrically contradictory of prevailing
                    errors both in doctrine and practice. In December 1529 he preached his two
                    “Sermons on the Cards,” which awakened a turbulent controversy in the
                    university, and his opponents, finding that they were unable to cope with the
                    dexterity and keenness of his satire, would undoubtedly have succeeded in
                    getting him silenced by force, had it not been reported to the king that Latimer
                    “favoured his cause,” that is, the cause of the divorce. While, therefore, both
                    parties were imperatively commanded to refrain from further dispute, Latimer was
                    invited to preach before Henry in the Lent of 1530. The king was so pleased with
                    the sermon that after it “he did most familiarly talk with him in a gallery.” Of
                    the special regard which Henry seemed to have conceived for him Latimer took
                    advantage to pen the famous letter on the free circulation of the Scriptures, an
                    address remarkable, not only for what Mr Froude justly calls “its almost
                    unexampled grandeur,” but for its striking repudiation of the aid of temporal
                    weapons to defend the faith; “for God,” he says, “will not have it defended by
                    man or man’s power, but by his word only, by which he hath evermore defended it,
                    and that by a way far above man’s power and reason.” Though the appeal was
                    without effect on the immediate policy of Henry, he could not have been
                    displeased with its tone, for shortly afterwards he appointed Latimer one of the
                    royal chaplains. In times so “out of joint” Latimer soon became “weary of the
                    court,” and it was with a sense of relief that he accepted the living of West
                    Kington, Wiltshire, conferred on him by the king in 1531. Harassed by severe
                    bodily ailments, encompassed by a raging tumult of religious conflict and
                    persecution, and aware that the faint hopes of better times, which seemed to
                    gild the horizon of the future, might be utterly darkened by a failure either in
                    the constancy of his courage or in his discernment and discretion, he exerted
                    his eloquence with unabating energy in the furtherance of the cause he had at
                    heart. At last a sermon he was persuaded to preach in London exasperated
                    Stokesley, bishop of the diocese, and seemed to furnish thatfervent persecutor
                    with an opportunity to overthrow the most dangerous champion of the new
                    opinions. Bilney, of whom Latimer wrote, “if such as he shall die evil, what
                    shall become of me?” perished at the stake in the autumn of 1531, and in January
                    following Latimer was summoned to answer before the bishops in the consistory.
                    After a tedious and captious examination, he was in March brought before
                    convocation, and on refusing to subscribe certain articles was excommunicated
                    and imprisoned; but through the interference of the king he was finally released
                    after he had voluntarily signified his acceptance of all the articles except
                    two, and confessed that he had erred not only “in discretion but in doctrine.”
                    If in this confession he to some extent tampered with his conscience, there is
                    every reason to believe that his culpable timidity was occasioned, not by
                    personal fear, but by anxiety lest by his death he should hinder instead of
                    promoting the cause of truth. After the consecration of Cranmer in 1533 his
                    position was completely altered. A commission appointed to inquire into the
                    disturbances caused by his preaching in Bristol severely censured the conduct of
                    his opponents; and, when the bishop prohibited him from preaching in his
                    diocese, he obtained from Cranmer a special licence to preach throughout the
                    province of Canterbury. In 1534 Henry formally repudiated the authority of the
                    pope, and from this time Latimer was the chief cooperator with Cranmer and
                    Cromwell in advising the king regarding the series of legislative measures which
                    rendered that repudiation complete and irrevocable.</p>
                <p>It was, however, the preaching of Latimer more than the edicts of Henry that
                    established the principles of the Reformation in the minds and hearts of the
                    people; and from his preaching the movement received its chief colour and
                    complexion. The sermons of Latimer possess a combination of qualities which
                    constitute them unique examples of that species of literature. It is possible to
                    learn from them more regarding the social and political condition of the period
                    than perhaps from any other source, for they abound, not only in exposures of
                    religious abuses, and of the prevailing corruptions of society, but in
                    references to many varieties of social injustice and unwise customs, in racy
                    sketches of character, and in vivid pictures of special features of the time,
                    occasionally illustrated by interesting incidents in his own life. The homely
                    terseness of his style, his abounding humour, rough, cheery, and playful, but
                    irresistible in its simplicity, and occasionally displaying sudden and dangerous
                    barbs of satire, his avoidance of dogmatic subtleties and noble advocacy of
                    practical righteousness, his bold and open denunciation of the oppression
                    practised by the powerful, his scathing diatribes against ecclesiastical
                    hypocrisy, the transparent honesty of his fervent zeal, tempered by sagacious
                    moderation—these are the qualities which not only rendered his influence so
                    paramount in his lifetime, but have transmitted his memory to posterity as
                    perhaps that of the one among his contemporaries most worthy of our interest and
                    admiration.</p>
                <p>In September 1535 Latimer was consecrated bishop of Worcester. While holding this
                    office he was selected to officiate as preacher when the friar Forest, whom he
                    vainly endeavoured to move to submission, was burned at the stake for teaching
                    treason to his penitents. In 1539, being opposed to the “Act of the Six
                    Articles,” Latimer resigned his bishopric, learning from Cromwell that this was
                    the wish of the king. It would appear that on this point he was deceived, but as
                    he now declined to accept the articles he was confined within the precincts of
                    the palace of the bishop of Chichester. After the attainder of Cromwell little
                    is known of him until 1546, when, on account of his connexion with the preacher
                    Crome, he was summoned before the council at Greenwich, and committed to the
                    Tower. Henry died before his final trial could take place, and the general
                    pardon at the accession of Edward VI. procured him his liberty. He declined to
                    resume his see, notwithstanding the special request of the Commons, but in
                    January 1548 again began to preach, and with more effectiveness than ever,
                    crowds thronging to listen to him both in London and in the country. Shortly
                    after the accession of Mary in 1553 a summons was sent to Latimer to appear
                    before the council at Westminster. Though he might have escaped by flight, and
                    though he knew, as he quaintly remarked, that “Smithfield already groaned for
                    him,” he at once joyfully obeyed. The pursuivant, he said, was “a welcome
                    messenger.” The hardships of his imprisonment, and the long disputations at
                    Oxford, told severely on his health, but he endured all with unbroken
                    cheerfulness. On October 16, 1555, he and Ridley were led to the stake at
                    Oxford. Never was man more free than Latimer from the taint of fanaticism or
                    less dominated by “vainglory,” but the motives which now inspired his courage
                    not only placed him beyond the influence of fear, but enabled him to taste in
                    dying an ineffable thrill of victorious achievement. Ridley he greeted with the
                    words, “Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man; <hi rend="italic"
                    >we</hi> shall this day light such a candle by God’s grace in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n344/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0344-0327"/> England as (I trust) shall never be put out.” He
                    “received the flame as it were embracing it. After he had stroked his face with
                    his hands, and (as it were) bathed them a little in the fire, he soon died (as
                    it appeared) with very little pain or none.”</p>
                <p>Two volumes of Latimer’s sermons were published in 1549. Various volumes of his
                    remains appeared after his death, edited by</p>
                <p>Beraher and Thomas Some. À complete edition of his works, edited for the Parker
                    Society by the Rev. George Elwes Corrie, appeared in two volumes, 1844-45. His
                    Sermon on the Plough, and Seven Sermons preached before Edward VI., the best
                    known of his sermons, were reprinted by Arber, 1869. In addition to memoirs
                    attached to editions of his sermons, there are Lives by Gilpin (1755) and Demaus
                    (1869). The principal contemporary authorities are Foxe’s Book of Martyrs,
                    Stow’s Chronicles and Annals, and his own Sermons. (T. F. H.)</p>
