                    he furnished the microscopists who were then turning their attention to the
                    minute structure of organized bodies. He appears soon to have found that single
                    lenses of very short focus were preferable for this purpose to the compound
                    microscopes then in use; and it is clear from the discoveries he made with these
                    that they must have been of very excellent quality.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is much to be regretted that a cabinet
                    which he bequeathed to the Royal Society of London,—containing twenty-six of

                    by a magnified drawing of it, the whole being the work of his own hands,—is no

                    double-convex lens, and not a sphere or globule”; and he states that their
                    magnifying powers range from 40 to 160 diameters.</p></note> These discoveries
                    were for the most part originally given to the world in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophical Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society, to the notice of which
                    learned body he was first introduced by De Graaf in 1673. He was elected a
                    fellow in 1680, and was chosen in 1697 a corresponding member of the Academy of
                    Sciences in Paris. He died at his native place in 1723; and Sir Martin Folkes,
                    then vice-president of the Royal Society, says in the eulogium he pronounced
                    :—“We have seen so many and those of his most surprising discoveries, so
                    perfectly confirmed by great numbers of the most curious and <pb break="no"

                    reason to distrust his accuracy in those others which have not yet been so
                    frequently or so carefully examined.”</p>
                <p>His capital discovery was undoubtedly that of the capillary circulation of the
                    blood, first announced in 1690, which afforded the link still wanting for the
                    completion of the doctrine of Harvey, by showing that the blood passes from the
                    arteries into the veins through a network of extremely minute vessels, the thin
                    walls of which allow the fluid plasma to transude into the tissues it traverses,
                    so as to serve for their nutrition. He first sought to discern this in the comb
                    of a young cock, then in the ear of a white rabbit, and then in the membrane of
                    a bat’s wing; but, though in the last he was able to follow an artery to its
                    ultimate subdivision, he found that, as soon as “it became so small as only to
                    admit one or two globules to pass through it at a time, he then lost sight of
                    it,” partly in consequence of “the membrane of the wing being covered with a
                    kind of scale” (epidermis). His first success was obtained with the tail of a
                    newly-hatched tadpole, in which, he says, “I could distinctly perceive the whole
                    circuit of the blood, in its passage to the extremities of the vessels, and in
                    its return towards the heart,”—its movement being made apparent by that of the
                    globules carried along in its current. These corpuscles, which had been
                    previously discovered by Malpighi, were correctly described by Leeuwenhoek as
                    flattened circular disks in man, and as oval disks in tadpoles. He afterwards
                    observed the capillary circulation in the tail-fins of small fishes, and
                    recognized the ellipticity of the corpuscles in that class also. He even made
                    out the capillary circulation in the broad thin extremities of the two smallest
                    or hind feet of small crabs about an inch in diameter, and correctly remarked
                    that the corpuscles of their blood were colourless and far fewer than those of
                    fishes or tadpoles, “the globules in red blood being (I am well assured)
                    twenty-five times more in number than those, in the same space, in the blood of
                    a crab.” To us it seems not a little surprising that his assertions in regard to
                    the capillary circulation were deemed incredible by some of his scientific
                    contemporaries. It is recorded, however, that Peter the Great, when passing
                    through Delft in 1698, requested Leeuwenhoek to pay him a visit, and to bring
                    his microscope with him, and that the czar was particularly impressed by the
                    spectacle of the circulation in the tail of a small eel.</p>
                <p>Among Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries in the minute anatomy of man and the higher
                    animals may be specially mentioned the tubules of teeth, the fibrous structure
                    of the crystalline lens, the solidity of the human hair (which had been
                    previously represented as tubular), the structure of the epidermis, and the
                    parallel tubules of the medullary substance of the brain,—which last, however,
                    he supposed to be vessels conveying fluid substance from the highly vascular
                    cortical layers, for the support and nourishment of the spinal marrow and
                    nerves. He was also an independent discoverer of the spermatozoa, although
                    anticipated by a few months by Ludwig Hamm, a student at Leyden.</p>
                <p>As might be expected, he made many observations on the anatomy of insects; and
                    among the most interesting of these are his discovery of the composite structure
                    of the eyes (which he recognized also in the eyes of the shrimp), the scales on
                    the wings not only of moths but of the gnat, and the annular (really spiral)
                    structure in the walls of the “vessels” <hi rend="italic">(traçhese)</hi> of
                    their wings. He also proved that cochineal, which had been supposed to be “the
                    fruit of some tree,” is really the dried body of an insect, which he not
                    unnaturally supposed to be allied to the ladybird. He likewise gave a very good
                    account of the spinnerets and poison-claws of spiders, and of the comb-like
                    appendages to their feet. He made a special study, also, of the anatomy of the
                    flea,—besides following out its reproduction with great care, as will presently
                    appear.</p>
                <p>In examining the stomachs of shrimps, he found in them some minute shells, of
                    which he figured a specimen so exactly that it can be at once recognized as a
                    <hi rend="italic">Nonionina</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> —probably
                    the first recent foraminifer that had been distinctly noticed. But one of his
                    most interesting observations is that which he made upon a small <hi
                    rend="italic">Balanus</hi> attached to a mussel-shell; for he not only gives a
                    good figure of the animal, but describes the way in which it retreats into its
                    shell, and closes its orifice by two shelly valves. His figure most distinctly
                    shows its <hi rend="italic">articulate</hi> character, which has only in modern
                    times caused its removal from the molluscous to the aunulose sub-kingdom.</p>
                <p>Not less admirable were his observations on the structure of plants. He made very
                    careful sections of stems of the oak, elm, beech, willow, fir, and other trees,
                    in different directions, of which he gave careful figures and descriptions,—
                    specially noting the horizontal arrangement of the cells in the “medullary
                    rays,” and the peculiar “pitting” of the woody fibre of the fir, as well as the
                    absence of large vessels in the latter. He also examined the structure of
                    various germinating seeds, and gave accurate descriptions of the relation of the
                    embryo to the cotyledons.</p>
                <p>Although, when he adventured into physiological speculation, Leeuwenhoek’s ideas
                    (like those of the best physiologists of his time) were often very crude, his
                    reasonings upon the facts actually observed by him are often remarkably cogent
                    and sagacious. Thus, to estimate the insensible perspiration, he placed his hand
                    within a dry glass jar, closed the space between its neck and his wrist by
                    stuffing his handkerchief into it, and carefully collected and weighed the
                    moisture which accumulated in its interior during a given time; and by a
                    computation based on the ratio of the surface of the hand to that of the entire
                    body he concluded that about 28 oz. of fluid are daily lost by transpiration,
                    which is not far from the truth. So, again, he triumphantly refuted the chemical
                    theories which then reigned in medicine, and which assumed that the blood
                    undergoes a fermentation like that of wine or beer, by the statement that he had
                    never seen in the blood-vessels the bubbles of gas which must be generated in
                    them if this doctrine were correct. In one important point, however, he allowed
                    his imagination to supplement the necessary imperfection of his observations,
                    maintaining that each blood-disk is made up of six coherent particles, an idea
                    probably suggested by the crenated appearance which the blooddisks often
                    present.</p>
                <p>It is to Leeuwenhoek that we owe the refutation of the then current biological
                    doctrine that animals of high organization can be “produced spontaneously, or
                    bred from corruption.” This doctrine had been previously attacked by Eedi, who
                    showed that the putrefaction of meat will not engender maggots, if the access of
                    blow-flies be prevented. But even Redi, while upholding the doctrine “Omne vivum
                    ex <hi rend="italic">vivof</hi> believed that the insects found within the galls
                    of plants, and the parasitic worms by which the human body is sometimes
                    infested, are generated by a peculiar modification of the living vegetable or
                    animal substance. It was Leeuwenhoek who first explicitly took up the position
                    that every living organism reproduces its like, no type originating in any other
                    way than by the ordinary generative process of its kind: “Omne vivum ex <hi
                    rend="italic">ovo.”</hi> This he established by careful and prolonged
                    observation, in a great variety of cases in which “spontaneous generation” had
                    been reputed to take place; and he further continually adduced the great
                    complexity of organization which his microscopic researches had revealed in what
                    had been previously regarded as creatures of the lowest grade, as an argument
                    against the doctrine that they are “bred from corruption.” Thus he followed out
                    the whole history of oak-galls, and showed that they are a product of a peculiar
                    vegetable growth, excited by the insertion of an egg by the winged insect, and
                    supplying the maggot, when hatched, with food. So, again, he showed that the
                    weevils of granaries, then commonly supposed to be bred <hi rend="italic"
                    >from</hi> wheat, as well as <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it, are nothing else than
                    grubs hatched from eggs deposited by winged insects; and he practically applied
                    this conclusion, by recommending that granaries thus infested should be
                    repeatedly fumigated with sulphur at the time when these insects come forth, so
                    as to kill them before they deposit eggs. His chapter on the flea, in which he
                    not only describes its structure, but traces out the whole history of its
                    metamorphoses from its first emergence from the egg, is full of interest,—not so
                    much for the exactness of his observations, as for its incidental revelation of
                    the extraordinary ignorance then prevalent in regard to the <pb break="no"

                    despised creature,” which some asserted to be produced from sand, others from
                    dust, others from the dung of pigeons, and others from urine, but which he
                    showed to be “endowed with as great perfection in its kind as any large animal,”
                    and proved to breed in the regular way of winged insects. He even noted the fact
                    that the pupa of the flea is sometimes attacked and fed upon by a mite,—an.

                <p>Although Bonnet is usually credited with the discovery of the viviparous
                    propagation of the <hi rend="italic">Ap)hides,</hi> this had been really made by
                    Leeuwenhoek half a century previously. For, his attention having been drawn to
                    the blighting of the young shoots of fruit-trees, which was commonly attributed
                    to the ants found upon them, he was the first to find the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphides</hi> that really do the mischief; and, upon searching, after his wont,
                    into the history of their generation, he observed the young within the bodies of
                    their parents. He carefully studied also the history of the ant, and was the
                    first to show that what had been commonly reputed to be “ants’ eggs” are really
                    their pupae, containing the perfect insect nearly ready for emersion, whilst the
                    true eggs are far smaller, and give origin to “maggots” or larvae.</p>
                <p>Of the sea-mussel, again, and other shell-fish, he argued (in reply to a then
                    recent defence of Aristotle’s doctrine by Bonami, a learned Jesuit of Italy)
                    that they are not generated out of the mud or sand which is found on the
                    sea-shore or the beds of rivers at low water, but from spawn, by the regular
                    course of generation. “For my part,” he says, “I hold it equally impossible for
                    a small shell-fish to be produced without generation as for a whale to have its
                    origin in the mud.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Leeuwenhoek’s argument in this instance was partly based on false premises.

                    5th century, and no Western prelate took any part, either personally or
                    otherwise, in the first council of Constantinople. The fifth (sometimes called
                    the seventh) canon of the council of Sardica, in 343, however, shows that the
                    possibility of such delegation had already begun to be discussed, and suggests
                    that it may actually have been exemplified before that date. This canon provides
                    that, in case of an appeal by a deposed bishop to Rome, if the pope is inclined
                    to grant a new trial, it shall be competent for him to write to the bishops of
                    the neighbouring province, but if the appellant wishes the pope to send priests
                    from his own side (“ut de latere suo presbyteros mittat”), it shall be free to
                    the pope to do so, and give them due rank and dignity in the court thus
                    constituted (Hefele, <hi rend="italic">Cone.,</hi> i. 568). Instances of
                    delegation of the papal authority in various degrees become numerous in the
                    course of the 5th century, especially during the pontificate of Leo I. Thus Leo
                    writes in 444 <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 6) to Anastasius of Thessalonica,
                    appointing him his vicar for the province of Illyria; the same arrangement, he
                    informs us, had been made by Pope Siricius in favour of Anysius, the predecessor
                    of Anastasius. Similar vicarial or legatine powers had been conferred in 418 by
                    Zosimus upon Patroclus, bishop of Arles. In 449 Leo was represented at the
                    “Robber Synod,” from which his legates hardly escaped with life; at Chalcedon,
                    in 451, they were treated with singular honour. Again, in 453 the same pope
                    writes to the empress Pulcheria, naming Julianus of Cos as his representative in
                    the defence of the interests of orthodoxy and ecclesiastical discipline at
                    Constantinople <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 112); the instructions to Julianus
                    are given in <hi rend="italic">Ep.</hi> 113 (“hanc specialem curam vice mea
                    functus assumas ”). The designation of Anastasius as vicar apostolic over
                    Illyria may be said to mark the beginning of the custom of conferring, <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio,</hi> the title of <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi> upon
                    the holders of important sees, who ultimately came to be known as <hi
                    rend="italic">legati</hi><hi rend="italic">nati,</hi> with the rank of primate;
                    the appointment of J*ulianus at Constantinople gradually developed into the long
                    permanent office of <hi rend="italic">apocrisiarius</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >respοnsalis.</hi> Another sort of delegation is exemplified in Leo’s letter to
                    the African bishops <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 12), in which he sends
                    Potentius, with instructions to inquire in his name, and to report (vicem curae
                    nostrae fratri et consacerdoti nostro Potentio delegantes qui de episcopis,
                    quorum culpabilis ferebatur electio, quid veritas haberet inquireret, nobisque
                    omnia fideliter indicaret). Passing on to the time of Gregory the Great, we find
                    Augustine of Canterbury sometimes spoken of as legate, but it does not appear
                    that in his case this title was used in any strictly technical sense, although
                    the archbishop of Canterbury afterwards attained the permanent dignity of a
                    legatus natus. Boniface, the apostle of Germany, was in like manner constituted,
                    according to Hincmar <hi rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 30), a legate of the apostolic
                    see by Popes Gregory II. and Gregory III. According to Hefele <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cοnc.,</hi> iv. 239), Rodoald of Porto and Zecharias of Anagni, who were sent
                    by Pope Nicolas to Constantinople in 860, were the first who are actually called
                    <hi rend="italic">legati</hi><hi rend="italic">a latere.</hi> The policy of
                    Gregory VII. naturally led to a great development of the legatine as
                    distinguished from the ordinary episcopal function. According to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Nova</hi><hi rend="italic">Compilatio Decretalium</hi> of Gregory
                    IX., under the title “De officio legati” the canon law recognizes two sorts of
                    legate, the <hi rend="italic">legatus natus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legatus datus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">missus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >legatus datus</hi><hi rend="italic">(missus')</hi> may be either (1) <hi
                    rend="italic">delegatus,</hi> or (2) <hi rend="italic">nuncius
                    ap&gt;ostolicus,</hi> or (3) <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi><hi rend="italic">a
                    latere (lateralis,</hi><hi rend="italic">collateralis).</hi> The rights of the
                    <hi rend="italic">legatus natus,</hi> which included concurrent jurisdiction
                    with that of all the bishops within his province, have been much curtailed since
                    the 16th century; they were altogether suspended in presence of the higher
                    claims of a <hi rend="italic">legatus</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi></p></note>
                    And he maintained the same to be true of the fresh-water mussel (<hi
                    rend="italic">Unio),</hi> whose ova he examined so carefully that he saw in them
                    the rotation of the embryo, a phenomenon supposed to have been first discovered
                    long afterwards. ‘ ‘ This uncommonly pleasing spectacle,” he says, “was enjoyed
                    by myself, my daughter, and the engraver for three whole hours, and we thought
                    it one of the most delightful that could be exhibited.” Not only was he the
                    first discoverer of the rotifers, but he showed “how wonderfully nature has
                    provided for the preservation of their species,” by their tolerance of the
                    drying-up of the water they inhabit, and the resistance afforded to the
                    evaporation of the fluids of their bodies by the impermeability of the casing in
                    which they then become enclosed. “We can now easily conceive,” he says, “that in
                    all rain-water which is collected from gutters in cisterns, and in all waters
                    exposed to the air, animalcules may be found; for they may be carried thither by
                    the particles of dust blown about by the winds.” Although Baker is usually
                    credited with the first careful study of the “wheel-animalcule,” yet he really
                    added very little to the account long previously given of it by Leeuwenhoek. In
                    the same spirit he investigated the generation of eels, which were at that time
                    supposed, not only by the ignorant vulgar, but by “respectable and learned men,”
                    to be produced from dew (!) without the ordinary process of generation. He was
                    rewarded by the discovery of their viviparous propagation,—his careful and
                    prolonged observations on which point, though since called in question, have
                    never been refuted. The spectacle of the minute eels lying together in a
                    transparent liquid within the body of the female gave him, he says, great
                    pleasure,—affording a complete answer to those who said behind his back, “Since
                    Mr Leeuwenhoek is endeavouring to establish the regular generation of all
                    animals, let him show us in what manner eels are bred.”</p>
                <p>Altogether it does not seem too much to affirm that Leeuwenhoek is well entitled
                    to be considered, not only as “the father of scientific microscopy,” but as
                    having contributed more than any other naturalist to the overthrow of the
                    doctrine of “spontaneous generation,” and as having set a most admirable example
                    of scientific method in the prosecution of biological research.</p>
                <p>Leeuwenhoek’s contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> amounted to one hundred and twelwe. He also published
                    twenty-six papers in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Paris Academy of
                    Sciences.</hi> Two collections of his works appeared during his life, one in
                    Dutch, and the other in Latin,—the most complete edition having been published
                    at Leyden shortly before his death in 4 vols. (1719-22). A selection from this,
                    translated into English by S. Hoole, was published in London (1798-81), 2 vols.
