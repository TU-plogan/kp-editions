                    physician to the Polish king then reigning, and his father caused himself to be
                    naturalized as a Polish citizen. The original form of the name appears to have
                    been Loelheffel. From his earliest childhood the future historian showed his
                    fondness for books. In the year 1807 we find him teacher in a school at
                    Krzemieniec in Volhynia, and in 1814 professor of history at Vilna, a post which
                    he quitted in 1820 for a four years’ discharge of the same office at the
                    university of Warsaw, but returned to it in 1824. His lectures enjoyed great
                    popularity, and the enthusiasm felt for him by the students is shown in the
                    beautiful lines addressed to him by Mickiewicz. But this very circumstance made
                    him obnoxious to the Russian Government, and at Vilna Novosiltzev was then
                    all-powerful. Lelewel was removed from his professorship, and returned to
                    Warsaw, where he was elected a deputy to the diet in 1829. He joined the
                    revolutionary movement with great enthusiasm, but was throughout deficient in
                    energy, and, in fact, although the emperor Nicholas distinguished him as one of
                    the most dangerous rebels, he did not appear to advantage as a man of action. On
                    the suppression of the rebellion he made his way in disguise to Germany, and
                    subsequently reached Paris in 1831. There, however, he was not allowed to stay
                    long, as the Government of Louis Philippe ordered him to quit French territory
                    in 1833 at the request of the Russian ambassador. The cause of this expulsion is
                    said to have been his activity in writing revolutionary proclamations. He now
                    repaired to Brussels, where he for a time lectured on history at the university,
                    but was from some cause or other compelled to abandon his occupation. Lelewel
                    spent several years in Brussels in great poverty, barely earning a scanty
                    livelihood by his writings. He died in 1861 at Paris, whither he had removed a
                    short time previously.</p>
                <p>Lelewel was an indefatigable man of letters. He was of a simple austere
                    character, and of the strictest probity—in short, of an antique type, one of the
                    few men who have loved learning for its own sake. His literary activity was
                    enormous, extending over the period from the “Edda Skandinawska” of 1807 to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Géographie des Arabes,</hi> 2 vols., Paris, 1851. Many of his
                    works are concerned with Polish history, yet he by no means confined himself to
                    it. Thus he has written on the trade of Carthage, on Pytheas the early
                    geographer, and on numismatics (Zα <hi rend="italic">numismatique du Moyen
                    Âge,</hi> Paris, 1835, 2 vols.; <hi rend="italic">Études</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Numismatiqucs,</hi> Brussels, 1840). One of his most important publications
                    wasZα <hi rend="italic">Géographie du Moyen Âge,</hi> Brussels, 1850-52, with an
                    atlas of fifty plates entirely engraved by himself, for he rightly attached such
                    importance to the accuracy of his maps that he would not allow them to be
                    executed by anyone else. His works on Polish history are monumental; they have
                    been collected into a series under the title <hi rend="italic">Γolska, dzieje i
                    rzeczy jej rozpatrzywane</hi> (Poland, her History and Affairs Surveyed),
                    published at Posen, 1854-1868, in 20 vols. He had intended to have written a
                    complete history of the country on an extensive scale, but never accomplished
                    the task. His method is shown in the little history of Poland, first published
                    at Warsaw in Polish in 1823, under the title <hi rend="italic">Dzieje
                    Polski,</hi> and afterwards almost r ewritten in the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                    de Pologne,</hi> published at Paris in 2 vols, in 1844. Two other works on
                    Polish history which may be especially mentioned are an edition of the
                    “Chronicle of Matthew of Cholewa” and “Ancient Memorials of Polish Legislation”
                    <hi rend="italic">{Ksic^gi ustaw polskich i mazowieckich).</hi> While employed
                    in the university library of Warsaw he studied bibliography, and the fruits of
                    his labours may be seen in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliograficznych Ksiqg
                    dwoje</hi> (A Couple of Books on Bibliography) 2 vols. 8vo, Vilna, 1823-26. The
                    characteristics of Lelewel as an historian are great research and power to draw
                    inferences from his facts; his style is too often careless, and his narrative is
                    not picturesque, but his expressions are frequently terse and incisive. He has
                    left valuable materials for a just comprehension of his career in his
                    autobiography <hi rend="italic">{Adventures while Prosecuting Researches and
                    Inquiries on Polish Matters').</hi></p>
