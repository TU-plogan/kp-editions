                    ornithologists, one of the grandest birds-of-prey of the Palaearctic
                    Region—inhabiting lofty mountain chains from Portugal to the borders of China,
                    though within historic times, if not within living memory, it has been
                    exterminated in several of its ancient haunts. Its northern range in Europe does
                    not seem to have extended further than the southern frontier of Bavaria, or the
                    neighbourhood of Salzburg;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Dr Girtanner has a valuable paper on this bird in Switzerland (Verhandl.
                    Si-Gall, naturw. Gesellschaft, 1869-70, pp. 147-244).</p></note> but in Asia it
                    formerly reached a higher latitude, having been found even so lately as 1830 in
                    Dauuria (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol iii. p. 736, note 3), where
                    according to Herr Radde <hi rend="italic">(Beitr. Kenntn. Russ.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Reichs,</hi> xxiii. p. 467) it has now left but its name. It is
                    not uncommon on many parts of the Himalayas, where it breeds, and on the
                    mountains of Kumaon and the Punjab, and is the “Golden Eagle” of most
                    Anglo-Indians. Returning westward, it is found also in Persia, Palestine, Crete
                    and Greece, the Italian Alps, Sicily, Sardinia, and Mauritania.</p>
                <p>In some external characters the Lämmergeyer is obviously intermediate between the
                    Families <hi rend="italic">Vulturidse</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Palconidse,</hi> and the opinion of systematists has from time to time varied
                    as to its proper position; but as this ought to depend on the decision of
                    anatomists, who have not yet delivered their verdict, it must be still left in
                    doubt; and there would be little advantage in recounting how one author has
                    referred it to the former group and another to the latter, since nobody seems to
                    have applied the only sure test—that afforded by characters which are not
                    superficial<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Professor
                    Huxley’s labours have unfortunately not been directed to this particular point,
                    and therefore throw little or no light on it. He puts the Vultwridae and
                    Falconidae together under the name of Gyρ-aetidae, very properly separating from
                    them the American Vultures as Cathartidae.</p></note> It will suffice to say
                    that most writers have deemed its Vulturine affinity the strongest (relying
                    apparently on the form of the beak, which can scarcely be said to be either
                    Aquiline or Falconine), in spite of its well-feathered head and tarsi. The whole
                    length of the bird is from 43 to 46 inches, of which, however, about 20 are due
                    to the long cuneiform tail, while the pointed wings measure more than 30 inches
                    from the carpal joint to the tip. The coloration of the plumage is very
                    peculiar: the top of the head is white, bounded by black, which, beginning in
                    stiff bristly feathers turned forwards over the base of the beak, proceeds on
                    either side of the face in a well-defined band to the eye, where it bifurcates
                    into two narrow stripes, of which the upper one passes above and beyond that
                    feature till just in front of the scalp it suddenly turns upwards across the
                    head and meets the corresponding stripe from the opposite side, enclosing the
                    white forehead already mentioned, while the lower stripe extends beneath the eye
                    about as far backwards and then suddenly stops. A tuft of black, bristly
                    feathers projects beardlike from the base of the mandible, and gives the bird
                    one of its commonest epithets in many languages, as well as an appearance almost
                    unique among the whole Class <hi rend="italic">Aves.</hi> The rest of the head,
                    the neck, throat, and lower parts generally are clothed with lanceolate feathers
                    of a pale tawny colour—sometimes so pale as to be nearly white beneath;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herr Meves (Ofoers. Vet.
                    Akad. Förhandlingar, 1860, p. 487) asserts that in some cases, as proved by
                    chemical tests, the red colouring is due to a superficial deposit of oxide of
                    iron on the feathers, and <pb n="244"/> that the colouring-matter on the eggs
                    (to be presently described) also arises from the same cause. This opinion has,
                    however, been denied by several other naturalists, though none of them seem to
                    have tried the experiment; while Mr Hume, who has (Scrap Book, p. 46), confirms
                    Herr Meves’s statement. In confinement, moreover, the bird has been observed
                    always to lose or not to acquire its tawny tint.</p></note> while the scapulars,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n255/mode/1up"

                    greyish-black, most of the feathers having a white shaft and a median tawny
                    line. The quill-feathers, both of the wings and tail, are of a dark
                    blackish-grey. The irides are of a light orange, and the sclerotic
                    tunics,—equivalent to the “white of the eye” in most animals,—which in few birds
                    are visible, are in this very conspicuous and of a deep crimson, giving it an
                    air of great ferocity. In the young of the year the whole head, neck, and throat
                    are clothed in dull black, and most of the feathers of the mantle and
                    wing-coverts are broadly tipped and mesially streaked with tawny or lightish
                    grey.</p>
                <p>The Lämmergeyer breeds early in the year. The nest is of large size, built of
                    sticks, lined with soft material, and placed on a ledge of rock—a spot being
                    chosen, and often occupied for many years, which is nearly always difficιilt of
                    access, and not un frequently quite inaccessible, to man, from the precipitous
                    or overhanging configuration of the cliffs. Here in the month of February a
                    single egg is usually laid. This is more than 3 inches in length by nearly 2 J
                    in breadth, of a pale but lively brownish-orange. The young when in the nest are
                    clad in down of a dirty white, varied with grey on the head and neck, and with
                    ochraceous in the iliac region. How long the eggs take in hatching, or how long
                    the young remain nestlings, seems to be unknown. Equally unknown is the length
                    of time that elapses before the latter assume the adult plumage, but it is
                    probable that this period must at least exceed a twelvemonth.</p>
                <p>There is much discrepancy as to the ordinary food of the Lämmergeyer, some
                    observers maintaining that it lives almost entirely on carrion, offal, and the
                    most disgusting garbage; but there is no question of its frequently taking
                    living prey, and it is reasonable to suppose that this bird, like so many
                    others, is not everywhere uniform in its habits. Its very name shews it to be
                    the reputed enemy of shepherds, and it is in some measure owing to their
                    hostility that it has been exterminated in so many parts of its European range.
                    The usual mode of proceeding is said to be by suddenly rushing at the animal,
                    especially if it be young, when in a somewhat dangerous position, so startling
                    it as to make it lose its foothold and fall down the precipice.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stories are told of its
                    attacking human beings under such circumstances, and the present writer is not
                    disinclined to believe that some of such stories may be true, though he is
                    unable to refer to any that rest on testimony sufficient to dispel all
                    doubt.</p></note> But the Lämmergeyer has also a great partiality for bones,
                    which when small enough it swallows and slowly digests. When they are too large,
                    it is said to soar with them to a great height and drop them on a rock or stone
                    that they may be broken into pieces of convenient size. Hence its name
                    Ossifrage,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Among other
                    crimes attributed to the species is that, according to Pliny (Hist. Nat., x.
                    cap. 3), of having caused the death of the poet Aeschylus, by dropping a
                    tortoise on his bald head! In the Atlas range the food of this bird is said to
                    consist chiefly of the Τestudo rnauritanica, which “it carries to some height in
                    the air, and lets fall on a stone to break the shell” (Ibis, 1859, p. 177). It
                    was the iριrη and φ∙f∣νη of Greek classical writers.</p></note> by which the

                <p>The Lämmergeyer of north-eastern and south Africa is deemed by systematists to be
