                <p><label type="entry">LAPLAND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lappland</hi></label>, is
                    the north-west portion of the continent of Europe, bounded W., N., and E. by the
                    North Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean, and the White Sea, and S. partly by the White
                    Sea, but mainly by a conventional line. It includes the northern parts of
                    Norway, Sweden, and Finland, and the western part of the Russian government of
                    Archangel. A line drawn from the mouth of the Salten Fjord on the Norwegian
                    coast to the mouth of the Ponoi on the White Sea, practically identical with the
                    61st parallel of north latitude, measures 700 miles. Of Russian Lapland only a
                    very small portion lies outside of the Arctic circle; but in Swedish Lapland the
                    southern confines descend as low as 64°. According to Frijs (in Petermann’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Hitth.,</hi> 1870), the total area of Lapland may be estimated at
                    153,200 square miles, of which 16,073 miles belong to Norway, 48,898 to Sweden,
                    26,575 to Finland, and 61,654 to Russia.</p>

                    Scandinavian portion presents the usual characteristics of the mountain plateau
                    of that peninsula,—on one side the bold headlands, fjords, deep-grooved valleys,
                    and glaciers of Norway, on the other the long mountain lakes and lake-fed rivers
                    of Sweden. On the Swedish side the Lapp borders only come down to within from 30
                    to 40 miles of the coast, where the rivers begin to lose the character of
                    mountain streams. With the exception of Torne Lappmark, which is really part of
                    Scandinavia, Finnish and Russian Lapland may be generally described as
                    comparatively low country, broken by detached hills and ridges, one of which,
                    the Umbdek Dunder, attains an elevation of 2500 feet. Rivers and lakes abound.
                    In thé north of the Finnish region lies the great Enare or Inara (formerly Upper
                    Imandra) Lake, with an area of 1147 square miles; and the south is traversed by
                    the countless head-waters of the Kemi, which falls into the Gulf of Bothnia to
                    the east of the Swedish frontier. The largest of the rivers of Russian Lapland—
                    or, as it is often called, the Kola peninsula—is the Tulom, which falls into the
                    Arctic Ocean; and others of importance are the Pasvig, the Ponoi, and the
                    Varsuga. Lake Imandra, or Inandra (in Lappish Aver), is about 65 miles long by 8
                    or 9 broad; Lake Nuoljaure is 35 miles by 7; and Guolle-jaure, Umbozero,
                    Kontojarvi, and Pääjarvi are all of considerable extent. An opinion was long
                    prevalent that there was a natural boundary of the most striking kind between
                    the Arctic coast of Norwegian and that of Russian Lapland,—that to the east of
                    Jacob’s river the harbours or fjords were ice-bound for six months of the year,
                    while the influence of the Gulf Stream never allowed those to the west to be
                    frozen. This, however, is not the case. The principal harbours on the Murman
                    coast eastward to the month of the White Sea remain open like those of
                    Norway.</p>
                <p>Though Lapland contains vast stretches of desolate tundra and dreary swamp, the
                    country as a whole has a certain quiet beauty, and in the wilder districts the
                    scenery is wonderfully various in colour and form. “It is hardly possible,” says
                    Lieutenant Temple in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Roy. Geog. Sοc.,</hi> 1880, “to
                    conceive a greater contrast to the ice-bound regions which lie between the same
                    parallels in the western hemisphere.” And, though it gives little scope for
                    husbandry, Lapland is richly furnished with much that is serviceable to man. Not
                    to mention the iron and copper mines, it still possesses great store of timber,
                    pine and spruce and birch; though fruit trees yield no fruit, there is abundance
                    of edible berries; the rivers and lakes abound with salmon, trout, perch, and
                    pike; myriads of water-fowl, ptarmigan, partridges, and capercailzie breed
                    within its borders; and the cod, herring, holibut, and Greenland sharks of its
                    seas give occupation to thousands of fishermen.</p>
                <p>The chief characteristic of Lapland is its Arctic climate and the distribution of
                    daylight and darkness. In the northern parts the longest day and the longest
                    night last for three months each, and through the greater part of the country
                    the sun does not set at midsummer or rise at midwinter.</p>
                <p>The following calendar of the climate after Laestadius relates more particularly
                    to the northern districts of Swedish Lapland, but is more or less applicable to
                    a large part of the country :—January: cold and clear; no day-light; about 4

                <p>The population of Lapland has been considerably recruited in modern times by
                    immigrants from the south; but the country is still very sparsely peopled, and
                    the Lapps still predominate. There are no towns, and the villages are not only
                    few and insignificant, but often hardly less nomadic than the people, being
                    shifted according to exigencies of fodder or fuel. Hammerfest, the “most
                    northern town of the European continent,” has only 2100 inhabitants, and Kola
                    (formerly Malmis), the principal settlement in Russian Lapland, does not now
                    exceed 500.</p>

                    almost identical with those employed by the Finns for their country and race,
                    and probably connected with a root signifying “dark” (see Donner, <hi

                    certainly a nickname imposed by foreigners, although some of the Lapps apply it
                    contemptuously to those of their countrymen whom they think to be less civilized
                    than themselves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                    most probable etymology is the Finnish lαρρu, and in this case the meaning would
                    be the ‘ ‘ land’s-end folk.”</p></note></p>
                <p>In Sweden and Finland the Lapps are usually divided into fisher, mountain, and
                    forest Lapps. In Sweden the first class includes many impoverished mountain
                    Lapps. As described by Laestadius (1827-32), their condition was a very
                    miserable one; but since his time matters have much improved. The principal
                    colony has its summer quarters on the Stuor-Lule Lake, possesses good boats and
                    nets, and, besides catching and drying fish, makes money by the shooting of wild
                    fowl and the gathering of eggs. When he has acquired a little means it is not
                    unusual for the fisher to settle down and reclaim a bit of land. The mountain
                    and forest Lapps are the true representatives of the race. In the wandering life
                    of the mountain Lapp his autumn residence, on the borders of the forest
                    district, may be considered as the central point; it is there that he erects his
                    <hi rend="italic">njalla,</hi> a small wooden storehouse raised high above the
                    ground by one or more piles. At the beginning of November, a little sooner or
                    later, he begins to wander south or east into the forest land, and in the course
                    of the winter he may visit, not only such places as Jokkmokk and Arjepluog, but
                    even Gefle, Upsala, or Stockholm. About the beginning of May he is back at his
                    njalla, but as soon as the weather grows warm he pushes up to the mountains, and
                    there throughout the summer pastures his herds and prepares his store of cheese.
                    By autumn or October he is busy at his njalla killing the surplus reindeer bulls
                    and curing meat for the winter. From the mountain Lapp the forest (or, as he
                    used to be called, the spruce-fir) Lapp is mainly distinguished by the narrower
                    limits within which he pursues his nomadic life. He never wanders outside of a
                    certain district, in which he possesses hereditary rights, and maintains a
                    series of camping grounds which he visits in regular rotation. In May or April
                    he lets his reindeer loose, to wander as they please; but immediately after
                    midsummer, when the mosquitoes become troublesome, he goes to collect them.
                    Catching a single deer and “belling” it, he drives it through the wood: the
                    other deer, whose instinct leads them to gather into herds for mutual protection
                    against the mosquitoes, are <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n323/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0323-0306"/> attracted by the sound. Should the summer be very
                    cool and the mosquitoes few, the Lapp finds it next to impossible to bring the
                    creatures together. About the end of August they are again let loose, but they
                    are once more collected in October, the forest Lapp during winter pursuing the
                    same course of life as the mountain Lapp.</p>
                <p>In Norway there are three classes—the sea Lapps, the river Lapps, and the
                    mountain Lapps, the first two settled, the third nomadic. The mountain Lapps
                    have, on the whole, a rather ruder and harder life than the same class in
                    Sweden. About Christmas those of Kautokeino and Karasjokk are usually settled in
                    the neighbourhood of the churches; in summer they visit the coast, and in autumn
                    they return inland. Previous to 1852, when they were forbidden by imperial
                    decree, they were wont in winter to move south across the Russian frontiers. It
                    is seldom possible for them to remain more than three or four days in one spot.
                    Flesh is their favourite, in winter almost their only, food, though they also
                    use reindeer milk, cheese, and rye or barley cakes. The sea Lapps are in some
                    respects hardly to be distinguished from the other coast dwellers of Finmark.
                    Their food consists mainly of cooked fish. The river Lapps, many of whom,
                    however, are descendants of Quains or Finns proper, breed cattle, attempt a
                    little tillage, and entrust their reindeer to the care of mountain Lapps.</p>
                <p>In Finland there are comparatively few Laplanders, and the great bulk of them
                    belong to the fisher class. Many of them are settled in the neighbourhood of the
                    Enare Lake. In the spring they go down to the Norwegian coast and take part in
                    the sea fisheries, returning to the lake about midsummer. Formerly they found
                    the capture of wild reindeer a profitable occupation, using for this purpose a
                    palisaded avenue gradually narrowing towards a pitfail.</p>
                <p>The Russian Lapps are also for the most part fishers, as is natural in a district
                    with such an extent of coast and such a number of lakes, not to mention the
                    advantage which the fisher has over the reindeer keeper in connexion with the
                    many fasts of the Greek Church. They maintain a half nomadic kind of life, very
                    few of them having become regular settlers in the Russian villages. It is usual
                    to distinguish them according to the district of the coast which they frequent,
                    as Murman (Murmanski) and Terian (Terski) Lapps. A separate tribe, the Filmans,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Finnmans, nomadize about the Pazyets, Motoff, and
                    Petchenga tundras, and retain the peculiar dialect and the Lutheran creed which
                    they owe to a former connexion with Sweden. They were formerly known as the
                    “twice and thrice tributary” Lapps, because they paid to two or even three
                    states— Russia, Denmark, and Sweden.</p>
                <p>The ethnographical position of the Lapps has not been clearly determined, though
                    it is evident they can no longer be classified with the Finns. They are, as has
                    been seen, far from a numerous people, and within the historical period they
                    have considerably recruited themselves from neighbouring races. Shortness of
                    stature<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence they have
                    been supposed by many to be the originals of the “little folk” of Scandinavian
                    legend.</p></note> is their most obvious characteristic, though in regard to
                    this much exaggeration has prevailed. Düben (p. 167) found an average of 4 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 9 feet for males and a little less for females;
                    Mantegazza, who made a number of anthropological observations in Norway in 1879,
                    gives 5 feet and 4 ’ 75 feet respectively <hi rend="italic">(Archivio per
                    Vantrop.,</hi> 1880). Individuals much above or much below the average are rare.
                    The body is usually of fair proportions, but the legs are rather short, and in
                    many cases somewhat bandy. Dark, swarthy, yellow, copper-coloured are all
                    adjectives employed by competent observers to describe their complexion,—the
                    truth being that their habits of life do not conduce either to the preservation
                    or display of their natural colour of skin, and that some of them are really
                    fair, and others, perhaps the majority, really dark. The colour of the hair,
                    too, ranges from blonde and reddish to a bluish or greyish black·; and the eyes
                    are black, hazel, blue, or grey. The shape of the skull is the most striking
                    peculiarity of the Lapp. He is the most brachycephalous type of man in Europe,
                    perhaps in the world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Bertillon found in one instance a cephalic index of 94. The average obtained
                    by Brunei· Bey was 84*7, by Virchow 82 ’ 5.</p></note> According to Virchow, the
                    women in width of face are more Mongolian-like than the men, but neither in men
                    nor women does the opening of the eye show any true obliquity. In children the
                    eye is large, open, and round. The nose is always low and broad, more markedly
                    retroussé among the females than the males. Wrinkled and puckered by exposure to
                    the weather, the faces even of the younger Lapps assume an appearance of old
                    age. The muscular system is usually well developed, but there is deficiency of
                    fatty tissue, which affects the features (particularly by giving relative

                    the skin, indeed, can but rarely be paralleled among other Europeans. Among the
                    Lapps, as among other lower races, the index is shorter than the ring
                    finger.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Retzius,

                <p>The Lapps are a quiet, inoffensive people. Crimes of violence are almost unknown
                    among them, and the only common breach of law is the killing of tame reindeer
                    belonging to other owners. In Russia, however, they have a bad reputation for
                    lying and general untrustworthiness, and drunkenness is well-nigh a universal
                    vice. In Scandinavia laws have been directed against the importation of
                    intoxicating liquors into the Lapp country since 1723.</p>
                <p>Superficially at least the great bulk of the Lapps have been Christianized,—those
                    of the Scandinavian countries being Protestants, those of Russia members of the
                    Greek Church. In education the Scandinavian Lapps are far ahead of their Russian
                    brethren, to whom reading and writing are arts as unfamiliar as they were to
                    their pagan ancestors. The general manner of life is patriarchal. The father of
                    the family has complete authority over all its affairs; and on his death this
                    authority passes to the eldest son. Parents are free to disinherit their
                    children; and, if a son separates from the family without his father’s
                    permission, he receives no share of the property except a gun and his wife’s
                    dowry.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A valuable paper

                <p>By the very circumstances of their position the Lapps are of necessity
                    conservative in most of their habits, many of which can hardly have altered
                    since the first taming of the reindeer. But the strong current of mercantile
                    enterprise has carried a few important products of southern civilization into
                    their huts. The lines in which Thomson describes their simple life—</p>

                    all their homely wealth Supply; their wholesome fare and cheerful cups—</p>
                <p>are still applicable in the main to the mountain Lapps; but even they have
                    learned to use coffee as an ordinary beverage, and to wear stout Norwegian cloth
                    <hi rend="italic">(vadmal).</hi></p>
                <p>Linguistically the Laps belong to the great Uralo-Altaic family; the similarity
                    of their speech to Finnish is evident on the surface. It is broken up into very
                    distinct and even mutually unintelligible dialects, the origin of several of
                    which is, however, easily found in <pb break="no"

                    people. Düben distinguishes four leading dialects; but a much greater number are
                    recognizable. In Russian Lapland alone there are three, due to the influence of
                    Norwegian, Karelian, and Russian (Lonnrot, Acta Soc. Sei. Fennicae, vol. iv.).
                    “The Lapps,” says Castren, ‘ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> have had the
                    misfortune to come into close contact with foreign races while their language
                    was yet in its tenderest infancy, and consequently it has not only adopted an
                    endless number of foreign words, but in many grammatical aspects fashioned
                    itself after foreign models.” That it began at a very early period to enrich
                    itself with Scandinavian words is shown by the use it still makes of forms
                    belonging to a linguistic stage older even than that of Icelandic. Düben has
                    subjected the vocabulary to a very interesting analysis for the purpose of
                    discovering what stage of culture the people had reached before their contact
                    with the Norse. Agricultural tenns, the names of the metals, and the word for
                    smith, are all of Scandinavian origin, and the words for “taming” and “milk”
                    would suggest that the southern strangers taught the Lapps how to turn the
                    reindeer to full account. The important place, however, which this creature must
                    always have held in their estimation is evident from the existence of more than
                    three hundred native reindeer words.</p>
                <p>The Lapp tongue was long ago reduced to writing by the missionaries; but very
                    little has been printed in it except school-books and religious works. A number
                    of popular tales and songs, indeed, have been taken down from the lips of the
                    people by Fjellner, Grönland, and others; J. A. Frijs, professor of Lapp in the
                    university of Christiania, has published Lappiske Sprogρrover: en samling lapp.
                    eυentyr, ordsprog, og gdder, Christiania, 1856; and Lappish mythologi eventyr
                    ogfolkesagn, Christiania, 1871· See also G. Donner, Lieder der Lappen,
                    Helsingfors, 1876. The songs are extremely similar to those of the Finns, and a
                    process of mutual borrowing seems to have gone on. In one of the saga-like
                    pieces—Pishan-Peshan’s son—there seems to be a distinct mention of the Baikal
                    Lake, and possibly also of the Altai Mountains. The story of Njavvisena,
                    daughter of the Sun, is full of quaint folklore about the taming of the
                    reindeer. Giants, as well as a blind or one-eyed monster, are frequently
                    introduced, and the Aesopic fable is not without its representatives. Grammars
                    of the Lapp tongue have been published by Fjellstrom (1738), Leem (1748), Rask
                    (1832), Stockfleth (1840); lexicons by Fjellstrom (1730), Leem (1768-1781),
                    Lindahl (1780), Stockfleth (1852). Many of the Lapps are able to speak one or
                    even two of the neighbouring tongues.</p>
                <p>The reputation of the Laplanders for skill in magic and divination is of very
                    early date, and in Finland is not yet extinct. When Erik Blood-axe, son of
                    Harold Haarfager, visited Bjarmaland in 922, he found Gunhild, daughter of Asur
                    Tote, living among the Lapps, to whom she had been sent by her father for the
                    purpose of being trained in witchcraft; and Ivan the Terrible of Russia sent for
                    magicians from Lapland to explain the cause of the appearance of a comet. One of
                    the powers with which they were formerly credited was that of raising winds.
                    “They tye three knottes,” says old Richard Eden, “on a strynge hangyng at a
                    whyp. When they lose one of these they rayse tollerable wynds. When they lose an
                    other the wynde is more vehement; but by losing the thyrd they rayse playne
                    tempestes as in old tyme they were accustomed to rayse thunder and lyghtnyng”
                    (Hist, of Trauayle, 1577, p. 284). Though we are familiar in English with
                    allusions to “Lapland witches,” it appears that the art, according to native
                    custom, was in the hands of the men. During his divination the wizard fell into
                    a state of trance or ecstasy, his soul being held to run about at large to
                    pursue its inquiries. Great use was made of a curious divining-drum, oval in
                    shape, and made of wood, 1 to 4 feet in length. Over the upper surface was
                    stretched a white-dressed reindeer skin, and at the corners (so to speak) hang a
                    variety of charms—tufts of wool, bones, teeth, claws, &amp;c. The area λvas
                    divided into several spaces, often into three, one for the celestial gods, one
                    for the terrestrial, and one for man. A variety of figures and conventional
                    signs were drawn in the several compartments: the sun, for instance, is
                    frequently represented by a square and a stroke from each corner, Thor by two
                    hammers placed crosswise; and in the more modern specimens symbols for Christ,
                    the Virgin, and the Holy Ghost are introduced. An arpa or divining-rod was laid
                    on a definite spot, the drum beaten by a hammer, and conclusions drawn from the
                    position taken up by the arpa. Any Lapp who had attained to manhood could in
                    ordinary circumstances consult the drum for himself, but in matters of unusual
                    moment the professional wizard (nâid, noide, or noaide) had to be called in.</p>
                <p>The Lapps have a dim tradition that their ancestors lived in a far eastern land,
                    and they tell rude stories of their own conflicts with Norsemen and Karelians.
                    But no answer can be obtained from them to the questions naturally put by the
                    historian in regard to their early distribution and movements. By many it has
                    been maintained that they were formerly spread over the whole of the
                    Scandinavian peninsula, and they have even been considered by some as the
                    remnants of that primeval race of cave-dwellers which hunted the reindeer over
                    the snow-fields of central and western Europe. But much of the evidence adduced
                    for these theories is highly questionable. The contents of the so-called Lapps’
                    graves found in various parts of Scandinavia are often sufficient in themselves
                    to show that the appellation must be a misnomer, and the syllable Lap or Lapp
                    found in many names of places can often be proved to have no connexion with the
                    Lapps. Nothing more can be affirmed with certainty than that the area occupied
                    or visited by the Lapps once extended farther south (in Russia as far, it would
                    appear, as Lake Ladoga), and that they already occupied their present territory
                    at the time when they are first mentioned in history. According to Düben the
                    name first occurs in the 13th century—in the Fundinn Noregr, composed about
                    1200, in Saxo Grammaticus, and in a papal bull of date 1230; but the people are
                    probably to be identified with those Finns of Tacitus whom he describes as wild
                    hunters with skins for clothing and rude huts as only means of shelter, and
                    certainly with the Skrithiphinoi of Procopius (Goth., ii. 15), the Scritobini of
                    Paulus Warnefridus, and the Scridifinni of the geographer of Ravenna. Some of
                    the details given by Procopius, in regard for instance to the treatment of
                    infants, show that his informant was acquainted with certain characteristic
                    customs of the Lapps.</p>
                <p>In the 9th century the Norsemen from Norway began to treat their feeble northern
                    neighbours as a subject race.* The wealth of Ottar,—“northmost of the
                    northmen,”—whose narrative has been preserved by King Alfred, consisted mainly
                    of six hundred of those “deer they call hrenas” and in tribute paid by the
                    natives; and the Eigils saga tells how Brynjulf Bjargulfson had his right to
                    collect contributions from the Finns (i.β., the Lapps) recognized by Harold
                    Haarfager. So much value was attached to this source of wealth that as early as
                    1050 strangers were excluded from the furtrade of Finmark, and a kind of
                    coast-guard prevented their intrusion. Meantime the Karelians were pressing on
                    the eastern Lapps, and in the course of the 11th century the rulers of Novgorod
                    began to treat them as the Norsemen had treated their western brethren. The
                    ground-swell of the Tartar invasion drove the Karelians westward in the 13th
                    century, and for many years even Finmark was so unsettled that the Norsemen
                    received no tribute from the Lapps. At length in 1326 a treaty was concluded
                    between Norway and Russia by which the supremacy of the Norwegians over the
                    Lapps was recognized as far east as Voljo beyond Kandalax on the White Sea, and
                    the supremacy of the Russians over the Karelians as far as Lyngen and the
                    Mâlself. The relations of the Lapps to their more powerful neighbours were
                    complicated by the rivalry of the different Scandinavian kingdoms. After the
                    disruption of the Calmar Union (1523), Sweden began to assert its rights with
                    vigour, and in 1595 the treaty of Teusina between Sweden and Russia decreed
                    “that the Lapps who dwell in the woods between eastern Bothnia and Varanger
                    shall pay their dues to the king of Sweden.” It was in vain that Christian IV.
                    of Denmark visited Kola and exacted homage in 1599, and every year sent
                    messengers to protest against the collection of his tribute by the Swedes (a
                    custom which continued down to 1806). Charles of Sweden took the title of “king
                    of the Kajans and Lapps,” and left no means untried to establish his power over
                    all Scandinavian Lapland. By the peace of Knäröd (1613) Gustavus Adolphus gave
                    up the Swedish claim to Finmark; and in 1751 mutual renunciations brought the
                    relations of Swedish and Norwegian (Danish) Lapland to their present position.
                    Meanwhile Russian influence had been spreading westward; and in 1809, when
                    Alexander I. finally obtained the cession of Finland, he also added to his
                    dominions the whole of Finnish Lapland to the east of the Muonio and the
                    Köngäma.</p>
                <p>The Lapps have had the ordinary fate of a subject and defenceless people; they
                    have been utilized with little regard to their own interests or inclinations.
                    The example set by the early Norwegians was followed by the Swedes: a peculiar
                    class of adventurers known as the Birkarlians (from Bjark or Birk, “trade ”)
                    began in the 13th century to farm the Lapps, and, receiving very extensive
                    privileges from the kings, grew to great wealth and influence. In 1606 there
                    were twenty-two Birkarlians in Tornio, seventeen in Lule, sixteen in Pite, and
                    sixty-six in Ume Lappmark. They are regularly spoken of as having or owning
                    Lapps, whom they hire out, and dispose of as any other piece of property. In
                    Russian Lapland matters followed much the same course. The very institution of
                    the Solovets monastery, intended by St Tryphon for the benefit of the poor
                    neglected pagans, turned out the occasion of much injustice towards them. By a
                    charter of Ivan Vasilivitch (November 1556), the monks are declared masters of
                    the Lapps of the Motoff and Petchenga districts, and they soon sought to extend
                    their control over those not legally assigned to them (Ephimenko). Other
                    monasteries in distant parts of the empire were gifted with similar proprietary
                    rights; and the supplication of the patriarch Nikon to Alexis Mikhaelovitch, for
                    example, shows only too clearly the oppression to which the Lapps were
                    subjected.</p>
                <p>It is long, however, since these abuses were abolished; and in Scandinavia more
                    especially the Lapps of the present day enjoy the advantages resulting from a
                    large amount of philanthropic legislation on the part of their rulers. There
                    seems to be no fear of their becoming extinct, except it may be by gradual
                    amalgamation with <pb break="no"

                    number in all Lapland is estimated at 27,000. According to official statistics
                    the Swedish Lapps increased from 5617 in 1830 to 6702 in 1870. In Norway there
                    were 14,464 in 1845, 17,178 in 1865. For Russian and Finnish Lapland the numbers
                    were given in 1859 as 1200 and 2183, and according to Kelsieff the whole number
                    in Russia is not now more than 3000. The number of reindeer possessed by the
                    whole people is estimated at 363,000.</p>
