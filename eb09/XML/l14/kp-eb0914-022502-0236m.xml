                    long., with an area of 1947 square miles. It is bounded N. and W. by the river
                    Betwa, S.W. by the Narayan, S. by the Vindhyachal Ghâts and the Sâgar (Saugor)
                    district of the Central Provinces, S.E. and E. by Orchha state and the Dhasan.
                    The district is an undulating plain about 1500 feet on an average above the
                    sea-level, in the hill country of Bundelkhand, sloping gradually northwards from
                    the Vindhya range to the Betwa and Jumna. It is drained by several important
                    tributaries of the Jumna, and an immense number of smaller streams; but their
                    rapid and frequently swollen currents, instead of fertilizing, impoverish the
                    land and sweep away embankments and bridges. The general condition of the
                    district is far from prosperous. A large proportion of the area is covered with
                    jungle, and the poor-looking villages are few and far between. Only 366 square
                    miles were under tillage in 1872; the food stuffs (mainly wheat, grain, barley,
                    and millet) are never produced in much greater quantity than is necessary for
                    local consumption, and a bad year results in scarcity, if not famine. As but
                    little is done in the way of irrigation, the spring harvest is a very poor one;
                    and if the rainfall sinks much below its average of 40 inches the autumn harvest
                    is also scanty.</p>
                <p>In 1865 the population was 248,146; in 1872 it was only 212,661, while the number
                    of villages had fallen from 750 to 646. About 98 per cent. (207,788) of the
                    inhabitants in 1872 were Hindus—the Brahmans numbering 20,657, Rajputs 20,985,
                    Banias 11,356. The Rajput Bundelas are the most important socially, the Banias
                    commercially. A few Gonds are found in the south, and about 10,000 Sahariyas, a
                    degraded body of savages known to the police throughout India as professional
                    thieves, are scattered throughout the jungle. The district is administered on
                    the non-regulation system by a deputy-commissioner. The only municipality is
                    Lalitpur town (population 8976 in 1872). The Gonds are the earliest known
                    inhabitants of Lalitpur; they have left traces of their ultimate high state of
                    civilization in temples and reservoirs. They were succeeded by the Chandel
                    princes of Mahoba, who in their turn gave place to a number of petty independent
                    rulers. In the 14th century the Bundelas invaded the country, and Lalitpur
                    finally became a part of the state of Chanderi, which continued for the most
                    part practically independent till the beginning of the 19th century, when
                    Sindhia, provoked by raids into Gwalior, sent Colonel Baptiste against Lalitpur,
                    and took the government under his direct control. In 1829 two-thirds of his
                    territory was restored to the Chanderi sovereign. The remainder of the country,
                    which was retained by Sindhia, was in 1844 made over to the British Government.
                    The Bundela chiefs of Lalitpur were among those who most eagerly joined the
                    mutiny, and it was only after a severe struggle that the district was again
                    pacified.</p>
