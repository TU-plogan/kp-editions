                    Virginia, U.S., January 20, 1732, was one of six distinguished sons of Thomas
                    Lee, a descendant of an old Cavalier family. After obtaining the foundation of a
                    liberal education in England, and spending a little time in travel, he returned
                    to Virginia in 1752, coming into possession of a fine property left him by his
                    father, and for several years applied himself to varied studies. At the age of
                    twenty-five he was appointed justice of the peace, and soon after was chosen a
                    delegate to the house of burgesses. He kept a diffident silence during two
                    sessions, his first speech being in strong opposition to slavery, which he
                    proposed to discourage, and eventually to abolish, by imposing a heavy tax on
                    all further importations. In 1764 Lee had applied for a collectorship under the
                    Stamp Act, which afterwards roused the determined hostility of the colonies, but
                    on reflexion he regretted doing so, and became an outspoken promoter of the most
                    extreme democratic ideas. In February 1766 he organized an association in
                    Westmoreland, in accordance with Patrick Henry’s famous resolution against the
                    Act. At the winter session of the burgesses in 1766, Lee, with the aid of
                    Patrick Henry, succeeded in carrying the house upon a test question against the
                    united aristocratic elements of the colony. In 1767 he spoke eloquently against
                    the acts levying duties upon tea and other articles, and in 1768, in a letter to
                    John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, he made the suggestion of a private
                    correspondence among the friends of liberty in the different colonies. Lee is
                    said also to have originated, in a conversation with fellow burgesses in 1773,
                    the plan of an inter-colonial or so-called continental congress, which was
                    carried into effect next year. At this first congress in Philadelphia in 1774,
                    Lee is said to have penned the address to the king, and is known to have
                    prepared that to the people of British America, together with the second address
                    to the people of Great Britain, directed by congress in 1775, both of which are
                    among the most effective papers of the time. On June 7, 1776, instructed by the
                    Virginia house of burgesses, he introduced in congress the resolutions declaring
                    “that these united colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and independent
                    states, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and
                    that all political connexion between them and the state of Great Britain is, and
                    ought to be, totally dissolved.” Lee was in congress in 1778-80 and 1784-85, and
                    was one of the first senators chosen from Virginia after the adoption of the
                    federal constitution. Though strongly opposed to the adoption of that
                    constitution, owing to what he regarded as its dangerous infringements upon the
                    independent power of the States, he accepted the place of senator in hope of
                    bringing about amendments. He became a warm upholder of Washington’s
                    administration, and his prejudices against the constitution were largely removed
                    by its working in practice. He retired from public life in 1792, and died at
                    Chantilly in Westmoreland county, June 19, 1794.</p>
