                <p>L represents probably the same sound in all alphabets.</p>
                <p>That sound used to be called a “liquid,” in which class <hi rend="italic">m,

                    unsatisfactory so far as <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>
                    are concerned, for they have nothing common in their formation with the others.
                    But <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> are very closely akin.
                    They are both dentals —or more accurately front palatals—produced by raising the
                    point of the tongue to the front part of the palate, immediately behind the
                    gums. They differ in this: for <hi rend="italic">r</hi> a small aperture is left
                    over the tip of the tongue by which the air escapes; but for <hi rend="italic"
                    >l</hi> the tongue reaches the top of the palate, but does not rest (as for r)
                    against the sides of the mouth, and the voice escapes laterally by these
                    side-apertures. The slightness of the difference in the positions of the mouth
                    for these two sounds explains their exchangeableness. Perhaps the most
                    remarkable variation of the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> sound is that which is
                    heard in Welsh and denoted by <hi rend="italic">ll,</hi> in such words as
                    Llanberis, Llangollen, &amp;c. An Englishman commonly sounds this as <hi
                    rend="italic">thl,</hi> which is certainly not right. But the best authorities
                    on phonetics are not agreed as to the precise nature of the sound. Mr Ellis
                    thinks that it is produced by laying the left side of the tongue against the
                    whole of the palate, and then forcibly ejecting the breath along the right side.
                    But he admits that the sound thus produced differs very little from a voiceless
                    or surd <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (the common <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is
                    sonant), which stands therefore to <hi rend="italic">l</hi> in the same relation
                    as <hi rend="italic">f</hi> does to <hi rend="italic">v, or wh</hi> (really <hi
                    rend="italic">hui)</hi> to <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> A simpler modification of
                    the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> sound is that heard in the Italian “gli” or in the
                    Spanish “llano”; it is formed by raising the middle part of the tongue to the
                    roof of the mouth, not the point against the front part of the palate, as for
                    the ordinary <hi rend="italic">I.</hi></p>
                <p>The peculiar nature of the <hi rend="italic">l</hi> sound renders it apt to fall
                    out before consonants with which it is inconsistent; this is specially seen in
                    French plurals, such as “chevaux” from “cheval.” It is also common, but
                    sporadic, in English; <hi rend="italic">e,g.,</hi> in “walk,” “talk,” “palm,”
                    “alms,” “half,” “would,” &amp;c. As is frequently the case with such vanishing
                    sounds, it has sometimes intruded through false analogy in words with which it
                    has nothing to do, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in “could” (Old English “coude
                    ”), and rather strangely in some words of Latin origin, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> participle, principle. The form of the letter L has varied slightly,
                    but has always consisted of two straight lines at an angle. In Greek the form
                    was generally A; and this has been preserved in the Cyrillic and Russian
                    alphabets. But in the western Greek alphabet the form was generally <hi
                    rend="italic">L</hi>; and this appears in old Roman inscriptions, passing by
                    degrees into the right angle with which we are familiar.</p>
