                    into the semblance of a snout or muzzle (often upturned at the tip), the
                    so-called “lantern.” This snout is hollow, and is merely an inflated production
                    of the head. Much interest, as well as mystery, has surrounded these insects,
                    originating in a statement by Madame Merian in her work on the insects of
                    Surinam <hi rend="italic">(Metamorphosis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >insectorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Surinamensium,</hi> &amp;c.), of which the
                    first edition appears to have been published in 1705, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n306/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0306-0291"/> but which subsequently passed through many
                    editions with varying titles and in several languages. Madame Merian stated that
                    the common South American species, now known as <hi rend="italic">Fulgora
                    laternaria,</hi> L., was highly luminous at night, so much so that she was
                    enabled to read by the light of one only, and that when several were confined
                    together the interior of the box appeared all ablaze. No one doubted these
                    statements, and the illustrious Linnaeus used the words “Prominente fronte noctu
                    lucem vivacissimam spargit” in diagnosing the insect in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Systema</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturae.</hi> Moreover, it was believed that,
                    because one species had been asserted to be luminous, others allied thereto must
                    possess the same power; the specific names used by Linnaeus, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">Candelaria, phosphorea, noctivida,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucernaria,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">flammea,</hi> may be adduced as
                    instances. Of these one only, the <hi rend="italic">F. Candelaria</hi> of China,
                    has become (with the original <hi rend="italic">laternaria)</hi> a subject of
                    controversy, for it also was asserted to be luminous. As time wore on many
                    intelligent naturalists and other travellers visited both South America and
                    China, and they concluded that the light must be produced only under very
                    exceptional conditions, or that the original statement was an error, for they
                    could not detect any luminosity, nor, as a rule, was such a property believed in
                    by the natives of the regions. Quite recently many naturalists of undoubted
                    authority have resided for years in the districts where these insects occur
                    without having ^personally detected luminosity (though directly in search of
                    it), and without obtaining any indications of the existence of such a belief in
                    the minds of the natives. On the other hand, there have been a few travellers
                    who have professed to be able to confirm Madame Merian’s statements, both from
                    personal observation and from information derived from native sources. Possibly
                    the last of these was within the last twenty years, and his assertion concerned
                    <hi rend="italic">F. Candelaria,</hi> and upon his statement an entomologist of
                    repute, lately deceased, maintained to the last his belief in the luminous
                    powers. With him all faith in this direction has probably passed away. It is not
                    for us to attempt to define the reasons for Madame Merian’s positive and
                    circumstantial statements. The preponderance of negative testimony is so
                    crushingly great that <hi rend="italic">Fulgora</hi> may be regarded as
                    eliminated from the category of luminous insects.</p>
