                <p><label type="entry">LITURGY</label>. The word “Liturgy” technically denotes the
                    “Order for the Celebration and Administration of the Eucharist.” It has come to
                    be used in a more popular sense to denote any or all of the various services of
                    the Christian church, whether contained in separate volumes or bound up together
                    in the form of a Book of Common Prayer. We propose to treat of “the liturgy”
                    chiefly, but not exclusively, in the former and stricter sense, and, without
                    further discussion of the use of the word in Biblical or patristic literature,
                    and without entering into various questions with reference to their origin,
                    growth, first committal to writing, &lt;kc., to give our readers some account of
                    the principal liturgies which exist, or have existed, in the Christian
                    church.</p>
                <p>There are five main families or groups of liturgies, three of them Eastern in
                    origin and use, one Eastern in origin but Western in use, one Western both in
                    origin and use. They are known either by the names of the apostles with whom
                    they are traditionally connected, or by the names of the countries or cities in
                    which they are known or believed to have been once or always in use.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">St James, West Syrian,
                    Jerusalem. —</hi> The principal liturgies to be enumerated under this group are
                    the Clementine, so called from being found in the eighth book of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Apostolic Constitutions,</hi> which have been erroneously referred
                    to St Clement, first bishop of Rome (lib. viii. 10-15); the Greek and Syriac
                    liturgies of St James; the Greek liturgies of St Basil and St Chrysostom; the
                    Armenian liturgy of St Gregory the Illuminator, first patriarch of Armenia; a
                    large number of later Syriac liturgies springing from the Syriac liturgy of St
                    James. Of these liturgies, that of St Chrysostom is used now by the Orthodox
                    Eastern Church, except on the first five Sundays in Lent, Thursday and Saturday
                    in Holy Week, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n730/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0730-0707"/> the vigils of Christmas and Epiphany, and St
                    Basil’s Day, when the liturgy of St Basil is used; and in Lent (except Sundays
                    and Saturdays and Lady Day), when the liturgy of the pre-sanctified is used.</p>
                <p>This group, like all the purely Eastern liturgies, is marked by an absence of
                    flexibility as to number and shape of prefaces, collects, &amp;c. Its special
                    feature, if we may adopt a recently employed canon of differentiation, is the
                    position of the great intercession for quick and dead, for rulers in church and
                    state, for the sick, for travellers, for the fruits of the earth, &amp;c., after
                    the consecration of the elements has been completed by the invocation of the
                    Holy Spirit (C. E. Hammond, <hi rend="italic">Lit. Eastern and Western,</hi> pp.
                    26-29).</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">St Hark, Egyptian,
                    Alexandria.—</hi> This group includes the Greek liturgies of St Mark, St Basil,
                    and St Gregory; the Coptic liturgies of St Cyril, St Basil, and St Gregory; the
                    Ethiopie liturgy known as the “Canon Universalis” or “Liturgy of all the
                    Apostles,” together with sixteen other subordinate Ethiopie liturgies. They are
                    distinguished by the position of the great intercession in the middle of the
                    preface, as well as by the prominent part assigned throughout to the deacon.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">St</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Adaeus,</hi><hi rend="italic">East Syrian, Edessa.—</hi> There are three extant
                    liturgies belonging to this group, now exclusively used by Nestorian
                    Christians,—those of SS. Adaeus and Maris, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and
                    Nestorius; the titles of three lost liturgies have been preserved, —those of
                    Narses, Barsumas, and Diodorus of Tarsus. The liturgy of the Christians of St
                    Thomas, on the Malabar coast of India, formerly belonged to this group, but it
                    was almost completely assimilated to the Roman liturgy by Portuguese Jesuits at
                    the synod of Diamper in 1599. The characteristic of this group is the position
                    of the great intercession in the middle of the consecration, between the words
                    of institution (or, to speak more accurately, the place where the words of
                    institution must have occurred) and the invocation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">St John,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hispano-Gallican,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ephesus.—</hi> This group
                    of Latin liturgies, which once prevailed very widely in western Europe, has been
                    almost universally superseded by the liturgy of the Church of Rome. Where it
                    survives it has been either partially or almost completely assimilated to the
                    Roman pattern. It prevailed once throughout Spain, France, part of northern
                    Italy, and Great Britain and Ireland, in forms of which a detailed account is
                    appended. · The term “Ephesine” has been applied to this family of liturgies,
                    chiefly by modern English liturgiologists, to denote a theory as to their origin
                    which, although upheld by other than English writers, must be regarded rather as
                    a possible hypothesis than a proved fact (Leslie, <hi rend="italic">Pref, to
                    Mozar. Missal,</hi> sect. 25; Bickell, <hi rend="italic">Messe und Pascha,</hi>
                    P∙ lθ)∙ The many traces of Eastern influence in their composition, and the close
                    connexion which is known to have existed at a very early period between the
                    churches of Lyons and of western Asia Minor, have suggested the theory that the
                    latter country must have been the birthplace of this class of liturgies. The
                    names of the apostle St John and of Ephesus his place of residence have been
                    pressed into service as further particularizations of the same theory. The
                    special feature of these liturgies is the position of the great intercession
                    after the offertory, before the commencement of the preface and canon.</p>
                <p>The chief traces of Oriental affinity lie in the following points :—(1) the
                    various proclamations made by the deacon, including that of « Silentium facite”
                    before the epistle (Migne, tom. lxxxv. p. 534); (2) the presence of a third
                    lesson, preceding the epistle, taken from the Old Testament; (3) the occasional
                    presence of “preces,” a series of short intercessions resembling the Greek
                    “Ektene,” or deacon’s litany; (4) the position of the kiss of peace at an early
                    point in the service, before the canon, instead of the Roman position after
                    consecration; (5) the exclamation “sancta sanctis” occurring in the Mozarabic
                    rite, the counterpart of the Eastern τα αγια τoις dγιbιs; (6) traces of the
                    presence of the “Epiklesis,” that is to say, the invocation of the Holy Spirit,
                    in its Eastern position, after the words of institution, as in the collect
                    styled the Post-pridie in the Mozarabic service for the second Sunday after
                    Epiphany :—“We beseech thee that thou wouldest sanctify this oblation with the
                    permixture of Thy Spirit, and conform it with full transformation into the Body
                    and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.” On the other hand, the great variableness
                    of its parts, and its immense number of proper prefaces, ally it to the Western
                    family of liturgies.</p>
                <p>We now proceed to give a more detailed account of the chief liturgies of the
                    Hispano-Gallican group.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Mozarabic Liturgy.—</hi> This was the national liturgy
                    of the Spanish Church till the close of the 11th century, when the Roman liturgy
                    was forced upon it. Its use, however, lingered on, till in the 16th century
                    Cardinal Ximenes, anxious to prevent its becoming quite obsolete, had its books
                    restored and printed, and founded a college of priests at Toledo to perpetuate
                    its use. It survives now only in that and one other church in Spain, and even
                    there not without certain Roman modifications of its original text and
                    ritual.</p>
                <p>Its date and origin, like the date and origin of all existing liturgies, are
                    uncertain, and enveloped in the mists of antiquity. It is evidently not derived
                    from the Roman liturgy. Its whole structure, and every separate detail, disprove
                    such a parentage, and therefore it is strange to find St Isidore of Seville <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lib. de Eccles. Offc.,</hi> i. 15) attributing it to St Peter. No
                    proof is adduced, and the only value which can be placed upon such an
                    unsupported assertion is that it shows that a very high and even apostolic
                    antiquity was claimed for it. A theory, originating with Pinius, that it may
                    have been brought by the Goths from Constantinople when they invaded Spain, is
                    as improbable as it is unproven. It may have been derived from Gaul. The
                    Gallican liturgy stood to it in the relation of twin-sister, if it could not
                    claim that of mother. The resemblance was so great that, when Charles the Bald
                    (843-877) wished to gain some idea of the character of the already obsolete
                    Gallican rite, he sent to Toledo for some Spanish priests to perform mass
                    according to the Mozarabic rite in his presence. But there is no record of the
                    conversion of Spain by Gallican missionaries. Christianity existed in Spain from
                    the earliest times. Probably St Paul travelled there (Rom. xv. 24-28). It may be
                    at least conjectured that its liturgy was Pauline rather than Petrine or
                    Johannine.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Gallican</hi><hi rend="italic">Liturgy.—</hi> This was the
                    ancient and national liturgy of France till the commencement of the 9th century,
                    when it was suppressed by order of Charlemagne, who directed the Roman missal to
                    be everywhere substituted in its place. All traces of it seemed for some time to
                    have been lost, until three Gallican sacramentaries were discovered and
                    published by Thomasius in 1680, under the titles of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Missale</hi><hi rend="italic">Gothicum,</hi><hi rend="italic">Missale</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gallicum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Missale Francorum,</hi> and a
                    fourth was discovered and published by Mabillon in 1687, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacramentarium Bobbiense.</hi> Fragmentary discoveries have been
                    made since then. Mone discovered fragments of eleven Gallican masses, and
                    published them at Carlsruhe in 1850. Other fragments from the library of St Gall
                    have been published by Bunsen <hi rend="italic">(Anal. Ante-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Nie.,</hi> iii. 263-66), and from the Ambrosian library at Milan
                    by Cardinal Mai <hi rend="italic">(Scrip. Vet. Vat. Coll.,</hi> iii. 2, 247).
                    More of this MS. is being prepared for publication by Dr Ceriani. A single page
                    was <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n731/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0731-0708"/> discovered in the library of Gonville and Caius
                    College, Cambridge, in 1867, which has not yet been published. These documents,
                    illustrated by early Gallican canons, and by allusions in the writings of
                    Sulpicius Severus, Caesarius of Arles, Gregory of Tours, Germanus of Paris, and
                    other authors, enable scholars to reconstruct the greater part of this liturgy.
                    The previously enumerated signs of Eastern origin and influence are found here
                    as well as in the Mozarabic liturgy, together with certain other more or less
                    minute peculiarities, which would be of interest to professed liturgiologists,
                    but which we must not pause to specify here. They point to the possibility of
                    the theory that the Gallican liturgy was introduced into use by Irenaeus, bishop
                    of Lyons (c. 130-200), who had learned it in the East from St Polycarp, the
                    disciple of the apostle St John.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Ambrosian Liturgy.—</hi> Considerable variety of opinion has
                    existed among liturgical writers as to the proper classification of the
                    “Ambrosian” or “Milanese” liturgy. If we are to accept it in its present form,
                    and to make the present position of the great intercession the test of its <hi
                    rend="italic">genus,</hi> then we must place it under Group V., the “Petrine,”
                    and consider it as a branch of the Roman family. If, on the other hand, we
                    consider the important variations from the Roman liturgy which yet exist, and
                    the still more marked and numerous traces of variation which confront us in the
                    older printed and MS. copies of the Ambrosian rite, we shall detect in it an
                    original member of the Ephesine group of liturgies, which for centuries past has
                    been undergoing a gradual but ever increasing assimilation to Rome. We know this
                    as a matter of history, as well as ⅝ matter of inference from changes in the
                    text itself. Charlemagne adopted the same policy towards the Milanese as towards
                    the Gallican Church. He carried off all the Milanese Church books which he could
                    obtain, with the view of substituting Roman books in their place, but the
                    completeness of his intentions failed, partly through the attachment of the
                    Lombards to their own rites, partly through the intercession of a Gallican
                    bishop named Eugenius (Mabillon, <hi rend="italic">Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ital.,</hi> i., ii. p. 106). It has been asserted by Joseph Vicecomes that this
                    is an originally independent liturgy drawn up by St Barnabas, who first preached
                    the gospel at Milan (De <hi rend="italic">Missae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Pit.,</hi> i. chap, xi., xii.), and this tradition is preserved in the title
                    and proper preface for St Barnabas Day in the Ambrosian missal (Pamelius, i.
                    385, 386).</p>
                <p>We can trace the following points in which the Milanese differs from the Roman
                    liturgy, many of them exhibiting distinct lines of Ephesine or Eastern
                    influence. Some of them are no longer found in recent Ambrosian missals, and
                    only survive in the earlier MSS. published by Pamelius <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Liturgicοn,</hi> tom. i. p. 293), Muratori <hi rend="italic">(Lit. Rom.
                    Vet.,</hi> i. 132), and Ceriani (in his edition, 1881, of an ancient MS. at

                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Celtic Liturgy.—</hi> We postpone the consideration of this
                    subject to a position under the heading of the liturgies of Great Britain and
                    Ireland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Group</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">St Peter, Italian,
                    Pome.—</hi> There is only one liturgy to be enumerated under this group, viz.,
                    the present liturgy of the Church of Rome, which, though originally local in
                    character and circumscribed in use, has come to be nearly coextensive with the
                    Roman Church, sometimes cuckoo-like ejecting earlier national liturgies, as in
                    France and Spain, sometimes incorporating more or less of the ancient ritual of
                    a country into itself, and producing from such incorporation a subclass of
                    distinct uses, as in England, France, and North Italy. Even these subordinate
                    uses have for the most part become, or are rapidly becoming, obsolete. The
                    genius and policy of Rome are in favour of uniformity; and it requires no keen
                    powers of vision to foretell that, liturgically speaking, she will be, before
                    long, within all her dominions supreme.</p>
                <p>The date, origin, and early history of the Roman liturgy are obscure. The first
                    Christians at Rome were a Greekspeaking community, and their liturgy must have
                    been Greek, and is possibly represented in the so-called Clementine liturgy. But
                    the date when such a state of things ceased, when and by whom the present Latin
                    liturgy was composed, whether it is an original composition, or, as its
                    structure seems to imply, a survival of some intermediate form of liturgy,—all
                    these are questions which are waiting for their solution, and to which no
                    certain answer can be given, unless and until some further discovery shall be
                    given of earlier liturgical remains.</p>
                <p>One MS. exists which claims to represent the Roman liturgy as it existed in the
                    time of Leo I., 440-61. It was discovered at Verona by Blanchini in 1735,
                    assigned by him to the 8th century, and published under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacramentarium Leonianum</hi>; but this title was from the first
                    purely conjectural, and is in the teeth of the internal evidence which the MS.
                    itself affords, and is now being gradually abandoned. It is impossible here to
                    enter into the minutiae of the evidence for this and other conclusions. The
                    question is discussed at some length by Muratori, <hi rend="italic">Lit. Pom.
                    Vet.,</hi> i. chap. 3.</p>
                <p>A MS. of the 9th or 10th century was found at Rome by Thomasius, and published by
                    him in 1680 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sacramentarium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gelasianum.</hi> But it was written in France, and is certainly
                    not a pure Gelasian codex; and, although there is historical evidence of that
                    pope (492-96) having made some changes in the Roman liturgy, and although other
                    MSS. have been published by Gerbertus and others, claiming the title of
                    Gelasian, we neither have nor are likely to have genuine and contemporary MS.
                    evidence of the real state of the liturgy in that pope’s time.</p>
                <p>The larger number of MSS. of this group are copies of the Gregorian sacramentary,
                    that is to say, MSS. representing, or purporting to represent, the state of the
                    Roman liturgy in the days of Gregory the Great (590-604). But they cannot be
                    accepted as certain evidence, for the following reasons :—not one of them was
                    written earlier than the 9th century; not one of them was written in Italy, but
                    every one north of the Alps; every one contains internal evidence of a
                    post-Gregorian date in the shape of masses for the repose or for the
                    intercession of St Gregory, and in various other ways.</p>
                <p>The Roman liturgy was introduced into England in the 7th, into France in the 9th,
                    and into Spain in the 11th century. In France certain features of the service
                    and certain points in the ritual of the ancient national liturgy became
                    interwoven with its text, and formed those many varying mediaeval Gallican uses,
                    which are associated with the names of the different French sees.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing characteristics of the Petrine liturgy are these :—(a) the
                    position of the great intercession within the canon, <pb break="no"

                    before, and the commemoration of the departed just after, the words of

                    Invocation of the Holy Spirit; (c) the position of the Pax or “Kiss of Peace”
                    after the consecration and just before the communion, whereas in other liturgies
                    it occurs at a much earlier point in the service.</p>

                    >Period</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">The Celtic Church.—</hi> Until recently almost
                    nothing was known of the character of the liturgical service of the vast Celtic
                    Church which existed in these islands before the Anglo-Saxon conquest, and which
                    continued to exist in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and Cornwall for very
                    considerable though varying periods of time after that event. But recently a
                    good deal of light has been thrown on the subject, partly by the publication of
                    the few genuine works of SS. Patrick, Columba, Columbanus, and other Celtic
                    saints; partly by the discovery of liturgical remains in the Scottish <hi
                    rend="italic">Book of Deer,</hi> and in the Irish <hi rend="italic">Books of
                    Dimma and Mulling</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Stowe Missal</hi>; partly by
                    the publication of mediaeval Irish compilations such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leabhar Breac, Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Hymnorum,</hi> &amp;c., which
                    contain ecclesiastical calendars, legends, treatises, &amp;c., of considerable
                    but very varying antiquity. The evidence collected from these sources is
                    sufficient to prove that the liturgy of the Celtic Church was of the Ephesine
                    type. In central England the churches, together with their books and everything
                    else belonging to them, were destroyed by heathen invaders from Jutland,
                    Schleswig, and Holstein at the close of the 5th century; but the Celtic Church
                    in the remoter parts of England, as well as in the neighbouring kingdoms of
                    Scotland and Ireland, retained its liturgical independence for many centuries
                    afterward.</p>
                <p>An examination of its few extant service books and fragments of service books
                    yields the following evidence of the Ephesine origin and character of the Celtic
                    liturgy :—(a) The presence of whole collects and anthems which occur in the
                    Gallican and Mozarabic but not in the Roman liturgy; (ό) various forniulae of
                    thanksgiving after communion; (c) frequent addresses to the people in the form
                    of Gallican <hi rend="italic">Praefationes</hi>; (c?) the Gallican form of
                    consecration prayer, being a variable Post-Sanctus leading up to the words of
                    institution; (e) the complicated rite of fraction as described in an Irish tract
                    at the end of the Stowe missal finds its only counterpart in the elaborate
                    ceremonial of the Mozarabic Church; <hi rend="italic">{f)</hi> the presence of
                    the Gallican ceremonial of <hi rend="italic">Pedilavium</hi> or “Washing of
                    Feet” in the earliest Irish baptismal office. For a further description of these
                    and of other features which seem to be peculiar to the Celtic liturgy the reader
                    is referred to Warren’s <hi rend="italic">Liturgy and Ritual of the Celtic
                    Church,</hi> 1881.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Period</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">The Anglo-Saxon
                    Church.—</hi> We find ourselves here on firmer ground, and can speak with
                    certainty as to the nature of the liturgy of the English Church after the
                    beginning of the 7th century. Information is drawn from the liturgical allusions
                    in the extant canons of numerous councils, from the voluminous writings of Bede,
                    Alcuin, and many other ecclesiastical authors of the Anglo-Saxon period, and
                    above all from a very considerable number of service books written in England
                    before the Norman Conquest. Three of these books are manuscript missals of more
                    or less completeness, and, as none of them have yet been published, their names
                    are appended: — (1) the Leofric missal, a composite 10th to 11th century MS.,
                    presented to the cathedral of Exeter by Leofric, the first bishop of that see
                    (104G-1072), now in the Bodleian Library at Oxford; (2) the missal of Robert of
                    Jumièges, archbishop of Canterbury (1051-52), executed probably at Winchester,
                    and presented by Archbishop Robert to his old monastery of Jumièges in the
                    neighbourhood of Rouen, in the public library of which town it now lies; (3) the
                    Red Book of Derby, an incomplete missal of the second half of the 11th century,
                    now in the library of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge.</p>
                <p>A perusal of these volumes proves, what we should have expected <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori,</hi> that the Roman liturgy was in use in the Anglo-Saxon Church.
                    This was, no doubt, the case from the very first. That church owed its
                    foundation to the forethought of a Roman pontiff, and the energy of a band of
                    missionaries, headed by St Augustine, who came directly from Rome, and who
                    brought, as we are expressly assured by Bede, their liturgical codices with them
                    from their native country <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Ec.,</hi> ii. 28).
                    Accordingly, when we speak of an Anglo-Saxon missal, we mean a Roman missal only
                    exhibiting one or more of the following features which differentiate it from an
                    Italian missal of the same century.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> Rubrics, and other entries of a miscellaneous
                    character, written in the vernacular language of the country; (δ) the
                    commemoration of national or local saints in the calendar, in the canon of the
                    mass, and in the litanies which occur on Easter eve, and in the baptismal
                    offices; (c) the presence of a few special masses in honour of these national
                    saints, together with a certain number of collects of a necessarily local
                    character, for the rulers of the country, for its natural produce, &amp;c.; (d)
                    the addition of certain peculiarities of liturgical structure and arrangement
                    interpolated into the purely Roman service from an extraneous source. There are
                    two noteworthy examples of this in Anglo-Saxon service books. Every Sunday and
                    festival, and almost every votive mass, has its proper preface, although the
                    number of such prefaces in the Gregorian sacramentary of the same period had
                    been reduced to eight. There were a large but not quite an equal number of
                    triple episcopal benedictions to be pronounced by the bishop after the Lord’s
                    Prayer and before the communion. This custom must either have been perpetuated
                    from the old Celtic liturgy, or directly derived from a Gallican source.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Period</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Anglo-Horman
                    Church.—</hi> The influx of numerous foreigners, especially from Normandy and
                    Lorraine, which preceded, accompanied, and followed the Conquest, and the
                    occupation by them of the highest posts in church as well as state, had a
                    distinct effect on the liturgy of the English Church. These foreign
                    ecclesiastics brought over with them a preference for and a habit of using
                    certain features of the Gallican liturgy and ritual, which they succeeded in
                    incorporating into the service books of the Church of England. One of these
                    prelates named Osmund, a Norman count, earl of Dorset, chancellor of England,
                    and bishop of Salisbury, 1078-99, undertook the revision of the English service
                    books, and the missal which he produced in 1085, which we know as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sarum Missal,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Missal according to
                    the Use of Sarum,</hi> practically became the liturgy of the English Church. It
                    was not only received in the province of Canterbury, but was largely adopted
                    beyond those limits—in Ireland in the 12th, and in various Scottish dioceses in
                    the 12th and 13th centuries.</p>
                <p>It would be outside the scope of a general article like the present to tabulate
                    the numerous and frequently minute differences between a mediaeval Sarum and the
                    earlier Anglo-Saxon or contemporaneous Roman liturgy. They lie mainly in
                    differences of collects and lections, variations of ritual on Candlemas, Ash
                    Wednesday, and throughout Holy Week, the introduction into the canon of the mass
                    of certain clauses and usages of Ephesine character or origin, the wording of
                    rubrics in the subjunctive or imperative tense, the peculiar “Preces in
                    Prostratione,” the procession of Corpus Christi on Palm Sunday, the forms of
                    ejection and reconciliation of penitents, &amp;c. The varying episcopal
                    benedictions as used in the Anglo-Saxon Church were retained, but the numerous
                    proper prefaces were discarded, the number being reduced to ten.</p>
                <p>Besides the famous and far-spreading use of Sarum, other uses, more local and
                    less known, grew up in various English dioceses. In virtue of a recognized
                    diocesan independence, bishops were able to regulate or alter their ritual, and
                    to add special masses or commemorations for use within the limits of their
                    jurisdiction. The better known and the more distinctive of these uses were those
                    of York and Hereford, but we also find traces of, or allusions to, the uses of
                    Bangor, Lichfield, Lincoln, Ripon, St Asaph, St Paul’s, Wells, and
                    Winchester.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Other Service Books.—</hi> The Eucharistic service was

                    The <hi rend="italic">Gradual</hi> contained the introit, gradual, sequences,
                    and the other portions of the communion service which at high mass were sung by
                    the choir. (8) The <hi rend="italic">Legenda</hi> contained the lections read at
                    matins and at other times, and may be taken as a generic term to include the <hi
                    rend="italic">Homiliarium, Martyrology, Passional,</hi> and other volumes. (9)
                    The <hi rend="italic">Manual</hi> was the term usually employed in England to
                    denote the <hi rend="italic">Rituale.</hi> (10) The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pontifical</hi> contained the order of ordination, consecration, and such other
                    rites as could, ordinarily, only be performed by the bishop. (11) The <hi
                    rend="italic">Rituale</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ritual</hi> comprised the
                    occasional offices for baptism, marriage, burial, and those other offices which
                    it ordinarily fell to the lot of the parish priest to execute. To these we must
                    add a book which was not strictly a church office book, but a handy book for the
                    use of the laity, and which was in very popular use, and often very highly
                    embellished in the 14th to 16th century, the <hi rend="italic">Book of the
                    Hours,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Horae Beatae Mariae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Virginis.</hi> It contained portions of the canonical hours, litanies, the
                    penitential psalms, and other devotions of a miscellaneous and private
                    character.</p>
                <p>The Eastern Church, too, possessed and still possesses numerous and voluminous
                    office books, of which the chief are the following:— The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euchologion,</hi> containing the liturgy itself with the remaining sacramental
                    offices bound up in the same volume; the <hi rend="italic">Horologion,</hi>
                    containing the unvarying portion of the Breviary, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mensea</hi> being equivalent to a complete Breviary; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Menologion,</hi> or martyrology; the <hi rend="italic">Octoechus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Paracletice,</hi> containing Troparia, and answering to the
                    Western Antiphonary; the <hi rend="italic">Pentecostarion,</hi> containing the
                    services from Easter Day to All Saints’ Sunday, as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Triodion</hi> contained those from Septuagesima Sunday to Easter eve. · The <hi

                    The liturgy of the English Church passed through a more marked phase of change
                    in the 16th century than during any of those periods which we have briefly
                    described. The desire for some reform, and the sense of its necessity, which had
                    been manifesting itself in various ways for more than a century and a half,
                    culminated in the reign of Edward VI., and caused the appearance, with the full
                    sanction of church and state, of the First Prayer Book of Edward VI. which was
                    published on March 7, 1549, and came into general use on the feast of
                    Whitsunday, June 9, 1549. Without attempting to enumerate particular points, we
                    will summarize the general features which marked this change, and will exhibit
                    the gains of such a reform, which, from an Anglican point of view, constitute
                    its complete justification.</p>
                <p>(a) Simplification in the number and character of books required for divine
                    service. The Prayer Book is a compendium of most of the volumes which have been
                    recently named and described. Its matins and evensong are a compilation from the
                    Breviary; the office of Holy Communion, with the collects, epistles, and
                    gospels, is a translation and adaptation of the missal; the occasional offices
                    represent the ritual or manual, and the offices of confirmation and of
                    ordination are taken, with modifications, from the pontifical.</p>
                <p>(δ) The removal from the service of a vast quantity of legendary matter which was
                    read in the form of lections, and which was objectionable partly because it was
                    unhistorical, partly because it was ludicrous and almost profane. As an instance
                    of unhistorical matter, we quote a passage from the fourth lection for the
                    festival of St Silvester, December 31, bishop of Rome, 314-335</p>
                <p>“In which office of the priesthood he (Silvester) distinguished himself above the
                    rest of the clergy,-and afterwards succeeded Melchiades on the papal throne in
                    the reign of Constantine. That emperor suffered from leprosy, and, in order to
                    cure himself, by the advice of his physicians he ordered a bath to be prepared
                    of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> ∏fants blood. But the holy apostles Peter and
                    Paul appeared to him in private, ana toιa him that, if he wished to be free from
                    his leprosy, he should abandon the mad plan of an impious bath, and send for
                    Silvester dwelling in seclusion at Mount Soracte, that by him the emperor should
                    be refreshed in the bath of salva- ⅛"' f <hi rend="superscript"> h0</hi> κs <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ld</hi> ° <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"

                    "&gt;ples to be built in every province of the Roman empire after the fashion of
                    the Christians, and that he should do away with the images of vain deities, and
                    institute the worship of the true God. Constantine, therefore, in obedience to
                    the divine warnings, made diligent search for and summoned Silvester, by <hi
                    rend="italic">whom,</hi> recognιzmg the description of the apostles, he was
                    baptized, and incited to defend and extend the Christian religion.”</p>
                <p>This lection retains its position in the present Roman Breviary, although its
                    unhistorical character can be abundantly proved and is generally acknowledged.
                    The Breviary in fact is still, and was even more so then, full of legends which
                    once passed for but have long since been abandoned as history.</p>
                <p>As examples of the ludicrous we quote the first lection for the festival of St
                    Foelanus from the Aberdeen Breviary of 1509, fol. xxvi., and the eighth lection
                    for the festival of St Serf from the same Breviary (July 2, fol. xvi.):—</p>
                <p>“He (Foelanus) was born, as it was foretold of him, with a stone in his mouth, on
                    account of which he was so despised by his father that he was ordered
                    immediately after his birth to be thrown into a neighbouring pond and drowned.
                    In this pond he was miraculously nourished by angels for a whole year. But after
                    the lapse of a year he was found by Bishop Ibarus, to whom a divine revelation
                    of the fact had been given, playing among the angels. He was taken out of the
                    pond safe and sound, was baptized, and afterwards became distinguished in sacred
                    literature."</p>
                <p>“A certain robber carried off one day a sheep which used to live and feed in the
                    house of St Serf, and killed it and ate it. Diligent inquiry was made for the
                    thief but without success. At length suspicion fell on the robber, and he
                    hastened into St Serf’s presence, prepared to deny the accusation with an oath.
                    He swore a big oath that he was innocent of the charge laid against him, when,
                    wonderful to relate (a fact which would not be believed on merely human
                    testimony), the sheep which had lately been eaten began to baa in the stomach of
                    the robber, whereupon in confusion the man fell prostrate to the ground, and
                    humbly asked for pardon, and the saint prayed for him.”</p>
                <p>There was also a quantity of objectionable matter introduced by a process of
                    adaptation, or sometimes, as it was technically termed, by a process of farsing,
                    into the older prayers. The Gloria in Excelsis in the Sarum Missal is printed
                    thus (Burntisland edit., 1861, p. 586)—the farsed words are represented by
                    italics :—</p>
                <p>“Qui tollis peccata mundi, suscipe deprecationem nostram, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Mariae</hi><hi rend="italic">gloriam.</hi> Qui sedes

                    >Mariam sanctificans.</hi> Tu solus Dominus, <hi rend="italic">Mariam</hi>

                    Christe, cum Sancto Spiritu in gloria Dei Patris. Amen.”</p>
                <p>(c) For the first time, so far as can be ascertained, in the history of the
                    English Church, the vernacular tongue was employed.</p>
                <p>(d) The numerous litanies to and invocations of the saints, especially of the
                    Virgin Mary, were expunged.</p>
                <p>(e) There was a very great extension of the portion of Holy Scripture read in
                    divine service, partly by the excision of non-Scriptural matter, partly by the
                    lengthening of lessons which sometimes consisted only of one or two verses, so
                    “that many times there was more business to find out what should be read than to
                    read it when it was found out.”</p>
                <p>(∕) There was a general simplification of the services, by the reduction of the
                    number of saints’ days, by the cutting away of anthems, invitatories, and
                    responds, by the compression of the seven canonical hours into the two daily
                    services of matins and evensong, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>(g) The various offices for the dead were abolished, and numerous prayers which
                    involved a belief in the mediaeval idea of the penal flames of purgatory made
                    way for the present burial office and the commemoration of the departed in the
                    Eucharistic service.</p>
                <p>The first reformed Prayer Book of 1549 remained in use till 1552, when by Act of
                    Uniformity passed on April 6 it was ordered that a further reformed Prayer Book
                    should come into general use on the feast of All Saints (November 1) following.
                    This second Prayer Book, commonly spoken of as the Second Prayer Book of King
                    Edward the VI., marks the furthest point in the Puritan direction which was ever
                    reached by the liturgy of the Church of England. An idea of its character may be
                    gained by mentioning some of the features retained in the first and discarded in
                    the Second Prayer Book, and some of the features added in the Second but absent
                    from the First Prayer Book.</p>
                <p>In the former class are—(a) the sign of the cross used in consecration,
                    confirmation, marriage, and visitation of the sick; (δ) the use of exorcism,
                    chrisom, and chrism in baptism; (c) unction of the sick; <hi rend="italic"
                    >{d)</hi> certain prayers for the dead, and a special Eucharist for funerals;
                    (e) the mention of vestments with albs and tunics for Eucharistic use, and of
                    the pastoral staff and cope for bishops; (∕) the ceremonies of crossing and
                    knocking on the breast left optional; (g) the invocation of the Holy Ghost
                    before consecration; (Ä) the mixed chalice; (i) directions to communicants to
                    receive the consecrated bread in their mouths, and for reservation for the sick.
                    In the latter class are—(a) the addition of the Scriptural sentences,
                    exhortation, confession, and absolution before morning and evening prayer; (δ)
                    the addition of the Jubilate, Cantate, and Deus Misereatur as alternative
                    canticles; (c) the words “commonly called the mass” omitted from the title of
                    Holy Communion; <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi> the words “militant here on earth”
                    added to the title of the prayer for the whole state of Christ’s Church; (e) the
                    decalogue introduced at the commencement of the communion service; <hi
                    rend="italic">(f)</hi> the second clause in the formula of sacramental
                    distribution was substituted for the first, the two being subsequently combined
                    in 1559. These are merely samples out of many more points which might be
                    named.</p>

                <p>It has not been ascertained that this Prayer Book ever received the sanction of
                    Convocation, and it probably never came into complete use. Such use was in any
                    case short-lived, for Edward VI. died on July 6, 1553, and the English Prayer
                    Book was abolished and the Latin missal restored to use by one of the first Acts
                    of Queen Mary, in October 1553. Queen Mary died on November 17, 1558, and
                    another complete change of policy took place. The reformed Prayer Book was
                    brought into use again on June 24, 1559, not in the exact shape which it bore in
                    1552, but with various modifications, which we forbear to enumerate in detail.
                    It may be said of them, as of the various alterations introduced subsequently
                    into the Prayer Book, that their general tendency was conservative rather than
                    destructive, and in a Catholic rather than in a Protestant direction. The next
                    important revisions of the Prayer Book took place in 1604, under James I., after
                    the Hampton Court Conference, and in 1661-62, after the restoration of Charles
                    II. The Book of Common Prayer had been abolished under the Commonwealth, and it
                    could only be used under the risk of heavy penalties from 1645 to 1661. It was
                    now restored with a considerable number of additions and alterations, after
                    having been discussed without any satisfactory result between churchmen and
                    Puritans at the Savoy conference in 1661. When these had received the sanction
                    of the Convocations of Canterbury and York, it was attached to an Act of
                    Uniformity which received the royal assent on May 19, 1662, by the provisions of
                    which Act it came into general use on St Bartholomew’s Day, August 24, 1662.
                    Since that date, although various slight changes have been made in recent years,
                    nothing has been done amounting to a revision or new edition of the Prayer Book,
                    or demanding notice in these columns.</p>
                <p>A few words are added about other national versions of the reformed liturgy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Liturgy of the Scottish Episcopal Church.—</hi> This
                    liturgy in nearly its present form was compiled by Scottish bishops in 1636, and
                    imposed, or, to speak more accurately, attempted to be imposed upon the Scottish
                    people by the royal authority of Charles I. in 1637. The prelates chiefly
                    concerned in it were Spottiswood, bishop of Glasgow; Maxwell, bishop of Ross;
                    Wedderburn, bishop of Dunblane; and Forbes, bishop of Edinburgh. Their work was
                    approved and revised by certain members of the English episcopate, especially
                    Laud, archbishop of Canterbury; Juxon, bishop of London; and Wren, bishop of
                    Norwich. This liturgy has met with varied fortune, and passed through several
                    editions. It is now used as an alternative form with the English communion
                    office in the Scottish Episcopal Church.</p>
                <p>Among its more noteworthy features are—(a) the retention in its integrity and in
                    its primitive position after the words of institution, of the invocation of the
                    Holy Spirit j<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The

                    word and Holy Spirit these and Thy gifts and creatures of Bread and Wine, that
                    they may become the Body and Blood of Thy most dearly-beloved Son.” This

                    or two, instead of three or four. The general arrangement of the parts
                    approximates more closely to the First Prayer Book of Edward VI. than to the

                    of Common Prayer, but among the more important variations we may name the

                    resembles that of the Scottish than of the Anglican liturgy, especially in the
                    position of the oblation and invocation immediately after the words of
                    institution; (δ) the Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis, and Athanasian creed are
                    disused; (c) ten selections of psalms are appointed to be used as alternatives
                    for the psalms of the day. In addition to these there are various verbal and
                    other unimportant alterations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Irish Prayer Book.—</hi> The Prayer Book in use in the
                    Irish portion of the United Church of England and Ireland was the Anglican Book
                    of Common Prayer, but after the disestablishment of the Irish Church several
                    changes were introduced into it by a synod held in Dublin in 1870. These changes
                    included (a) the excision of all lessons from the Apocrypha, (5) of the rubric
                    ordering the recitation of the Athanasian creed, (c) of the rubric ordering the
                    vestments of the second year of Edward VI., (&lt;Z) of the form of absolution in
                    the office for the visitation of the sick, (e) the addition of one question and
                    answer in the Church Catechism, bringing out more clearly the spiritual
                    character of the real presence.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Presbyterian Church.—</hi> The Presbyterian churches of
                    Scotland at present possess no liturgy properly so called. Certain general rules
                    for the conduct of divine service are contained in the “Directory for the Public
                    Worship of God,” agreed upon by the Assembly of Divines at Westminster, with the
                    assistance of commissioners from the Church of Scotland, approved and
                    established by an Act of the General Assembly, and by an Act of Parliament, both
                    in 1645. In 1554 John Knox had drawn up an order of liturgy, closely modelled on
                    the Genevan pattern, for the use of the English congregation to which he was
                    then ministering at Frankfort. On his return to Scotland this form of liturgy
                    was adopted by an Act of the General Assembly in 1560, and became the
                    established form of worship in the Presbyterian Church, until the year 1645,
                    when the Directory of Public Worship took its place. Herein regulations are laid
                    down for the conduct of public worship, for the reading of Scripture, and for
                    extempore prayer before and after the sermon and in the administration of the
                    sacraments of baptism and the Lord’s supper, for the solemnization of marriage,
                    visitation of the sick, and burial of the dead, for the observance of days of
                    public fasting and public thanksgiving, together with a form of ordination, and
                    a directory for family worship. In all these cases, although the general tenor
                    of the prayer is frequently indicated, the wording of it is left to the
                    discretion of the minister, with these exceptions :—at the act of baptism this
                    formula must be used—“I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
                    and of the Holy Ghost;” and for the Lord’s Supper these forms are suggested, but
                    with liberty to the minister to use “other the like, used by Christ or his
                    apostle upon this occasion: ”—</p>
                <p>“According to the holy institution, command, and example of our blessed Saviour
                    Jesus Christ, I take this bread, and, having given thanks, break it, and give it
                    unto you. Take ye, eat ye; this is the body of Christ which is broken for you;
                    do this in remembrance of him.” And again; “According to the institution,
                    command, and example of our Lord Jesus Christ, I take this cup and give it unto
                    you; this cup is the New Testament in the blood of Christ, which is shed for the
                    remission of the sins of many; drink ye all of it.”</p>
                <p>There is also an unvarying form of words directed to be used before the minister
                    by the man to the woman and by the woman to the man in the case of the
                    solemnization of matrimony. The form of words on all other occasions, including
                    ordination, is left to the discretion of the officiating minister, or of the
                    presbytery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Continental Protestant Churches. The Calvinistic
                    Churches.—</hi> Rather more of the liturgical element, in the shape of a set

                    German Calvinistic Protestants. The Sunday morning service, as drawn up by
                    Calvin, was to open with a portion of Holy Scripture and the recitation of the
                    Ten Commandments. Afterwards the minister, inviting the people to accompany him,
                    proceeded to a confession of sins and supplication for grace. Then one of the
                    Psalms of David was sung. Then came the sermon, prefaced by an extempore prayer
                    and concluding with the Lord’s Prayer, creed, and benediction. The communion
                    service began with an exhortation leading up to the apostles’ creed; then
                    followed a long exhortation, after which the bread and cup were distributed to
                    the people, who advanced in reverence and order, while a Psalm was being sung or
                    a suitable passage of Scripture was being read. After all had communicated a set
                    form of thanksgiving was said by the minister. Then the hymn of Simeon was sung
                    by the congregation, who were then dismissed with the blessing. This form of
                    service has been modified in various ways from time to time, but it remains
                    substantially the type of service in use among the Reformed Churches of Germany,
                    Switzerland, and France.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Lutheran Church.—</hi> Luther was far more conservative
                    than the rest of the Protestant Reformers, and his conservatism appeared nowhere
                    more than in the service books which he drew up for the use of the church which
                    bears his name. In 1523 he published a treatise <hi rend="italic">Of the Order
                    of the Service in the Congregation,</hi> and in 1526 he published the <hi
                    rend="italic">German Mass.</hi> Except that the vernacular was substituted for
                    the Latin language, the old framework and order of the Roman missal were closely
                    followed, beginning with the Confiteor, Introit, Kyrie Eleison, Gloria in
                    Excelsis, &amp;c. The text of this and other Lutheran services is given in <hi
                    rend="italic">Agende</hi><hi rend="italic">für christliche Gemeinden des
                    hitherischen Bekenntnisses,</hi> Nördlingen, 1853. At the same time Luther was
                    tolerant, and expressed a hope that different portions of the Lutheran Church
                    would from time to time make such changes or adaptations in the order of service
                    as might be found convenient. The Lutheran Churches of northern Europe have not
                    been slow to avail themselves of this advice and permission. Most of them have
                    drawn up liturgies for themselves, sometimes following very closely, sometimes
                    differing considerably from the original service composed by Luther himself. In
                    1822, on the union of the Lutheran and Reformed (Calvinistic) Churches of
                    Prussia, a new liturgy was published at Berlin. It is used in its entirety in
                    the chapel royal, but great liberty as to its use was allowed to the parochial
                    clergy, and considerable variations of text appear in the more recent editions
                    of this service book.</p>
                <p>The Swedenborgians, Irvingites, and other Protestant bodies have drawn up
                    liturgies for themselves, but they are hardly of sufficient historical
                    importance to be described at length here.</p>
                <p>The Old Catholics, lastly, published a <hi rend="italic">Rituale</hi> in 1875
                    containing the occasional offices for baptism, matrimony, burial, &amp;c., and a
                    form for reception of holy communion, in the German language. The latter is for
                    temporary use in anticipation of a revised and not yet published missal,
                    corresponding to the order of communion in English published March 8, 1548, in
                    anticipation of the complete office in the Prayer Book of 1549. (F. E. W.)</p>
