                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0687-0664"/> one of the most extensive and widely disseminated
                    of the domestic industries of European countries. The preparation and spinning
                    of yarn gave occupation to women of all classes; and the operations of weaving
                    employed large numbers of both sexes. The industry was most largely developed in
                    Russia, Austria, Germany, Holland, Belgium, the northern provinces of France,
                    and certain parts of England, in the north of Ireland, and throughout Scotland;
                    and in these countries its importance was generally recognized by the enactment
                    of special laws, having for their object the protection and extension of the
                    trade. The inventions of Arkwright, Hargreaves, and Crompton in the later part
                    of the 18th century, benefiting as they did, almost exclusively, the art of
                    cotton spinning, and the unparalleled development of that branch of textile
                    manufactures, largely due to the ingenuity of these inventors, gave the linen
                    trade as it then existed a fatal blow. Domestic spinning, and with it hand-loom
                    weaving, immediately began to shrink; a large and most respectable section of
                    the operative classes in western Europe found their employment dwindling away,
                    and the wages they earned from their diminished labour insufficient to ward off
                    starvation. The trade which had supported whole villages and provinces entirely
                    disappeared, and the linen manufacture, in attenuated dimensions and changed
                    conditions, took refuge in special localities, where it resisted, not
                    unsuccessfully, the further assaults of cotton, and, with varying fortunes,
                    rearranged its relations in the community of textile industries. The linen
                    industries of the United Kingdom were the first to suffer from the aggression of
                    cotton; more slowly the influence of the rival textile travelled across
                    Continental countries; and even to the present day, in Russia, and in other
                    regions remote from great commercial highways, the domestic manufacture of
                    linens holds its place almost as it has done from the earliest period. In 1810
                    Napoleon I., with a view partly to promote Continental linen industries, and
                    partly to strike a blow at the great British manufacture of cotton, issued a
                    proclamation offering a reward of one million francs to any inventor who should
                    devise the best machinery for the spinning of flax yarn. Within a few weeks
                    thereafter Philippe de Girard patented in France important inventions for flax
                    spinning by both dry and wet methods. His inventions, however, did not receive
                    the promised reward, and were indeed neglected in his native country. In 1815 he
                    was invited by the Austrian Government to establish a spinning mill at
                    Hirtenberg near Vienna, which was run with his machinery for a number of years,
                    but ultimately it failed to prove a commercial success. In the meantime,
                    however, English inventors, stimulated rather than daunted by the success of
                    cotton machinery, had applied themselves to the task of adapting machines to the
                    preparation and spinning of flax. The foundation of machine spinning of flax was
                    laid by John Kendrew and Thomas Porthouse of Darlington, who, in 1787, secured a
                    patent for “a mill or machine upon new principles for spinning yarn from hemp,
                    tow, flax, or wool.” These machines, imperfect as they were, attracted much
                    notice, and were introduced in various localities both in England and Scotland
                    into mills fitted specially for flax spinning. By innumerable successive
                    improvements and modifications, the invention of Kendrew and Porthouse developed
                    into the perfect system of machinery with which, at the present day,
                    spinning-mills are furnished; but progress in adapting flax fibres for
                    mechanical spinning, and linen yarn for weaving cloth by power-loom, was much
                    slower than in the corresponding case of cotton.</p>
                <p>The implements usedin the preparation of linen yarn in ancient and modern times,
                    down to the end of the 18th century, were of the most primitive and inexpensive
                    description. Till comparatively recent times, the sole spinning implements were
                    the spindle and distaff. The spindle, which is the fundamental apparatus in all
                    spinning machinery, was nothing more nor less than a round stick or rod of wood
                    about 12 inches in length, tapering towards each extremity, and having at its
                    upper end a notch or slit into which the yarn might be caught or fixed. In
                    general, a ring or “whorl” of stone or clay was passed round the upper part of
                    the spindle to give it momentum and steadiness when in rotation. The distaff, or
                    rock, was a rather longer and stronger bar or stick, around one end of which, in
                    a loose coil or ball, the fibrous material to be spun was wound. The other
                    extremity of the distaff was carried under the left arm, or fixed in the girdle
                    at the left side, so as to have the coil of flax in a convenient position for
                    drawing out to yarn. A prepared end of yarn being fixed into the notch, the
                    spinster, by a smart rolling motion of the spindle with the right hand against
                    the right leg, threw it out from her, spinning in the air, while, with the left
                    hand, she drew from the rock an additional supply of fibre which was formed into
                    a uniform and equal strand with the right. The yarn being sufficiently twisted
                    was released from the notch, wound around the lower part of the spindle, and
                    again fixed in the notch at the point insufficiently twisted; and so the
                    rotating, twisting, and drawing out operations went on till the spindle was
                    full. So persistent is an ancient and primitive art of this description that to
                    the present day, in remote districts of Scotland,—the country where machine
                    spinning has attained its highest development,—spinning with rock and spindle is
                    yet practised;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dr
                    Arthur Mitchell’s <hi rend="italic">The Past in the Present,</hi> Edinburgh,
                    1880.</p></note> and, rude as these implements are, yarn of extraordinary
                    delicacy, beauty, and tenacity has been spun by their agency. The first
                    improvement on the primitive spindle was found in the construction of the
                    hand-wheel, in which the spindle, mounted in a frame, was fixed horizontally,
                    and rotated by a band passing round it and a large wheel, set in the same
                    framework. Such a wheel became known in Europe about the middle of the 16th
                    century, but it appears to have been in use for cotton spinning in the East from
                    time immemorial. At a later date, which cannot be fixed, the treadle motion was
                    attached to the spinning wheel, enabling the spinster to sit at work with both
                    hands free; and the introduction of the two-handed or double-spindle wheel, with
                    flyers or twisting arms on the spindles, completed the series of mechanical
                    improvements effected on flax spinning till the end of the 18th century. The
                    common use of the two-handed wheel throughout the rural districts of Ireland and
                    Scotland is a matter still within the recollection of middle-aged people; but
                    spinning wheels are now seldom seen.</p>
                <p>The modern manufacture of linen divides itself into two branches, spinning and
                    weaving, to which may be added the bleaching and various finishing processes,
                    which, in the case of many linen textures, are laborious undertakings and
                    important branches of industry.</p>
                <p>Flax, when received into the mills, has to undergo a train of preparatory
                    operations before it arrives at the stage of being twisted into yarn. The whole
                    operations in yarn manufacture comprise (1) heckling, (2) preparing, and (3)
                    spinning.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Heckling.—</hi> This first preparatory process consists not
                    only in combing out, disentangling, and laying smooth and parallel the separate
                    fibres, but also serves to split up and separate into their ultimate filaments
                    the strands of fibre which, up to this point, have been agglutinated together.
                    The heckling process was, until recent times, done by the hand; and it was one
                    of fundamental importance, requiring the exercise of much dexterity and
                    judgment. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n688/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0688-0665"/> broken, ravelled, and short fibres, which
                    separate out in the heckling process, form tow, an article of much inferior
                    value to the spinner; and the proportion of tow made in the process of
                    hand-heckling varies according to the skill and knowledge of the heckler. A good
                    deal of hand-heckling is still practised, especially in Irish and Continental
                    factories; and it has not been found practicable, in any case, to entirely
                    dispense with a rough preparation of the fibre by hand labour. In heckling by
                    hand, the heckler stakes a handful or “strick” of rough flax, winds the top end
                    around his hands, and then, spreading out the root end as broad and flat as
                    possible, by a swinging motion dashes the fibre into the teeth or needles of the
                    rougher or “ruffer” heckle. The rougher is a board plated with tin, and studded
                    with spikes or teeth of steel about 7 inches in length, which taper to a fine
                    sharp point. The heckler draws his strick several times through this tool,
                    working gradually up from the roots to near his hand, till in his judgment the
                    fibres at the root end are sufficiently combed out and smoothed. He then seizes
                    the root end and similarly treats the top end of the strick. The stricks, as
                    finished, are carefully piled up in a regular manner, keeping each handful
                    separate for convenience of future treatment. The same process is again repeated
                    on a similar tool, the teeth of which are 5 inches long, and much more closely
                    studded together; and for the finer counts of yarn a third and a fourth heckle
                    may be used, of still increasing fineness and closeness of teeth. In dealing
                    with certain varieties of the fibre, for fine spinning especially, the flax is,
                    after roughing, broken or cut into three lengths—the top, middle, and root ends.
                    Of these the middle cut is most valuable, being uniform in length, strength, and
                    quality. The root end is more woody and harsh, while the top, though fine in
                    quality, is uneven and variable in strength. From some flax of extra length it
                    is possible to take two short middle cuts; and, again, the fibre is occasionally
                    only broken into two cuts according to the judgment and requirement of the
                    manufacturer. Flax so prepared is known as “cut line” in contradistinction to
                    “long line” flax, which is the fibre unbroken. The subsequent treatment of line,
                    whether long or cut, does not present sufficient variation to require further
                    reference to these distinctions.</p>
                <p>In the case of heckling by machinery, the flax is first roughed and arranged in
                    stricks, as above described under hand heckling. Considerable variations are
                    presented in the construction of heckling machines, but the general principles
                    of those now most commonly adopted, such as the machines of Combe, of Horner, or
                    of Cotton, &amp;c., are identical. These are known as vertical sheet heckling
                    machines (fig. 1), their essential features being a set of endless leather bands
                    or sheets <hi rend="italic">f,</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi> revolving over a
                    pair of rollers <hi rend="italic">c, h</hi> in a vertical direction. These
                    sheets are crossed by iron bars, to which heckle stocks, furnished with teeth,
                    are screwed. The heckle stocks on each separate sheet are of one size and gauge,
                    but each successive sheet in the length of the machine is furnished with stocks
                    of increasing fineness, so that the heckling tool at the end where the flax is
                    entered is the coarsest, while that to which the fibre is last submitted has the
                    smallest and most closely set teeth. Thus the whole of the endless vertical
                    revolving sheet presents a continuous series of heckle teeth, and the machines
                    are furnished with a double set of such sheets revolving face to face, so close
                    together that the pins of one set of sheets intersect those on the opposite
                    stocks. Overhead, and exactly centred between these revolving sheets, is the
                    head or holder channel <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> from which the flax hangs down
                    while it is undergoing the heckling process on both sides. The flax is fastened
                    in a holder δ, consisting of two heavy flat plates of iron, between which it is
                    spread and tightly screwed up. The holder is 11 inches in length, and the holder
                    channel is fitted to contain a line of six, eight, or twelve such holders,
                    according to the number of separate bands of heckling stocks in the machine. The
                    head or holder channel has a falling and rising motion, by which it first
                    presents the ends and gradually more and more of the length of the fibre to the
                    heckle teeth, and, after dipping down the full length of the fibre exposed, it
                    slowly rises and lifts the flax clear of the heckle stocks. By a reciprocal
                    motion the whole of the holders are then moved forward one length; that at the
                    last and finest set of stocks is thrown out, and place is made for filling in an
                    additional holder at the beginning of the series. Thus with a six-tool heckle,
                    or set of stocks, each holder full of flax from beginning to end descends into
                    and rises from the heckle teeth six times in travelling from end to end of the
                    machine. The root ends being thus first heckled, the holders are shot back along
                    an inclined plane, the iron plates unclamped, the flax reversed, and the top
                    ends are then submitted to the same heckling operation. The tow made in the
                    heckling process is cleared from the heckle teeth, as they revolve, by doffers
                    <hi rend="italic">l, l,</hi> which in travelling upwards are, by passing over
                    special guide rollers e, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> projected out from the line
                    of the heckle teeth. The doffers themselves are cleared by fixed combs &lt;7,
                    <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the tow falling down is collected in troughs <hi
                    rend="italic">k, k</hi> on each side of the machine. Tow, which is a much less
                    valuable substance than dressed line, undergoes a somewhat different preparing
                    process, and is used only for the lower numbers of yarn.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preparing.—</hi> The various operations in this stage have for
                    their object the proper assortment of dressed line into qualities fit for
                    spinning the different counts or sizes of yarn for which it may be suitable, and
                    the drawing out of the fibres to a perfectly level and uniform continuous ribbon
                    or sliver, containing throughout an equal quantity of fibre in any given length.
                    From the heckling the now smooth, glossy, and clean stricks are taken to the
                    sorting room, where they are assorted into different qualities by the “line
                    sorter,” who judges by both eye and touch the quality and capabilities of the
                    fibre. So sorted, the material is passed to the spreading and drawing frames, a
                    series or system of machines all similar in construction and effect. The
                    essential features of the spreading frame are— (1) the feeding cloth or creeping
                    sheet, which delivers the flax to (2) a pair of “feed and jockey” rollers, which
                    pass it on (3) to the gill frame or fallers. The gill frame consists<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0689-0666"/> of a series of narrow heckle bars, with short
                    closely studded teeth, which travel between the feed rollers and the drawing or
                    “boss and pressing” rollers to be immediately attended to. They are, by an
                    endless screw arrangement, carried forward at the rate at which the flax is
                    delivered to them, and when they reach the end of their course they fall under,
                    and by a similar screw arrangement are brought back to the starting point; and
                    thus they form an endless moving level toothed platform for carrying away the
                    flax from the feed rollers. The drawing rollers grip the fibre as it leaves the
                    gill, and, as they revolve much more rapidly than the feeding rollers, the fibre
                    is drawn out through the gill teeth say to twenty or thirty times the length it
                    had on the feeding board, and is consequently reduced to a sliver or loose
                    ribbon of correspondingly greater tenuity. The sliver from the drawing frame is
                    delivered into a tin can which holds 1000 yards, and the machine automatically
                    rings a bell when that length is delivered. From the spreading frame the cans of
                    sliver pass to the drawing frames, where from four to twelve slivers combined
                    are passed through feed rollers over gills, and drawn out by drawing rollers to
                    the thickness of one. A third and fourth similar doubling and drawing may be
                    embraced in a preparing system, so that the number of doublings the flax
                    undergoes, before it arrives at the roving frame, may amount to from one
                    thousand to one hundred thousand, according to the quality of yarn in progress.
                    Thus, for example, the doublings on one preparing system maybe 6×12×12×12×8 =
                    82,944. The slivers delivered by the last drawing frame are taken to the roving
                    frame, where they are singly passed through feed rollers and over gills, and,
                    after drafting to sufficient tenuity, slightly twisted by flyers and wound on
                    bobbins, in which condition the material—termed “rove” or “rovings ”—is ready
                    for the spinning frame.</p>
                <p>The preparation of tow for spinning differs in essential features from the
                    processes above described. Tow from different sources, such as scutching tow,
                    heckle tow, &amp;c., differs considerably in quality and value, some being very
                    impure, filled with woody shives, &amp;c., while other kinds are comparatively
                    open and clean. A preliminary opening and cleaning is necessary for the dirty
                    much-matted tows, and in general thereafter they are passed through two carding
                    engines called respectively the breaker and the finisher cards till the slivers
                    from their processes are ready for the drawing and roving frames. In the case of
                    fine clean tows, on the other hand, passing through a single carding engine may
                    be sufficient. The processes which follow the carding do not differ materially
                    from those followed in the preparation of rove from line flax.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spinning.—</hi> The spinning operation, which follows the
                    roving, is done in two principal ways, called respectively dry spinning and wet
                    spinning, the first being used for the lower counts or heavier yarns, while the
                    second is exclusively adopted in the preparation of fine yarns up to the highest
                    counts manufactured. The spinning frame does not differ in principle from the
                    throstle spinning machine used in the cotton manufacture (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cotton,</hi> vol. vi. p. 495). The bobbins of flax rove are
                    arranged in rows on each side of the frame (the spinning frames being all
                    double) on pins in an inclined plane A (fig. 2). The rove passes downwards
                    through an eyelet or guide <hi rend="italic">I</hi> to a pair of nipping rollers
                    <hi rend="italic">p, p,</hi> between which and the final drawing rollers c, c,
                    placed in the case of dry spinning from 18 to 22 inches lower down, the fibre
                    receives its final draft while passing over and under cylinders <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> and guide-plate <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> and attains that degree of tenuity which the finished yarn
                    must possess. From the last rollers the now attenuated material, in passing to
                    the flyers <hi rend="italic">f</hi> receives the degree of twist which compacts
                    the fibres into the round hard cord which constitutes spun yarn; and from the
                    flyers it is wound on the more slowly rotating spool <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    within the flyer arms, centred on the spindle S. In wet spinning the general
                    sequence of operations is the same, but the rove, as unwound from its bobbin,
                    first passes through a trough of water heated to about 120° Fahr.; and,
                    moreover, the interval between the two pairs of rollers in which the drawing out
                    of the rove is accomplished is very much shorter. The influence of the hot water
                    on the flax fibre appears to be that it softens the gummy principle which binds
                    the separate cells together, and thereby allows the elementary cells to a
                    certain extent to be drawn out without breaking the continuity of the fibre; and
                    further it makes a finer, smoother, and more uniform strand than can be obtained
                    by dry spinning. The extent to which the original strick of flax as laid on the
                    feeding roller for (say) the production of a 50 lea yarn is, by doublings and
                    drawings, extended, when it reaches the spinning spindle, may be stated thus
                    :—35 times on spreading frame, 15 times on first drawing frame, 15 times on
                    second drawing frame, 14 times on third drawing frame, 15 times on roving frame,
                    and 10 times on spinning frame, in all 16,537,500 times its original length,
                    with 8 × 12 × 16 = 1536doublings on the three drawing frames. That is to say, 1
                    yard of heckled line fed into the spreading frame is spread out, mixed with
                    other fibres, to a length of about 9400 miles of yarn. In the case of fine
                    yarns, by the additional drawings given, the doublings and elongations are very
                    much greater.</p>
                <p>The next operation is reeling from the bobbins into hanks. By Act of Parliament,
                    throughout the United Kingdom the standard measure of flax yarn is the “lea,”
                    called also in Scotland the “cut” of 300 yards. The flax is wound or reeled on a
                    reel having a circumference of 90 inches (2∣ yards) making “a thread,” and one
                    hundred and twenty such threads form a lea. The grist or quality of all fine
                    yarns is estimated by the number of leas in a pound; thus “50 lea” indicates
                    that there are 50 leas or cuts of 3ΘO yards each in a pound of the yarn so
                    denominated. With the heavier yarns in Scotland the quality is indicated by
                    their weight per “spindle” of 48 cuts or leas; thus “3 ⅛ tow yam” is such as
                    weighs 3 lb per spindlβj equivalent to “16 lea.”</p>
                <p>The hanks of yam from wet spinning are either dried in a loft with artificial
                    heat, or, in rural localities, exposed over ropes in the open air. When dry they
                    are twisted back and forward to take the wiry feeling out of the yarn, and made
                    up in bundles for the market as “grey yam.” English and Irish spinners make up
                    their yams into “bundles” of 20 hanks, each hank containing 10 leas; Scotch
                    manufacturers, on the other hand, adhere to the spindle containing 4 hanks of 12
                    cuts or leas.</p>
                <p>Commercial qualities of yarn range from about 6 lb tow yarns (8 lea) up to 160
                    lea line yarn. Very much finer yarn up even to 400 lea may be spun from the
                    system of machines found in many <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n690/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0690-0667"/> factories; but these higher counts are only used
                    for fine thread for sewing and for the making of lace. The highest counts of cut
                    line flax are spun in Irish factories for the manufacture of fine cambrics and
                    lawns which are characteristic features of the Ulster trade. Exceedingly high
                    counts have sometimes been spun by hand, and for the preparation of the finest
                    lace threads it is said the Belgian hand spinners must work in damp cellars,
                    where the spinner is guided by the sense of touch alone, the filament being too
                    fine to be seen by the eye. Such lace yarn is said to have been sold for as much
                    as £240 per tt&gt;. In the Great Exhibition of 1851 yarn of 760 lea, equal to
                    about 130 miles per tħ, was shown which had been spun by an Irish woman
                    eighty-four years of age. In the same exhibition there was shown by a Cambray
                    manufacturing firm hand-spun yarn •equal to 1200 warp and 1600 weft or to more
                    than 208 and 278 miles per lb respectively.</p>
                <p>A large proportion of the linen yarn of commerce undergoes a more or less
                    thorough bleaching before it is handed over to the weaver. Linen yarns in the
                    green condition contain such a large proportion of gummy and resinous matter,
                    removable by bleaching, that cloths which might present a firm close texture in
                    their natural unbleached state would become thin and impoverished in a perfectly
                    bleached condition. Manufacturers allow about 20 per cent, of loss in weight of
                    yarn in bleaching from the green to the fully bleached stage; and the
                    intermediate stages of “creamed,” “half-creamed,” “milled,” and “improved,” all
                    indicating a certain degree of bleaching, have corresponding degrees of loss in
                    weight. The differences in colour resulting from different degrees of bleaching
                    are taken advantage of for producing patterns in certain classes of linen
                    fabrics.</p>
                <p>Linen thread is prepared from the various counts of fine bleached line yarn by
                    winding the hanks on large spools, and twisting the various strands, two, three,
                    four, or six cord as the case may be, on a doubling spindle similar in principle
                    to the yarn spinning frame, excepting, of course, the drawing rollers. A large
                    trade in linen thread has been created by its use in the machine manufacture of
                    boots and shoes, saddlery, and other leather goods, and in heavy sewing-machine
                    work generally. The thread industry is largely developed at Lisburn near
                    Belfast, at Johnstone near Glasgow, and at Paterson, New Jersey, United States.
                    Fine cords, net twine, and ropes are also twisted from flax.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Weaving.—</hi> The application of the power-loom to the weaving
                    of linen was hindered by many obstacles which were not met with in dealing with
                    the weaving of cotton and woollen fabrics. The principal difficulty arose
                    through the hardness and inelasticity of the linen wefts, owing to which the
                    yarn frequently broke under the sharp sudden jerk with which the picker throws
                    the shuttle in powerloom weaving. The difficulties in the way of power-loom
                    linen weaving, combined with the obstinate competition of distressed hand-loom
                    weavers, delayed the introduction of factory weaving of linen fabrics for many
                    years after the system was fully applied to other textiles. Competition with the
                    hand-loom against the power-loom is conceivable, although it is absolutely
                    impossible for the work of the spinning wheel to stand against the rivalry of
                    drawing, roving, and spinning frames. To the present day, in Ireland especially,
                    a great deal of fine weaving is done by hand-loom; and the persons who first
                    applied machinery to the weaving of linen damasks in Scotland are yet (1882)
                    alive. Power was applied on a small scale to the weaving of canvas in London
                    about 1812; in 1821 power-looms were started for weaving linen at Kirkcaldy,
                    Scotland; and in 1824 Maberly &amp; Co. of Aberdeen had two hundred power-looms
                    erected for linen manufacture. The powerloom has been in uninterrupted use in
                    the Broadford factory, Aberdeen, which then belonged to Maberly &amp; Co., down
                    to the present day, and to that firm may be awarded the credit of being the
                    effective introducers of power-loom weaving in the linen trade.</p>
                <p>The various operations connected with linen weaving, such as winding, warping,
                    dressing, beaming, and drawingin, do not differ in essential features from the
                    like processes in the case of cotton weaving, &lt;fcc., neither is there any
                    significant modification in the looms employed. Dressing is a matter of
                    importance in the preparation of linen warps for beaming. It consists in
                    treating the spread yarn with flour paste, applied to it by cylinders, the
                    lowermost of which revolves in a trough of paste. The paste is equalized on the
                    yarn by brushes, and dried by passing the web over steam-heated cans before it
                    is finally wound on the beam for weaving. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Weaving.</hi></p>
                <p>For the bleaching and calendering of such linen fabrics as undergo these
                    processes see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bleaching</hi> vol. iii. p. 821; <hi

                <p>Linen fabrics are numerous in variety and widely different in their qualities,
                    appearance, and applications, ranging from heavy sailcloth and rough sacking to
                    the most delicate cambrics and lawns. The heavier manufactures include as a
                    principal item sailcloth, with canvas, tarpaulin, sacking, and carpeting. The
                    principal seats of the manufacture of these linens are Dundee, Arbroath, and
                    Forfar. The medium weight linens, which are used for a great variety of
                    purposes, such as tent-making, towelling, covers, outer garments for men,
                    linings, upholstery work, &amp;c., include duck, huckaback, crash, tick, dowlas,
                    osnaburg, low sheetings, and low brown linens. Plain bleached linens form a
                    class by themselves, and include principally the materials for shirts and
                    collars and for bed sheets. Under the head of twilled linens are included
                    drills, diapers, and dimity for household use; and damasks for table linen, of
                    which two kinds are distinguished—single or five-leaf damask, and double or
                    eight-leaf damask, the pattern being formed by the intersection of warp and weft
                    yarns at intervals of five and eight strands of yarn respectively. The fine
                    linens are cambrics, lawns, and handkerchiefs; and lastly, printed and dyed
                    linen fabrics may be assigned to a special though not important class. Numerous
                    local, fancy, and temporary names are frequently attached to linen fabrics; but
                    in the above list are only included such articles as occupy a standing position
                    in the great markets. In a general way it may be said regarding the British
                    industry that the heavy linen trade centres in Dundee; medium goods are made in
                    most linen manufacturing districts; damasks are chiefly produced in Dunfermline
                    and Perth; and the fine linen manufactures have their seat in Belfast and the
                    north of Ireland. Leeds is the centre of the linen trade of England.</p>
                <p>Linen fabrics have several advantages over cotton, resulting principally from the
                    microscopic structure and length of the flax fibre. The cloth is much smoother
                    and more lustrous than cotton, cloth; and, presenting a less “woolly” surface,
                    it does not soil so readily, nor absorb and retain moisture so freely, as the
                    more spongy cotton; and it is at once a cool, clean, and healthful material for
                    bed-sheeting and clothing. Bleached linen, starched and dressed, possesses that
                    unequalled purity, gloss, and smoothness which make it alone the material
                    suitable for shirt-fronts, collars, and wristbands; and the gossamer delicacy,
                    yet strength, of the thread it may be spun into fits it for the fine lace-making
                    to which it is devoted. Flax is a heavier material than cotton, but weight for
                    weight it is much stronger, single yam having proportionate strength in the
                    ratio of 3 to l <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 83, doubled yam 3 to 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 26, and cloth 3 to 2T3. Of course cotton, on the
                    other hand, has many advantages peculiarly its own.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade and Commerce.—</hi> The application of machine power to
                    the entire range of linen manufactures has greatly improved the position and
                    developed the resources of the industry, so that linen now occupies a
                    well-defined and important position among the principal textiles. Had it not
                    been for the sudden and unprecedented growth of the jute trade, no doubt the
                    coarser and heavier branches of the trade would have attained much greater
                    dimensions; and the development of the jute industry of Scotland fully accounts
                    for the comparatively inelastic condition of the Scottish linen trade.</p>
