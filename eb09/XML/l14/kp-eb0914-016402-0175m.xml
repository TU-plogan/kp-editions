                    gave expression to his republican sympathies—what Tacitus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ann.</hi> iii. 75) calls his <hi rend="italic">incorrupta libertas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> proved an obstacle to his advancement, and his rival,
                    Ateius Capito, who had unreservedly given in his adhesion to the ruling powers,
                    was unfairly promoted by Augustus to the consulate, when, in ordinary course,
                    the appointment should have fallen to Labeo; the result was that, smarting under
                    the wrong that was done him, he declined to accept the office when it was
                    offered to him in a subsequent year (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> iii. 75;
                    Pompon, in fr. 47, <hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> i. 2). From this time he seems to
                    have abandoned politics, and devoted his whole time to jurisprudence, with which
                    his name is much more prominently connected. His training in the science had
                    been derived principally from Trebatius Testa, although he had also diligently
                    attended the public audiences of most of the more eminent lawyers of the later
                    years of the republic. To a profound knowledge of the law as he had received it
                    from them he added a wide general culture, devoting his attention specially to
                    dialectics, philology <hi rend="italic">(grammatica),</hi> and antiquities, as
                    valuable aids in the exposition, expansion, and application of legal doctrine
                    (Gell., xiii. 10). Capito, in a letter preserved by Gellius (xiii. 12), says of
                    him “nihil haberet nisi quod justum sιnctumque esse in Romanis antiquitatibus
                    legisset and this has sometimes been thought irreconcilable with the statement
                    of Pomponius (fr. 47, <hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> i. 2) that in law he was an
                    innovator. But the observations of Capito refer to what he calls Labeo’s absurd
                    craze for freedom—his horror of anything out of the old current of
                    constitutional practice (which had led him, as Capito relates, into the
                    ridiculous extreme of indignantly resenting, as unauthorized, the courtesy of a
                    tribune who had ordered an officer simply to summon him to answer to a
                    complaint, instead of apprehending him). In his jurisprudential teaching and
                    advising there was none of this dogged indisposition to deviate from the paths
                    of his predecessors. It was the characteristic of his rival Capito to stand as
                    much as possible within the old lines,—“in his, quae ei tradita fuerunt,
                    perseverabat” (Pomp, in fr. 47, <hi rend="italic">Dig.</hi> i. 2); that of Labeo
                    was, with the aid of his dialectic, philology, and antiquities, to dissect a
                    received doctrine so as to reach its innermost <hi rend="italic">ratio,</hi> and
                    from this to start afresh, and give the doctrine a more accurate expression and
                    a variety of new developments. His success in this new method is attested by the
                    position he took among his contemporaries, and the reputation in which he was
                    held by his successors. Down to the time of Hadrian his was probably the name of
                    greatest authority; and the fact that several of his works were abridged and
                    annotated by later hands testifies to the estimation in which they were held by
                    practitioners. While Capito is hardly ever referred to, the dicta of Labeo are
                    of constant recurrence in the writings of the classical jurists, such as Gaius,
                    Ulpian, and Paul; and no inconsiderable number of them were thought worthy of
                    preservation in Justinian’s <hi rend="italic">Digest.</hi> Labeo gets the credit
                    of being the founder of the Proculian sect or school, while Capito is spoken of
                    as the founder of the rival Sabinian one (Pomponius in fr. 47, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dig.</hi> i. 2). It is doubtful whether this statement is quite accurate. Labeo
                    certainly taught in some way or other; for it is recorded of him that he devoted
                    six months of the year to giving professional advice and instructing his pupils
                    in Rome, while the other six he spent in literary work at his country seat. But
                    the lecturing <hi rend="italic">stationes</hi> of which Gellius speaks (xiii.
                    13) had not by that time been established, and it is probable that the real
                    founders of the two <hi rend="italic">scholae</hi> were Proculus and Sabinus,
                    followers respectively of the methods of Labeo and Capito. Such conjunctions (in
                    reference to peculiar doctrines of the schools), as “Proculus et Pegasus,”
                    “Sabinus et Cassius,” are very frequent; but the name of Labeo or Capito in
                    conjunction with another is of the rarest occurrence. There is not a single case
                    in the texts in which the latter is credited with the introduction of a doctrine
                    of the Sabinians, and only one or two in which Labeo is spoken of as the author
                    of a doctrine of the other school.</p>
                <p>Labeo’s most important literary work was the Libri Posteriorum, so called because
                    published only after his death. So far as can be judged, they contained a
                    systematic exposition of the common law in at least forty books, after the order
                    of the commentaries of Q. Mucius Scaevola. They seem to have been epitomized by
                    Javolenus, who was a leader of the Sabinian school; and numerous excerpts from
                    them, some from the original, others from the epitome, are preserved in
                    Justinian’s Digest., His Libri αd Edictum, frequently referred to by Ulpian and
                    Paul, as well as by earlier waiters, embraced a commentary, not only on the
                    edicts of the urban and peregrine praetors, but also on that of the curule
                    aediles. His Probabilium (πιθανών) Lib. V1I1., a collection of definitions and
                    axiomatic legal propositions, seem to have been one of his most characteristic
                    productions; they were abridged and annotated by Paul, and occasionally
                    criticized by him with some severity. Amongst the writings of Labeo which we
                    know only by report were Commentarii de jure pontificio, Commentarii ad XII.
                    Tabulas, Libri Epistolarum, and Libri Responsorum. See Van Eck, “De vita,
