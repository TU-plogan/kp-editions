                    law of the XII. Tables, the composition of scurrilous songs and gross noisy
                    public affronts were punished by death. Minor offences of the same class seem to
                    have found their place under the general conception of <hi rend="italic"
                    >injuria,</hi> which included ultimately every form of direct personal
                    aggression which involved contumely or insult. In the later Roman jurisprudence,
                    which has, on this point, exercised considerable influence over modern systems
                    of law, we find verbal injuries dealt with in the edict under two heads. The
                    first comprehended defamatory and injurious statements which were made in a
                    public manner <hi rend="italic">(convicium</hi><hi rend="italic">contra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bonos</hi><hi rend="italic">mores').</hi> In this case the essence
                    of the offence lay in the unwarrantable public proclamation, in the contumely
                    which was offered to a man before his fellow-citizens. In such a case the truth
                    of the statements was no justification for the unnecessarily public and
                    insulting manner in which they had been made. The second head included
                    defamatory statements which were made in private, and in this case the offence
                    lay in the imputation itself, not in the manner of its publication. The truth
                    was therefore a sufficient defence, for no man had a right to demand legal
                    protection for a false reputation. Even belief in the truth was enough, because
                    it took away the intention which was essential to the notion of <hi
                    rend="italic">injuria.</hi> The law thus aimed at giving sufficient scope for
                    the discussion of a man’s character, while at the same time it protected him
                    from needless insult and pain. The remedy for verbal injuries was long confined
                    to a civil action for a money penalty, which was estimated according to the
                    gravity of the case, and which, although vindictive in its character, doubtless
                    included practically the element of compensation. But a new remedy was
                    introduced with the extension of the criminal law, under which many kinds of
                    defamation were punished with great severity. We find at the same time increased
                    importance attached to the publication of defamatory books and writings, the <hi
                    rend="italic">libri</hi> or <hi rend="italic">libelli</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >j'amosi,</hi> from which we derive our modern use of the word libel; and under
                    the later emperors the latter term came to be specially applied to anonymous
                    accusations or pasquils, the dissemination of which was regarded as peculiarly
                    dangerous, and visited with very severe punishment, whether the matter contained
                    in them were true or false.</p>
                <p>The earlier history of the English law of defamation is somewhat obscure. Civil
                    actions for damages seem to have been tolerably frequent so far back as the
                    reign of Edward I. There was no distinction drawn between words written and
                    spoken. When no pecuniary penalty was involved such cases fell within the old
                    jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, which was only finally abolished
                    during the present reign. It seems, to say the least, uncertain whether any
                    generally applicable criminal process - was in use. The crime of <hi
                    rend="italic">scandalum magnatum,</hi> spreading false reports about the
                    magnates of the realm, was established by statutes, but the first fully reported
                    case in which libel is affirmed generally to be punishable at common law is one
                    tried in the Star Chamber in the reign of James I. In that case no English
                    authorities are cited except a previous case of the same nature before the same
                    tribunal; the law and terminology appear to be taken directly from Roman
                    sources, with the insertion that libels tended to a breach of the peace; and it
                    seems probable that that not very scrupulous tribunal had simply found it
                    convenient to adopt the very stringent Roman provisions regarding the <hi
                    rend="italic">libelli famosi</hi> without paying any regard to the Roman
                    limitations. From that time we find both the criminal and civil remedies in full
                    operation, and will now consider how the law stands with regard to each at the
                    present time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Civil Law.—</hi> The first important distinction we encounter
                    is that between slander and libel, between the oral and written promulgation of
                    defamatory statements. In the former case the remedy is limited. The law will
                    not take notice of every kind of abusive or defamatory language. It must be
                    shown either that the plaintiff has suffered actual damage as a direct
                    consequence of the slander, or that the imputation is of such a nature that we
                    are entitled to infer damage as a necessary consequence. The special damage on
                    which an action is founded for slanderous words must be of the nature of
                    pecuniary loss. Loss of reputation or of position in society, or even illness,
                    however clearly it may be traced to the slander, is insufficient. When we cannot
                    prove special damage, the action for slander is only allowed upon certain
                    strictly defined grounds. These are the imputation of a crime or misdemeanour
                    which is punishable corporeally, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> by imprisonment;
                    the imputation of a contagious or infectious disease; statements which tend to
                    the disherison of an apparent heir (other cases of slander of title when the
                    party is in possession requiring the allegation of special damage); and lastly,
                    slanders directed against a man’s professional or business character, which tend
                    directly to prejudice him in his trade, profession, or means of livelihood. In
                    the latter case the words must either be directly aimed at a man in his business
                    or official character, or they must be such as necessarily to imply unfitness
                    for his particular office or occupation. Thus words which merely reflect
                    generally upon the moral character of a tradesman or professional man are not
                    actionable, but they are actionable if directed against his dealings in the
                    course of his trade or profession. But, in the case of a merchant or trader, an
                    allegation which affects his credit generally is enough, and in the same way it
                    has been held that statements are actionable which affect the ability or moral
                    characters of persons who hold offices, or exercise occupation which require a
                    high degree of ability, or infer peculiar confidence. In every case the
                    plaintiff must have been at the time of the slander in the actual exercise of
                    the occupation or enjoyment of the office with reference to which the slander is
                    supposed to have affected him.</p>
                <p>The action for libel is not restricted in the same way as that for slander.
                    Originally, as we have seen, there appears to have been no essential distinction
                    between them, but the establishment of libel as a criminal offence had probably
                    considerable influence, and it soon became settled that written defamatory
                    statements, or pictures and other signs which bore a defamatory meaning, implied
                    greater malice and deliberation, and were generally fraught with greater injury
                    than those which were merely made by word of mouth. The result has been that the
                    action for libel is not limited to special grounds, or by the necessity of
                    proving special damage. It may be founded on any statement which disparages a
                    man’s private or professional character, or which tends to hold him up to
                    hatred, contempt, or ridicule. Tn one of the leading cases, for example, the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n525/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0525-0506"/> plaintiff obtained damages because it was said of
                    him that he was a hypocrite, and had used the cloak of religion for unworthy
                    purposes. In another case a charge of ingratitude was held sufficient. In civil
                    cases the libel must be published by being brought by the defendant under the
                    notice of a third party, and it has even been held that it is sufficient if this
                    has been done by gross carelessness, without deliberate intention to publish.
                    Every person is liable to an action who is concerned in the publication of a
                    libel, whether he be the author, printer, or publisher; and the extent and
                    manner of the publication, although not affecting the ground of the action, is a
                    material element in estimating the damages.</p>
                <p>It is not necessary that the defamatory character of the words or writing
                    complained of should be apparent on their face. They may be couched in the form
                    of an insinuation, or may derive their sting from a reference to circumstances
                    understood by the persons to whom they are addressed. In such a case the
                    plaintiff must make the injurious sense clear by an averment called an innuendo,
                    and it is for the jury to say whether the words bore the meaning thus ascribed
                    to them.</p>
                <p>In all civil actions for slander and libel the falsity of the injurious
                    statements is an essential element, so that the defendant is always entitled to
                    justify his statements by their truth; but when the statements are in themselves
                    defamatory, their falsity is presumed, and the burden of proving their truth is
                    laid upon the defendant. There are however, a large class of false defamatory
                    statements, commonly called privileged, which are not actionable on account of
                    the particular circumstances in which they are made. The general theory of law
                    with regard to these cases is this. It is assumed that in every case of
                    defamation intention is a necessary element; but in the ordinary case, when a
                    statement is false and defamatory, the law presumes that it has been made or
                    published with an evil intent, and will not allow this presumption to be
                    rebutted by evidence or submitted as matter of fact to a jury. But there are
                    certain circumstances in which the natural presumption is quite the other way.
                    There are certain natural and proper occasions on which statements may be made
                    which are in themselves defamatory, and which may be false, but which naturally
                    suggest that the statements may have been made from a perfectly proper motive
                    and with entire belief in their truth. In the cases of this kind which are
                    recognized by law, the presumption is reversed. It lies with the plaintiff to
                    show that the defendant was actuated by what is called <hi rend="italic">express
                    malice,</hi> by an intention to do harm, and in this case the question is not
                    one of legal inference for the court, but a matter of fact to be decided by the
                    jury. Although, however, the theory of the law seems to rest entirely upon
                    natural presumption of intention, it is pretty clear that in determining the
                    limits of privilege the courts have been almost wholly guided by considerations
                    of public or general expediency.</p>
                <p>In some cases the privilege is absolute, so that we cannot have an action for
                    defamation even although we prove express malice. Thus no action of this kind
                    can be maintained for statements made in the course of judicial proceedings if
                    they are in any sense relevant to the matter in hand. In the same way no
                    statements or publications are actionable which are made in the ordinary course
                    of parliamentary proceedings. Papers published under the authority of parliament
                    are protected by a special Act, 3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 9, which was passed after a
                    decree of the law courts adverse to the privilege claimed. The reports of
                    judicial and parliamentary proceedings stand in a somewhat different position,
                    which has only been attained after a long and interesting conflict. The general
                    rule now is that all reports of parliamentary or judicial proceedings are
                    privileged in so far as they are honest and impartial. Even <hi rend="italic">ex
                    parte</hi> proceedings, in so far as they take place in public, now fall within
                    the same rule. But if the report is garbled, or if part of it only is published,
                    the party who is injured in consequence is entitled to maintain an action, and
                    to have the question of malice submitted to a jury. Comments on subjects of
                    public interest, on the proceedings of courts or public bodies, on publications,
                    exhibitions, and on persons who have in any way chosen to invite the public
                    attention, fall within a similar rule. The public interest demands that on all
                    these subjects a fair latitude for discussion should be permitted; the critic is
                    entitled to the utmost liberty so long as he expresses nothing more than his
                    honest opinion of the subject before him, but if it can be proved that he has
                    used false and defamatory language out of malice, and especially if he has
                    travelled beyond the facts which are properly before the public, he is no longer
                    protected by his privilege. In private life a large number of statements are
                    privileged so long as they remain matters of strictly private communication. It
                    is difficult to define the limits of private privilege without extensive
                    reference to concrete cases; but generally it may be said that it includes all
                    communications which are made in performance of a duty not merely legal but
                    moral or social, answers to <hi rend="italic">l&gt;ona fide</hi> inquiries,
                    communications made by persons in confidential relations regarding matters in
                    which one or both are interested, and even statements made within proper limits
                    by persons in the <hi rend="italic">l&gt;ona fide</hi> prosecution of their own
                    interest. Common examples of this kind of privilege are to be found in answer to
                    inquiries as to the character of servants or the solvency of a trader, warnings
                    to a friend, communications between persons who are jointly interested in some
                    matters of business. But in every case we must be careful not to exceed the
                    limits of publication required by the occasion, or otherwise the privilege is
                    lost. Thus defamatory statements may be privileged when made to a meeting of
                    shareholders, but not when published to others who have no immediate concern in
                    the business.</p>
                <p>In a few instances in which an action cannot be maintained even by the averment
                    of malice, the plaintiff may maintain an action by averring not only malice but
                    also want of reasonable and probable cause. The most common instances of this
                    kind are malicious charges made in the ordinary course of justice and malicious
                    prosecutions. In such cases it would be contrary to public policy to punish or
                    prevent every charge which was made from a purely malicious motive, but there is
                    no reason for protecting accusations which are not only malicious, but destitute
                    of all reasonable probability.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Criminal Law.—</hi> Publications which are blasphemous,
                    immoral, or seditious are frequently termed libels, and are punishable both at
                    common law and by various statutes. The matter, however, which constitutes the
                    offence in these publications lies beyond our present scope. Libels upon
                    individuals may be prosecuted by criminal information or indictment, but there
                    can be no criminal prosecution for slander. So far as concerns the definition of
                    libel, and its limitation by the necessity of proving in certain cases express
                    malice, there is no substantial difference between the rules which apply to
                    criminal prosecutions and to civil actions, with the one important exception
                    (now considerably modified) that the falsity of a libel is not in criminal law
                    an essential element of the offence. If the matter alleged were in itself
                    defamatory, the court would not permit inquiry into its truth. The sweeping
                    application of this rule seems chiefly due to the indiscriminate use, in earlier
                    cases, of a rule in Roman law which was only applicable to certain modes of
                    publication, but has been supported by various reasons of general policy, and
                    especially by the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n526/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0526-0507"/> view that one main reason for punishing a libel
                    was its tendency to provoke a breach of the peace. The same view has occasioned
                    a difference in the publication required in civil and criminal actions. It is
                    enough in criminal law that the libel has been published to the party against
                    whom it is directed, if it is averred that it is intended or calculated to
                    produce a breach of the peace. Important alterations, however, have been
                    introduced into this branch of the law by 6 à 7 Vict. c. 96. By that Act any
                    person who maliciously publishes a defamatory libel may be punished by fine or
                    imprisonment or both, the imprisonment not to exceed one year. Any person
                    maliciously publishing a defamatory libel, knowing the same to be false, is
                    liable to fine and imprisonment for two years. In every case the truth of the
                    matters charged may be inquired into if it be pleaded, but the truth does not
                    amount to a defence unless it is also proved that the publication was for the
                    public benefit; and if, after such plea, the defendant is convicted, it is
                    competent to the court to consider whether the guilt of the defendant is
                    mitigated or aggravated by the plea, and the evidence given in relation to it.
                    By the same Act a defendant is protected from publication of libels without his
                    knowledge, authority, or consent, if the publication did not arise from the want
                    of due care and caution on his part. The court are further authorized to award
                    costs to the defendant in any information or indictment at the instance of a
                    private prosecutor.</p>
                <p>An important dispute about the powers of the jury in cases of libel arose during
                    last century in connexion with some well known trials for seditious libels. The
                    point is familiar to readers of Macaulay in connexion with the trial of the
                    seven bishops, but the cases in which it was brought most prominently forward,
                    and which led to its final settlement, were those against Woodfall (the printer
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lunins),</hi> Wilkes, and others, and especially the case
                    against Shipley, the dean of St Asaph (21 St. Tr. 925), in which the question
                    was fought by Mr Erskine with extraordinary energy and ability. The controversy
                    turned upon the question whether the jury were to be strictly confined to
                    matters of fact which required to be proved by evidence, or whether in every
                    case they were entitled to form their own opinion upon the libellous character
                    of the publication and the intention of the author. There could be no doubt of
                    course that the jury, if they pleased, had it in their power to return a general
                    verdict of guilty or not guilty, but both in theory and practice they were
                    subject in law to the directions of the court, and had to be informed by it as
                    to what they were to take into consideration in determining upon their verdict
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Jury).</hi> There is no difficulty about the general
                    application of this principle in criminal trials. In a case of murder, for
                    example, the judge directs the jury that if they are satisfied the accused did
                    so and so they ought to find him guilty. He directs them, not merely as to the
                    definition of the crime, but as to the particular facts which fall within that
                    definition. If the crime is one which is inferred by law from certain facts,
                    they are only concerned with these facts, and must accept the construction which
                    is put upon them by law. Applying these principles to the case of libel, juries
                    were directed that it was for the court to determine whether the publication
                    fell within the definition of libel, and whether the case was one in which
                    malice was to be inferred by construction of law. If the case were one in which
                    malice was inferred by law, the only facts left to the jury were the fact of
                    publication and the meaning averred by innuendoes; they could not go into the
                    question of intention, unless the case were one of privilege, in which express
                    malice had to be proved. In general principle, therefore, the decisions of the
                    court were in accordance with the ordinary principles of criminal law·. But
                    there were undoubtedly some peculiarities in the case of libel. The sense of
                    words, the inferences to be drawn from them, and the effect which they produce
                    are not so easily defined as gross matters of fact. They seem to belong to those
                    cases in which the impression made upon a jury is more to be trusted than the
                    decision of a judge. And further, owing to the mode of procedure, the defendant
                    was often punished before the question of law was determined. But nevertheless
                    the question would scarcely have been raised had the libels related merely to
                    private matters. The real ground of dispute was the liberty to be accorded to
                    political discussion. Had the judges taken as wide a view of privilege in
                    discussing matters of public interest as they do now, the question could
                    scarcely have arisen; for Erskine’s w4ιole contention really amounted to this,
                    that the jury were entitled to take into consideration the good or bad intent of
                    the authors, which is precisely the question which would now be put before them
                    in any matter which concerned the public. But at that time the notion of a
                    special privilege attaching to political discussion had scarcely arisen, or was
                    at least confined within very narrow limits, and the cause of free political
                    discussion seemed to be more safely entrusted to juries than to courts. The
                    question was finally settled by Mr Fox’s Libel Act (32 Geo. III. c. 60), by
                    which the jury were entitled to give a general verdict on the whole matter put
                    in issue.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Scotch Law.—</hi> In Scotch law there were originally three
                    remedies for defamation. It might he prosecuted by or with the concurrence of
                    the lord advocate before the Court of Justiciary; or, secondly, a criminal
                    remedy might be obtained in the commissary (ecclesiastical) courts, which
                    originally dealt with the defender by public retractation or penance, but
                    subsequently made use of fines payable to their own procurator or to the party
                    injured, these latter being regarded as solatium to his feelings; or, lastly, an
                    action of damages was competent before the Court of Session, which was strictly
                    civil in its character, and aimed at the reparation of patrimonial loss. The
                    first remedy has fallen into disuse; the second and third (the commissary courts
                    being now abolished) became mixed up together, and are represented by the
                    present action for damages or solatium. Originally the action before tbe Court
                    of Session was strictly for damages—founded, not upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >animus</hi><hi rend="italic">injuriandi,</hi> but upon culpa, and could be
                    defended by proving the truth of the statements. But in time the Court of
                    Session began to assume the original jurisdiction of the commissary courts, and
                    entertained actions for solatium in which the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">injuriandi</hi> was a necessary element, and to which, as in Roman
                    law, the truth was not necessarily a defence. Ultimately the two actions got
                    very much confused. We find continual disputes as to the necessity for <hi
                    rend="italic">the animus</hi><hi rend="italic">injuriandi</hi> and the
                    applicability of the plea of <hi rend="italic">veritas convicii,</hi> which
                    arose from the fact that the courts were not always conscious that they were
                    dealing with two actions, to one of which these notions were applicable, and to
                    the other not. On the introduction of the jury court, presided over by an
                    English lawyer, it was quite natural that he, finding no very clear distinction
                    maintained between damage and solatium, applied the English plea of truth as a
                    justification to every case, and retained the <hi rend="italic">animus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">injuriandi</hi> both in ordinary cases and cases of privilege in
                    the same shape as the English conception of malice. The leading and almost only
                    differences between the English and Scotch law now are that the latter makes no
                    essential distinction between oral and written defamation, that it practically
                    gives an action for every case of defamation oral or written upon which in
                    England a civil action might be maintained for libel, and that it possesses no
                    criminal remedy. In consequence of the latter defect and the indiscriminate
                    application of the plea of veritas to every case both of damages and solatium,
                    there appears to be at present no remedy in Scotland even for the widest and
                    most needless publication of offensive statements if only they are true.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">American Law.—</hi> In this as in so many other departments the
                    American law scarcely if at all differs from that of England. In so far indeed
                    as the common law is concerned, they may be said to be substantially identical.
                    The principal statutes which have altered the English criminal law, such as Mr
                    Fox’s Act, and 6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 96, are also represented by equivalent
                    legislation in most American States. (A. GI. )</p>
