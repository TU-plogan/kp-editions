                        rend="smallcaps">Maximilien Émile</hi> (1801-1881), the compiler of the best
                    dictionary of any living language, and the Frenchman of most encyclopaedic
                    knowledge since Diderot, was born at Paris on February 1, 1801. His father had
                    been a gunner, and afterwards sergeant-major of marine artillery, in the French
                    navy, and was deeply imbued with the revolutionary ideas of the day. Settling
                    down as a collector of taxes, he married Sophie Johaunot, a free-thinker like
                    himself, and devoted himself to the education of his son Émile. The boy was sent
                    to the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, where he had for friends Hachette and Eugène
                    Burnouf, and he distinguished himself alike in his work and in all athletic
                    exercises. After he had completed his course at school, he hesitated for a time
                    as to what profession he should adopt, and meanwhile made himself master, not
                    only of the English and German languages, but of the classical and Sanskrit
                    literature and philology. At last he determined to study medicine, and in 1822
                    entered his name as a student of medicine. He passed all his examinations in due
                    course, and had only his thesis to prepare in order to obtain his degree as
                    doctor when in 1827 his father died, leaving his mother absolutely without
                    resources. He at once renounced his degree, and, while attending the lectures of
                    Rayer and taking a keen interest in medicine, began teaching Latin and Greek for
                    a livelihood. He carried a musket on the popular side in the revolution of
                    February 1830, and was one of the national guards who followed Charles X. to
                    Rambouillet. At last, in 1831, when quite thirty years of age, he obtained an
                    introduction to Armand Carrel, the editor of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >National,</hi> who gave him the task of reading the English and German
                    papers for excerpts. Carrel by the merest chance, in 1835, discovered the
                    ability of his reader, who from that time became a constant contributor, and
                    eventually director of the paper. In 1836 he began to contribute articles on all
                    sorts of subjects to the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes·,</hi> in 1837
                    he married; and in 1839 appeared the first volume of his edition of the works of
                    Hippocrates. This volume at once placed Littré in the forefront of the literary
                    and scientific world; its ability was recognized by his election the same year
                    into the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres. At the age of thirtyeight
                    then he had won for himself a high reputation as a learned man of letters and of
                    science, but was still tormented by the unsettled ideas and thoughts which
                    generally beset younger men, and were only increased by the study of his
                    favourite authors Byron and Obermann. At this epoch he came across the works of
                    Auguste Comte, the reading of which formed, as he himself said, “the cardinal
                    point of his life,” and from this time onward appears the influence of
                    positivism on his own life, and, what is of even more importance, his influence
                    on positivism, for he gave at least as much to positivism as he received from
                    it. He brought to it a wide knowledge of science and literature, a great and
                    growing reputation, and a clear head. He soon became an intimate friend of
                    Comte’s, and set to work to popularize his ideas in numerous works on the
                    positivist philosophy, while at the same time continuing his edition of
                    Hippocrates, which was not completed till 1862, publishing a similar edition of
                    Pliny’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> assisting after 1844 in the
                    place of Fauriel at the committee engaged on the <hi rend="italic">Histoire
                        littéraire de la France,</hi> where his knowledge of the early French
                    language and literature was invaluable, and contributing largely to the <hi

                    himself took part in the repression of the extreme republican party in June
                    1849, under the banner of order. His essays, contributed during this period to
                    the <hi rend="italic">National,</hi> were collected together and published under
                    the title of <hi rend="italic">Conservation,</hi><hi rend="italic">Révolution,
                        et Positivisme</hi> in 1852, and show, not only a lively faith in a good
                    time coming, but a thorough acceptance of all the doctrines propounded by Comte.
                    However, during the later years of his master’s life, he began to perceive that
                    he could not wholly accept all the dogmas or the more mystic ideas of his friend
                    and master, but he studiously concealed his differences of opinion almost from
                    himself, and Comte failed to perceive that his pupil had outgrown him, as he
                    himself had outgrown his master Saint-Simon. Comte’s death in 1858 freed Littré
                    from any fear of embittering his master’s later years, and he published his own
                    ideas in his <hi rend="italic">Paroles</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                        Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">Positive</hi> in 1859, and at still
                    greater length in his work in <hi rend="italic">Auguste</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Comte et la Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic">positive</hi> in 1863. In
                    this book he traces the origin of Comte’s ideas through Turgot, Kant, and
                    Saint-Simon, then eulogizes Comte’s own life, his method of philosophy, his
                    great services to the cause, and the effect of his works, and finally proceeds
                    to show where he himself differs from him. He approved wholly of Comte’s
                    philosophy, his great laws of society, and his philosophical method, which
                    indeed he defended warmly against J. S. Mill, but declared that, while he
                    believed in a positivist philosophy, he did not believe in a religion of
                    humanity. In the year 1863, after completing his Hippocrates and his Pliny, he
                    set to work on his great French dictionary, bringing to the task an unexampled
                    knowledge of old French, of modern and classical languages, and of modern
                    philology, which were to make his dictionary unique in its interest and
                    accuracy. In the same year he was proposed for the Académie Française, but
                    rejected, owing to the opposition of the fiery bishop of Orleans, who denounced
                    him as the chief of the French materialists. He also at this time started with
                    M. Wyrouboff the <hi rend="italic">Philosophie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Positive,</hi> a review which was to embody the views of modern
                    positivists, and to which he largely contributed. His life was thus absorbed in
                    literary work, and flowed quietly on, till the overthrow of the empire called on
                    him to take a part in politics. He felt himself too old to undergo the
                    privations of the siege of Paris, and retired with his family to Britanny,
                    whence he was summoned by M. Gambetta to Bordeaux, to lecture on history, and
                    thence to Versailles to take his seat in the senate to which he had been chosen
                    by the department of the Seine. In December 1871 he was elected a member of the
                    Académie Française in spite of the renewed opposition of the Mgr. Dupanloup,
                    bishop of Orleans, who resigned his seat rather than receive him. His dictionary
                    was completed in 1873, and he lived on full of years and honours, for in 1874 he
                    was elected a life senator. The most notable of his productions in these latter
                    years were his political papers attacking and unveiling the confederacy of the
                    Orleanists and legitimists, and in favour of the republic, his republication of
                    many of his old articles and books, among others the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conservation, Revolution,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Positivisme</hi> of 1852
                    (which he reprinted word for word, appending a formal, categorical renunciation
                    of many of the Comtist doctrines therein contained), and a little tract <hi
                        rend="italic">Pour la dernière fois,</hi> in which he maintained his
                    unalterable belief in materialism. When it became obvious that the old man could
                    not live much longer, his wife and daughter, who had always been fervent
                    Catholics, strove to convert him to their religion. He had long, interviews with
                    Père Millériot, a celebrated controversialist, and was much grieved at his
                    death; but it is hardly probable he would have ever been really converted.
                    Nevertheless, when on the point of death, his wife had him baptized, and his
                    funeral was conducted with the rites of the Catholic Church. He died June 2,
                    1881.</p>
                <p>It is almost impossible to characterize the varied learning and immense
                    intellectual activity of Littré. As a philosopher he had popularized and sifted
                    the ideas of Comte, and had succeeded Comte as Comte succeeded Turgot, Kant, and
                    Saint-Simon; as a lexicographer he has been compared to Johnson, though his work
                    is as far ahead of Johnson’s as the philological knowledge of the 19 th century
                    is in advance of that of the 18th; and as a man of almost universal knowledge,
                    and a writer on every sort of subject, from barbarian learning and modern
                    science to epic poetry and the military genius of Napoleon, he remains
                    unrivalled, even in a country which can boast of Diderot and Comte.</p>
                <p>It would take too much space to give a complete list of all Littré’s voluminous
                    works, but the following are those of greatest importance his editions of
