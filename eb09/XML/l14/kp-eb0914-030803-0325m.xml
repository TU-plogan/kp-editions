                    temperate parts of the Old World this species is perhaps the most abundant of
                    the Plovers, <hi rend="italic">Charadrvidae,</hi> breeding in greater or fewer
                    numbers in almost every suitable place from Ireland to Japan,—the majority
                    migrating towards winter to southern countries, as the Punjab, Egypt, and
                    Barbary,—though in the British Islands some are always found at that season,
                    chiefly about estuaries. As a straggler it has occurred within the Arctic</p>
                <p>Circle (as on the Varanger Fjord in Norway), as well as in Iceland and even
                    Greenland; while it not unfrequently appears in Madeira and the Azores.
                    Conspicuous as the strongly contrasted colours of its plumage and its very
                    peculiar flight make it, one may well wonder at its success in maintaining its
                    ground when so many of its allies have been almost exterminated, for the Lapwing
                    is the object perhaps of greater persecution than any other European bird that
                    is not a plunderer. Its eggs—the well known “Plovers’ Eggs” of commerce<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is a prevalent belief
                    that many of the eggs sold as “Plovers’” are those of Rooks, but no notion can
                    be more absurd, since the appearance of the two is wholly unlike. Those of the
                    Redshank, of the Golden Plover (to a small extent), and enormous numbers of
                    those of the Black-headed Gull, and in certain places of some of the Terns, are,
                    however, undoubtedly sold as Lapwings’, having a certain similarity of shell to
                    the latter, and a difference of flavour only to be detected by a fine palate. It
                    is estimated that 800,000 Lapwings’ eggs are yearly sent to England from the one
                    province of Friesland in Holland (see Ornith. Centralblatt, 1877, p.
                    108).</p></note> —are taken by the thousand or ten thousand; and, worse than
                    this, the bird, wary and wild at other times of the year, in the breeding-season
                    becomes easily approachable, and is (or used to be) shot down in enormous
                    numbers to be sold in the markets for “Golden Plover.” Its growing scarcity as a
                    species was consequently in Great Britain very perceptible until an Act of
                    Parliament (35 &amp; 36 Vict. cap. 78) frightened people into letting it
                    alone,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This measure was
                    really insufficient to afford it, or any other bird, proper protection, but the
                    British public seldom read Acts of Parliament critically, and, hearing that one
                    had been passed for the Preservation of Wild Birds, in which the Lapwing was
                    specially named, most persons desisted from persecuting this species, not in the
                    least knowing that the utmost penaltj' they could incur by killing it in the
                    closeseason would be but trifling.</p></note> and its numbers have since then as
                    perceptibly increased, to the manifest advantage of many classes of the
                    community—those who would eat its eggs, those who would eat its flesh (at the
                    right time of year), as well as the agriculturists whose lands it frequented,
                    for it is admitted on all hands that no bird is more completely the farmer’s
                    friend. What seems to be the secret of the Lapwing holding its position in spite
                    of slaughter and rapine is the adaptability of its nature to various kinds of
                    localities. It will find sustenance for itself and its progeny equally on the
                    driest soils as on the fattest pastures; upland and fen, arable and moorland <hi
                    rend="subscript"> λ</hi> are alike to it, provided only the ground be open
                    enough. The wailing cry<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This sounds like ρee-weet, with some variety of intonation. Hence the names
                    Peewit, Peaseweep, and Teuchit, commonly applied in some parts of Britain to
                    this bird,—though the first is that by which one of the smaller Gulls, Lams
                    ridibundus (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gull,</hi> vol. xi. p. 274), is known in
                    the districts it frequents. In Sweden Viρa, in Germany Kiebitz, in Holland
                    Kiewiet, and in France Dixhu.it, are names of the Lapwing, given to it from its
                    usual cry. Other English names are Green Plover and Hornpie—the latter from its
                    long hornlike crest and pied plumage. The Lapwing’s conspicuous crest seems to
                    have been the cause of a common blunder among our writers of the Middle Ages,
                    who translated the Latin word Upupa, properly <hi rend="smallcaps">Hoopoe</hi>
                    (g ’.v.), by Lapwing, as being the crested bird with which they were best
                    acquainted. In like manner other writers of the same or an earlier period
                    Latinized Lapwing by Egrettides (plural), and rendered that again into English
                    as Egrets—the tuft of feathers misleading them also. The word Vanellus is from
                    vannus, the fan used for winnowing corn, and refers to the audible beating of
                    the bird’s wings.</p></note> and the frantic gestures of the cock bird in the
                    breeding-season will tell any passer-by that a nest or brood is near; but,
                    unless he knows how to look for it, nothing save mere chance will enable him to
                    find it. Yet by practice those who are acquainted with the bird’s habits will
                    accurately mark the spot whence the hen silently rises from her treasure, and,
                    disregarding the behaviour of the cock, which is intended to delude the
                    intruder, will walk straight to one nest after another as though they knew
                    beforehand the exact position of each. The nest is a slight hollow in the
                    ground, wonderfully inconspicuous even when deepened, as is usually the case, by
                    incu <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> bation, and the black-spotted olive <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n326/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0326-0309"/> eggs (four in number) are almost invisible to the
                    careless or untrained eye unless it should happen to glance directly upon them.
                    The young when first hatched are clothed with mottled down so as closely to
                    resemble a stone and to be overlooked as they squat motionless on the approach
                    of danger. At a distance the plumage of the adult appears to be white and black
                    in about equal proportions, the latter predominating above; but on closer
                    examination nearly all the seeming black is found to be a bottle-green gleaming
                    with purple and copper; and the tail-coverts, both above and below, are seen to
                    be of a bright bay colour that is seldom visible in flight. The crest consists
                    of six or eight narrow and elongated feathers, turned slightly upwards at the
                    end, and is usually carried in a horizontal position, extending in the cock
                    beyond the middle of the back; but it is capable of being erected so as to
                    become nearly vertical. Frequenting (as has been said) parts of the open country
                    so very divergent in character, and as remarkable for the peculiarity of its
                    flight as for that of its cry, the Lapwing is far more often observed in nearly
                    all parts of the British Islands than any other of the group, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Limicolae,</hi> to which it belongs. The peculiarity of its flight seems due to
                    the wide and rounded wings it possesses, the steady and ordinarily somewhat slow
                    flapping of which impels the body at each stroke with a manifest though easy
                    jerk. Yet on occasion, as when performing its migrations, or even its almost
                    daily transits from one feeding-ground to another, and still more when being
                    pursued by a Falcon, the speed with which it moves through the air is very
                    considerable; and the passage of a flock of Lapwings, twinkling aloft or in the
                    distance, as the dark and light surfaces of the plumage are alternately
                    presented, is always an agreeable spectacle to those who love a landscape
                    enlivened by its wild creatures. On the ground this bird runs nimbly, and is
                    nearly always engaged in searching for its food, which is wholly animal.</p>
                <p>Allied to the Lapwing are several forms that have been placed by ornithologists
                    in the genera <hi rend="italic">Hoplopterus, Chettusia, Lobiυanellus,
                    Sarciophorus,</hi> and so forth; but the respective degree of affinity they bear
                    to one another is not rightly understood, and space would prohibit any attempt
                    at here expressing it. In some of them the hind toe, which has already ceased to
                    have any function in the Lapwing, is wholly wanting. In others the wings are
                    armed with a tubercle or even a sharp spur on the carpus. Few have any occipital
                    crest, but several have the face ornamented by the outgrowth of a fleshy lobe or
                    lobes. With the exception of North America, they are found in most parts of the
                    world, but perhaps the greater number in Africa. Europe has three species— <hi
                    rend="italic">Hoplopterus</hi><hi rend="italic">spinosus,</hi> the Spur-winged
                    Plover, and <hi rend="italic">Chettusia</hi><hi rend="italic">gregaria</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">C. leucura</hi>; but the first and last are only stragglers
                    from Africa and Asia. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
