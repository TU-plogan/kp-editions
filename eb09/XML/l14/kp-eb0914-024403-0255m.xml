                    concentrated heat in a convenient and portable form. The substances used in
                    lamps for lighting are of two classes—(1) fixed oils, and (2) fluid hydrocarbons
                    obtained from the distillation of bituminous shales, &amp;c. (paraffin oil),
                    petroleum, and essential oils. The latter class may be distinguished as mineral
                    oils. Till very recently fixed oils were almost exclusively used for lamps; but
                    since the introduction of the cheaper and more convenient mineral oils, in the
                    second half of the 19 th century, the use of fixed oils has steadily decreased
                    in all parts of the world.</p>
                <p>There is scarcely any fixed or fatty oil which has not been used, more or less,
                    for burning. Many oils are so used in the districts which produce them, although
                    they hardly enter into ordinary commerce under the name of burning oils. The
                    so-called fish oils (sperm, whale, and seal) were, in recent times, principal
                    burning oils, and to a limited extent are still so employed. Of the vegetable
                    oils of commerce, colza oil is the most extensively used as an illuminant, and
                    after it come other rape oils, poppy oil, the lower qualities of olive oil,
                    sesamum or gingelly oil, candle-nut oil, and ground-nut oil, all of which,
                    however, are local or restricted in consumption. The suitability of fixed oils
                    for burning purposes depends on their purity or freedom from foreign matters,
                    and on their limpidity, or, what is in effect the same thing, the temperature at
                    which they solidify. Thus cocoa-nut fat is consumed in ordinary <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n256/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0256-0245"/> lamps in tropical regions, although in temperate
                    latitudes it is a permanent solid. In the combustion of a fixed oil in lamps,
                    the oil undergoes destructive distillation, and at the burning point is resolved
                    into a gaseous mixture. The comparative viscosity of all fixed oils renders it
                    necessary to adopt some device supplementary to the capillary action of the wick
                    for maintaining at the level of the burner a supply of oil sufficient to support
                    uniform combustion. Again, the lubricant properties of fixed oils make it
                    practicable to adopt various mechanical devices to regulate the supply of fuel
                    to the burner, and otherwise control illumination.</p>
                <p>The mineral oils, on the other hand, are, as sold, mixtures of various volatile
                    hydrocarbons which give off inflammable vapours at comparatively low
                    temperatures, und in consumption in lamps they come to the burning point in the
                    condition of vapour. With highly volatile oils, and the use of imperfectly
                    fitted lamps, though not •with proper oil and fittings, there is some danger of
                    explosion; there is also a risk that with imperfect combustion deleterious gases
                    may be diffused through an apartment. Mineral oils possess such a high degree of
                    limpidity that the suction of the wick alone is generally sufficient to bring
                    the necessary supply of fuel to the burner.</p>
                <p>The qualities of a lamp are judged of by the brilliance, steadiness, and
                    uniformity of light it yields in proportion to the quantity of oil it consumes;
                    by the convenient position of the light in relation to the equal illumination of
                    the space it has to light; by the form, portability, and convenience of the lamp
                    itself; and by the simplicity and economy of its construction, regard being had
                    to efficiency. The chief points to consider in connexion with the structure of
                    lamps are (1) the means of supplying oil to the burner and of regulating that
                    supply, (2) the form and arrangement of the wick or medium over which the flame
                    is supported, (3) the regulation and control of the currents of air in the lamp
                    which support combustion, and (4) the position of the oil reservoir in relation
                    to the dissemination of the light and the stability of the lamp itself.</p>
                <p>The simple form which was used down to the end of the 18th century, and which as
                    a “cruisie” continued in common use in Scotland till the middle of this century,
                    illustrates the most elementary and most imperfect arrangement of a limp. Here,
                    as in the lamps of antiquity, the oil vessel lies immediately behind the burning
                    point of the wick, with which the oil is about level when the reservoir is full.
                    The wick is a round soft cord or fibrous mass. Such a lamp has no merit but
                    simplicity. The light is thrown only forward and to the sides, the back being
                    entirely in shadow. The wick, being a round solid mass, takes up oil equally at
                    the centre and circumference; but to the outer edges of the flame only is there
                    any access of air; consequently combustion in the centre is imperfect, resulting
                    in a smoky unsteady flame, and a discharge into the atmosphere of the acrid
                    products of destructive distillation. Further, as the level of the oil sinks in
                    the reservoir, the wick has to feed the flame from a greater distance by mere
                    capillary force, and, the supply thus diminishing, the light decreases in
                    proportion.</p>
                <p>Since the time when inventors first began to better the primitive lamp, just one
                    hundred years ago, the improvements in lamp construction have been enormous; the
                    forms and modifications of invention bearing on lamps have been innumerable, and
                    many excellent devices which did good service have been superseded by others
                    simpler and more efficient. Notice can here be taken only of such inventions as
                    developed new principles and features of originality.</p>
                <p>The first improvement was in wicks and burners. In 1783 Leger of Paris devised a
                    flat band or ribbon wick and burner, which produced a broad thin flame with no
                    core, so that all parts of the oil supply were brought into intimate contact
                    with the air, and perfect combustion and a steady flame were secured. The
                    deficiencies of the flat wick flame were that the light was comparatively thin
                    and impoverished, and that the parts of a room facing the thin ends of the flame
                    were badly illuminated. To some extent these evils were overcome by the adoption
                    of a curved form of burner, which in the end led up to the burner invented by
                    Ami Argand of Paris, and patented in England in 1784. In its simplest form the
                    Argand burner consists of two concentric tubes or cylinders, between which the
                    tubular wick is contained. The inner tube is open throughout, and to it a
                    current of air passes from below, and, being carried upwards by the draught of
                    the flame, atmospheric oxygen for combustion is supplied as well to the inner
                    circumference as to the outer side of the flame, whence the name “double current
                    burner” which it frequently receives. An adequate and controllable flow of air
                    to the interior of the Argand burner having been secured, it remained to devise
                    some means by which the current supplied to the outer circumference of the flame
                    could be strengthened and regulated. This Argand secured by means of a chimney,
                    which was made at first of sheet iron and suspended over the flame; but that
                    device was quickly abandoned in favour of a glass chimney which rested on a
                    perforated gallery placed a little below the level of the burner. Subsequent
                    experience suggested the formation of a shoulder or constriction on the chimney
                    at a point a little above the level of the flame, whereby the air current is
                    directed inward against the external surface of the flame, thus materially
                    improving the combustion. Argand’s original burner is the parent form of
                    innumerable modifications all more or less complex in their adaptations.</p>
                <p>A typical example of the burner and chimney is represented in fig. 1, in which
                    the burner is composed of three tubes, d, f, g. The tube g is soldered to the
                    bottom of the tube d, just above o, and the interval between the outer surface
                    of the tube g and the inner surface of the tube d is an annular cylindrical
                    cavity closed at bottom, containing the cylindrical cotton wick immersed in oil.
                    The wick is fixed to the wick tube ki, which is capable of being moved spirally;
                    within the annular cavity is also the tube f, which is capable of being moved
                    round, and serves to elevate and depress the wick. P is a cup that screws on the
                    bottom of the tube d, and serves to receive the superfluous oil that drops down
                    from the wick along the inner surface of the tube g. The air enters through the
                    holes o, o, and passes up through the tube g to maintain the combustion in the
                    interior of the circular flame. The air which maintains the combustion on the
                    exterior part of the wick enters through the holes w, with which rn is
                    perforated. When the air in the chimney is rarefied by the heat of the flame,
                    the surrounding heavier air, entering the lower part of the chimney, passes
                    upward with a rapid current, to restore the equilibrium. RG is the cylindrical
                    glass chimney with a shoulder or constriction at R, G. The oil flows from a side
                    reservoir, and occupies the cavity between the tubes g and d. The part ki is a
                    short tube, which receives the circular wick, and slides spirally on the tube g,
                    by means of a pin working in the hollow spiral groove on the exterior surface of
                    g. The wick-tube has also a catch, which works in a perpendicular slit in the
                    tubef; and, by turning the tube f, the wick-tube will be raised or lowered, for
                    which purpose a ring, or gallery, rn, fits on the tube d, and receives the glass
                    chimney RG; a wire S is attached to the tube f, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n257/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0257-0246"/> and, bending over, descends along the outside of
                    d. The part rn, that supports the glass chimney, is connected by four other
                    wires with the ring q, which surrounds the tube d, and can be moved round. When
                    m is turned round, it carries with it the ring q, the wire S, and the tube ∕,
                    and thereby produces elevation or depression of the wick.</p>
                <p>A device in the form of a small metallic disk or button, known as the Liverpool
                    button from having been first adopted in the so-called Liverpool lamp, effects
                    for the current of air passing up the interior of the Argand burner the same
                    object as the constriction of the chimney RG secures in the case of the external
                    tube. The button fixed on the end of a wire is placed right above the burner
                    tube g, and throws out equally all round against the flame the current of air
                    which passes up through g. The result of these expedients, when properly
                    applied, is the production of an exceedingly solid brilliant white light,
                    absolutely smokeless, this showing that the combustion of the oil is perfectly
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>The means by which a uniformly regulated supply of oil is brought to the burner
                    varies of course with the position of the oil reservoir. In some lamps, not now
                    in use, by ring-formed reservoirs and other expedients, the whole of the oil was
                    kept as nearly as possible at the level of the burner. In what are termed
                    fountain, reading, or study lamps, the principal reservoir is above the burner
                    level, and various means are adopted for maintaining a supply from them at the
                    level of the burner. But the most convenient position for the oil reservoir in
                    lamps for general use is directly under the burner, and in this case the stand
                    of the lamp itself is utilized as the oil vessel. In the case of fixed oils it
                    is necessary with such lamps to introduce some appliance for forcing a supply of
                    oil to the burner, and very many methods of effecting this have been devised,
                    most of which were ultimately superseded by the moderator lamp. The Carcel or
                    pump lamp, invented by Carcel in 1800, is still to some extent used in France.
                    It consisted of a double piston or pump, forcing the oil through a tube to the
                    burner, worked by ingenious clockwork arranged to go a certain number of
                    hours.</p>
                <p>An example of a form of reading lamp still in general use is seen in section in
                    fig. 2. The lamp is mounted on a standard on which it can be raised or lowered
                    at will, and fixed by a thumb screw. The oil reservoir is in two parts, the
                    upper ac being an inverted flask which fits into bb, from which the burner is
                    directly fed through the tube d; h is an overflow cup for any oil that escapes
                    at the burner, and it is pierced with air-holes for admitting the current of air
                    to the centre tube of the Argand burner. The lamp is filled with oil by
                    withdrawing the flask ac, filling it, and inverting it into its place. The under
                    reservoir bb fills from it to the burner level ee, on a line with the mouth of
                    ac. So soon as that level falls below the mouth of ac, a bubble of air gets
                    access to the upper reservoir, and oil again fills up bb to the level ee, and so
                    on it goes as long as combustion continues and the supply of oil in ac endures.
                    The principle is susceptible of numerous modifications.</p>
                <p>The moderator lamp (fig. 3), invented by Μ. Franchot about 1836, from the
                    simplicity and efficiency of its arrangements rapidly superseded almost all
                    other forms of mechanical lamp. The two essential features of the moderator lamp
                    are (1) the strong spiral spring which, acting on a piston within the
                    cylindrical reservoir of the lamp, serves to propel the oil to the burner, and
                    (2) the ascending tube C through which the oil passes upwards to the burner. The
                    latter consist of two sections, the lower fixed to and passing through the
                    piston A into the oil reservoir, and the upper attached to the burner. The lower
                    or piston section moves within the upper, which forms a sheath enclosing nearly
                    its whole length when the spring is fully wound up. Down the centre of the upper
                    tube passes a wire, “the moderator,” G, and it is by this wire that the supply
                    of oil to the burner is regulated. The spring exerts its greatest force on the
                    oil in the reservoir when it is fully wound up, and in proportion as it expands
                    and descends its power decreases. But when the apparatus is wound. up the wire
                    passing down the upper tube extends throughout the whole length of the lower and
                    narrower piston tube, obstructing to a certain extent the free flow of the oil.
                    In proportion as the spring uncoils, the length of the wire within the lower
                    tube is decreased; the upward flow of oil is facilitated in the same ratio as
                    the force urging it upwards is weakened. In all mechanical lamps the flow is in
                    excess of the consuming capacity of the burner, and in the moderator the surplus
                    oil, flowing over the wick, falls back into the reservoir above the piston,
                    whence along with new supply oil it descends into the lower side by means of
                    leather valves a, a. B represents the rack which, with the pinion D, winds up
                    the spiral spring hard against E when the lamp is prepared for use. The
                    moderator wire is seen separately in GtG; and FGÙ illustrates the arrangement of
                    the sheathing tubes, in the upper section of which the moderator is fixed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lamps for Mineral Oils. —</hi> At an early period numerous
                    attempts were made to utilize the highly inflammable volatile hydrocarbons and
                    alcohols, which from their cheapness and abundance offered some hope of
                    competing with the fixed oils then in universal use for illuminating purposes.
                    These lamps had little success, and no small danger accompanied their limited
                    use. The Vesta lamp of Young, introduced in 1834 for burning spirit of
                    turpentine under the name of camphine, procured a smokeless flame by means of
                    the Argand burner, constricted chimney, and Liverpool button, with the access of
                    abundant air. It was not, however, till the introduction of paraffin oils and
                    petroleum that mineral oil lamps became of great importance. Lamp makers had not
                    to direct their attention to mechanical arrangements, for mineral oils rise
                    abundantly by capillarity alone; the problem was to produce a sufficiently
                    powerful current of air to ensure complete and smokeless combustion of these
                    richly carbonaceous compounds, and, in view of the highly volatile nature of the
                    liquids dealt with, to prevent their exposure to the air, and more particularly
                    to prevent the heating of the oil reservoir which would generate explosive
                    mixtures, or vapours of dangerous tension.</p>
                <p>Mineral oil lamps, like those for fixed oils, are constructed with both circular
                    or tubular and flat-wick burners. In the case of the latter a cone or brass cap
                    is placed over the burner, having a slit or opening a little longer and wider
                    than the wick-holder itself. This cone serves to direct the whole current of air
                    which enters below against the surface of the flame, and mingling with the
                    vapour of the oil produces perfect combustion, with a white flame which rises
                    over the slit in the cone. The cool air current entering under the cone is also
                    beneficially utilized in preventing the undue heating of the oil reservoir and
                    the metallic wick-holder which passes down into it.</p>
                <p>These flat wick lamps are simple in construction, cheap, and, so far as they go,
                    economical light producers, but their flame is thin, and it is not practicable
                    to compensate for the thinness by increased breadth of wick, because in such a
                    case the edges of the light come so near the chimney that at these points the
                    glass becomes rapidly heated, causing unequal expansion and destruction of the
                    chimney. In 1865 Messrs James &amp; Joseph Hinks of Birmingham secured a patent
                    for improvements in the burners of mineral oil lamps, “whereby two or more flat
                    flames or one circular or nearly circular flame may be produced by the use of
                    two or more single flat wicks.” Under this patent was manufactured their
                    well-known duplex lamp, which has gone far to supersede all other forms.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n258/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0258-0247"/>
                <p>An improved form of their lamp is shown in fig. 4, in which a portion of the cone
                    B is removed to show the two parallel flat wicks A, A, which have each a
                    separate slit or opening in the cone. C is the coincident winder for raising or
                    lowering the wicks in the tubes, by which the wicks can be moved separately or
                    simultaneously as desired. D is a lever for raising the extinguishers E, whereby
                    not only is the light instantly extinguished, but the wicks are also covered and
                    protected from dirt, while all evaporation by the wick-holder is prevented.
                    Messrs Hinks &amp; Son have further devised an automatic lighting attachment
                    which obviates the necessity of raising the glass chimney for lighting the
                    lamp.</p>
                <p>Messrs Hinks claimed in their 1865 patent the use of “two or more flat flames,”
                    and since that period numerous burners have been produced in foreign countries
                    in which more than two flat wicks are used. The crown burner of Brünner in
                    Vienna contains no less than six flat wicks. There are triplex burners, too, in
                    which the wicks are arranged as a triangle; a most valuable lamp of this
                    construction is the “Hesperus” of Messrs Jones &amp; Willis of Birmingham.
                    Another form, the triplexicon, has three burners so closely placed together that
                    the flames coalesce into a solid flame about half an inch in thickness. Further,
                    there are star-shaped and cruciform burners, and others of little practical
                    value.</p>
                <p>The circular or tubular burners for mineral oils have been much simplified from
                    the forms necessary in the case of colza, &amp;c. A tubular wick is no longer
                    required; a simple flat wick of a size that will allow its edges exactly to meet
                    round the upper edge of the burner ring is used instead. In the form shown in
                    fig. 5 the wickholder and burner consists of a hollow truncated cone, with a
                    vertical conical section removed from its side. The flat wick passes up through
                    this cone, its edges meeting and forming in effect a circular wick at the top,
                    while the central current of air gets ready access to the tube by the conical
                    opening formed in its side, and the outer current passes up within the chimney
                    walls as usual. This form also is easily susceptible of numerous modifications.
                    (J. PA. )</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ancient Lamps.—</hi> Though Athenaeus states (xv. 700) that the
                    lamp (λύχνο?) was not an ancient invention in Greece, it had come into general
                    use there for domestic purposes by the 4th century B.C., and no doubt had long
                    before been employed for temples or other places where a permanent light was
                    required in room of the torch of Homeric times. Herodotus (ii. 62) sees nothing
                    strange in the “festival of lamps,” Lychnokaie, which was held at Sais in Egypt,
                    except in the vast number of them. Each was filled with oil so as to burn the
                    whole night. Again he speaks of evening as the time of lamps (τrεpi λύχνων, vii.
                    215). Still, the scarcity of lamps in a style anything like that of an early
                    period, compared with the immense number of them from the late Greek and Roman
                    age, seems to justify the remark of Athenaeus. The commonest sort of domestic
                    lamps were of terra-cotta and of the shape seen in figs. 6 and 7, with a spout
                    or nozzle <hi rend="italic">(μυκτήρ)</hi> in which the wick <hi rend="italic"
                    >(θρυαλλiς)</hi> burned, a round hole on the top to pour in oil by, and a handle
                    to carry the lamp with. A lamp with two or more spouts was <hi rend="italic"
                    >8lμυξoς,</hi><hi rend="italic">τρίμυξος,</hi> &lt;fcc., but these terms would
                    not apply strictly to the large class of lamps with numerous holes for wicks but
                    without nozzles. Decoration was confined to the front of the handle, or more
                    commonly to the circular space on the top of the lamp, and it consisted almost
                    always of a design in relief, taken from mythology or legend, from objects of
                    daily life or scenes such as displays of gladiators or chariot races, from
                    animals and the chase. A lamp in the British Museum has a view of the interior
                    of a Roman circus with spectators looking on at a chariot race. In other cases
                    the lamp is made altogether of a fantastic shape, as in the form of an animal, a
                    bull’s head, or a human foot. Naturally colour was excluded from the
                    ornamentation except in the form of a red or black glaze, which would resist the
                    heat. The typical form of hand lamp (figs. 6, 7) is a combination of the
                    flatness necessary for carrying steady and remaining steady when set down, with
                    the roundness evolved from the working in clay and characteristic of vessels in
                    that material. In the bronze lamps this same type is retained, though the
                    roundness was less in keeping with metal. Fanciful shapes are equally common in
                    bronze. The standard form of handle consists of a ring for the fore finger and
                    above it a kind of palmette for the thumb to press on to keep the lamp steady.
                    Instead of the palmette is sometimes a crescent, no doubt in allusion to the
                    moon. It would only be with bronze lamps that the cover protecting the flame
                    from the wind could be used, as was the case out of doors in Athens. Such a lamp
                    was in fact a lantern. Apparently it was to the lantern that the Greek word <hi
                    rend="italic">lampas,</hi> a torch, was first transferred, probably from a
                    custom of having guards to protect the torches also. Afterwards it came to be
                    employed for the lamp itself (λύχνο?, <hi rend="italic">lucerna).</hi> When
                    Juvenal <hi rend="italic">(Sat.,</hi> iii. 277) speaks of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aenea lampas,</hi> he may mean a torch with a bronze handle, but more probably
                    either a lamp or a lantern. Lamps used for suspension were mostly of bronze, and
                    in such cases the decoration was necessarily on the under part, so as to be seen
                    from below. Of this the best example is the lamp at Cortona, found there in 1840
                    (engraved, <hi rend="italic">Monumenti</hi><hi rend="italic">d. Inst.
                    Arch.,</hi> iii. pls. 41, 42, and in Dennis, <hi rend="italic">Cities and
                    Cemeteries of Etruria,</hi> 2d ed., ii. p. 403).</p>
                <p>It is set round with sixteen nozzles ornamented alternately with a siren and a
                    satyr playing on a double flute. Between each pair of nozzles is a head of a
                    river god, and on the bottom of the lamp is a large mask of Medusa, surrounded
                    by bands of animals. These designs are in relief, and the workmanship, which
                    appears to belong to the beginning of the 5th century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.,</hi> justifies the esteem in which Etruscan lamps were held in antiquity
                    (Athenaeus, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n259/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0259-0248"/> XV. 700). Of a later but still excellent style is
                    a bronze lamp in the British Museum found in the baths of Julian in Paris (figs.
                    8, 9, 10). The chain is attached by means of two dolphins very artistically
                    combined. Under the nozzles are heads of Pan (fig. 8); and from the sides
                    project the foreparts of lions (fig. 10). To what extent lamps may have been
                    used in temples is unknown. Probably the Erechtheum on the acropolis of Athens
                    was an exception in having a gold one kept burning day and night, just as this
                    lamp itself must have been an exception in its artistic merits. It was the work
                    of the sculptor Callimachus, and was made apparently for the newly rebuilt
                    temple a little before 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> When once filled with
                    oil and lit it burned continuously for a whole year. The wick was of a fine flax
                    called Carpasian (now understood to have been a kind of cotton), which proved to
                    be the least combustible of all flιx (Pausanias, i. 26, 7). Above the lamp a
                    palm tree of bronze rose to the roof for the purpose of carrying off the fumes.
                    But how this was managed it is not easy to determine unless the palm be supposed
                    to have been inverted and to have hung above the lamp spread out like a
                    reflector, for which purpose the polished bronze would have served fairly well.
                    The stem if left hollow would collect the fumes and carry them out through the
                    roof. This lamp was refilled on exactly the same day each year, so that there
                    seems to have been an idea of measuring time by it, such as may also have been
                    the case in regard to the lamp stand <hi rend="italic">(fvχveιov)</hi> capable
                    of holding as many lamps as there were days of the year, which Dionysius the
                    Sicilian tyrant placed in the Prytaneum of Tarentum. At Pharae in Achaia there
                    was in the market-place an oracular statue of Hermes with a marble altar before
                    it to which bronze lamps were attached by means of lead. Whoever desired to
                    consult the statue went there in the evening and first filled the lamps and lit
                    them, placing also a bronze coin on the altar. A similar custom prevailed at the
                    oracle of Apis in Egypt, Pausanias adds (vii. 22, 2). At Argos he speaks of a
                    chasm into which it was a local custom continued to his time to let down burning
                    lamps, with some reference to the goddess of the lower world, Persephone (ii.
                    22, 4). At Cnidus a large number of terra-cotta lamps were found crowded in one
                    place a little distance below the surface, and it was conjectured that there
                    must have been there some statue or altar at which it had been a custom to leave
                    lamps burning at night (Newton, <hi rend="italic">Discoveries at
                    Halicarnassus,</hi> &amp;c., ii. p. 394). These lamps are of terra-cotta, but
                    with little ornamentation, and so like each other in workmanship that they must
                    all have come from one pottery, and may have been all brought to the spot where
                    they were found on one occasion, probably the funeral of a person with many
                    friends, or the celebration of a festival in his honour, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">parentalia</hi> among the Romans, to maintain which it was a
                    common custom to bequeath property. For example, a marble slab in the British
                    Museum has a Latin inscription describing the property which had been left to
                    provide among other things that a lighted lamp with incense on it should be
                    placed at the tomb of the deceased on the kalends, nones, and ides of each month
                    <hi rend="italic">{Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">Marbles,</hi> v., pl. 8, fig. 2).
                    For birthday presents terracotta lamps appear to have been frequently employed,
                    the device generally being that of two figures of victory holding between them a
                    disk inscribed with a good wish for the new year :— <hi rend="smallcaps">annv
                    nov favstv</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">felix.</hi> This is the inscription on a
                    lamp in the British Museum, which besides the victories has among other symbols
                    a disk with the head of Janus. As the torch gave way to the lamp in fact, so
                    also it gave way in mythology. In the earlier myths, as in that of Demeter, it
                    is a torch with which she goes forth to search for her daughter, but in the late
                    myth of Cupid and Psyche it is an oil lamp which Psyche carries, and from which
                    to her grief a drop of hot oil falls on Cupid and awakes him. Terra-cotta lamps
                    have very frequently the name of the maker stamped on the foot. Clay moulds from
                    which the lamps were made exist in considerable numbers. <hi rend="smallcaps"
