                    (1800-1876), an eminent Orientalist, was born on October 22,1800, at Bergen in
                    Norway. Having received his first university education at Christiania, he went
                    to Germany, and continued his philological studies at Heidelberg and Bonn. The
                    latter university, though only founded a few years previously (in 1818), had
                    already become one of the chief centres of Oriental studies. The lectures of A.
                    W. von Schlegel, the distinguished critic and leader of the German Romantic
                    school, who shares with F. Bopp the honour of having founded the critical school
                    of Sanskrit philology, were especially attractive to the young Norwegian, and
                    determined him henceforth to devote his energies chiefly to the exploration of
                    the newly-opened mine of Indian literature. Having acquired a sound knowledge of
                    Sanskrit, he spent three years in Paris and London, engaged in copying and
                    collating MSS., and collecting materials for future research, especially in
                    reference to the Hindu drama and philosophy. During this period he published,
                    jointly with E. Burnouf, his first work, <hi rend="italic">Essai sur le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pali</hi> (Paris, 1826). On his return to Bonn he studied Arabic,
                    for some time, under Freytag, and took the degree of Ph,D., his dissertation
                    discussing the Arabic notices of the geography of the Punjab <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Commentatio geographica atque historica de Pentapotamia Indica,</hi> Bonn,
                    1827). Soon after he was admitted privatdocent, and entered on his academical
                    career with ah inaugural dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Taprobane</hi><hi rend="italic">insula.</hi> In 1830 he was appointed
                    “extraordinary” and in 1840 “ordinary” professor to the newly-created chair of
                    Old Indian language and literature, Schlegel continuing to hold (till his death
                    in 1845) the chair of history. In spite of a tempting offer of the Sanskrit
                    chair at Copenhagen, in 1841, Lassen remained faithful to the university of his
                    adoption to the end of his life. He died at Bonn on May 8, 1876, having been
                    affected with almost total blindness for many years. As early as 1864 he was
                    relieved of the duty of lecturing.</p>
                <p>The numerous works and essays published by Lassen during half a century of
                    unremitting labour, cover a wide field of Oriental research, and afford ample
                    evidence of the thorough accuracy of his scholarship and the comprehensiveness
                    of his learning. In 1829-31 he brought out, in conjunction with Schlegel, a
                    critical annotated edition of the Hitopαdesα, the now well-known manual of
                    political ethics in the form of fables, interspersed with moral maxims. The
                    appearance of this edition marks the starting-point of the critical study of the
                    Sanskrit literature. At the same time Lassen assisted his teacher and friend in
                    editing and translating the first two cantos of the epic Râmâyana (1829-38). In
                    1832 he brought out the text of the first act of Bhavabhûti’s drama,
                    Mâlatîrnâdhava, and a complete edition, with a Latin translation, of the
                    Sânkhya-kârikâ, one of the chief works of the Sânkhya philosophy. In 1837
                    followed his edition and translation of Jayadeva’s charming lyrical drama,
                    Gitagovinda, and his Institutiones linguae Pracritieae, which still forms the
                    standard work on the popular dialects of the Indian dramas. His Anthologia
                    Sanscritica, which came out the following year, contained several hitherto
                    unpublished texts, and did much to stimulate the study of Sanskrit in German
                    universities, where, indeed, it continues to be used, new editions of it having
                    been published by Gildemeister in 1865 and 1868. In 1845 Lassen brought out a
                    new and improved edition of Schlegel’s text and translation of the famous
                    philosophical episode ofthe Mahdbhdrata, the “Bhagavadgîtâ.” He did not,
                    however, confine himself to the study of Indian languages, but acted likewise as
                    a scientific pioneer in other fields of philological inquiry. In his Beiträge
                    zur Deutung der Eugubinischen Tafeln (1833), he prepared the way for the correct
                    interpretation of the Umbrian inscriptions; and the Zeitschrift fur die Kunde
                    des Morgenlandes (7 vols., 1837-50), started and conducted by him,— the first
                    three volumes in conjunction with Ewald and Rodiger,— contains, among other
                    valuable papers from his pen, grammatical sketches of the Beluchi and Brahui
                    languages, and an essay on the Lycian inscriptions. Soon after the appearance of
                    Burnouf’s Commentaire sur le Yaçna (1833), Lassen also directed his attention to
                    the Zend, and to Iranian studies generally; and in his work Die altpersischen
                    Keilinschriften von Persepolis (1836) he first made known the true character of
                    the Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions, thereby anticipating, by one month,
                    Bumoufs Mémoire on the same subject, while Major (Sir Henry) Rawlinson’s famous
                    memoir on the Behistun inscription, though drawn up in Persia, independently of
                    contemporaneous European research, at about the same time, did not reach the
                    Royal Asiatic Society until three years later. Subsequently Lassen published, in
                    the sixth volume of his <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n340/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0340-0323"/> journal (1845), a complete collection of all the
                    Old Persian cuneiform inscriptions known up to that date. He also was the first
                    scholar in Europe who took up, with signal success, the decipherment of the
                    newly-discovered Bactrian coins, which furnished him the materials for his
                    important essay, Zur Geschichte der griechischen und indo-scylhischen Könige in
                    Baktrien, Kabul, und Indien (1838). He likewise contemplated bringing out a
                    critical edition of the Vendidad; but, after publishing the first five fargards
                    (1852), he felt that his whole energies were required for the successful
                    accomplishment of the great undertaking of his life, with which his name will
                    always be inseparably connected—his Indische Alterthumskunde. In this
                    work—completed in four volumes, published respectively in 1847 (2d ed., 1867),
                    1849 (2d ed., 1874), 1858, and 1861—which forms one of the greatest monuments of
                    untiring industry and critical scholarship, everything that could be gathered
                    from native and foreign sources, relative to the political, social, and
                    intellectual development of India, from the earliest times down to Mohammedan
                    invasion, was worked up by him into a connected historical account. Only those
                    acquainted with Indian history and literature, where nothing is fixed, can
                    realize the enormous difficulty of the task; but in spite of much that may turn
                    out to be erroneous, and in spite of still more that is, and from the nature of
                    the subject must always be, uncertain and hypothetical, there can be no doubt
                    that Lassen has laid in this work a solid foundation for future Indian
                    historical and antiquarian research.</p>
