                <p><label type="entry">LIQUOR LAWS</label> may be divided into the three great
                    systems of free trade, restriction, and prohibition. The system of free trade
                    may mean either that no special licence is required by law for carrying on a
                    traffic in intoxicating liquors, or that such a licence is required, but that
                    the licensing authority is bound to grant it in every case in which certain
                    conditions are complied with. Wherever the determination of these conditions
                    involves an appeal to the discretion of the licensing authority, the system of
                    free trade tends to pass into the system of restriction. For practical purposes
                    it does not matter much whether the law says, “every man of good character is
                    entitled to a licence for a properly constructed house in a suitable locality,”
                    or “the magistrate must consider the character of the applicant and of the
                    premises, but is not bound to give reasons for his decision.” But wherever the
                    applicant can submit to a court capable of dealing with evidence the question of
                    fact whether he has fulfilled certain conditions defined by law, the system of
                    free trade may be said in theory to exist Wherever, on the other hand, the law
                    distinctly affirms an absolute discretion in the magistrate, or lays down a
                    positive principle, such as the “normal number” or the fixed proportion between
                    public-houses and population, the system is properly described as restriction,
                    or monopoly. This system, again, in its extreme form, tends to pass into one of
                    prohibition. Under one of the alternative plans permitted by the Swedish
                    licensing law of 1855, generally known as the Gothenburg plan, the municipality
                    begins by the partial, and advances to the total, prohibition of liquor traffic,
                    except by servants of the municipality; and this plan is sometimes advocated
                    merely as a step towards the suppression of all trade in liquor. In nearly all
                    countries the nature of the trade carried on in public-houses has subjected them
                    to a much more rigorous police supervision than ordinary trades. All trades,
                    however, must be carried on under the conditions required by the public comfort
                    and safety; and to give unlimited licence in such matters to publicans would be
                    to violate social rights not inferior to freedom of industry and trade.</p>
                <p>Of recent years there has been a considerable increase in the amount of
                    drunkenness in Europe generally. There are no means of determining the law of
                    the increase by reliable statistics, but it seems probable that the increase is
                    confined to the large towns and to the lowest classes. There has also been of
                    late, both in the United Kingdom and on the Continent, a very earnest and
                    animated discussion on the policy and results of the various systems of liquor
                    law. It cannot be said that so far any decisive experience has been adduced on
                    the subject. In fact the legislation of Europe is in a very uneasy and changeful
                    state. Thus, prior to the federal constitution of 1874, the cantons of
                    Switzerland were in the habit of directing the municipal authorities to observe
                    a certain proportion between the number of licences and the population. The new
                    constitution, however, laid down the general principle of free trade, and the
                    federal council intimated to the various cantons that it was no longer lawful to
                    refuse a licence on the ground that there was no public need of it. In the
                    previous year precisely the opposite change took place in Denmark. The licence
                    system rested on the law of 29th December 1857, but this was modified by the law
                    of 23d May 1873, which increased the conditions to be fulfilled by those
                    applying for a licence, and conferred upon the communal authorities the power of
                    fixing the maximum number of licences to be granted. Similarly, in France, the
                    liquor law rests upon the decree of 1851, but public opinion is turning against
                    the absolute discretion reposed in the administrative authority, and the law
                    proposed by M. de Gasté and approved of by the chamber of deputies on 22d March
                    1878 will probably lead to a system of greater freedom. In the German empire the
                    various states are still permitted by a law of the confederation, dated 21st
                    June 1869, to restrict the issue of licences to what the public seem to require,
                    but except in Wiirtemberg this permission seems not to have been used. In
                    Austria the rapid growth of drunkenness in Galicia made necessary the severe
                    police law of 19th July 1877, but in other parts of the empire the exceptionally
                    lenient law of 20th December 1859 seems to be considered sufficient. In the
                    midst of so many fluctuations of opinion, the practical questions of legislation
                    must be decided on general principles and not by experimental evidence. Those
                    who speak and write on the reform of the liquor laws are divided into two great
                    classes—(1) the nephalists, who consider alcohol, in every form, whether in
                    distilled or in fermented liquors, to be poison, and therefore wish the sale of
                    it to be entirely suppressed; (2) those who see no objection to moderate
                    drinking, especially of the less alcoholic beverages, or at least regard the
                    idea of suppression as an impracticable chimaera. In the United Kingdom the
                    nephalists are at present agitating for Sir Wilfrid Lawson’s Permissive Bill,
                    which has latterly taken the form of a local option resolution. This means that
                    in each burgh or parish two-thirds of the ratepayers may decide that no licences
                    shall be given, a vote to be taken on the subject every three years. On 17th
                    March 1879 the select committee of the House of Lords on intemperance reported
                    emphatically against the scheme of the Permissive Bill. The committee did not
                    examine witnesses from the United States with respect to the experiments in
                    prohibition which have been made there on a large scale; but it is generally
                    admitted that the Maine Liquor Law has succeeded only in villages and rural
                    districts; in towns it has failed. So also the Michigan Law, prohibiting the
                    sale of liquor except for medicinal or mechanical purposes, was condemned after
                    twenty years’ experience; and in 1875 a licence tax was imposed on dealers in
                    liquor.</p>
                <p>The result is the same under those celebrated “local option laws” which are in
                    force in some of the United States. These laws proceed from the legislatures of
                    the various States. They sometimes take the form of a general prohibition of the
                    sale of intoxicants, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n712/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0712-0689"/> subject to a vote of the inhabitants in each
                    township or county, but more frequently they merely provide in general terms for
                    the issue of licences in the usual way, unless the local constituency shall
                    otherwise determine. Such laws are in force in Massachusetts, New Jersey (which
                    had the Chatham Local Option Law of 1871), New Hampshire, Connecticut, and
                    Vermont. But whether they are constitutional or not is a matter· of serious
                    controversy in the courts of the United States. On the one hand, it is said that
                    such a law amounts to a delegation by the State of its legislative power, —that
                    it leaves the hands of the State and general assembly in an unfinished state,
                    commanding nothing, prohibiting nothing. On the other hand, it is said this is a
                    police regulation, which is properly entrusted to county commissioners, or
                    boards of select men for the protection of the health and morals of the
                    localities over which they preside; and it is quite competent for a State to
                    make a law delegating the power to determine some fact or state of things, upon
                    which the law makes, or intends to make, its own action depend. In the case of
                    the States already mentioned the constitutional character of the local option
                    law has been upheld by decision, but in the cases of Delaware, Texas, Indiana,
                    California (Wall’s Case), Iowa, and Pennsylvania, it has been denied. The
                    question has also been raised in the American courts whether in the case of
                    intoxicants being imported from one State to another a local option law, which
                    prohibits the sale of the imported goods, does not violate the freedom of
                    commerce which is guaranteed to all the States by the American
                    Constitution.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Cooley, <hi rend="italic">On Constitutional Limitations,</hi> and <hi

                    prohibit indirectly by raising enormously the licence fee. The subject is
                    frequently before the courts, and it is decided that where the licensing power
                    is given for revenue purposes there is no limit to the discretion of the
                    licensing authority, but where it is given for purposes of regulation the fee
                    should not exceed the expense of issuing the licence and inspecting and
                    regulating the licensed trade.</p></note></p>
                <p>Among those who are not nephalists a variety of schemes has been suggested. A
                    small minority are in favour of free trade subject to certain conditions. An
                    experiment of this kind was tried by the Liverpool magistrates in 1853. “The
                    premises were to be of high rateable value; the excise duty was to be greatly
                    increased; the licencee was invariably to reside on the premises; and a special
                    police for the inspection of licensing houses was to be provided.” These
                    conditions being complied with, no licence was refused. This experiment was made
                    the subject of inquiry by Mr Villier’s select committee of 1854. That committee,
                    which included Sir George Grey and Lord Sherbrooke (Mr Lowe), reported
                    unanimously in its favour. A similar experiment) was made in Liverpool during
                    the years 1862-66 without evil results, and also since 1862 in the Prescot
                    division of the county of Lancashire. On the Continent the only countries where
                    free trade prevails are Belgium, Holland, Greece, Spain, and Roumania. In
                    certain parts of Bavaria communes possess breweries, the produce of which they
                    are by custom entitled to sell without any licence; and thσ Rhenish Palatinate
                    has never been subject to the restrictions mentioned below which apply to the
                    rest of the empire. In Belgium licences are unknown. The only tax which the
                    publican pays is the “patent” which is paid by every trade. So strong is the
                    general law in Belgium that in 1866, when the municipal authorities of Antwerp
                    issued a regulation prohibiting the sale of alcoholic drinks in the streets,
                    this was held to be illegal by the court of cassation. The Dutch law is the same
                    as in Belgium. It must not be supposed, however, that the Dutch are satisfied
                    with the present law. The Dutch “society for total abstinence from strong drink”
                    is very active; and in 1880 the Government presented to the lower chamber a
                    bill, introducing a licence and also the principle of the normal number, the
                    proportion of licences to population varying according to the total population
                    of towns. In Belgium the <hi rend="italic">Associatiojι</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >contre l’abus des boissons alcooliques</hi> is endeavouring to secure
                    amendments of the law, chiefly of a fiscal and police character, but the
                    introduction of the licence is not suggested. In Germany, with the ex ception of
                    Würtemberg and those places where the licence is unknown, the liquor trade is
                    practically free. The law of 1869 declares that a licence can be refused for two
                    reasons only—if the police condemn the structure or situation of the premises,
                    or if the applicant is likely to encourage drunkenness, gaming, reset of theft,
                    or improper meetings. This system may be contrasted with those of Italy and
                    Russia. In Italy, under the law of 20th March 1865, a licence is obtained from
                    the sub-prefect or <hi rend="italic">autoritα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >politica</hi><hi rend="italic">del circondario</hi> on the demand of the syndic
                    <hi rend="italic">(sindacd)</hi> of the commune and after consulting with the
                    municipal <hi rend="italic">giunta.</hi> In Russia, under the decree of 1861 and
                    the communal law of 28th June 1870, the licence is got from the municipal or
                    communal council, or, in certain cases, from the owners of land, especially
                    church land. In both countries the licensing authorities have unlimited
                    discretion, which they have exercised so as to multiply
                    public-houses&gt;,enormously. Assuming that sufficient guarantees can be got for
                    the respectability of the applicant and the good sanitary condition of his
                    premises, the system of free trade, or of unrestricted licensing on defined
                    conditions, is the only one which can be defended on principle. It is impossible
                    for the magistrates to exercise a just discretion in deciding what public-houses
                    are required for a locality. The fact that an applicant has invested capital in
                    the business and is ready to begin is the best evidence that there is a demand
                    to be supplied. There is, however, no prospect of free trade being established
                    in the United Kingdom. The select committee of 1879 reported against it.</p>
                <p>A larger number of licensing reformers support the scheme for introducing the
                    “normal number” to the United Kingdom. This was embodied in the bills of Sir
                    Robert Anstruther and Sir Harcourt Johnstone (1876). No new licences were to be
                    granted till the number had been reduced to 1 in 500 of the population in towns,
                    and 1 in 300 in country districts. At present the proportion is 1 to 173 of the
                    population in towns in England and Wales. It seems impossible to determine any
                    such proportion <hi rend="italic">ab</hi><hi rend="italic">ante.</hi> Even were
                    it possible, the rough classification of towns by population, and the failure to
                    discriminate between various rural districts, would result in great injustice.
                    In Mr Cowen’s bill of 1877 and Lord Colin Campbell’s bill of 1882 it was
                    proposed to have in each locality a separate licensing board elected annually by
                    the ratepayers. This proposal sins against the recognized principle in the
                    reform of local government that authorities must be consolidated, not
                    multiplied. The select committee of 1879 suggested that the function of
                    licensing might be entrusted to the proposed representative county boards.</p>
                <p>Another scheme, which has the advantage of appealing to modern experience in
                    Europe, was contained in Sir Robert Anstruther’s bills of 1872 and 1874 and Mr
                    Chamberlain’s bill of 1877. These were all modifications of the Gothenburg
                    system, which Mr Carnegie, a Scotch brewer in Gothenburg, has done much to make
                    known in the United Kingdom. In Sweden, prior to 1855, there was absolute free
                    trade in liquor. The General Licensing Act, passed in that year, gave power to
                    local authorities, subject to confirmation by the provincial governor, to fix
                    annually the number of licences, and to sell them for three years on certain
                    conditions. If a company, or “bolag,” were formed for the purpose of taking all
                    the licences, the local authority might contract with the company for three
                    years. The Act did not apply to beer. The result of this Act has been twofold.
                    In rural districts almost no licences have been issued. In towns, on the other
                    hand, drinking has increased of late, and has led to the severe police laws of
                    18th September 1874 and 15th October 1875. In 1866 Gothenburg set the example of
                    transferring the whole public-house traffic to a bolag, which undertakes to
                    appropriate no profit <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n713/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0713-0690"/> from the business, but to conduct its
                    establishments in the interest of temperance and morality, and to pay over to
                    the municipality the profits made beyond a fair interest on capital. This
                    experiment has been a great financial success, and if developed will relieve the
                    town from the greater part of its local taxation. The example has been followed
                    by every town in Sweden having a population above 5000; and in 1877, after long
                    discussion, it was adopted in Stockholm, the capital, where the number of life
                    licences presented unusual difficulties. Mr Chamberlain proposed that the work
                    done by the Swedish bolag should be attempted by town councils in the United
                    Kingdom. For this purpose he asked power to acquire the freehold of all licensed
                    premises and the interests of the licence holders. The business would then be
                    carried on by the town council, the profits being carried to the credit of the
                    education and poor rates. The powers of the licensing justices would cease on
                    the adoption of the scheme by the town council. The select committee of 1879
                    recommended that legislative facilities should be given for the adoption of this
                    scheme. It is doubtful, however, if the burden would be generally submitted to,
                    except on the understanding that the local rates would <hi rend="italic">be
                    pro</hi><hi rend="italic">tanto</hi> diminished; and, were this realized, the
                    tendency would be to support the municipality on the liquor trade by extending
                    its operations.</p>
                <p>The great mass of opinion in the United Kingdom, however, seeks some modification
                    of the present licensing system. That system is extremely complicated. The
                    wholesale licences are granted by the excise without a magistrate’s certificate,
                    but for nearly all retail licences such a certificate is required. Generally,
                    the magistrates have absolute discretion as regards licences to sell <hi
                    rend="italic">οη</hi> the premises, but in England a licence to sell <hi
                    rend="italic">off</hi> the premises can be refused only for one or more of the
                    following reasons—no satisfactory evidence of good character, disorderly house,
                    previous forfeiture of licence by misconduct, want of legal qualification. The
                    English law is contained in the Wine and Beerhouse Act 1869, and the Licensing
                    Act 1872 and 1874.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&amp;
                    33 Vict. c. 27; 35 &amp; 36 Vict. c. 94; 37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 49.</p></note> The
                    great features of the legislation of 1872 were (1) the introduction of a
                    confirming authority (viz., the licensing committee in counties and the whole
                    magistrates in burghs) for the purpose of restricting the issue of new licences;
                    (2) the qualification of annual value in public-house premises for the purpose
                    of raising the character of those engaged in the trade; (3) the new regulations
                    for closing; (4) the new regulations of police penalties, especially with
                    reference to the endorsement of convictions on the licence and the forfeiture of
                    the licence. The Act of 1874 abolished the necessity of confirmation in the case
                    of “off” licences, gave the magistrates absolute discretion as regards the
                    endorsement of convictions, and removed from magistrates all discretion as
                    regards closing hours. There are not many peculiarities in the licensing law of
                    Ireland. Public-house licences are generally held by shopkeepers, and no
                    qualification of value is required except in the case of beerhouses. Mr Meldon’s
                    Act of 1877 (37 &amp; 38 Vict. c. 69) closed public-houses on Sunday. In
                    Scotland prior to 1853 licences were regulated by the Home-Drummond Act (9 Geo.
                    IV. c. 58), which authorized only one form of certificate for “common
                    inns.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>So also the first
                    English Act, 5 &amp; 6 Edw. VI., provided one form of licence for
                    “alehouses.”</p></note> In 1846 a select committee reported that the combination
                    of the grocer trade with the sale of spirits to be consumed on the premises was
                    productive of evil to the working classes. This led to the Forbes Mackenzie Act
                    of 1853, which was amended in 1862, upon the report of a royal commission in
                    1860 (16 &amp; 17 Vict. c. 67; 25 &amp; 26 Vict. c. 35). It created three
                    licences—(1) for hotels, (2) for public-houses, (3) grocers’ licences. Under the
                    hotel licence intoxicating liquors may be sold to lodgers and travellers. On
                    Sundays the public-houses are closed, and on week days the sale is practically
                    limited to the period between 8 A. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.</hi> and 11 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">p.m.</hi> Cameron’s Act of 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 26) makes
                    the refusal of a certificate by the magistrate final, and in the case of a new
                    licence requires the confirmation of a county licensing committee or in burghs
                    of a joint committee of magistrates and justices.</p>
                <p>Information on this subject is to be found chiefly in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reports of</hi> royal commissions and select committees. It has been much
                    discussed at the meetings of tue social Science Association, and there is a
                    large literature of pamphlets and magazine articles, to which, among many
                    others, Lord Sherbrooke, Mr Chamberlain, and Mr Arthur Arnold have contributed.
                    The reports of the various international congresses “pour l’étude des questions
                    relatives à l’alcoolisme,” may be studied with advantage. See also Metman’s <hi
