                <p><label type="entry">LOIRE</label> (Lat., <hi rend="italic">Liger),</hi> the first
                    of the rivers of France in length of course (626 miles) and extent of basin
                    (44,979 square miles), has its headwaters in the great central plateau, and is
                    considered to take its rise in the Gerbier de Jonc, in the department of
                    Ardèche, at a height of 4504 feet above the sea,—though the Allier branch, which
                    has its source about 30 miles west, in the department of Lozère, at the foot of
                    Maure de la Gardille, 4668 feet above the sea, has an almost equal course. The
                    two streams continue to run parallel till the upper Loire turns westward and is
                    joined by the Allier in the neighbourhood of Nevers. All the more important
                    affluents of the upper and middle part of the Loire—as the Cher, the Indre, the
                    Vienne, respectively 198,152, and 231 miles in length—have their gathering
                    grounds in the central plateau. In the north-east the basin of the Seine comes
                    so close (at one place to within 6 or 7 miles) that the versant towards the
                    Loire has hardly anything to contribute; and it is not till within 65 miles of
                    the estuary that we find an important tributary, the Maine, bringing down the
                    drainage of the Brittany plateau. At certain seasons the Loire is navigable for
                    ships as far as Nantes (33 miles), for boats as far as LaNoirie (other 518
                    miles), and for rafts as far as Retournac; but for six months of the year
                    navigation is practically impossible.</p>
                <p>In the volume of water there is all the irregularity of a mountain torrent; at
                    the Bee d’Allier, for instance,—the meeting point of the two head streams,—while
                    the maximum current is 353,200 cubic feet per second, the minimum is 10,600
                    cubic feet, and above Orleans the range lies between 31,800 and 850. During the
                    drought of summer thin and feeble streams thread their way between the sandbanks
                    of the channel; while at other times a stupendous flood pours down and submerges
                    wide reaches of land. In the middle part of its course the Loire traverses the
                    western portion of the undulating Paris basin, with its Tertiary marls, sands,
                    and clays, and the alluvium carried off from these renders its lower channel
                    inconstant; the rest of the drainage area is occupied by crystalline rocks, over
                    the hard surface of which the water, undiminished by absorption, flows rapidly
                    into the streams. A fall of from 3 to 4 inches over the whole river basin is
                    sufficient to pour 35,320,000,000 cubic feet of water into the channels. When
                    the rain is general over the whole area, the floods on the different tributaries
                    reach the main river at different times; but when, through any cause, two or
                    more of them arrive at the same time, inundations of the most serious character
                    result. Attempts to control the river must have begun at a very early date, and
                    by the close of the Middle Ages the bed between Orleans and Angers was enclosed
                    by dykes 10 to 13 feet high. In <pb break="no"

                    >turcies</hi> 23 feet high was completed from Bee d’Allier downwards. This great
                    work had, however, the serious defect that the channel was so much narrowed that
                    the embankments are almost certain to give wayas soon as the water rises 16 feet
                    (the average rise is about 14, and in 1846 it was more than 22). In ιnoremodern
                    times the importance of the water-wayfrom the sea to Nantes led to the embanking
                    of the lower part of the course; but instead of a depth of 16 feet being
                    secured, as the engineers anticipated, there is no more at full tide than 13
                    feet. One of the practical results of this state of matters has been the
                    commercial development of Saint Nazaire and Paimboeuf, and the comparative
                    decline of Nantes as a great shipping port. Besides the general embankments of
                    the river, several of the towns along the Loire have constructed special works
                    to defend themselves against the floods; Tours, the most exposed of all, is
                    surrounded by a circular dyke. Various schemes for the systematic regulation of
                    the Loire have been discussed. It has been proposed to construct in the upper
                    valleys of the several aflluents a number of gigantic dams or reservoirs from
                    which the water, stored during flood, could be let off into the river as
                    required. A reservoir of this kind, formed by the engineer Mathieu at the
                    village of Pinay, about 18 miles above Roanne, and capable of retaining from
                    3500 to 4500 million cubic feet of water, has greatly diminished the force of
                    the floods at Roanne, and maintained the comparative equilibrium of the current
                    during the dry season. There is a canal (157 miles) along the left bank of the
                    Loire between Roanne and Briare; and the Canal du Bern connects this with the
                    navigable part of the Cher. The Canal du Centre extends from Digoιn on the Loire
                    to Châlon on the Saône; the Canal du Nivernais and the canals starting from
                    Orleans and Briare communicate with the Seine; and the Nantes canal opens up the
                    way to Lorient, Brest, and Dinan. The canals of the Sauldre and the Dive (20 and
                    26 miles respectively) are mainly for irrigation purposes.</p>
