                    (1817-1878), a prolific and versatile writer, born in London in 1817, was a
                    grandson of Charles Lee Lewes, a comedian who had a considerable reputation in
                    his day. He was educated in London, Jersey, and Brittany, and began active life
                    by attempting business and afterwards medicine. Later he appears to have had
                    serious thoughts of making the stage his profession. He finally fixed his choice
                    on a literary career. His early writings belong mainly to the lighter
                    departments of letters. He contributed a large number of critical studies to the
                    leading quarterly and other reviews. These discuss a wide variety of subject,
                    and, though often characterized by hasty impulse and imperfect study, betray a
                    singularly acute critical judgment, which has been enlightened by philosophic
                    study. Of these critical writings the most valuable are those on the drama,
                    which were afterwards republished under the title <hi rend="italic">Actors and
                    Acting</hi> (1875). With this may be taken the volume on <hi rend="italic">The
                    Spanish Drama</hi> (1846). The combination of wide scholarship, philosophic
                    culture, and practical acquaintance with the theatre gives these essays a high
                    place among the best efforts in English dramatic criticism. In 1845-1846 he
                    published <hi rend="italic">The Biographical History of Philosophy,</hi> an
                    attempt to depict the life of philosophers as an ever-renewed fruitless labour
                    to attain the unattainable. In 1847-1848 he made two attempts in the field of
                    fiction— <hi rend="italic">Ranthrope,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rose, Blanche,
                    and Violet—</hi> which, though displaying considerable skill both in plot,
                    construction, and in characterization, have taken no permanent place in
                    literature. The same is to be said of an ingenious attempt to rehabilitate
                    Robespierre (1849). The culmination of the author’s work in prose literature is
                    the <hi rend="italic">Life of Goethe</hi> (1855), probably the best known of his
                    writings. Lewes’s many-sidedness of mind, and his combination of scientific with
                    literary tastes, eminently fitted him to appreciate the large nature and the
                    wide-ranging activity of the German poet. The high position this work has taken
                    in Germany itself, notwithstanding the boldness of its criticism and the
                    unpopularity of some of its views (e.y., on the relation of the second to the
                    first part of <hi rend="italic">Faustf</hi> is a sufficient testimony to its
                    general excellence. From about 1853 Lewes’s writings show that he was occupying
                    himself with scientific and more particularly biological work. He may be said to
                    have always manifested a distinctly scientific bent in his writings, and his
                    closer devotion to science was but thp following out of early impulses.
                    Considering the author’s want of the usual course of technical training, these
                    studies are a remarkable testimony to the penetration of his intellect. The most
                    important of these essays are collected in the volumes <hi rend="italic">Seaside
                    Studies</hi> (1858), <hi rend="italic">Physiology of Common Life</hi> (1859),
                    <hi rend="italic">Studies in Animal Life</hi> (1862), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristotle, a Chapter from the History of Science</hi> (1864). They are much
                    more than popular expositions of accepted scientific truths. They contain able
                    criticisms of authorized ideas, and embody the results of individual research
                    and individual reflexion. He struck out a number of impressive suggestions, some
                    of which have since been accepted by physiologists at home and abroad. Of these
                    the most valuable is that now known as the doctrine of the functional
                    indifference of the nerves—that what are known as the specific energies of the
                    optic, auditory, and other nerves are simply differences in their mode of action
                    due to the differences of the peripheral structures or sense-organs with which
                    they are connected. This idea has since been independently arrived at by Wundt
                    <hi rend="italic">{Physiologische Psychologie,</hi> 2d ed., p 321). In 1865, on
                    the starting of the <hi rend="italic">Fortnightly Review,</hi> Lewes became its
                    editor, but he retained the post for less than two years. This date marks the
                    transition from more strictly scientific to philosophic work. He had from early
                    youth cherished a strong liking for philosophic studies; one of his earliest
                    essays was an appreciative account of Hegel’s <hi rend="italic">Aesthetics.</hi>
                    Coming under the influence of positivism as unfolded both in Comte’s own works
                    and in J. S. Mill’s <hi rend="italic">System of Logic,</hi> he abandoned all
                    faith in the possibility of metaphysic, and recorded this abandonment in the
                    above-mentioned <hi rend="italic">History of Philosophy.</hi> Yet he did not at
                    any time give an unqualified adhesion to Comte’s teaching, and with wider
                    reading and reflexion his mind moved away further from the positivist’s
                    standpoint. In the preface to the third edition of his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of Philosophy</hi> he avowed a change in this direction, and this movement is
                    still more plainly discernible in subsequent editions of the work. The final
                    outcome of this intellectual progress is given to us in <hi rend="italic">The
                    Problems of Life and Mind,</hi> which may be regarded as the crowning work of
                    his life. His sudden death in 1878 cut short the work, yet it is complete enough
                    to allow us to judge of the author’s matured conceptions on biological,
                    psychological, and metaphysical problems.</p>
                <p>The first two volumes on <hi rend="italic">The Foundations of a Creed</hi> lay
                    down what he regarded as the true principles of philosophizing. He here seeks to
                    effect a <hi rend="italic">rapprochement</hi> between metaphysic and science. He
                    is still so far a positivist as to pronounce all inquiry into the ultimate
                    nature of things fruitless. What matter, form, spirit are in themselves is a
                    futile question that belongs to the sterile region of “metem pirics.” But
                    philosophical questions maybe so stated as to be susceptible of a precise
                    solution by scientific method. Thus, since the relation of subject to object
                    falls within our experience, it is a proper matter for philosophic
                    investigation. It may be questioned whether Lewes is right in thus identifying
                    the methods of science and philosophy. Philosophy is not a mere extension of
                    scientific knowledge; it is an investigation of the nature and validity of the
                    knowing process itself. In any case Lewes cannot be said to have done much to
                    aid in the settlement of properly philosophical questions. His whole treatment
                    of the question of the relation of subject to object is vitiated by a confusion
                    between the scientific truth that mind and body coexist in the living organism
                    and the philosophic truth that all knowledge of objects implies a knowing
                    subject. In other words, to use Mr Shadworth Hodgson’s phrase, he mixes up the
                    question of the <hi rend="italic">genesis</hi> of mental forms with the question
                    of their <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Reflexion,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 40-58). Thus he reaches the “monistic” doctrine
                    that mind and matter are two aspects of the same existence by attending simply
                    to the parallelism between psychical and physical processes given as a fact (or
                    a probable fact) of our experience, and by leaving out of account their relation
                    as subject and object in the cognitive act. His identification of the two as
                    phases of one existence is open to criticism, not only from the point of view of
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0511-0492"/> philosophy, but from that of science. In his
                    treatment of such ideas as “sensibility,” “sentience,” and the like, he does not
                    always show whether he is speaking of physical or of psychical phenomena. Among
                    the other properly philosophic questions discussed in these two volumes the
                    nature of the causal relation is perhaps the one which is handled with most
                    freshness and suggestiveness. The third volume, <hi rend="italic">The Physical
                    Basis of Mind,</hi> further develops the writer’s views on organic activities as
                    a whole. He insists strongly on the radical distinction between organic and
                    inorganic processes, and on the impossibility of ever explaining the former by
                    purely mechanical principles. With respect to the nervous system, he holds that
                    all its parts have one and the same elementary property, namely, sensibility.
                    Thus sensibility belongs as much to the lower centres of the spinal cord as to
                    the brain, contributing in this more elementary form elements to the
                    “subconscious” region of mental life. The higher functions of the nervous
                    system, which make up our conscious mental life, are merely more complex
                    modifications of this fundamental property of nerve substance. Closely related
                    to this doctrine is the view that the nervous organism acts as a whole, that
                    particular mental operations cannot be referred to definitely circumscribed
                    regions of the brain, and that the hypothesis of nervous activity passing in the
                    centre by an isolated pathway from one nerve-cell to another is altogether
                    illusory. By insisting on the complete coincidence between the regions of
                    nerve-action and sentience, and by holding that these are but different aspects
                    of one thing, lie is able to attack the doctrine of animal and human automatism,
                    which affirms that feeling or consciousness is merely an incidental concomitant
                    of nerve-action, and in no way essential to the chain of physical events.
                    Lewes’s views in psychology, partly opened up in the earlier volumes of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Problems,</hi> are more fully worked out in the last two volumes
                    (3d series). He discusses the method of psychology with much insight. He claims
                    against Comte and his followers a place for introspection in psychological
                    research. In addition to this subjective method there must be an objective,
                    which consists partly in a reference to nervous conditions, and partly in the
                    employment of sociological and historical data. Biological knowledge, or a
                    consideration of the organic conditions, would only help us to explain mental
                    <hi rend="italic">functions,</hi> as feeling and thinking; it would not assist
                    us fo understand differences of mental <hi rend="italic">faculty</hi> as
                    manifested in different races and stages of human development. The organic
                    conditions of these differences will probably for ever escape detection. Hence
                    they can be explained only as the products of the social environment. This idea
                    of dealing with mental phenomena in their relation to social and historical
                    conditions is probably Lewes’s most important contribution to psychology. Among
                    other points which he emphasizes is the complexity of mental phenomena. Every
                    mental state is regarded as compounded of three factors in different
                    proportions— namely, a process of sensible affection, of logical grouping, and
                    of motor impulse. But Lewes’s work in psychology consists less in any definite
                    discoveries than in the inculcation of a sound and just method. His biological
                    training prepared him to view mind as a complex unity, in which the various
                    functions interact one on the other, and of which the highest processes are
                    identical with and evolved out of the lower. Thus the operations of thought, or
                    “the logic of signs,” are merely a more complicated form of the elementary
                    operations of sensation and instinct, or “the logic of feeling.” The whole of
                    the last volume of the <hi rend="italic">Problems</hi> may be said to be an
                    illustration of this position. It is a valuable repository of psychological
                    facts, many of them drawn from the more obscure regions of mental life and from
                    abnormal experience, and is throughout suggestive and stimulating. To suggest,
                    and to stimulate the mind, rather than to supply it with any complete system of
                    knowledge, may be said to be Lewes’s service in philosophy. The exceptional
                    rapidity and versatility of his intelligence seems to account at once for the
                    freshness in his way of envisaging the subject-matter of philosophy and
                    psychology, and for the want of satisfactory elaboration and of systematic
                    co-ordination. (J. S.)</p>
