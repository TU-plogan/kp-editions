                    Marquis of</hi></label> (1769-1822), better known by his courtesy title Of
                    Viscount Castlereagh, which he held until the last year of his life, the
                    statesman who brought about the union with Ireland, who was foreign minister for
                    ten eventful years, who represented England at the congress of Vienna, and who
                    was the recognized leader of the aristocratic and reactionary party which owed
                    its being to the excesses of the French Revolution, was born on June 18, 1769,
                    and was thus one year older than his great rival George Canning. His father,
                    Robert Stewart of Ballylawn in the county of Londonderry, and Mount Stewart in
                    Down, had represented the latter county in two Irish parliaments; and his
                    marriage with Lady Sarah Seymour Conway, daughter of the earl of Hertford, in
                    1766, had brought him into connexion with many of the great Whig families of
                    England, as did also his second marriage with the eldest daughter of Lord
                    Camden. His elder son, the future minister, was educated at a school in Armagh,
                    and proceeded in 1786 to St John’s College, Cambridge. He spent only a single
                    year at the English university, and was on his grand tour through Europe when he
                    was summoned home by his father, who had just been created Lord Londonderry in
                    the peerage of Ireland, to stand for the county of Down as the candidate of the
                    smaller landholders against the influence of the marquis of Downshire. The
                    election cost the new Lord Londonderry £60,000, a sum which crippled him for his
                    whole life. But he was successful, and the young Stewart entered the Irish
                    parliament as one of the few really independent members who sat there, bound by
                    no ties to a great lord, but the representative of three thousand freeholders of
                    the richest county of the most educated province of Ireland. He joined the
                    opposition, like his father before him, and eagerly pressed for the extension of
                    the franchise to the Roman Catholics, even going so far, said his enemies later,
                    as to become a contributor to the <hi rend="italic">northern Star</hi> of
                    Belfast, the organ of the seditious party in Ulster; but the great events of the
                    French Revolution soon showed their influence on his opinions, as on those of
                    most landed proprietors. His thoughts on politics already clearly pointed
                    towards the necessity of a union between England and Ireland, a necessity by
                    this time obvious to all political thinkers and practical politicians. But for
                    the time he held firmly to the popular side, voting for the removal of Catholic
                    disabilities, and the right of Irishmen to trade with India. At last, however,
                    Lord Camden came over to Ireland, in March 1795, as lord-lieutenant, with Mr
                    Pelham as his secretary, on a mission to tell the Catholics and reformers that
                    they must expect no further relief and no further reform. He took much notice of
                    his sister’s step-son, young Robert Stewart, who was quite willing to be won
                    over from the opposition, and who had in the previous year married Lady Emily
                    Hobart, daughter of the late earl of Buckinghamshire, and near relative of many
                    great political personages. Lord Camden used his influence to obtain for his
                    brother-in-law a viscountcy as Viscount Castlereagh in October 1795, and in the
                    following August an earldom as earl of Londonderry. In that same August 1796 he
                    made Robert Stewart, who by his father’s promotion had become Viscount
                    Castlereagh, keeper of his signet, an honorary post which merely marked his
                    accession to the Government, and in February 1797 acting secretary in the place
                    of Mr Pelham. Taking office at a time when everything was at the height of
                    confusion, Lord Castlereagh soon began to show his splendid administrative
                    genius, which, indeed, consisted in his “infinite capacity for taking pains” and
                    careful mastery of details. During the rebellion of 1798, when Lord Camden
                    resigned in panic, Castlereagh showed all the qualities of a splendid <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0883-0854"/> minister of police, and heartily co-operated with
                    the wise measures of Lord Cornwallis, by which the rebellion was soon brought to
                    an end. He was equally useful to Cornwallis in the second part of his mission to
                    Ireland, namely, the union with England, The measure was to be carried; the
                    means were bribery whether in honours or in money. The details of the passage of
                    the measure through the House can be studied in the correspondences of
                    Cornwallis and Castlereagh, in which appear clearly the utter disgust of
                    Cornwallis at the work he was doing and the country he was in, and Castlereagh’s
                    pride in his successful manipulation of men. The Union carried (1800), then came
                    the fulfilment of promises made to secure support or disarm opposition, and
                    first in importance those to the Catholics. It was thoroughly understood between
                    Pitt, Cornwallis, and Castlereagh that full rights of citizenship were to be
                    given to the Catholics as a reward for the loyal behaviour of the greater men
                    during the rebellion, and to induce them not to oppose the Union. But the
                    promise was not fulfilled. Pitt had indeed promised to carry the measure; but
                    the king’s conscience was worked upon by Lord Loughborough, and to Pitt’s
                    surprise and disgust his resignation was accepted, and immediately followed by
                    that of the abler half of the cabinet, and necessarily of Cornwallis and
                    Castlereagh. With his resignation ends the first epoch of Castlereagh’s
                    political life. On very many occasions in his correspondence Cornwallis mentions
                    him with warm praise of his “talents, temper, and judgment,” and only qualifies
                    his opinion in one place, when he says, on July 3,1800, that “Littlehales very
                    much surpasses Lord Castlereagh in the private management of mankind from his
                    good humour and kind attention to everybody.” Here Cornwallis touches the
                    greatest political fault of Castlereagh, which destroyed his popularity and
                    ruined his reputation—his want of sympathy for human weaknesses.</p>
                <p>Castlereagh was sworn of the English privy council in December 1799, and returned
                    to the first united parliament for the county of Down. He had no intention of
                    permanently losing office by his advocacy of the Catholic claims, and therefore,
                    instead of going into violent opposition like Canning and others of the late
                    administration, he supported the weak Addington ministry, and in June 1802 was
                    appointed president of the Board of Control. On Pitt’s return to power in
                    December 1804 he kept Castlereagh in office, and in 1805 made him secretary of
                    state for war and the colonies, as well as president of the Board of Control.
                    For the six months he held the war office he was Pitt’s right hand in
                    administration, as Canning was in debate. He now prepared a great expedition of
                    thirty thousand men, who were to land in Hanover and make a diversion in
                    northern Germany in favour of the Russians and Austrians. The expedition was too
                    late to be of any use, but it deserves notice as illustrating Castlereagh’s
                    favourite idea that England should carry on “grande guerre,” which was to appear
                    to a greater extent later. His present tenure of office was but short, for
                    Pitt’s Government resigned on his death in January 1806.</p>
                <p>When Pitt died, Castlereagh was prime mover in the attempt to make Lord
                    Hawkesbury premier, and when that failed, sooner than give up all hope of place,
                    he declared that he and his friends “looked to” Lord Grenville. Grenville,
                    however, formed his ministry of “all the talents” out of the sections which
                    followed Fox, Windham, and Sidmouth. The opposition was led in the House of
                    Commons by Castlereagh and Canning. Now began the close association of these two
                    celebrated men, each of whom hoped to lead the Tory party, and who did so in
                    turn, both Irishmen from the same county of Londonderry, both in the prime of
                    life, and distinguished —the one for his surpassing eloquence, the other for his
                    administrative powers. Each rival despised the other: Castlereagh, conscious of
                    his high birth and noble connexions, looked down on the son of the actress;
                    Canning, conscious on his side of his great talents for debate, looked down on
                    the clumsy debater and laborious parliamentary tactician, who looked to
                    governing the country rather by a careful manipulation of boroughs and patronage
                    than by eloquence and statesmanship. Castlereagh again, proud of his position as
                    an ex-cabinet minister, pretended to lead Canning, who had held but inferior
                    posts; while Canning, in his ardent devotion to the memory of Pitt, sneered at
                    the man who had taken a seat in Addington’s cabinet. This rivalry was increased
                    almost to personal dislike by the marriage of Castlereagh’s sister to the son
                    and heir of that uncle of Canning’s, Paul, in whose favour his own father had
                    been disinherited, and who some years later was made Lord Garvagh. The rivals
                    were not long in opposition, the new ministry resigning in 1807. The duke of
                    Portland formed a new administration on strictly anti-Catholic principles, in
                    which Castlereagh and Canning, both advocates of the Catholic claims, were
                    secretaries of state, the former for war and the colonies, the latter for
                    foreign affairs. During the two years they remained in office together each
                    chafed at the other. The chief events connected with the war office during this
                    tenure of office were the expeditions to Copenhagen, the Peninsula, and
                    Walcheren. Of the Copenhagen expedition the chief credit or discredit must rest
                    with Canning, but the merits of its execution rest entirely with Lord
                    Castlereagh, who showed himself a war minister far superior to Dundas and
                    Windham, and despatched in perfect secrecy a large military and naval
                    expedition, which was swiftly and entirely successful. On the subject of the
                    Portuguese expedition and the assistance to be afforded to the Spanish
                    insurgents, the two secretaries were of different opinions. Canning sent the
                    Spaniards officers, money, and arms in profusion, but was reluctant to send a
                    great army, while Castlereagh planned the Portuguese expedition, chose Sir A.
                    Wellesley to command it, and deserves the credit of Vimiera. Napier in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Peninsular</hi> JK&lt;zr proves how wrong Canning was, how
                    impossible it was to organize out of the Spaniards a force able to resist
                    Napoleon, and how right Castlereagh was in believing in the efficacy of a
                    British army. The Walcheren expedition went far utterly to ruin Castlereagh’s
                    reputation, and completed the difference between Canning and himself. Yet the
                    conception was good. Castlereagh prepared the expedition with skill and secrecy,
                    though with slight regard for men’s lives, as appeared in his choice of the
                    unhealthy island of Walcheren for debarkation, in his refusal to send enough
                    doctors or hospital ships, and in his appointment of Lord Chatham to command in
                    chief. In this appointment of Chatham appears the radical vice of his war
                    administration: he looked before giving a command on active service to
                    parliamentary influence, not tried ability. The failure of the expedition
                    brought about a crisis in the cabinet. In April 1809 Canning had sent in his
                    resignation to the duke of Portland, declaring that he could no longer serve
                    with Castlereagh, but the matter was put off from time to time, and at length
                    Canning consented to wait till the Walcheren expedition was over. In September
                    he insisted once for all that something must be done, and then for the first
                    time Castlereagh heard that his dismissal had been determined on for some
                    months. He was naturally indignant, and, being unable to challenge Lord Camden,
                    his benefactor, who had really behaved worst to him, or the old duke of
                    Portland, he challenged Canning, who had throughout protested against the manner
                    in which Castlereagh had been treated. On September 21 they met <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0884-0855"/> on Putney Heath, when Canning was slightly
                    wounded in the thigh, and Castlereagh had a button shot off his coat. After this
                    duel both resigned, and remained out of office two years, but Castlereagh did
                    not intend to remain so, and through the influence of his aunt, old Lady
                    Hertford, with the prince regent he was, after the refusal of Canning, offered
                    the secretaryship of state for foreign affairs in March 1812 in the room of Lord
                    Wellesley. On Perceval’s assassination in May 1812, the leadership of the House
                    of Commons was given to Castlereagh. The first ten years of Lord Liverpool’s
                    administration were the palmy days of the Tory aristocracy, and during them Lord
                    Castlereagh was the guiding spirit of foreign policy in the cabinet, and the
                    faithful interpreter of Lord Sidmouth’s home policy in the House of Commons.
                    Once in power, he perceived that Napoleon must be beaten in Germany, and that,
                    though Lord Wellington’s army in Spain must be supported to maintain the credit
                    of English soldiers, and occupy as many French troops as possible, the important
                    point was for the Russian and Prussian monarchs to be joined by the Austrian
                    emperor, and follow up the blow Napoleon had dealt himself in his invasion of
                    Russia. To bring Austria into the field, manage the crown prince of Sweden,
                    maintain the alliance of the great powers and the harmonious working of their
                    armies and policies, Castlereagh gave the English ambassadors at the courts of
                    Austria, Russia, and Prussia, full powers to correspond with each other, and
                    follow the allied forces. The ability with which these instructions were carried
                    out is to be read in the history of the whole campaign of 1813, and of the
                    congresses of Mannheim and Frankfort. When the allies entered France,
                    Castlereagh himself left England to attend the congress of Chatillon. He
                    remained with armies of the allies, entered Paris with them, and signed the
                    preliminaries of peace. Great was the applause he received on his return from
                    the people, and above all in the House of Commons. The prince regent made him a
                    Knight of the Garter, an honour which had only been conferred on two commoners,
                    Sir R. Walpole and Lord North, for the last two hundred years, and when the
                    allied sovereigns visited London they treated him with marked favour, so that it
                    was no wonder, when he started to take his seat as British plenipotentiary at
                    the congress of Vienna, he believed himself to be a great diplomatist. That he
                    was mistaken in this was conclusively proved by that congress where, as Von
                    Gentz said, England could have done anything, and did nothing. Throughout he
                    supported Metternich, partly because Metternich’s nature had mastered him, but
                    more because he had imbibed a blind distrust of Russia. "When the return of
                    Napoleon from Elba put an end to the quarrels which were nearly ending in a
                    general war between Prussia and Russia on the one side and England, France, and
                    Austria on the other, and united all parties against him, Castlereagh returned
                    to England, and expressed his confidence in a speedy termination of the new
                    struggle, which indeed was closed at Waterloo. He signed the second peace of
                    Paris on behalf of England, and on his return his father was created marquis of
                    Londonderry. From this time his career can be sketched very shortly. At home the
                    grand harvest of 1815 was followed by very bad ones, and great discontent
                    existed both among the agricultural and manufacturing classes. The Government
                    pursued the same tactics which had in 1793 united nearly all the upper classes
                    in a fever of reaction; they established a secret committee which declared the
                    existence of a widespread conspiracy, and it was often their spies who threw
                    into the meetings of the discontented sufficient politics to make them look like
                    conspiracies. The bad feeling existing came to a climax with the Peterloo
                    massacre, and Lord Sidmouth introduced his Six Acts to check a network of
                    conspiracies which mostly did not exist. Castlereagh had to introduce the Six
                    Acts in the House of Commons, and as usual spoke of the people with the air of
                    hauteur and contempt which made him so particularly obnoxious to them. His
                    foreign policy during these years was chiefly inspired by a real desire to
                    maintain the peace of Europe, which he believed was only to be preserved by the
                    harmony of all the monarchs and their foreign ministers, and to preserve this
                    harmony he was so loth to differ from them on any subject that it was commonly
                    believed among the people that he had signed the Holy Alliance. At the congress
                    of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1818 it was for this reason that he recommended that
                    France should be freed from the army of occupation. The death of George III. in
                    January 1820 made no difference to Castlereagh, who was greatly in the favour of
                    the new king, and who had no difficulty in supporting the Bill of Pains and
                    Penalties against the queen. Scarcely was the excitement of the queen’s trial
                    and the king’s coronation over, when Lord Londonderry, for he had succeeded to
                    that title in this very year, accompanied the king to Hanover in October 1821 to
                    discuss the revolutions in Greece and Spain with Metternich. The interviews
                    which then took place are fully described in Metternich’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Autobiography</hi> (vol. iii. pp. 552-560), and exhibit clearly the paramount
                    influence of Metternich over Lord Londonderry, whom he persuaded to take part in
                    a congress at Verona in the following year. While he was making preparations to
                    start, he became possessed by many strange delusions, which clearly indicated
                    that his mind was unhinged by over work, as it had been once before after the
                    passing of the Union with Ireland. This soon became obvious to every one; the
                    king noticed it; and the duke of Wellington sent a physician down to Foots Cray
                    to see him. The doctor found him suffering from melancholia, and ordered his
                    razors to be taken away, but in spite of all precautions he procured a penknife
                    and committed suicide on August 12,1822. His body was conveyed to London to be
                    buried in Westminster Abbey, and just as it was being lowered into the grave a
                    cry of exultant hatred arose from that rabble he had so despised.</p>
                <p>Castlereagh’s character illustrates the strange difference which in corrupt times
                    can exist between public and private morality. In private life he was a strictly
                    honourable and affectionate man; he was a good husband, a good son, a good
                    brother, and a good master; but even in his private relations that want of
                    warmth which made Cornwallis declare he was utterly unlike an Irishman, and
                    Wilberforce liken him to a fish, seems to have existed, and seems to have been
                    part of his temperament In public life he played quite a different part, and,
                    though he had one or two firm political principles, as appears in his steady
                    advocacy of Catholic emancipation, he seems as a rule to have regarded politics
                    as a game, in which all means were fair to win, and very extraordinary some of
                    his means appear to be. Though a very bad and confused speaker, he was very
                    successful as a parliamentary leader, from the care with which he used his
                    patronage, and the amount of votes he won by it. While not a great diplomatist,
                    as the mastery Metternich obtained over him clearly proved, as an administrator
                    he deserves the highest praise, steadily punctual to his work, never allowing
                    arrears to accumulate, and never neglecting a detail; but his parliamentary
                    necessities stood in his way: every appointment was given from a party point of
                    view, and if, as in the case of Sir A. Wellesley, chance sometimes led him
                    right, jobbing more often led him wrong. But the chief interest which centres in
                    Lord Londonderry is that he was the last leader of an extinct class. The old
                    aristocrats who lived by politics, and thought all means fair in politics, are
                    gone <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n885/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0885-0856"/> for ever, and with Londonderry’s death the
                    unnatural tension of the reaction from the excesses of the French Revolution
                    ceased, and modern Conservatism, containing indeed many prejudices and an
                    exaggerated admiration for what is fixed, came into being with its real sympathy
                    for all mankind, which the old Tories, and more especially Lord Londonderry,
                    would have despised.</p>
                <p>The best materials for studying Londonderry’s life and opinions are his <hi
                    rend="italic">Despatches</hi> edited by his brother, the third marquis, in 12
                    volumes. They are, however, very incomplete from the loss of the most valuable
                    at sea in the wreck of the ship which was taking Mr Turner, Lord Londonderry’s
                    chosen biographer, to India. The <hi rend="italic">Cornwallis
                    Correspondence</hi> for his Irish work, and the supplementary <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wellington Despatches</hi> should also be used. Alison’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dives</hi> of Lord Castlereagh and Sir Charles Stewart are interesting reading,
                    but abound with that celebrated author’s usual faults, and should be corrected
                    by Walpole’s <hi rend="italic">History of England,</hi> from 1815. Of
                    contemporary diaries, Rose’s, Lord Colchester’s, Romilly’s, and Wilberforce’s ,
                    with Pellew’sZî/è <hi rend="italic">of Lord Sidmouth,</hi> should be consulted,
                    and Metternich’s <hi rend="italic">Autobiography</hi> for the later foreign
                    policy. Mr Thornton has a short biography in his <hi rend="italic">Lives of the
                    Foreign Secretaries from</hi> 1800, which is chiefly valuable from his access to
                    the unpublished memoranda of Lord Bexley, who as Mr Vansittart was chancellor of
                    the exchequer, and helped to lead the Commons from 1812 to 1822. (H. Μ. S.)</p>
