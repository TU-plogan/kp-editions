                    the poem itself, and the title <hi rend="italic">Visio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Willelmi,</hi> &amp;c., in many MSS.; and we may at once reject the suggestion
                    that his name may have been Robert. In no less than three MSS. occurs the
                    following colophon: “Explicit visio Willelmi W. de Petro Ie Plowman.” What is
                    here meant by W. it is difficult to conjecture; but it is just possible that it
                    may represent Wychwood (of which more presently), or Wigorniensis, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of Worcester. As to the surname, we find the note that
                    “Robert or William Langland made pers ploughman,” in a handwriting of the 15th
                    century, on the fly-leaf of a MS. copy belonging to Lord Ashburnham; and in a
                    Dublin MS., is the note: “Memorandum, quod Stacy de Rokayle, pater Willielmi de
                    Langlond, qui Stacius fuit generosus, et morabatur in Schiptone-under-Whicwode,
                    tenens domini le Spenser in comitatu Oxon., qui predictus Willielmus fecit
                    librum qui vocatur Perys Ploughman.” Nevertheless, it would seem that Langland
                    should rather be Langley, since there is no trace of any Langland family in the
                    midland counties, while the Langley family were wardens of Wychwood forest in
                    Oxfordshire between the years 1278 and 1362. The question has been fully
                    discussed by Professor Pearson in the <hi rend="italic">North British
                    Review,</hi> April 1870, p. 244. According to Bale, our author was born at
                    Cleobury Mortimer, which is quite consistent with the supposition that his
                    father may have removed from that place to Shipton in Oxfordshire, as there
                    seems to have been a real connexion between the families in those places. It
                    must not be omitted that in the parish of Shipton-under-Wychwood there is a
                    hamlet named Langley, from which he may have received his name.</p>
                <p>The internal evidence concerning the author is fuller and more satisfactory. By
                    piecing together the various hints concerning himself which the poet gives us,
                    we may compile the following account. His name was William (and probably
                    Langley), and he was born about 1332 perhaps at Cleobury Mortimer in Shropshire.
                    His father, who was doubtless a franklin or farmer, and his other friends put
                    him to school, made a “clerk” or scholar of him, and taught him what Holy Writ
                    meant. In 1362, at the age of about thirty, he found himself wandering upon the
                    Malvern hills, and fell asleep beside a stream, and saw in a vision a field full
                    of folk, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> this present world, and many other
                    remarkable sights which he duly records. From this supposed circumstance he
                    named his poem <hi rend="italic">The Vision of William,</hi> though it is really
                    a succession of visions, since he mentions several occasions on which he awoke,
                    and afterwards again fell asleep; and he even tells us of som; adventures which
                    befel him in his waking moments. In some of these visions there is no mention of
                    Piers the Plowman, but in others he describes him as being the coming reformer
                    who was to remedy all· abuses, and restore the world to a right condition. It is
                    remarkable that Lis conception of this reformer changes from time to time, and
                    becomes more exalted as the poem advances. At first he was no more than a
                    ploughman, one of the true and honest labourers who are the salt of the earth;
                    but at last he is identified with the great reformer who has come already, the
                    regenerator of the world in the person of Jesus Christ. We may, in fact,
                    consider Piers the Plowman as representing Christ himself, or, in the author’s
                    own phrase—“Petrus est Christus.” If this be borne in mind, it will not be
                    possible to make the mistake into which so many have fallen, of speaking of
                    Piers the Plowman as being the author, not the subject, of the poem. The author
                    may best be called William, or we may even give him the nickname of Long Will,
                    which, as he himself tell us, was bestowed upon him from his tallness of
                    stature,—just as the poet Gascoigne was familiarly called Long George. Though
                    there is mention of the Malvern hills more than once near the beginning of the
                    poem, it is abundantly clear that the poet lived for “many years in Cornhill
                    (London), with his wife Kitte and his daughter Calote.” He seems to have come to
                    London not long after the date of the first com mencement of his work, and to
                    have long continued there. He describes himself as being a tall man, one who was
                    loath to reverence lords or ladies or persons in gay apparel, and not deigning
                    to say “God save you” to the sergeants whom he met in the street, insomuch that
                    many people took him to be a fool. He was very poor, wore long robes, and had a
                    shaven crown, having received the clerical tonsure. But he seems only to have
                    taken minor orders, and earned a precarious living by singing the <hi
                    rend="italic">placebo,</hi><hi rend="italic">dirige,</hi> and seven psalms for
                    the good of men’s souls. The fact that he was married may explain why he never
                    rose in the church. But he had another source of livelihood in his ability to
                    write out legal documents, and he was extremely familiar with the law courts at
                    Westminster. His leisure time must have been entirely occupied with his devotion
                    to his poem, which was essentially the work of his lifetime. He was not
                    satisfied with rewriting it once, but he actually rewrote it twice; and from the
                    abundance of the MSS. which still exist we can see its development from the
                    earliest draught, written about 1362, to its latest form, written after 1390. It
                    is remarkable that the intermediate form, written later than 1370, is perhaps,
                    taken upon the whole, the best of the three.</p>
                <p>In 1399, just before the deposition of Richard II., appeared a poem addressed to
                    the king, who is designated as “Richard the Redeles,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> devoid of counsel. This poem, occurring in only one MS., in which it
                    is incomplete, breaking off abruptly in the middle of a page, may safely be
                    attributed to the same author, who was, at the time, passing through Bristol. As
                    he was then about sixty-seven years of age, we may be sure that he did not long
                    survive the accession of Henry IV. It may here be observed that the well-known
                    poem entitled <hi rend="italic">Pierce Ploughman's</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Crede,</hi> though excellently written, is certainly an imitation by another
                    hand, viz., by the anonymous author of <hi rend="italic">The Plowman's
                    Tale,</hi> which is inserted in the black-letter editions of Chaucer, though it
                    is none of his. The Pierce Ploughman of the <hi rend="italic">Crede</hi> is very
                    different in conception from the subject of William’s vision.</p>
                <p>As regards the poem itself, it has been already said that it exists in three
                    forms. If we denote these by the names of A-text, B-text, and C-text, we find,
                    of the first, twelve MSS.; of the second, sixteen; and of the third, also
                    sixteen MSS. A few of these show confusion between the different tvpes, but they
                    may roughly be <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n301/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0301-0286"/> classed as above; and it will be seen that we
                    thus have abundance of material, a circumstance which proves the great
                    popularity of the poem in former times. Owing to the frequent expressions which
                    indicate a desire for reformation in religion, it was, in the time of Edward
                    VI., considered worthy of being printed. Three impressions were printed by
                    Robert Crowley in 1550; and one of these was badly reprinted by Owen Rogers in
                    1561. In 1813 the best MS. of the C-text was printed by Dr Whitaker in an
                    expensive form. In 1842 Mr Thomas Wright printed an edition from an excellent
                    MS. of the B-text in the library of Trinity College, Cambridge (second edition,
                    1856). A complete edition of all three texts was undertaken, for the Early
                    English Text Society, by the Rev. W. W. Skeat, but is not yet finished (1881).
                    Vols, i., ii., and iii., containing the three texts, and the poem of Richard the
                    Redeles, appeared in 1866, 1869, and 1873 respectively, and a part of vol. iv.,
                    containing full notes to all three texts, with some indexes, in 1877.</p>
                <p>The general contents of the poem may be inferred from a brief description of the
                    latest text. This is divided into twenty-three passus, nominally comprising four
                    parts, called respectively Visio de Petro Plowman, Visio de Do-wel, Visio de
                    Do-bet, and Visio de Do-best. Here Do-bet signifies “do better” in modern
                    English; and the author’s own explanation of the names is that he who does a
                    kind action does well, he who teaches others to act kindly does better, but he
                    who combines both practice and theory, both doing good himself and teaching
                    others to do the same, does best. But the visions by no means closely correspond
                    to these descriptions; the poet really gives us a set of eleven visions, which
                    may be thus enumerated (1) Vision of the Field Full of Folk, of Holy Church, and
                    of the Lady Meed (passus i.-v.); (2) Vision of the Seven Deadly Sins, and of
                    Piers the Plowman (pass, vi.-x.); (3) Wit, Study, Clergy, and Scripture (pass,
                    xi., xii.); (4) Fortune, Nature, Recklessness, and Reason (pass, xiii., xiv.);
                    (5) Vision of Imaginative (pass. XV. ); (6) Conscience, Patience, and
                    Activa-Vita (pass, xvi., xvii.); (7) Free-will, and the Tree of Charity (pass.
                    xviiL, xix.); (8) Faith, Hope, and Charity (pass, xx.); (9) The Triumph of Piers
                    the Plowman, i,e., the Crucifixion, Burial, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ
                    (pass, xxi.); (10) The Vision of Grace (pase. xxii.); (11) The Vision of
                    Antichrist (pass, xxiii.).</p>
                <p>This bare outline gives but little idea of the real nature of the poem. The
                    general plan of it is slight and somewhat vague, but the execution is vivid and
                    remarkable. The author’s object was to afford himself opportunities by the way
                    (of which he has amply availed himself) of describing the life and manners of
                    the poorer classes; of inveighing against clerical abuses and the rapacity of
                    the friars; of representing the miseries caused by the great pestilences then
                    prevalent and by the hasty and ill-advised marriages consequent thereupon; and
                    of denouncing lazy workmen and sham beggars, the corruption and bribery then too
                    common in the law-courts, and all the numerous forms of falsehood which are at
                    all times the fit subjects for satire and indignant exposure. In describing, for
                    example, the seven deadly sins, he gives so exact a description of Glutton and
                    Sloth that the readers feel that these are no mere abstractions, but drawn from
                    the life, and it becomes hardly more difficult to realize Glutton than it is to
                    realize Sir John Falstaff. The numerous allegorical personages so frequently
                    introduced, such as Scripture, Clergy, Conscience, Patience, and the like, are
                    all mouthpieces of the author himself, uttering for the most part his own
                    sentiments, but sometimes speaking in accordance with the character which each
                    is supposed to represent. The theological disquisitions which are occasionally
                    introduced are somewhat dull and tedious, but the earnestness of the author’s
                    purpose and his energy of language tend to relieve them, and there are not many
                    passages which might have been omitted without loss. The poem is essentially one
                    of those which improve on a second reading, and as a linguistic monument it is
                    of very high value. Mere extracts from the poem, even if rather numerous and of
                    some length, fail to give a fair idea of it. The whole deserves, and will repay,
                    a careful study; indeed, there are not many single works from which a student of
                    English literature and of the English language may derive more substantial
                    benefit.</p>
                <p>The metre is alliterative, and destitute of final rhyme. It is not very regular,
                    as the author’s earnestness led him to use the fittest words rather than those
                    which merely served the purpose of rhythm. The chief rule is that, in general,
                    the same letter or combination of letters should, begin three emphatic syllables
                    in the same line, as, for example, in the line which may be modernized thus: “Of
                    all wanner of men, the wean and the rich.” Sometimes there are but two such
                    rhyme-letters, as: “Λfight of the commons wade him to reign.” Sometimes there
                    are four, as: “In a summer season, when soft was the sun.” There is invariably a
                    pause, more or less distinct, in the middle of each line.</p>

                    Wright (Camden Society), which is the same poem as Richard the Redeles; warton,

                    English; H. Morley, English Writers, &lt;fcc. A long and careful summary of the
                    whole poem is given in Illustrations of English Religion, by H. Morley, ch. lii.
