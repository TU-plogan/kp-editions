                    (c</hi></label>. 1531- 1588). This favourite of Queen Elizabeth came of an
                    ambitious family. They were not, indeed, such mere upstarts as their enemies
                    loved to represent them; for Leicester’s grandfather—the notorious Edmund Dudley
                    who was one of the chief instruments of Henry VII.’s extortions—was descended
                    from a younger branch of the barons of Dudley. But the love of power was a
                    passion which seems to have increased in them with each succeeding generation,
                    and though the grandfather was beheaded by Henry VIII. for his too devoted
                    services in the preceding reign, the father grew powerful enough in the days of
                    Edward VI. to trouble the succession to the crown. This was that John Dudley,
                    duke of Northumberland, who contrived the marriage of Lady Jane Grey with his
                    own son Guildford Dudley, and involved both her and her husband in a common ruin
                    with himself. Robert Dudley, the subject of this article, was an elder brother
                    of Guildford, and shared at that time in the misfortunes of the whole family.
                    Having taken up arms with them against Queen Mary, he was sent to the Tower, and
                    was actually sentenced to death; but the queen afterwards not only pardoned and
                    restored him to liberty, but appointed him master of the ordnance. On the
                    accession of Elizabeth he was also made master of the horse. He was then,
                    perhaps, about seven and twenty, and was evidently rising rapidly in the queen’s
                    favour. At an early age he had been married to Amy, daughter of Sir John
                    Robsart. The match had been arranged by his father, who was very studious to
                    provide in this way for the future fortunesof his children, and the wedding was
                    graced by the presence of King Edward. But it was not a happy marriage. The lady
                    lived alone at Cumnor Hall in Berkshire, the house of one Anthony Forster, and
                    there in the year 1560 she died under circumstances which certainly aroused some
                    suspicions of foul play. The scandal was the more serious as it was insinuated
                    that Dudley stood so high in the queen’s favour that he might reasonably hope to
                    marry her, and that a murder had been deliberately planned to remove an obstacle
                    to his advancement. The point, it must be owned, is not free from obscurity, and
                    recent revelations from the archives of Simancas prove that even before the
                    unhappy lady’s death it was said there was a design to poison her. After the
                    event, however, the story was that she had broken her neck by a fall down
                    stairs, and, suspicious as the case may appear, there is much to be said in
                    favour of Dudley’s innocence, which cannot be discussed within our limits.
                    Certain it is that he continued to rise in the queen’s favour. She made him a
                    Knight of the Garter, and bestowed on him the castle of Kenilworth, the lordship
                    of Denbigh, and other lands of very great value in Warwickshire and in Wales. In
                    September 1564 she created him baron of Denbigh, and immediately afterwards earl
                    of Leicester. In the preceding month, when she visited Cambridge, she at his
                    request addressed the university in Latin. The honours shown him naturally
                    excited jealousy, especially as it was well known that he entertained still more
                    ambitious hopes, which the queen apparently did not altogether discourage. The
                    earl of Sussex, in opposition to him, strongly favoured a match with the
                    archduke Charles of Austria. The court was divided, and, while arguments were
                    set forth on the one side against the queen’s marrying a subject, the other
                    party insisted strongly on the disadvantages of a foreign alliance. The queen,
                    however, was so far from being foolishly in love with him that in 1564 she
                    recommended him as a husband for Mary Queen of Scots. But even this, it was
                    believed, was only a blind, and indeed it may be doubted how far the proposal
                    was serious. After his creation as earl of Leicester great attention was paid to
                    him both at home and abroad. The <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n445/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0445-0426"/> university of Oxford made him their chancellor,
                    and Charles IX. of France sent him the order of St Michael. A few years later he
                    formed an ambiguous connexion with the baroness dowager of Sheffield, which was
                    maintained by the lady, with great appearance of truth, to have been a valid
                    marriage, though it was concealed from the queen. Long afterwards, in the days
                    of James I., their son, Sir Robert Dudley, a man of extraordinary talents,
                    sought to establish his legitimacy; but his suit was suddenly brought to a stop,
                    and the documents connected with it sealed up by an order of the Star Chamber,
                    without any reasons being assigned.</p>
                <p>In 1575 Queen Elizabeth visited the earl at Kenilworth, where she was entertained
                    for some days with great magnificence. The picturesque account of the event
                    given by Sir Walter Scott has made every one familiar with the general character
                    of the scene. Next year Walter, earl of Essex, with whom Leicester had had some
                    differences, died in Ireland, not without suspicion of poison, and Leicester’s
                    subsequent marriage with his widow again gave rise to very serious imputations
                    against him. This marriage, like the former, was kept secret at first; but it
                    was revealed to the queen in 1579 by Simier, an emissary of the duke of Alençon,
                    to whose projected match with Elizabeth the earl seemed to be the principal
                    obstacle. The queen showed great displeasure at the news, and had some thought,
                    it is said, of committing Leicester to the Tower, but was dissuaded from doing
                    so by his rival the earl of Sussex. In February 1582 Leicester, along with a
                    number of other noblemen and gentlemen, escorted the duke of Alençon on his
                    return to Antwerp to be invested with the government of the Low Countries. In
                    1584 he inaugurated an association for the protection of Queen Elizabeth against
                    conspirators. About this time there issued from the press the famous pamphlet,
                    believed to have been the work of Parsons the Jesuit, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Leicester's Commonwealth,</hi> which was intended to suggest to the people that
                    the English constitution was subverted and the government handed over to one who
                    was at heart an atheist and a traitor, besides being a man of infamous life and
                    morals. The book was ordered to be suppressed by letters from the privy council,
                    in which it was declared that the charges against the earl were to the queen’s
                    certain knowledge untrue; nevertheless they produced a very strong impression,
                    and were believed in by some who had no sympathy with Jesuits long after
                    Leicester’s death. In 1585 he was appointed commander of an expedition to the
                    Low Countries in aid of the revolted provinces, and sailed with a fleet of fifty
                    ships to Flushing, where he was received with great enthusiasm. In January
                    following he was invested with the government of the provinces, but immediately
                    received a strong reprimand from the queen for taking upon himself a function
                    which she had not authorized. Both he and the States General were obliged to
                    apologize; but the latter protested that they had no intention of giving him
                    absolute control of their affairs, and that it would be extremely dangerous to
                    them to revoke the appointment. Leicester accordingly was allowed to retain his
                    dignity; but the incident was inauspicious, nor did affairs prosper greatly
                    under his management. His nephew Sir Philip Sidney was slain at the unsuccessful
                    siege of Zutphen, and complaints were made by the States General of the conduct
                    of the whole campaign. He returned to England for a time, and went back in 1587,
                    when he made an abortive effort to raise the siege of Sluys. Disagreements
                    increasing between him and the States, he was recalled by the queen, from whom,
                    contrary to the expectation of his enemies, he met with a very good reception;
                    and he continued in such favour that in the following summer (the year being
                    that of the Armada, 1588) he was appointed lieutenant-general of the army
                    mustered at Tilbury to resist Spanish invasion. After the crisis was past he was
                    returning homewards from the court to Kenilworth, when he was attacked by a
                    sudden illness and died at his house at Cornbury in Oxfordshire, on the 4th
                    September.</p>
                <p>Such are the bare facts of Leicester’s life. Of his character it is more
                    difficult to speak with confidence, but some features of it are indisputable.
                    Being in person tall and remarkably handsome, he improved these advantages by a
                    very ingratiating manner. A man of no small ability and still more ambition, he
                    was nevertheless vain, and presumed at times upon his influence with the queen
                    to a degree that brought upon him a sharp rebuff. On the other hand, Elizabeth
                    stood by him, as we have seen, against efforts to supplant him. That she was
                    ever really in love with him, as modern writers have supposed, is extremely
                    questionable; but she saw in him some valuable qualities which marked him as the
                    fitting recipient of high favours. He was a man of princely tastes, especially
                    in architecture. At court he became latterly the leader of the Puritan party,
                    and his letters were pervaded by expressions of religious feeling which it is
                    hard to believe were insincere. Of the darker suspicions against him it is
                    enough to say that much was certainly reported beyond the truth; but there
                    remain some facts sufficiently mysterious to make a just estimate of the man a
                    rather perplexing problem. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">ga.)</hi></p>
