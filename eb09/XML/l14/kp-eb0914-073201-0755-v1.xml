                    four-legged reptiles, but is now applied to a whole order <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Lacertil·ia)</hi> which is represented by extremely numerous species in
                    all temperate and tropical parts of the globe. Lizards may be described as
                    reptiles with a more or less elongate body terminating in a tail, and with the
                    skin either folded into scales (as in snakes) or granular or tubercular; legs
                    are generally present—usually four, rarely two in number— but sometimes they are
                    reduced to rudiments or entirely hidden below the skin; the jaws are toothed,
                    and the two mandibles firmly united in front by an osseous suture. Eyelids are
                    generally present. The vent is a transverse slit, and not longitudinal as in
                    Crocodilians. Other structural characteristics, especially of the skeleton,
                    separate lizards from the other orders of reptiles; but will be better
                    understood if described in relation to'the other members of that class. See <hi

                <p>At a low estimate the number of described species of lizards may be given as
                    about one thousand seven hundred.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            edition of either is much required.</p></note> They are extremely scarce
                    north of 60° N. lat.; and in the southern hemisphere the southern point of
                    Patagonia forms the furthest limit of their range. As we approach the tropics,
                    the variety of forms and the number of individuals increase steadily, the most
                    specialized and the most developed forms (the monitors and leguans) being
                    restricted to the tropical regions where lizards abound. They have adapted
                    themselves to almost every physical condition, except the extreme cold of high
                    latitudes or altitudes. Those inhabiting temperate latitudes hibernate. The
                    majority live on broken ground, rocks with or without vegetation; others are
                    arboreal; to a few (certain monitors) the neighbourhood of water is a necessity;
                    whilst others'are true desert animals, in colour scarcely distinguishable from
                    their surroundings. Some, like many geckos, live near or in houses, being
                    enabled by a peculiar apparatus of their toes to run along perpendicular and
                    even overhanging surfaces. No lizard enters the sea, with the exception of one
                    species, the leguan of the Galapagos <hi rend="italic">(Amblyrhynchus),</hi>
                    which feeds on sea-weed. Some, like the majority of the geckos, are
                    nocturnal.</p>
                <p>The motions of most lizards are executed with great but not enduring rapidity.
                    With the exception of the chamaeleon, all drag their body over the ground, the
                    limbs being wide apart, turned outwards, and relatively to the bulk of the body
                    generally weak. But the limbs show with regard to development great variation,
                    and an uninterrupted transition from the most perfect condition of two pairs
                    with five separate clawed toes to their total disappearance; yet even limbless
                    lizards retain rudiments of the osseous framework below the skin. The motions of
                    these limbless lizards are very similar to those of snakes, which they resemble
                    in their elongate body passing into a long cylindrical and tapering tail.</p>
                <p>In a great many lizards <hi rend="italic">(Lacertidx,</hi> skinks, geckos) the
                    muscles of the several vertebral segments of the tail are so loosely connected,
                    and the axis of the vertebrae is so weak, that the tail breaks off with the
                    greatest facility. The part severed retains its muscular irritability for a
                    short time, wriggling as if it were a living creature. A lizard thus mutilated
                    does not seem to be much affected by its loss, and in a short time the part is
                    reproduced; but, whilst the muscles and also the integuments may be perfectly
                    regenerated, the osseous part always remains replaced by a cartilaginous rod,
                    without vertebral segmentation. This faculty is of great advantage to the
                    lizards endowed with it; they are either species in which the tail has no
                    special function, such as to assist in a particular kind of locomotion or to
                    serve as a weapon of defence, or they are small species which lack other means
                    of escape from their numerous enemies. The geckos are even able to throw off
                    their tail spontaneously, and are said to do this frequently when pursued by
                    some other animal, which is satisfied with capturing the wriggling member,
                    whilst the owner saves its life by a rapid flight.</p>
                <p>The majority of lizards are carnivorous, the larger feeding on small mammals,
                    birds, fishes, and eggs, the smaller on insects, worms, and other invertebrates.
                    Not a few, however, are herbivorous, as the larger leguans, and many agamas.
                    This difference in diet is quite independent of modifications of dentition.
                    Generally the teeth are simply <pb break="no"

                    notched at the top or sides. Always anchylosed with the bone, they are inserted

                        >(acrodontes').</hi> The form of the tongue exhibits many modifications
                    which have been used for the division of the order into families, as will be
                    seen from the systematic list given below.</p>
                <p>All lizards are oviparous, the eggs being of an oval shape, and covered with a
                    hard or leathery calcareous shell. The number of eggs laid is, in comparison
                    with other reptiles small, perhaps never exceeding forty, and some, like the
                    anolis and geckos, deposit only one or two at a time, but probably the act of
                    oviposition is repeated in these lizards at frequent intervals. The parents do
                    not take care of their progeny, and leave the eggs to hatch where they were
                    deposited. In a few lizards, however, the eggs are retained in the oviduct until
                    the embryo is fully developed; these species, then, bring forth living young,
                    and are called <hi rend="italic">ovoviviparous.</hi></p>
                <p>No lizard is venomous, with, perhaps, a single exception <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Heloderma)</hi> to be mentioned hereafter.</p>
                <p>The order of lizards may be divided into the following suborders and families

                <p>This list, from which many subgenera have been excluded, will give an idea of the
                    wide distribution of the order of lizards, and of the great variety of forms
                    which it comprises. Indeed, in both respects, it far surpasses the other orders
                    of reptiles. The scope of the present article does not permit us to enter into
                    further taxonomic details, but a few notes may be added on some lizards, to
                    which special interest is attached, or of which most frequent mention is made in
                    general literature.</p>
                <p>The first family, that of <hi rend="italic">Monitaridae,</hi> comprises very
                    large lizards, the largest exceeding a length of 6 feet. Some are terrestrial,
                    others semi-aquatic, the former having a rounded the latter a compressed tail
                    with a sharp, saw-like upper edge, which assists them greatly in swimming, and
                    at the same time forms a formidable weapon with which these powerful animals can
                    inflict deep wounds on the incautious captor. They range all over Africa, the
                    Indian region, and Australia; their prey consists of other vertebrate animals,
                    small mammals, birds, frogs, fishes, and eggs. The young are prettily spotted
                    with white and black ocelli, the old ones having a plainer coloration. The
                    Monitor of the Nile <hi rend="italic">(Monitor ηiloticus,</hi> fig. 1) is an
                    aquatic species, found in the neighbourhood of all large rivers of tropical
                    Africa. The Arabs know it well under the name <hi rend="italic">Waran</hi>
                    (whence the generic name <hi rend="italic">Varanus</hi> is derived), and it
                    frequently appears also among the engravings and hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt.
                    Some respect was and still is paid to it, as it is said to prey largely on the
                    eggs of crocodiles. Another Monitor, the <hi rend="italic">Waran</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">el ard</hi> of the Arabs <hi rend="italic">(Psarnmosaurus
                        scincus),</hi> also inhabits North Africa, but is strictly terrestrial, and
                    has a rounded tail.</p>
                <p>Most of the European lizards with four well-developed limbs belong to the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Lacerta.</hi> They are of small size, and insectivorous.
                    Their tongue is deeply cleft at the end, and is frequently exserted when the
                    animal is in a state of excitement from fear or anger. As in all the lizards of
                    the family <hi rend="italic">Lacertidae,</hi> their tail is easily broken, and
                    as readily reproduced, the reproduced portion often assuming a monstrous or
                    double shape, so that the animal appears to be provided with two tails. Only
                    three species occur in Great Britain (see fig, 2). The Common Lizard <hi
                        rend="italic">(Lacerta</hi><hi rend="italic">vivipara)</hi> frequents heaths
                    and banks in England and Scotland, and is locally met with also in Ireland; it
                    is ovoviviparous. Much scarcer is the second species, the Sand-Lizard <hi
                        rend="italic">(Lacerta agili</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> s</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> ι</hi> which is confined to
                    some localities in the south of England, the New Forest and its vicinity; it
                    does not appear to attain on English soil to the same size as on the Continent,
                    where it abounds growing sometimes to a length of 9 inches. Singularly, <hi
                        rend="italic">α</hi> snake <hi rend="italic">(Goronella</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">laevis),</hi> also common on the Continent, and feeding
                    principally on this lizard, has followed it across the British Channel,
                    apparently existing in those localities only in which the sand-lizard has
                    settled. This lizard is oviparous. The males differ by their brighter green
                    ground colour from the females, which are brown, spotted with black. The third
                    British species, the Green Lizard <hi rend="italic">(Lacerta</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">viridis),</hi> does not occur in England proper; it has found
                    a congenial home in the island of Guernsey, but is there much less developed as
                    regards size and beauty than in the countries south of the Alps and Pyrenees.
                    This species is larger than the two preceding; <pb break="no"

                    Germany and France one other species only <hi rend="italic">(Lacerta</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">muralis)</hi> appears; but in the south of Europe the species
                    of <hi rend="italic">Lacerta</hi> are much more numerous, the largest and finest
                    being <hi rend="italic">L. ocellata,</hi> which grows to a length of 18 or 20
                    inches, and is brilliantly green, ornamented with blue eye-like spots on the
                    sides. Even the small island-rocks of the Mediterranean, sometimes only a few
                    hundred yards in diameter, are occupied by peculiar races of lizards, which of
                    late years have attracted much attention from the fact that they, like other
                    reptiles, have assumed under such isolated conditions a more or less dark,
                    almost black, coloration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Helodcrma</hi><hi rend="italic">horridum</hi> is a Mexican
                    lizard, which in its native country has the reputation of being a most poisonous
                    reptile. Its anterior teeth are, indeed, provided with a deep groove, as in many
                    poisonous snakes, and the submaxillary gland is enormously developed. Sumichrast
                    has recently proved by actual experiment on mammals the fatal effects of the
                    bite of this lizard; and J. Stein, a traveller in Mexico, who was bitten in the
                    finger, suffered from symptoms similar to those resulting from the bite of a
                    poisonous snake. It thus appears that the fear in which it is held by the
                    natives is not due merely to its hideous appearance, as was formerly believed.
                    Tubercles of a dirty brown and yellow colour, with which its body is covered,
                    give it the appearance of a leprous skin. It is about 20 inches long, and is
                    known by the name of “Escorpion.”</p>
                <p>The Glass-Snake <hi rend="italic">(Pseudopus pαllasii)</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Shettopusik</hi> (Russ.) is common in Dalmatia, Hungary, southern Russia,
                    and the western parts of Central Asia. Externally it resembles a snake, the fore
                    limbs being entirely absent, and the hind limbs reduced to small rudiments. It
                    attains to a length of 2 or 3 feet, and feeds on insects, worms, mice, and small
                    birds. In captivity it becomes perfectly tame. North America is inhabited by a
                    very similar glasssnake <hi rend="italic">(Ophisaurus),</hi> and North Africa by
                    a third <hi rend="italic">(Hyalosawrus).</hi> Limbless lizards are especially
                    common in Australia, but their scutellation is so different from that of the
                    glass-snakes of the northern hemisphere that they are placed in distinct
                    families, which have been noticed in the systematic list <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Pygopodidae,</hi><hi rend="italic">Aprasiidx,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Lialidae).</hi></p>
                <p>The family of skinks also includes many genera with rudimentary limbs or without
                    any, the Slow-Worm or Blind-Worm <hi rend="italic">(Anguisfragilis)</hi> being
                    the one most generally known. It is distributed over the greater part σf Europe,
                    and rarely exceeds a length of 15 inches. Its eyes, although small, are
                    perfectly developed and provided with eyelids. It is ovoviviparous; the young,
                    in the first year of their life, differ considerably from the old in their
                    coloration, the back being of a milk-white colour, with a black line down the
                    middle. In the south of Europe it gradually disappears, and its place is taken
                    by the similarly shaped <hi rend="italic">Seps,</hi> a genus distinguished from
                        <hi rend="italic">Anguis</hi> by the presence of four very small rudiments
                    of limbs, which have no function.</p>
                <p>The Skink, which has given the name to the whole family, is a small lizard <hi
                        rend="italic">(Scincus officinalis)</hi> of 6 or 8 inches in length, common
                    in arid districts of North Africa and Syria. A peculiarly wedge-shaped snout,
                    and toes provided with strong fringes, enable this animal to burrow rapidly in
                    and under the sand of the desert. In former times large quantities of it were
                    imported in a dry state into Europe for officinal purposes, the drug having the
                    reputation of being efficacious in diseases of the skin and lungs; and even now
                    it may be found in apothecaries’ shops in the south of Europe, country people
                    regarding it as a powerful aphrodisiac for cattle.</p>
                <p>Of the family <hi rend="italic">Iguanidae</hi> we refer to three genera only: <hi
                        rend="italic">—Iguana, Anolis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phrynosoma.</hi>
                    Herpetologists distinguish several species of <hi rend="italic">Iguana</hi> or
                    Leguans, which, however, do not appear to differ in their habits. They are found
                    in the forest regions of tropical America only, in the neighbourhood of water,
                    into which when frightened they jump from the overhanging branches of trees, to
                    escape capture by swimming and diving. Feeding exclusively on leaves or fruits,
                    they are themselves highly esteemed as food, and their eggs also are eagerly
                    searched for by the natives. Iguanas grow to a length of from 2 to 5 feet, and
                    are readily recognized by a row of long compressed and pointed scales which form
                    a more or less high crest along the middle of the back and tail, and by a
                    compressed and pendant dewlap at the throat. These large lizards are strictly
                    arboreal, and of a brilliant coloration, in which green prevails.</p>
                <p>The smallest lizards of this family belong to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Anolis,</hi> extremely numerous as regards species and individuals on
                    bushes and trees of tropical America,· and especially of the West Indies. They
                    offer many points of analogy to the humming birds in their distribution,
                    colours, and even disposition. Gosse (A <hi rend="italic">Naturalist's Sojourn
                        in Jamaica,</hi> pp. 75 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> has given a vivid and
                    faithful description of their manners. Hundreds may be seen on a bright day,
                    disporting themselves on the trees and fences, leaping from branch to branch,
                    fearlessly entering houses, chasing each other, or engaging in combat with some
                    rival. Like the iguanas, they (at least the males) are provided with a large,
                    expansible dewlap at the throat, which is brilliantly coloured, and which they
                    display on the slightest provocation. This appendage is merely a fold of the
                    skin, ornamental and sexual, like the wattles of the throat of a gallinaceous
                    bird; it has no cavity in its interior, and has no communication with the mouth
                    or with the respiratory organs; it is supported by the posterior horns of the
                    hyoid bone, and can be erected and spread at the will of the animal. The
                    presence of such dewlaps in lizards is always a sign of an excitable temper. The
                        <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n759/mode/1up"

                    colours in a most extraordinary degree, the brilliant iridescent hues of their
                    body passing almost in an instant into a dull sooty brown in an irritated or
                    alarmed animal. They are much fed upon by birds and snakes, and have, like all
                    small much-persecuted lizards, a fragile tail, easily reproduced. They bring
                    forth only one large egg at a time, but probably breed several times during the
                    season.</p>
                <p>The third iguanoid, <hi rend="italic">Phrynosoma,</hi> is a terrestrial form.
                    Several species are known, inhabiting the plains of southwestern America and
                    Mexico. Since the opening of the Pacific Railway, living specimens are
                    frequently sent to Europe, and sold under the name of “Californian toads.”
                    Although they belong to the same family, a greater contrast than that between
                    the nimble, slender, and longtailed <hi rend="italic">Anolis</hi> and the
                    toad-like <hi rend="italic">Phrynosoma</hi> can hardly be imagined. The body is
                    short, broad, and depressed, ending in a short tail, covered with rough
                    tubercles or spines; the short head is armed behind with long bony spikes; the
                    colours are a motley of brown, black, and yellow. Their defence against birds
                    lies chiefly in their outward appearance, as, whilst they rest quiet, they are
                    difficult to distinguish from a stone overgrown with lichen; nor have we ever
                    found their remains in the stomach of snakes, their spines proving a sufficient
                    protection against these equally formidable enemies. They are said to move with
                    rapidity in a wild state, but in confinement, especially when the animal
                    believes itself observed, their movements are extremely sluggish and their
                    manners uninteresting. It seems to be a common belief in California 'that they
                    have the power of squirting a blood-red fluid from the corner of the eye to some
                    distance; but nothing has been found, on anatomical examination, to establish
                    the correctness of this assertion. They attain a length of from 6 to 8
                    inches.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">Agamidae,</hi> which represent the iguanas in the Old
                    World, and which have been differentiated into a still greater number of
                    distinct generic forms, several genera deserve more than a merely nominal
                    notice. The perhaps most highly specialized form are the Dragons <hi
                        rend="italic">{Dracd)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> a genus of
                    small lizards from the East Indies, more common in the archipelago than on the
                    continent, but absent in Ceylon. The character by which they are at once
                    recognized is the peculiar additional apparatus for locomotion, formed by the
                    much-prolonged five or six hind ribs, which are connected by a broad expansible
                    fold of the skin, the whole forming a subsemicircular wing on each side of the
                    body. The snakes are the only order of vertebrates in which the ribs serve as
                    organs of locomotion, but, whilst in that order all the ribs are charged with a
                    function for which no other special organ exists, in the dragons only a part of
                    the ribs are modified for the purpose of assisting four well-developed limbs.
                    The dragons are tree-lizards; they take long flying leaps from branch to branch,
                    supported in the air by their expanded parachutes, which are laid backwards at
                    the sides of the animal while it is sitting or merely running. If the hind or
                    fore limbs of a dragon, were cut off, it would be helpless, and deprived of
                    locomotion, but it could continue to move with velocity after the loss of its
                    wings. Like the anolis, whose analogues they are in the Old World, they are
                    provided with long highly ornamented dewlaps. These appendages are found in both
                    sexes, one in the middle and one on each side of the throat, but they are much
                    more developed in the mature male. The tail is very long and slender, not
                    fragile; we have never seen a dragon in which this member was mutilated; it
                    seems to be necessary for their peculiar locomotion, and probably its loss soon
                    proves fatal to the animal. Cantor says that the transcendent beauty of their
                    colours baffles description.</p>
                <p>As the lizard lies in the shade along the trunk of a tree, its colours at a
                    distance appear as a mixture of brown and grey, and render it scarcely
                    distinguishable from the bark. Thus it remains with no signs of life except the
                    restless eyes watching passing insects, which, suddenly expanding its wings, it
                    seizes with a sometimes considerable unerring leap. All the species attain a
                    length of 7 or 8 inches, of which the tail takes at least one half. They deposit
                    three or four eggs at a time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Calotes</hi> is another genus of agamoids peculiar to the East
                    Indies; it comprises numerous species well known in India by the name of
                    “blood-suckers,” a designation the origin of which cannot satisfactorily be
                    traced. They are tree-lizards, extremely variable in their colours, which
                    change, not only with the season, but also at the will of the animal. The males,
                    and in some species also the females, possess a crest of compressed scales along
                    the back.</p>
                <p>Of the Australian agamas no other genus is so numerously represented and widely
                    distributed as <hi rend="italic">Grammatophora,</hi> the species of which grow
                    to a length of from 8 to 18 inches. Their scales are generally rough and
                    spinous; but otherwise they possess no strikingly distinguishing peculiarity,
                    unless the loose skin of their throat, which is transversely folded and capable
                    of inflation, be regarded as such. On the other hand, two other Australian
                    agamoids have attained some celebrity by their grotesque appearance, due to the
                    extraordinary development of their integuments. One (fig. 5) is the Frilled
                    Lizard <hi rend="italic">{Chlamydosaurus),</hi> which is restricted to
                    Queensland and the north coast, and grows to a length of 2 feet, including the
                    long tapering tail. It is provided with a frill-like fold of the skin round the
                    neck, which, when erected, resembles a broad collar, not unlike the gigantic
                    lace-collars of Queen <pb break="no"

                    the observation that this lizard when startled, rises with the forelegs off the
                    ground, and squats and jumps in kangaroofashion, thus reminding us of the
                    peculiar locomotion ascribed to certain gigantic extinct reptiles. The other
                    lizard is one which most appropriately has been called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Moloch</hi><hi rend="italic">horridus.</hi> It is covered with large and
                    small spinebearing tubercles; the head is small, and the tail short. It is
                    sluggish in its movements, and so harmless that its armature and (to a casual
                    observer) repulsive appearance are its sole means of defence. It grows only to a
                    length of 10 inches, and is not uncommon in the flats of South and West
                    Australia.</p>
                <p>The majority of the ground-agamas, and the most common species of the plains,
                    deserts, or rocky districts of Africa and Asia, belong to the genera <hi
                        rend="italic">Stellio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Agama.</hi> They resemble
                    much the <hi rend="italic">Grammatophora</hi> of the Australian region, their
                    scales being mixed with larger prominent spines, which in some species are
                    particularly developed on the tail, and disposed in whorls. Nearly all
                    travellers in the north of Africa mention the <hi rend="italic">Hardh6n</hi> of
                    the Arabs <hi rend="italic">{Stellio</hi><hi rend="italic">cordylimιs),</hi>
                    which is extremely common, and has drawn upon itself the hatred of the
                    Mohammedans by its habit of nodding its head, which they interpret as a mockery
                    of their own movements whilst engagedin prayer. <hi rend="italic">Uromastyx</hi>
                    is one of the largest and most developed genera of ground-agamas, and likewise
                    found in Africa and Asia. The body is uniformly covered with granular scales,
                    whilst the short, strong tail is armed with powerful spines disposed in whorls.
                    The Indian species (<hi rend="italic">U. harderickii)</hi> feeds on herbs only;
                    the African species probably take mixed food.</p>
                <p>The Chamaeleons are almost peculiar to the African region, and most numerous in
                    Madagascar, where out of the thirty-six species known not less than seventeen
                    occur. Only one species (C*. <hi rend="italic">vulgaris)</hi> extends into India
                    and Ceylon. No other member of the order of lizards shows such a degree of
                    specialization as the chamaeleons. The tongue, eyes, limbs, tail, skin, lungs
                    are modified in a most extraordinary manner to serve special functions in the
                    peculiar economy of these animals. They lead an exclusively arboreal life; each
                    of their feet is converted into a grasping hand, by means of which, assisted by
                    a long prehensile tail, they hold so fast to a branch on which they are sitting
                    that they can only with difficulty be dislodged. Their movements are slow on the
                    ground, and still more so in the water, where they are nearly helpless. As in
                    ant-eaters, woodpeckers, or frogs, their tongue is the organ with which they
                    catch their prey; it is exceedingly long, worm-like, with a clubshaped viscous
                    end; they shoot it out of the mouth with incredible rapidity towards insects,
                    which remain attached to it, and are thus caught. The globular eyes are covered
                    with a circular lid pierced by a small central hole, and are so prominent that
                    more than one-half of the ball stands out of the head. Not only can they be
                    moved in any direction, but each has an action independent of the other; one eye
                    may be looking forwards, whilst an object behind the animal is examined with the
                    other. The lungs of the chamaeleons are very capacious, and are inflated when
                    the animal is angry or frightened. The faculty of changing colour, which they
                    have in common with many other lizards, is partly dependent on the degree in
                    which the lungs are filled with air, and different layers of chromatophores are
                    pressed towards the outer surface of the skin. Some species are only a few
                    inches long, whilst others attain to a length of 18 and 20 inches. The majority
                    are oviparous, a few ovoviviparous.</p>
                <p>Almost all the lizards belonging to the family of <hi rend="italic">Geckos</hi>
                    may be recognized at first sight; the head is broad and depressed, the eyes
                    large, the body depressed; the tail is thick at the base, tapering, generally
                    somewhat deformed, as a specimen is rarely met with in which this member is not
                    reproduced. The limbs are stout, rather short, with at least four of the toes
                    well developed. Geckos are found in almost every part of the globe between and
                    near the tropics, frequenting houses, rocks, and trees; and some of the species
                    are so numerous around and within human dwellings as to be most familiar objects
                    to the inhabitants. Many are able to run up and along the surface of a wall or
                    of any other perpendicular object; for this purpose the lower surface of their
                    toes is provided with a series of movable plates or disks,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The mechanism resembles in some the
                            adhesive organ of <hi rend="italic">Echeneis</hi> or sucking-fish, in

                    adhere to the surface over which they pass. In forest-species this apparatus is
                    generally less developed, or entirely absent, claws being of greater use for
                    walking up the rough bark of a tree. Geckos, with few exceptions, are nocturnal
                    and, consequently, large-eyed animals, the pupil being generally contracted in a
                    vertical direction, shaped like two rhombs placed with the angles towards each
                    other. They are of small size, the largest species not exceeding 10 or 14 inches
                    in length. They are carnivorous, destroying moths and all kinds of insects, and
                    even the younger and weaker members of their own species. They have been seen
                    devouring the skin which they cast off, and <pb break="no"

                    fierce disposition, frequently fighting among themselves; but house-geckos
                    readily become habituated to the presence of man; accustomed to be fed at a
                    certain time with rice, these little lizards will punctually make their
                    appearance, and fearlessly take the proffered food. Another peculiarity of
                    geckos is that they, or at least some genera, are endowed with a voice. The
                    large <hi rend="italic">Gecko</hi><hi rend="italic">guttatus</hi> and <hi

                    sounding like “tokee” or “tok.” The common species found in houses in the south

                    and <hi rend="italic">Tarentola,</hi> the terrentola of the Italians. All geckos
