                    right bank of the estuary of the Mersey, about three miles from the open sea.
                    The form of the city is that of an irregular semicircle, having the base line
                    formed by the docks and quays extending about six miles along the east bank of
                    the estuary, which here runs nearly north and south, and is about a mile in
                    breadth. On the north the city is bounded by the borough of Bootle, along which
                    the line of docks is continued. The area of the city is 5210 acres.</p>

                    the Bunter stratification of the New Red Sandstone, overlying the Coal-measures,
                    which rise up some distance to the eastward. In the lower districts there is a
                    deposit of boulder clay, which has been extensively used for the manufacture of
                    bricks. The sandstone rises in long ridges to the eastward, in the highest
                    points about 250 feet above the sea-level. The city therefore lies on a
                    continuous slope varying in gradient, but in some districts very steep. Exposed
                    to the western sea breezes, with a dry subsoil and excellent natural drainage,
                    the site is naturally salubrious, but neglect and perverseness have in past
                    times done much to neutralize these advantages. The old borough, lying between
                    the pool and the river, was a conglomeration of narrow alleys and mean houses
                    packed together without any regard to sanitary provisions; and during the 16th
                    and 17th centuries it was several times visited by the plague, which carried off
                    many of the inhabitants. When the town burst its original limits, and expanded
                    up the slopes beyond, a better state of things began to exist. The older parts
                    of the town have at successive periods been entirely taken down and renovated.
                    The streets of shops—Church Street, Bold Street, Ac.—are equal in display to
                    similar establishments in London. The commercial part of the city is remarkable
                    for the number of palatial-looking piles of offices, built of hewn stone,
                    principally in the Italian Renaissance style, amongst which the banks and
                    insurance offices stand pre eminent. The <pb break="no"

                    the present century led to the construction of what are called “courts,” being
                    narrow <hi rend="italic">culs de sac,</hi> close packed, with no thorough
                    ventilation. This, combined with the degraded habits of a population brought
                    together indiscriminately, resulted in a very high rate of mortality, to contend
                    with which enormous sums have been expended in sanitary reforms of various
                    kinds. The more modern cottages, erected on the higher grounds, are all that can
                    be desired for that class of habitation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parks.—</hi> The public parks of Liverpool now form a prominent
                    feature in the aspect of the town. The earliest, the Prince’s Park, was laid out
                    in 1843 by private enterprise. Sefton Park, the most extensive, containing about
                    400 acres, was commenced in 1865, and completed at a cost Of £410,000. A large
                    portion of the land round the margin has been leased for the erection of villas.
                    Wavertree, Newsham, Sheil, and Stanley Parks have also been constructed at the
                    public expense. Connected with Wavertree Park are the botanic gardens, with the
                    usual plant houses, and a large and lofty palm house. The suburbs are rapidly
                    extending, and those on the south contain many good private residences. A
                    boulevard, about a mile in length, planted with trees in the centre, leads to
                    the entrance to Prince’s Park.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Public Buildings.—</hi> The old town has been so completely
                    renovated during the present century that scarcely any of the public buildings
                    date from an earlier period.</p>
                <p>The earliest, and in many respects the most interesting, is the town-hall in
                    Castle Street. This was erected from the designs of John Wood, the architect of
                    the squares and crescents of Bath, and was opened in 1754. The building has
                    since undergone considerable alterations and extensions, but the main features
                    remain unchanged. It is a classical rectangular stone building in the Corinthian
                    style, with an advanced portico in front, and crowned with a lofty dome
                    surmounted by a seated statue of Minerva. The interior was destroyed by fire in
                    1795, and was entirely remodelled in the restoration. It now contains a splendid
                    suite of apartments, including a ball-room about 100 feet by GO, approached by a
                    noble staircase. The building is occupied by the mayor as the municipal mansion
                    house. A range of municipal offices was erected in Dale Street in 1860. The
                    building is in the Palladian style, of considerable extent and imposing design,
                    with a dominating tower and square pyramidal spire.</p>
                <p>The crowning architectural feature of Liverpool is St George’s Hall, completed in
                    1854. The original intention was to erect a music hall suited for the triennial
                    festivals which had been periodically hel 1 in the town. About the <pb
                        break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n737/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0737-0714"/> same time the corporation proposed to erect
                    law courts for the assizes, which had been transferred to Liverpool and
                    Manchester. In the competitive designs, the first prize was gained in both cases
                    by Harvey Lonsdale Elmes. He was employed to combine the two objects in a new
                    design, of which the present building is the outcome.</p>
                <p>The structure is one of which the city may well feel proud, and notwithstanding
                    some defects it will always hold a high and honourable place amongst the
                    erections of modern times. It is fortunate in its situation, occupying the most
                    central position in the town, and surrounded by an area sufficiently extensive
                    to exhibit its proportions to the best advantage. Another advantage it possesses
                    is that of size; there are few buildings in the country, forming a solid mass
                    under one roof, which surpass it in dimension. The plan is simple in
                    arrangement, and easily described. The centre is occupied by the great hall, 169
                    feet in length, and, with the galleries, 87 feet wide and 74 feet high, covered
                    with a solid vault in masonry. Attached to each end, and opening therefrom, are
                    the law courts. A corridor runs round the hall and the courts, communicating
                    with the various accessory rooms. Externally the east front is faced with a fine
                    portico of sixteen Corinthian columns about 60 feet in height. An advanced
                    portico of similar columns fronts the south end crowned with a pediment filled
                    with sculpture, with the inscription—</p>
                <p>“Artibus, Legibus, Consiliis Locum Municipia Constituerunt Anno Domini <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">mdcccxli.”</hi></p>
                <p>The style is Roman, but the refinement of the details is suggestive of the
                    noblest period of Grecian art.</p>
                <p>The great hall is finished with considerable richness in polished granite
                    columns, marble balustrades and pavements, polished brass doors with rich
                    foliated tracery, &amp;c. The organ, built by Messrs Willis of London, from the
                    specification of Dr Samuel Wesley, is equal to any in the country for extent,
                    power, and beauty of tone. Mr Elmes, a young architect of great promise, having
                    died during the progress of the work, the building was completed by the late Mr
                    C. R. Cockerell, R.A.</p>
                <p>Next to the public buildings belonging to the city, the most important is the
                    exchange, forming three sides of a quadrangle, adjoining the town-hall on the
                    north side. The town-hall was originally built to combine a mercantile exchange
                    with municipal offices, but the merchants perversely preferred to meet in the
                    open street adjoining. This, with other circumstances, led to the erection of
                    the new exchange, a building of considerable merit, which was commenced in 1803
                    and opened in 1808. It had scarcely been in use for more than fifty years when
                    it was found that the wants of commerce had outstripped the accommodation, and
                    the structure was taken down to make room for the present building, in which
                    greater convenience has been attained, with considerable sacrifice of aesthetic
                    effect.</p>
                <p>The revenue buildings, commenced in 1828, on the site of the original Liverpool
                    Dock, combine the customs, inland revenue, post-office, and dock board
                    departments. It is a huge heavy structure, with three advanced porticoes in the
                    Ilyssus Ionic style. Near by stands the sailors’ home, a large building in the
                    Semi-Gothic or Elizabethan style.</p>
                <p>The Philharmonic Hall in Hope Street, with not much pretension externally, is one
                    of the finest music rooms in the kingdom; it accommodates an audience of about
                    2500.</p>
                <p>The group of buildings forming the free public library, museum, and gallery of
                    art are finely situated on the brow of the slope opposite St George’s Hall. The
                    library and gallery of art are separate buildings connected by the circular
                    reading-room in the middle. The latter possesses some novelties in construction,
                    having a circular floor 100 feet in diameter without columns or any intermediate
                    support, and a lecture-room underneath, amphitheatrical in form, with grades or
                    benches hewn out of the solid rock.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> There are three passenger stations in Liverpool
                    the London and North-Western, the Lancashire and Yorkshire, and the combined
                    station of the Midland, Great Northern, and Manchester and Sheffield. The rapid
                    increase of traffic has led to large extensions of the NorthWestern, and a very
                    large addition to the Lancashire and Yorkshire is in progress (1882). The tunnel
                    under the Mersey now in course of construction will give access for the Great
                    Western and Cumbrian systems into Liverpool.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water and Gas Supply.—</hi> The original supply of water was
                    from wells in the sandstone rock, but in 1846 an Act was passed, under which
                    extensive works were constructed at Rivington, about 25 miles distant, by which
                    a much larger supply was obtained. The vast increase of population led to
                    further requirements, and in 1880 another Act gave power to impound the waters
                    of the Vyrnwy, one of the affluents of the Severn. This scheme which, it is
                    expected, will give a copious supply for many years to come, is now being
                    carried out. The gas-works are the property of a company. Efforts have been made
                    to effect a purchase by the city, but hitherto without success.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration of Justice.—</hi> The city has quarter sessions
                    for criminal cases, presided over by the recorder, but the sessions are really
                    held eight times in the year. The court of passage for civil cases is a very
                    ancient institution, dating from the foundation of the borough by King John,
                    originally intended for cases arising out of the imports and exports passing
                    through. Its jurisdiction has been confirmed and settled by parliament, and it
                    is now competent, by consent, to try causes to any amount. The mayor is
                    nominally the president, but the actual judge is an assessor appointed by the
                    crown. There are two police courts which sit daily, one presided over by the lay
                    magistracy, the other by the stipendiary magistrate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical.—</hi> The parish, which was separated from
                    Walton-on-the-Hill in 1699, contained two churches, St Nicholas, the ancient
                    chapel, and St Peter’s, then built. There were two rectors, the living being
                    held in medieties. Of recent years changes have been sanctioned by parliament.
                    The living is now held by a single incumbent, and a large number of the churches
                    which have since been built have been formed into parishes by the ecclesiastical
                    commissioners. St Peter’s has been constituted the procathedral, pending the
                    erection of a more suitable building. Besides the two original parish churches,
                    there are sixtyseven others belonging to the establishment.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholics form a very numerous and powerful body in the city, and it is
                    estimated that from a third to a fourth of the entire population are Catholics.
                    A large part of these are Irish settlers or their descendants, but this district
                    of Lancashire has always been a stronghold of Catholicism, many of the landed
                    gentry belonging to old Catholic families.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charities.—</hi> These are numerous, and are maintained with no
                    niggardly hand. The earliest foundation is the Blue Coat hospital, established
                    in 1708, for orphans and fatherless children born within the borough. The
                    building, erected in 1717, is a quaint and characteristic specimen of the
                    architecture of the period. It now maintains two hundred and fifty boys and one
                    hundred girls. There is an orphan asylum, established in 1840, for boys, girls,
                    and infants, and a seamen’s orphan asylum, commenced in 1858, for boys and
                    girls. The Roman Catholics have similar establishments. The medical charities
                    are large and flourishing. The royal infirmary has had a school of medicine
                    attached, which has been very successful, and is now merged in the new
                    University College. The medical charities are aided by simultaneous collections
                    in the churches and chapels on “Hospital Sunday,” the first Sunday in the year,
                    the amount averaging about £10,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literature, Art, and Science.—</hi> The free library, museum,
                    and gallery of arts, established and managed by the city council, was originated
                    in 1850. The library building was erected by Sir William Brown at a cost of
                    £40,000. The Derby museum, containing the collections of Edward, the thirteenth
                    earl, were presented by his son. The Mayer museum of historical antiquities and

                    erected the art gallery which bears his name at an expense of .£35,000. The
                    Picton circular reading-room, and the Rotunda lecture-room were built by the
                    corporation at the cost of £25,000. The library contains nearly 100,000 volumes.
                    An annual exhibition of paintings has been established, the sales from which
                    average about £12,000 per annum. A permanent gallery has also been formed, which
                    is now being enlarged at a cost of about £12,000.</p>
                <p>The literary and philosophical society was established in 1812, and still
                    flourishes. There are also philomathic, geological, chemical, historic, and
                    various other societies for the cultivation of almost every branch of knowledge
                    and inquiry. An art club has been established with great success, and possesses
                    an excellent club-house and gallery. The royal institution, established by
                    Roscoe in 1817, possesses a fine gallery of early art, and is the centre of the
                    various literary institutions of the town.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Education.—</hi> Elementary education has always met with
                    cordial support in Liverpool, and is now carried on with vigour by the school
                    board, supplemented by voluntary schools. For middle class and higher education
                    there have existed for many years three institutions, which have been very
                    successful, viz., the school attached to the royal institution, the collegiate
                    institution in Shaw Street, and the Liverpool institute high schooL A further
                    effort has been successfully made resulting in the foundation of University
                    College, the inaugural meeting of which was held on January 14,1882. This
                    college is affiliated to the Victoria university of the north-west of England.
                    The sum of £135,000 has been raised by voluntary subscription, to which £30,000
                    have been contributed by the corporation. Seven chairs have been endowed, and
                    professors appointed, and a suitable building has been provided.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Recreation and Social Life.—</hi> There are eight theatres,
                    besides many minor music halls and places of amusement. The most fashionable and
                    exclusive is the Philharmonic Hall, which is a large handsome building open only
                    to proprietors, where concerts take place every fortnight during the season. The
                    Philharmonic concerts, and the balls at the Wellington Rooms (the Almacks of
                    Liverpool), afford the principal opportunities for the gatherings of the
                    fashionable world. The Alexandra theatre, the new Court theatre, the Prince of
                    Wales theatre, and Hengler’s cirque are all that could be desired in point of
                    decoration and the <hi rend="italic">mise en</hi><hi rend="italic">scene.</hi>
                    The minor houses are conducted on the whole with great propriety and

                <p>If the boroughs of Bootle and Birkenhead, which are component parts of the port,

                    million.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Trade, and Commerce.—</hi> The progress of the commerce of
                    Liverpool during the present century is almost without a parallel. In 1800 the
                    tonnage of ships entering the port was 450,060; in 1880 it reached 7,933,620
                    tons. In 1800 4746 vessels entered, averaging 94 tons; in 1880 there were
                    20,249, averaging 440 tons. The only British port which can at all come into
                    competition with Liverpool is London, the total trade of which, comprising
                    exports and imports, amounted in 1880 to 16,479,108 tons, against 14,496,364 in
                    Liverpool. A large proportion of this, however, is a coasting trade, indicated
                    by the smaller size of the ships, averaging 240 tons each in London as compared
                    with 440 tons in Liverpool. The coasting trade in Liverpool has rather fallen
                    off owing to the superior advantages of railway traffic. The proportion of
                    steamers to sailing ships has very largely increased of late years. The return
                    for 1881 gives 5,534,462 tons of steam navigation to 2,379,466 tons in sailing
                    ships. If we take the value of the imports as a criterion, London is far in
                    advance of Liverpool, the values in 1880 being £141,442,907 and £107,460,187,
                    but the London imports consist, to a great extent, of very valuable commodities,
                    such as tea, silk, indigo, wines, &amp;c., whilst the Liverpool imports
                    principally consist of grain, food, and raw produce, the materials for
                    manufacture. If we look at the exports the balance is reversed, Liverpool, in
                    1880, having exported the value of £84,029,651, against £52,600,929 from London.
                    In the number of ships registered as belonging to the port, Liverpool stands
                    first in the world, the tonnage belonging to Liverpool being 1,554,871, against
                    1,120,359 in London, and 1,005,894 in the whole of the ports on the Clyde.</p>
                <p>The commerce of Liverpool extends to every part of the world, but probably the
                    intercourse with America stands pre-eminent, there being five lines of steamers
                    to New York alone, besides lines to Philadelphia, Boston, Halifax, Canada, New
                    Orleans, &amp;c. The size of the ships has greatly increased, having reached
                    8000 tons burden, with 10,000 horse-power.</p>
                <p>The imports into Liverpool comprise produce of every description from every
                    region under the sun. Cotton, however, is the great staple, almost the whole
                    trade of the commodity centring here. Grain comes next, American and Australian
                    com occupying a large proportion of the market. Within the last few years an
                    enormous trade in American provisions, including live cattle, has sprung up.
                    Tobacco has always been a leading article of import into Liverpool, along with
                    the sugar and rum from the West Indies. Timber, principally from Canada, forms
                    an important part of the imports, the stacking yards extending for miles along
                    tne northern docks. At one time tea from China, and wool from Australia,
                    promised to be imported with advantage, but the financial arrangements with
                    London have drawn these trades almost entirely away. In regard to exports,
                    Liverpool possesses decided advantages; lying so near the great manufacturing
                    districts of Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire, this port is the
                    natural channel of transmission for their goods, and, if everything else fails,
                    there are always coal and salt from Wales and Cheshire ready to make up a cargo.
                    The consequence is that many ships, after discharging their homeward cargoes at
                    London and the eastern ports, come round in ballast to Liverpool for an outward
                    cargo.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures. —</hi> The manufactures of Liverpool are not
                    extensive. Attempts have been repeatedly made to establish cotton-mills in and
                    near the city, but have resulted in uniform failure. Engineering works,
                    especially as connected with marine navigation, have naturally grown up, and
                    have been carried on successfully on a large scale. Shipbuilding, in the days of
                    the old wooden walls, in the early part of the present century, was active and
                    prosperous, several frigates and sloops-of-war for Government having been built
                    here, but the keen competition of the Clyde and the north of England drew away a
                    large portion of the trade. There are now four shipbuilding establishments on
                    the Mersey. In the year 1880-81 there were launched from these yards
                    thirty-three iron ships, with a tonnage of 53,971 tons. At one period the soap
                    manufacture filled a large space in the industry of Liverpool, but it has almost
                    entirely departed. During the latter half of last century and the beginning of
                    the present, the pottery and china manufacture flourished in Liverpool. John
                    Sadler, a Liverpool manufacturer, was the inventor of printing on pottery, and
                    during the early period of Josiah Wedgwood’s career, all his goods which
                    required printing had to be sent to Liverpool. A large establishment, called the
                    Herculaneum Pottery, was founded in a suburb on the bank of the Mersey, and was
                    carried on with success for many years, but the whole trade has long
                    disappeared. One manufacture, established at an early period, still continues to
                    flourish—the watch and chronometer trade. Litherland, the inventor of the lever
                    watch, was a Liverpool manufacturer, and Liverpool-made watches have always been
                    held in high estimation. There are several extensive sugar refineries, and two
                    large tobacco manufactories.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Docks.—</hi> The docks of Liverpool on both sides of the Mersey
                    are under the same trust and management, and equally form part of the port of
                    Liverpool. On the Liverpool side they extend along the margin of the estuary 6∣
                    miles, of which 1⅛ miles is in the borough of Bootle. The Birkenhead docks have
                    not such a frontage, but they extend a long way backward. The water area of the
                    Liverpool docks and basins is 333⅜ acres, with a lineal quayage of 22 miles. The
                    Birkenhead docks, including the great float of 120 acres, contain a water area
                    of 160 acres, with a lineal quayage of 9 miles. The system of floating docks was
                    commenced by the corporation in 1709. With the advancing demands of commerce the
                    docks were extended north and south. They constituted from the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n739/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0739-0716"/> first a public trust, the corporation never
                    having derived any revenue from them, though the common council of the borough
                    were the trustees, and in the first instance formed the committee of management.
                    Gradually the dock ratepayers acquired influence, and were introduced into the
                    governing body, and ultimately, by the Act of 1856, the corporation was entirely
                    superseded. Under the present constitution, the management is vested in the
                    Mersey Docks and Harbour Board, consisting of twenty-eight members, two of whom
                    are nominated by the Board of Trade and the rest elected by the dock ratepayers,
                    of whom a register is kept and annually revised. The affairs of the board are of
                    considerable magnitude. The revenue is derived from tonnage rates on ships, dock
                    rates on goods, town dues on goods, with various minor sources of income. These
                    amounted in the year ending July 1, 1881, to £1,226,497. The amount of debt
                    outstanding is £16,284,881, for which a rate of interest averaging 4∣ per cent,
                    is paid.</p>
                <p>Down to 1843 the docks were confined to the Liverpool side of the Mersey. Several
                    attempts made to establish docks in Cheshire had been frustrated by the
                    Liverpool corporation, who bought up the land and kept it in their own hands. In
                    1843 a scheme was privately concocted for the construction of docks at
                    Birkenhead. Plans were prepared by Mr Bendel, C.E., the money subscribed, and
                    arrangements made with the Admiralty,—the corporation being kept in ignorance of
                    the proceedings. Application was then made by private individuals to purchase
                    200,000 square yards of land on the margin of an inlet called Wallasey Pool. The
                    common council, which had been reformed in 1836, innocently fell into the snare,
                    and in the ensuing session of parliament a rival scheme of docks for Birkenhead
                    was brought out and passed. The great expectations which were entertained of
                    their successful competition with Liverpool have been signally falsified. After
                    a twelve years’ struggle and litigation, the Birkenhead dock affairs had fallen
                    into a hopeless state of insolvency, without any prospect of recovery, and in
                    1855 the docks were transferred to the corporation of Liverpool on payment to
                    the bondholders of 13s. in the pound on their claims. Under the Act of 1856,
                    settling the future constitution of the dock board, the Birkenhead docks were
                    transferred to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board. The result on the whole has
                    been disastrous. The amount expended on the Birkenhead docks down to 1881 has
                    been nearly 6 millions. The returns for this immense outlay do little more than
                    defray the working expenses, the difference having to be made up from the
                    revenue on the Liverpool side,—so that, in consequence of this unfortunate
                    rivalry, the shipping frequenting the port is taxed to the amount of £270,000
                    per annum, which otherwise might have been remitted. The Birkenhead great float,
                    of 120 acres, though it contributes little to the revenue, is valuable as a
                    depot for ships lying up, so as not to interfere with the working docks. In
                    addition to the floating docks, there are in Liverpool eighteen graving docks
                    and three in Birkenhead, and two gridirons on the Liverpool side.</p>
                <p>The great landing stage of Liverpool is unique in its dimensions and utility. It
                    was originally constructed in 1857, from the plans of Mr J. Cubitt, and greatly
                    enlarged and extended in 1874, making the entire cost £373,000. The grand fabric
                    had just been completed, and was waiting to be inaugurated by the duke of
                    Edinburgh, when on the 28th July 1874 it accidentally caught fire, and, the
                    timber being impregnated with kreosote, the flames spread with unexampled
                    rapidity, and in a few hours the whole was destroyed. It was again constructed
                    with improvements. Its length is 2063 feet, or about ⅜ths of a mile, and its
                    breadth 80 feet. It is supporte 1 on floating pontoons rising and falling with
                    the tide, connected with the quay by seven bridges, besides a floating bridge
                    for heavy traffic 550 feet in length. The southern half is devoted to the
                    traffic of the Mersey ferries, of which there are eight—New Brighton, Egremont,
                    Seacombe, Birkenhead, Tranmere, Rock Ferry, New Ferry, and Eastham. The northern
                    half is used for sea-going steamers, and for the tenders of the great “liners.”
                    The warehouses for storing produce form a very prominent feature in the
                    commercial part of the city. Down to 1841 these were entirely in private hands,
                    distributed as chance might direct, but in that year a determined effort was
                    made to construct docks with warehouses around, on the margin of the quays. This
                    met with considerable opposition from those interested, and led to a municipal
                    revolution, but the project was ultimately carried out in the construction of
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">λi1</hi> A . <hi rend="superscript"> er</hi> ^ dock and
                    warehouses, which were opened by Prince Albert in 1845. Other docks since
                    constructed have been similarly surrounded. The Albert warehouses form an
                    immense pile standing between the dock and the river, imposing from their huge
                    dimensions, but otherwise the very incarnation of bald ugliness.</p>
                <p>Grain warehouses on a large scale have been constructed by the dock board both at
                    Liverpool and Birkenhead. The machinery for elevating, distributing, drying, and
                    discharging is of the most complete and thorough construction. The rental
                    received from the warehouses in the year 1880-81 was £240,394.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History</hi> —There are no archaeological difficulties
                    attending the origin of the town, which is clearly defined by documentary
                    evidence, lhe part of the country in which Liverpool is situated was not very
                    distinguished in the earlier periods of English history. No Roman remains have
                    been discovered within a considerable distance. Under the Saxons the site formed
                    part of the kingdom or province of Deira, the river Mersey (Mcere-sea) forming
                    the boundary between that kingdom and Mercia. During the Danish irruptions of
                    the 8th century colonies of Norsemen made settlements on both sides of the
                    Mersey, as is indicated by the names of the villages and townships in the
                    districts. After the Conquest, the site of Liverpool formed part of the fief
                    (inter Ripam et Mersham) granted by the Conqueror to Roger de Poitou, one of the
                    great family of Montgomery. After various forfeitures and regrants from the
                    crown, it was ultimately handed over by Henry II. to Warine, the keeper of the
                    castle and prison of Lancaster. In a deed executed by King John, then earl of
                    Mortaigne, about 1190, confirming the grant of this with other manors to Henry
                    Fitzwarine, son of the former grantee, the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    the endeavour to explain its etymology. Probably the most plausible is the

                    pool,” or “the pool at the confluence,” which exactly expresses the peculiarity
                    of the original site. It is, however, open to the objection that the Welsh
                    language had died out in the locality long before Liverpool was founded.</p>
                <p>The immediate origin of Liverpool was owing to the following circumstances. After
                    the partial conquest of Ireland by Strongbow, earl of Pembroke, under Henry II.,
                    the principal ports of communication were Bristol for the south and Chester for
                    the north. The gradual silting up of the river Dee soon so obstructed the
                    navigation as to render Chester a very unsuitable place of embarkation. A quay
                    was then constructed at Shotwick, about 8 miles below Chester, with a castle to
                    protect it from the incursions of the neighbouring Welsh; but a better site was
                    sought and soon found. Into the tidal waters of the Mersey, a small stream, fed
                    by a peat moss on the elevated land to the eastward, ran in an oblique direction
                    from north-east to south-west, forming at its mouth an open pool or sea lake, of
                    which many existed on both sides of the river. The triangular piece of land thus
                    separated formed a promontory of red sandstone rock, rising in the centre about
                    50 feet above the sea-level, sloping on three sides to the water. The pool was
                    admirably adapted as a harbour for the vessels of that period, being well
                    protected, and the tide rising from 15 to 21 feet. King John repurchased the
                    manor from Henry Fitzwarine, giving him another in exchange, and here he erected
                    a castle on the usual Plantagenet plan of round bastions connected by curtain
                    walls, with an inner ballium and buildings. He also founded a town by the
                    erection of burgage tenements, one hundred and sixty-eight in number, and in
                    1207 he issued the following letter patent or charter:—</p>

                    year of our reign.”</p>
                <p>From the Patent Rolls and the sheriff’s accounts we learn that considerable use
                    was made of Liverpool in the reign of John for shipping stores and
                    reinforcements to Ireland and Wales. In 1215 the town was garrisoned for the
                    king during the rising which took place after the granting of the Great
                    Charter.</p>
                <p>In 1229 a charter of incorporation was granted by Henry III., authorizing the
                    formation of a merchants’ guild, with a hanse and other liberties and free
                    customs, with sac and soc, toll and thean, &amp;c., and freedom from toll in all
                    the other seaports. Charters were subsequently granted by successive monarchs
                    down to the reign of William and Mary, which last was the governing charter to
                    the date of the Municipal Reform Act (1835). In 1880 when the new diocese of
                    Liverpool was created, the borough was transformed into a city by royal
                    charter.</p>
                <p>The crown revenues from the burgage rents and the royal customs were leased in
                    fee-farm from time to time, sometimes to the corporation, at others times to
                    private persons. The first lease was from Henry III., in 1229, at £10 per annum.
                    In the same year the borough with all its appurtenances was bestowed, with other
                    lands, on Ranulf, earl of Chester. During the subsequent two centuries the fief
                    was repeatedly forfeited and regranted, until it finally passed into the hands
                    of John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster, and from the accession of his son Henry IV.
                    it merged in the crown. In 1628 Charles I., in great straits for means which
                    were refused by parliament, offered for sale about a thousand manors, among
                    which Liverpool was included. The portion containing<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n740/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0740-0717"/> Liverpool was purchased by certain merchants
                    of London, who, in 1632, reconveyed the crown rights, including the fee-farm
                    rent of £14, 6s. 8d., to Sir Rd. Molyneux, recently created Lord Maryborough,
                    for the sum of £450. In 1672 all these rights and interests were purchased by
                    the corporation.</p>
                <p>Apart from the national objects for which Liverpool was founded, its trade
                    developed very slowly. From £10 per annum, in the beginning of the 13th century,
                    the crown revenues had increased towards the end of the 14th century, to £38—in
                    modem currency about £570; but then they underwent a decline. The Black Death,
                    the fatal scourge of the 14th century, passed over Liverpool about 1360, and
                    carried off a large part of the population. The Wars of the Roses, in the 15th
                    century, unsettled the northwestern districts, and repressed all progress for at
                    least a century. The crown revenues diminished from £38 to less than half that
                    sum, and were finally leased at £14, 6s. 8d., at which they continued until the
                    sale by Charles I.</p>
                <p>Liverpool sent no representatives to Simon de Montfort’s parliament in 1264, but
                    to the first royal parliament, called in 1296, the borough sent two members, and
                    again in 1306. The writs of summons were then suspended for two centuries and a
                    half. During the 14th and 15th centuries nearly the whole of the returns of the
                    sheriffs of Lancaster were to the following effect :—“There is not any city or
                    borough from which any citizens or burgesses are able or accustomed to come,
                    according to the tenor of the writ, by reason of their debility and poverty.” In
                    1547 Liverpool, with the rest of the Lancashire boroughs, resumed the privilege
                    of returning members. In 1588 the borough was represented by Sir Francis Bacon,
                    the immortal philosopher and statesman. During the civil war the town was
                    fortified and garrisoned by the parliament. It sustained three sieges, and in
                    1644 was escaladed and taken by Prince Rupert with considerable slaughter.</p>
                <p>The true rise of the commerce of Liverpool dates from the Restoration. Down to
                    that period its population had been either stationary or retrogressive, never
                    exceeding about 1000 souls. Its trade was chiefly with Ireland, France, and
                    Spain, exporting fish and wool to the Continent, and importing wines, iron, and
                    other commodities. The rise of the manufacturing industry of South Lancashire,
                    and the opening of the American and West Indian trade, gave the first impulse to
                    the progress which has ever since continued. The importation of sugar led to the
                    establishment of sugar refineries, which after the lapse of two centuries
                    continue to form an important branch of local industry. By the end of the
                    century the population had increased to 5000. The town burst the narrow limits
                    within which it had hitherto been confined, and extended itself across the pool
                    stream. In 1699 the borough was constituted a parish district from Walton, to
                    which it had previously appertained. In 1709, the small existing harbour being
                    found insufficient to accommodate the shipping, several schemes were propounded
                    for its enlargement, which resιdted in the construction of a wet dock closed
                    with flood-gates impounding the water, so as to keep the vessels floating during
                    the recess of the tide. This dock in Liverpool was the first of the kind, and
                    was the parent of all the magnificent structures which have attracted the
                    admiration of the world. The name of the engineer, Thomas Steers, deserves
                    recording, as the author of the practical application of a principle already
                    known leading to a world-wide utility, of a similar class to the adaptation of
                    the railway by George Stephenson at a subsequent period.</p>
                <p>About this date the merchants of Liverpool entered upon a traffic which, however
                    questionable in point of morality, became very profitable during the remainder
                    of the century—the slave trade, into which they were led by their connexion with
                    the West Indies. In 1709 a single barque of 30 tons burden made a venture from
                    Liverpool and carried 15 slaves across the Atlantic. Little was done during the
                    next twenty years, but in 1730, encouraged by parliament, Liverpool went
                    heartily into the new trade. In 1751 53 ships sailed from Liverpool for Africa,
                    of 5334 tons in the <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> gg <hi rend="superscript">
                        re</hi> g <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> ∙tθ∙ From this time the trade set
                    in with such a steady current that it soon became one of the most lucrative
                    branches of the commerce of the port. The voyage was threefold. The ships sailed
                    from Liverpool to the west coast of Africa, where they shipped the slaves, and
                    thence to the West India Islands, where the slaves were sold and the proceeds
                    brought home in cargoes of sugar and rum. In 1765 the number of Liverpool
                    slavers had increased to 86, carrying 24,200 slaves. By the end of the century
                    five-sixths of the African trade centred in Liverpool. Just before the abolition
                    in 1807 the number of Liverpool ships engaged in the traffic was 185, carrying
                    43,755 slaves in the year.</p>
                <p>Another branch of maritime enterprise which attracted the attention of the
                    merchants of Liverpool was privateering, which during the latter half of the
                    18th century was a favourite investment. After the outbreak of the Seven Years’
                    War with France and Spain, in 1756, the commerce of Liverpool suffered severely,
                    the French having overrun the narrow seas with swift well-armed privateers, and
                    the premiums for insurance against sea risks having risen to an amount almost
                    prohibitory. The Liverpool merchants took a lesson from the enemy, and armed and
                    sent out their ships as privateers. Some of the early expeditions having proved
                    very successful, almost the whole community rushed into privateering, with
                    results of a very chequered character. When the War of Independence broke out in
                    1776 American privateers swarmed about the West India Islands, and crossing the
                    Atlantic intercepted British commerce in the narrow seas. The Liverpool
                    merchants again turned their attention to retaliation. Between August 1778 and
                    April 1779 120 privateers were fitted out in Liverpool, carrying 1986 guns and
                    8754 men. The results, though in some cases very profitable, were exceedingly
                    demoralizing.</p>
                <p>During the whole of the 18th century the commerce of Liverpool kept steadily
                    increasing in spite of external war and internal competition, and has so
                    continued to the present time. The increase of the population supplies a fair
                    index to the growth of its commerce.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Municipality.—</hi> Under the Municipal Reform Act of 1835,
                    the boundaries of the original borough were extended by the annexation of
                    portions of the surrounding district. The city is divided into sixteen wards,
                    returning three members each to the common council, with sixteen aidermen,
                    making sixty-four in all. The wards were originally divided according to
                    population, but the lapse of nearly half a century has so completely disturbed
                    the proportions that, whilst some of the wards in the commercial localities have
                    diminished in population, the Everton and Kirkdale ward, originally a rural
                    suburb, now contains a population of 150,000, with a constituency of more than
                    20,000 electors. The electoral franchise, before the Reform Act restricted to
                    the freemen, is still enjoyed by their successors, but their number is
                    exceedingly small.</p>
                <p>The arms of the city as set forth in the confirmation by the Heralds’ College, in
                    1797, are described as follows :—“Argent, a Cormorant, in the beak a branch of
                    seaweed called Laver, all proper, and for the crest, on a wreath of the colours,
                    a Cormorant, the wings elevated; in the beak a branch of Laver proper.” The
                    supporters, granted at the same time are—“The dexter Neptune with his sea-green
                    mantle flowing, the waist wreathed with Laver, on his head an eastern crown or,
                    in the right hand a trident sable, the left supporting a banner of the arms of
                    Liverpool; on the sinister a Triton wreathed as the dexter and blowing his
                    shell; all proper.” The motto is “Deus nobis haec otia fecit.”</p>
                <p>The corporation of Liverpool has possessed from a very early period considerable
                    landed property, the first grant having been made by Thomas, earl of Lancaster,
                    in 1309. This land was originally of value only as a turbary, but in modern
                    times its capacity as building land has been a fruitful source of profit to the
                    town, a large proportion of the southern district being held in freehold by the
                    corporation leased for terms of seventy-five years, renewable from time to time
                    on a fixed scale of fines. The income from this source amounted in 1879 to
                    £83,746. There was formerly another source of income now cut off. The fee farm
                    rents and town dues originally belonging to the crown were purchased from the
                    Molyneux family in 1672 on a long lease, and subsequently in 1777 converted into
                    a perpetuity. With the growth of the commerce of the port these dues enormously
                    increased, and became a cause of great complaint by the shipping interest. In
                    1856 a bill was introduced into parliament and passed, by which the town dues
                    were transferred to the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board on payment of £1,500,000,
                    which was applied in part to the liquidation of the bonded debt of the
                    corporation, amounting to £1,150,000. The town dues at that time produced
                    £132,592 per annum, which has increased in 1881 to £260,698. The markets produce
                    an income of about £12,000 clear of expenses.</p>
                <p>The council form the sanitary authority of the city, in which capacity they
                    expended in the year 1880-81 the sum of £255,738, derived from rates. In the
                    same year there was expended for lighting and watching, £75,263; for parks and
                    places of recreation, £49,178; for town improvements, £33,192. These amounts are
                    partly defrayed out of the corporate funds; the part for the constabulary is
                    paid by Government, and the rest out of rates.</p>
                <p>The mayor has an annual allowance of £2700, to sustain the dignity of his office
                    and maintain the hospitality of the town-hall.</p>
                <p>The city returns three members to parliament.</p>
                <p>The see of Liverpool was created in 1880 under the Act of 1879, by the authority
                    of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, an endowment fund of about £100,000 having
                    been subscribed for the purpose.</p>
