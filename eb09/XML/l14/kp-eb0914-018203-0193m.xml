                <p><label type="entry">LACCADIVES</label>, a group of coral reefs and islands in the
                    Indian Ocean, lying between 10° and 12° 20' N. lat. and 71° 40' and 74° E. long.
                    The name Laccadives <hi rend="italic">(faksha dwipa,</hi> the “hundred thousand
                    isles”) is that given by the people of the continent, and was probably meant to
                    include the myriad Maldives; they are called by the natives simply <hi
                    rend="italic">Divi</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> “islands,” or <hi
                    rend="italic">Amendivi,</hi> from the chief island. There are about nineteen
                    separate reefs, containing, however, only thirteen islands, and of these only
                    eight are inhabited. The islands have in nearly all cases emerged from the
                    eastern and protected side of the reef, and have gradually extended towards the
                    west over the shallow lagoon of which the rest of the space within the
                    barrier-reef consists. The islands are small, none exceeding a mile in breadth,
                    and lie so low that they would be hardly <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n194/mode/1up"

                    which they are thickly covered. The soil is light coral sand, beneath which, a
                    few feet down, lies a stratum of coral stretching over the whole of the island.
                    This coral, which is generally a foot to a foot and a half in thickness, has
                    been in the principal islands wholly excavated, whereby the underlying damp sand
                    is rendered available for cereals. These excavations—a work of vast labour—were
                    made at a remote period, and according to the native tradition by giants. In
                    these spaces <hi rend="italic">[totam</hi><hi rend="italic">=</hi> “garden ”]
                    are cultivated coarse grain, pulse, bananas, and vegetables; cocoa-nuts grow
                    abundantly everywhere, and for rice the natives depend upon the mainland.</p>

                <p>making a total for all the islands of 11,287, a dense population for so small an
                    area. Amini, Kalpeni, Androt, and Kawrati are the principal or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tarwat</hi> islands, and in them only do the high caste natives reside. The
                    others are called <hi rend="italic">melachem,</hi> or low caste islands. The
                    people are Moplas, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of mixed Hindu and Arab descent,
                    and are Mohammedans. Their manners and customs are similar to those of the coast
                    Moplas; but they maintain their own ancient caste distinctions. The language
                    spoken is Mala-yala, but it is written in the Arabic character. Reading and
                    writing are common accomplishments among the men. The chief industries are the
                    manufactures of coir and jaggery, the Laccadive coir being esteemed the best in
                    India; the various processes are entrusted to the women. The men employ
                    themselves with boat-building and in conveying the island produce to the
                    coast—in the case of the English islands to Mangalore, and in that of the bibi’s
                    islands to Cannanore. In each case the coir is taken by the ruling Government at
                    lower than market rates, and the natives are not subject to any other taxation.
                    At Mangalore they are paid partly in money and partly in rice, and the rates are
                    not altered for many years. On the other hand the varying and oppressive tariff
                    imposed upon the Cannanore islands has led to a diminished and inferior
                    manufacture of coir, and to frequent complaints. This monopoly system, however
                    fairly worked by the British Government, interferes with the trading
                    capabilities of the natives, and puts them at considerable disadvantage with
                    their rivals of Minicoy and the Maldives. The exports from the Laccadives are of
                    the annual value of £17,000.</p>
                <p>History and Government.—No data exist for determining at what period the
                    Laccadives were first colonized. The earliest mention of them as distinguished
                    from the Maldives seems to be by Albinini {circ. 1030), who divides the whole
                    archipelago (Dibajât) into the Divah Kuzah or Cowrie Islands (the Maldives), and
                    the Divah Kanbar or Coir Islands (the Laccadives). See Journ. Asiat., September
                    1844, p. 265. According to native tradition, the islands were first occupied
                    about a thousand years ago. The early polity, according to Mr Robinson, was
                    patriarchal, conducted by a modal al, or chief inhabitant, and the heads of the
                    principal families. Each island was independent. This kind of internal economy
                    seems to have lasted until the advent of the Portuguese. During their
                    independence the islanders were converted to Islam by an Arab apostle named
                    Mumba Mulyaka, whose grave at Androt still imparts a peculiar sanctity to that
                    island. The kazee of Androt was in 1847 still a member of his family, and was
                    said to be the twenty-second who had held the office in direct line from the
                    saint. This gives colour to the tradition that the conversion took place about
                    1250. It is also further corroborated by the story given by Ibn Batuta of the
                    conversion of the Maldives, which occurred, as he heard, four generations (say
                    one hundred and twenty years) before his visit to these islands in 1342. The
                    Portuguese discovered the Laccadives in 1499, and built forts upon them, but <hi
                    rend="superscript"> a</hi> bout 1545 the natives rose upon their oppressors, and
                    with the aid of the raja of Chencal exterminated them. For this aid the raja
                    obtamed the suzerainty of the group, but he afterwards conferred them upon the
                    head of the Cannanore moplas for an annual tribute. The Cannanore raja ceased to
                    pay this tribute about the middle of the 18th century. In 1784 the Amini islands
                    threw off the voke, and put themselves under the protection of Tippoo, from whom
                    at the fall of Seringapatam in 1799, they passed to the East India Company. The
                    remaining islands had already in 1791 fallen into the power of the Company by
                    the storming of Cannanore, but by the peace of Seringapatam (1792) were
                    permitted to remain under the management of the bibi at a yearly tribute. This
                    has been often in arrear, and on this account these islands have been
                    sequestrated by the British Government since 1877, to the general satisfaction
                    of the inhabitants. See Mr Robinson’s Report, Madras, 1874; Mr Hume in Stray
                    Feathers, vol. iv., 1876, Calcutta.</p>
                <p>Minicoy (called MΛliku by the natives), a small island 5 miles in length, 108
                    miles south of Kalpéni and 68 miles north of the Maldives, belongs politically
                    to the Laccadives in so far as it forms part of the estate of the bibi of
                    Cannanore. The natives, however, are of the same race and speak the same
                    language as the Maldivians. The population in 1881 was 3915. The people are well
                    behaved, but of a very independent character; they are active and enterprising
                    sailors, and lazy cultivators. They are divided into four classes, viz.,
                    rnâlikans, the aristocracy, rnalurnnies, the pilots and mates of vessels,
                    klasies, smaller landed proprietors and sailors, and mela-chcries, toddy
                    drawers. Minicoy anciently formed part of the Maidive realm, but, probably in
                    the 16tb century, was given by a Maidive sultan to his brother. In 1607, when it
                    was visited by Pyrard, it was governed by a lady who for greater security held
                    it of the raja of Cannanore (Pyrard’s Voyage, chap, xxiii.).^ The island has
                    never been restored to the Mai dive kings.</p>
