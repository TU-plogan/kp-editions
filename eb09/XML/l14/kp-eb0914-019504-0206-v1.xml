                <p><label type="entry">LACTANTIUS FIRMIANUS</label>, also called Lucius Caecilius or
                    Lucius Caelius Lactantius Firmianus, was a Christian writer who from the beauty
                    of his style has been called the “Christian Cicero.” His history is very
                    obscure. His very name is doubtful; his birthplace, whether in Italy or in
                    Africa, is uncertain; it is impossible to say with any accuracy when his
                    writings were published; and the date of his death is unknown. His parents were
                    heathens; he was a pupil of Arnobius in Sicca in Africa; he went to Nicomedia in
                    Bithynia while Diocletian was emperor to teach rhetoric, but found little work
                    to do in that Greekspeaking city; he became a convert to Christianity, probably
                    late in life; and about ten or twelve years before his death (312-318) he went
                    to Gaul on the invitation of Constantine the Great, and became tutor to his
                    eldest son Crispus. These facts, with his writings, are all that is known about
                    Lactantius. His chief work <hi rend="italic">Divinarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Institutionum Libri Septem</hi> is a long introduction to Christianity,
                    written in exquisite Latin, but displaying such ignorance as to have incurred
                    the charge of favouring the Arian and Manichaean heresies. The date of
                    publication has been variously given from 302 to 323 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    be any other than the Diocletian, was raging while the book was being written
                    (v. 17, 5); whilst in the first, second, fourth, and fifths books Constantine is
                    addressed as emperor. Those who assert the earlier date of publication point out
                    that the references to Constantine are omitted in several MSS. Others adopt the
                    conjecture of Baluze that an early edition was published in Nicomedia and a
                    later twenty years afterwards <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> Ebert, <hi

                    given to them either by the author or by a later editor. The first, <hi

                        <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine Erroris,</hi> attack the
                    polytheism of heathendom, show the unity of the God of creation and providence,
                    and try to explain how men have wandered from truth into polytheistic error. The
                    third book, <hi rend="italic">De Falsa</hi><hi rend="italic">Sapientia,</hi>
                    describes and criticizes the various systems of prevalent philosophy, showing
                    how baseless and contradictory they are. The fourth book, <hi rend="italic">De
                        Vera</hi><hi rend="italic">Sapientia et Religione,</hi> insists upon the
                    inseparable union of true wisdom and true religion, and maintains that this
                    union is made real in the person of Christ. The fifth book, <hi rend="italic"
                        >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Justitia,</hi> maintains that true righteousness
                    is not to be found apart from Christianity, and that it springs from piety which
                    consists in the knowledge of God. The sixth book, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Vero Cultu,</hi> describes the true worεhip of God, which is
                    righteousness, and consists chiefly in the exercise of Christian love towards
                    God and man. The seventh book, <hi rend="italic">De Vita Beata,</hi> discusses,
                    among a variety of subjects, the chief good, immortality, the second advent, and
                    the resurrection. Jerome tells us that Lactantius wrote an epitome of these <hi
                        rend="italic">Institutions,</hi> and such a work was discovered in the royal
                    library at Turin in 1712 by C. M. Pfaff; it is doubtful, however, whether this
                    MS. is the epitome of Lactantius. Besides the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Institutions,</hi> Lactantius wrote a treatise, <hi rend="italic">De Ira
                        Dei,</hi> addressed to one Donatus and directed against the Epicurean
                    philosophy; an argument for the wisdom and goodness of God as exhibited in the
                    creation and preservation of the world, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Opificio</hi><hi rend="italic">Dei sive de</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Formatione Hominis</hi>; and a very celebrated treatise <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Mortibus Persecutorum,</hi> which
                    describes God’s judgments on the persecutors of his church from Nero to
                    Diocletian, and has served as a model for numberless subsequent writings of a
                    like nature. <hi rend="italic">De Mort. Persecut.</hi> is not included in the
                    earlier editions of Lactantius; it was discovered and printed by Baluze in 1679.
                    Many critics do not believe it to be the work of our author, and ascribe it to
                    an unknown Lucius Caecilius (see the work of Ebert above quoted). Jerome speaks
                    of Lactantius as a poet, and several poems have been attributed to him :— <hi
                        rend="italic">De Phenice, Symposium, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Pascha</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Felicem Episcopum,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Passione</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Domini.</hi> It is extremely probable that all these are the productions of
                    a much later age.</p>
                <p>MSS. of Lactantius are very numerous; a very complete catalogue of these and of
                    the earlier printed editions will be found in Le Brun and Lenglet Dufresnoy’s
                    edition, 2 vols. Paris, 1748. The best editions besides Dufresnoy’s are those of
                    Walch, Leipsic, 1715; of Biinemann, Leipsic, 1739; and in Migne’s Ραtrologiα
                    Latina, vols. vi. and vii. A new edition is promised in the Vienna Corpus
                    Script. Eccles. Latin.</p>
