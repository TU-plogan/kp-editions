                <p><label type="entry">LEITH</label>, a municipal and parliamentary burgh of
                    Midlothian, the chief seaport of the east coast of Scotland, If miles north by
                    east of Edinburgh, with which it is connected by Leith Walk and other lines of
                    street. It is built on the southern shore of the Firth of Forth, at the mouth of
                    the Water of Leith, which, crossed by seven bridges, divides it into North and
                    South Leith. Stretching along the coast for about 3J miles from Seafield on the
                    east to Granton on the west, the burgh includes the fishing village of Newhaven,
                    the suburb of Trinity, and part of Wardie, and extends to an area of 1978 acres.
                    It figures as Inverleith (“mouth of the Leith ”) in the foundation charter of
                    Holyrood Abbey (1128); and many of its houses, in narrow wynds and along the
                    eastern waterside, have an antique and decayed appearance. The earliest date on
                    any is 1573; but one, at the Coalhill, is thought to be the “handsome and
                    spacious edifice” built for her privy council by the queen regent, Mary of
                    Guise. Nothing remains of D’Essé’s fortifications (1549) or of Cromwell’s “fair
                    citadel” (1650); but it was Cromwell’s troops that raised the battery mounds
                    upon the Links, a grassy expanse of 1140 by 400 yards, bought for a public park
                    in 1857. Leith Fort, the headquarters of the royal artillery in Scotland, dates
                    from 1779; the quaint old Tolbooth, where Maitland of Lethington poisoned
                    himself (1573), was demolished in 1819; and the public buildings one and all are
                    modern, most of them classical structures. They comprise the town-hall (1828),
                    the custom-house (1812), Trinity house (1817), with David Scott’s Vasco de Gama
                    and other paintings, the exchange buildings, the corn exchange (1862), the
                    markets (1818), the slaughter-house (1862), the post-office (1876), the public
                    institute (1867), the poor-house (1862), the hospital (1872-76), John Watt’s
                    hospital (1862), the high school (1806), and Dr Bell’s school (1839). In
                    December 1881 eight board schools had 4839 children on the roll, and an average
                    attendance of 3932.</p>
                <p>Of twenty-seven churches, belonging to nine different denominations, the only
                    ancient one is that of South Leith parish, which, founded in 1483, and dedicated
                    to St Mary, was originally cruciform, but now, as “restored” in 1852, consists
                    of merely an aisled nave and square north-western tower; David Lindsay preached
                    in it before James VI. a thanksgiving sermon on the Gowrie conspiracy (1600),
                    and in its graveyard lies the Rev. John Home (1722-1808), author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Douglas,</hi> and a native of Leith. Other places of worship are
                    North Leith parish church (1814-16), with Grecian spire of 158 feet; North Leith
                    Free church (1859), in Germanized Gothic, with spire of 160 feet; and St James’s
                    Episcopal church (1862-69), a cruciform structure, designed in Early English
                    style by the late Sir G. G. Scott, with apsidal chancel, a spire of 160 feet,
                    and a peal of bells.</p>
                <p>So early as 1313 Leith possessed its ships, they in that year being burnt by the
                    English. But in a wide flat foreshore and drifting sands the port has had great
                    difficulties to contend with; and Tucker in 1656 describes it merely as “a
                    convenient dry harbour into which the firth ebbs and flows every tide, with a
                    convenient quay on the one side thereof, of a good length for lading of goods.”
                    The earliest dock was commenced in 1720, and the customhouse quay constructed in
                    1777; but little of the existing works is older than the present century. These,
                    with date, cost, and area, comprise the Old docks (1801-17; £285,108; 10⅛
                    acres), the Victoria dock (1852; £135,000; 5 acres), the Albert dock (1863-69;
                    £224,500; 10∣ acres), and the Edinburgh dock (1874-81; £400,000; 16∣ acres); in
                    connexion with the last two 62 and 108 acres were reclaimed from the east sands.
                    The largest of seven graving docks, the Prince of Wales dock (1858), measures
                    370 by 60 feet, and cost £100,000; the east and west piers, extended or formed
                    during 1826-52, and respectively 3530 and 3123 feet long, leave an entrance to
                    the harbour 250 feet broad, with a depth at high water of 20 to 25 feet. The
                    aggregate tonnage registered as belonging to the port was 1702 in 1692, 6935 in
                    1752, 25,427 in 1844, 28,303 (3946 steam) in 1854, 33,303 in 1860, 44,892 in
                    1867, 65,692 in 1873, 74,713 in 1878, and 86,509 on 31st December 1881, viz., 64
                    sailing vessels of 16,371 tons, and 125 steam-vessels of 70,138 tons, the
                    largest of the latter being one of 2144 tons. This shows marked progress, as

                <p>Of 3838 vessels of 952,580 tons that entered in the twelvemonth ending 31st

                    amounted to £1,996,609 and £1,993,947 from July 1838 to May 1876, and to

                <p>In 1511 James IV. here “buildit the ‘Michael,’ ane verrie monstruous great ship,
                    whilk tuik sae meikle timber that schee waisted all the woodis in Fyfe, except
                    Falkland wood, besides the timber that cam out of Norroway;” at present three
                    shipbuilding yards employ together nearly two thousand men. During the six years
                    1875-80 10 sailing vessels of 932 tons and 34 steam-vessels of 11,217 tons were
                    built at Leith, of which those built in 1880 were all steamships—11 of 3655 tons
                    being of iron, and 5 of 191 tons of wood. Glass-making dates from 1682,
                    sugar-refining from 1757, meat-preserving from 1837; and other industries are
                    flour-grinding, canvas-weaving, soap-boiling, rope-making, engineering, tanning,
                    and the manufacture of artificial manures. Leith is an important centre of trade
                    in grain, timber, and wool, and in wine from Spain, Portugal, and France. It is
                    also head of one of the twenty-five fishery districts of Scotland. Granted to
                    the city of Edinburgh in 1329, it first became an independent parliamentary and
                    municipal burgh in 1832-33, with Portobello and Musselburgh returning one member
                    to parliament, and being governed by a provost, four bailies, a treasurer, and
                    ten councillors. The annual value of real property amounted in 1882 to
                    £366,295,. against £150,642 in 1860, and £252,349 in 1873. Population (1811)
                    20,363, (1841) 26,808, (1851) 30,919, (1861) 30,628, (1871) 44,277, (1881)
                    58,193.</p>
                <p>The history of Leith is closely connected with that of Edinburgh, episodes being
                    the burning of its shipping by the English in 1313 and 1410, its sack by them in
                    1544 and 1547, its tenure by Mary of Guise as stronghold of the Catholic party
                    from 1548 to 1560 and ineffectual siege in the latter year by the Scotch and
                    English allies, the sailing from it of the first Darien expedition in 1698, and
                    the seizure of its citadel by Brigadier Mackintosh of Borlum and 1600 Highland
                    Jacobites in 1715, to which may be added the arrival, departure, or visit of
                    James II. (1437), Mary Queen of Scots (1561), James VI. and his queen Anne of
                    Denmark (1590), Charles I., who is said to have first got tidings of the Irish
                    rebellion (1641) when playing golf upon the Links, Cromwell and Charles II.
                    (1650), George IV. (1822), Queen Victoria (1842), the king of Denmark (1874),
