                    Trinity College, Oxford, and then entered as a student at Lincoln’s Inn, where,
                    as in the other Inns of Court, a love of letters, and a crop of debts and
                    difficulties, alike grew as matters of course. Thus already as a young man he
                    preferred the looser ways of life and the lighter aspects of literature. When
                    the penitent Stephen Gosson had (in 1579) published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Schoole of Abuse,</hi> Lodge took up the glove in his <hi rend="italic">Defence
                    of Poetry, Music, and Stage-</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n791/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0791-0768"/><hi rend="italic">plays</hi> (1579 or 1580), which
                    shows some of the moderation as well as of the learning befitting a scholar and
                    a gentleman. The publication was, however, prohibited, besides being answered by
                    Gosson in his <hi rend="italic">Playes Confuted in Five Actions,</hi> as by a
                    man sure of his ground if not of his cause. Having fleshed his pen, Lodge
                    displayed a strong inclination for continuing its use. In 1584 he published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Alarum Against Usurers,</hi> a pamphlet to which he no doubt
                    gave the benefit of his personal experience, and in which he mentions the fate
                    of his previous literary venture. Soon after this his years of wandering seem to
                    have begun, It is clear that their primary cause lay in the straits to which he
                    had been reduced, or had reduced himself; that he ever took so bold a leap into
                    disreputableness as to become an actor is improbable in itself, and the
                    assertion which has been made to that effect has been shown to rest on something
                    less satisfactory than conjecture. Lodge joined Captain Clarke in his raid upon
                    Terceira and the Canaries, and seems, in 1591, to have made another similar
                    voyage with Cavendish. During the former expedition, he, to beguile the tedium
                    of his voyage, composed his prose tale of <hi rend="italic">Rosalynde, Euphues'
                    Golden Legacie,</hi> which, published in 1590, afterwards suggested the story of
                    <hi rend="italic">As You Like It.</hi> The novel, which in its turn owes some,
                    though no very considerable, debt to the <hi rend="italic">Tale of Gamelyn,</hi>
                    is a pleasing example of the Euphuistic manner, but proves how slight an advance
                    an individual author of secondary rank is able to effect in a branch of
                    composition of which the genius of his age has not taken hold. In the year
                    before (1589) Lodge had already given to the world a volume* of poems, including
                    the delectable <hi rend="italic">Scillaes Metamorphosis.</hi> One would gladly
                    resign this and much else of Lodge’s sugared verse, together with some of his
                    perfumed prose, for the lost <hi rend="italic">Sailor’s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Kalender,</hi> in which he must after some fashion have told of his sea
                    adventures. During the last decade of the century he produced a <hi
                    rend="italic">farrago</hi> of literary products —a Juvenal, if not a very “Young
                    Juvenal,” at least in the readiness of his wit and in the robustness of his
                    moral indignation. In conjunction with Greene he produced, in a popular vein,
                    the odd but far from feeble play of <hi rend="italic">A Looking Glasse for
                    London and England.</hi> Probably about the same time he wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Tragedy of the Wounds of Civil War lively set forth in the True
                    Tragedies of Marius and</hi><hi rend="italic">Sylla</hi> (published 1594), a
                    good second-rate piece in the fashion of its age, and deficient neither in
                    rhetorical nor in comic vigour. His <hi rend="italic">Life and Death of William
                    Lοngl)eard</hi> (1593), and his <hi rend="italic">History of Robin the
                    Divell,</hi> are among his contemporary non-dramatic works; to which should be
                    added <hi rend="italic">Phillis</hi> (1593), a collection of lyrical pieces, and
                    a <hi rend="italic">Fig for Momus</hi> (on the strength of which he has been
                    rather loosely termed the earliest English satirist). In his later
                    years,—possibly about 1596, when he published his <hi rend="italic">Wits
                    Miserie,</hi> which is dated from Low Leyton, and the prose <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ρrosopopeia</hi> (if, as seems probable, it was his), in which he repents him
                    of his “lewd lines” of other days,—he was engaged in the practice of medicine,
                    for which he is said to have qualified himself by a degree at Avignon. His works
                    henceforth have a sober cast, comprising a translation of Josephus (1602) and
                    another of Seneca (1614), besides a <hi rend="italic">Treatise of the
                    Plague</hi> (1603), and a popular manual, still in manuscript, on <hi
                    rend="italic">Domestic Medicine.</hi> He was abroad on urgent private affairs of
                    one kind or another in 1616, from which time to his death from the plague, in
                    1625, nothing further concerning him remains to be noted. His life is one of
                    those which attract the curiosity of the literary student, who knows that it is
                    precisely in the mental and moral phases and experiences of able and active men
                    devoid of original genius, such as he, that much of the history of an age of
                    literature is to be read.</p>
                <p>Lodge’s works have not yet been completely reprinted, though the satisfaction of
                    this want may no longer be far distant. His <hi rend="italic">Rοsαlynde</hi> is
                    accessible in Hazlitt’s <hi rend="italic">Shakespeare's Library</hi> (vol. ii.)
                    and elsewhere. Its relation to Shakespeare’s comedy is exhaustively discussed in
                    an essay by Delius in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbuch</hi> of the German
                    Shakespeare Society (1871). Other works of his are scattered through the
                    publications of the old Shakespeare, the Hunterian, and possibly other
                    Societies; lists of them will be found in the edition of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glaucus</hi><hi rend="italic">and Silla,</hi> &amp;c., printed at the Chiswick
                    Press in 1839, in Hazlitt, and elsewhere. The question, <hi rend="italic">Was
                    Thomas Lodge an Actor?</hi> has been set at rest by Dr C. Μ. Ingleby in his
                    pamphlet bearing that title (1868), of which the main conclusion is embodied in
                    this notice. (A. W. W.)</p>
