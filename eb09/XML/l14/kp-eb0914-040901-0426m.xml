                    mere variety of <hi rend="italic">Allium Ampeloρrasum</hi> produced by
                    cultivation. It was formerly regarded as being a native of Switzerland, and the
                    year 1582 has been set down as the date of its introduction to England. Both
                    these assumptions are, however, erroneous. The plant is probably of Eastern
                    origin, since it was commonly cultivated in Egypt in the time of the Pharaohs,
                    and is so to the present day; while as regards its first appearance in England
                    both Tusser and Gerard—two of our earliest writers on this class of subjects,
                    the former of whom flourished in the early part and the latter in the later part
                    of the 1 Gth century—speak of it as being then commonly cultivated and
                    used.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Tusser, in his
                    verse for the month of March, writes:—</p><p>“Now leckes are in season, for
                    pottage ful good. And spareth the miick cow, and purgeth the blood; These
                    hauving with peason. for pottage in Lent, Thou spareth both oteιnel and bread to
                    be spent.”</p></note> The Romans, it would appear, made great use of the leek
                    for savouring their dishes, as seems proved by the number of recipes for its use
                    referred to by Celsius. Hence it is more than probable that it was brought to
                    England by the Romans during the period of their occupation. Italy was
                    celebrated for leeks in the time of Pliny (7/. <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> xix.
                    c. 6), according to whom they were brought into great notice and esteem through
                    the emperor Nero, derisively surnamed “Porrophagus,” who used to eat them for
                    several days in every month to clear his voice. The leek is very generally
                    cultivated in Great Britain as an esculent, but more especially in Scotland and
                    in Wales, being esteemed as an excellent and wholesome vegetable, with
                    properties very similar to those of the onion, but of a milder character. In
                    America it is not much cultivated except by market gardeners in the
                    neighbourhood of large cities. The whole plant, with the exception of the
                    fibrous roots, is used in soups and stews. The sheathing stalks of the leaves
                    lap over each other, and form a thickish stem-like base, which is blanched, and
                    is the part chiefly preferred. These blanched stems are much employed in French
                    cookery. They form an important ingredient in Scotch winter broth, and
                    particularly in the national dish <hi rend="italic">cock-a-leekie,</hi> and are
                    also largely used boiled, and served with toasted bread and white sauce, as in
                    the case of asparagus. Leeks are sown in the spring, earlier or later according
                    to the soil and the season, and are planted out for the summer, being dropped
                    into holes which are made with a stout dibble and left unfilled in order to
                    allow the stems space to swell. When they are thus planted deeply the holes
                    gradually fill up, and the base of the stem becomes blanched and prepared for
                    use, a process aided by drawing up the earth round about the stems as they
                    elongate. The leek is one of the most useful vegetables the cottager can grow,
                    as it will supply him with a large amount of produce at a season when it will
                    prove very welcome, namely, during the winter and spring. It is extremely hardy,
                    and presents no difficulty in its cultivation, the chief point, as with all
                    succulent esculents, being that it should be grown quickly upon well-enriched
                    soil. The plant is of biennial duration, flowering the second year, and
                    perishing after perfecting its seeds. The leek is the national symbol or badge
                    of the Welsh, who wear it in their hats on St David’s Day. The origin of this
                    custom has received various explanations, all of which are probably more or less
                    speculative.</p>
