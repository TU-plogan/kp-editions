                    from the definition of a logarithm. It follows from these equations that the
                    logarithm of the product of any number of quantities is equal to the sum of the
                    logarithms of the quantities, that the logarithm of the quotient of two
                    quantities is equal to the logarithm of the numerator diminished by the
                    logarithm of the denominator, that the logarithm of the rth power of a quantity
                    is equal to <hi rend="italic">r</hi> times the logarithm of the quantity, and
                    that the logarithm of the rth root of a quantity is equal to 2th of the
                    logarithm of the quantity.</p>
                <p>Logarithms were originally invented for the sake of abbreviating arithmetical
                    calculations, as by their means the operations of multiplication and division
                    may be replaced by those of addition and subtraction, and the operations of
                    raising to powers and extraction of roots by those of multiplication and
                    division. For the purpose of thus simplifying the operations of arithmetic, the
                    base is taken equal to 10, and use is made of tables of logarithms in which the
                    values of <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> the logarithm, corresponding to values of
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> the number, are tabulated. The logarithm is also a
                    function of frequent occurrence in analysis, being regarded as a known and
                    recognized function like sin <hi rend="italic">x</hi> or tan <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi>; but in mathematical investigations the base generally employed is not
                    10, but a certain quantity usually denoted by the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >e,</hi> of value 2∙71828 18284 ....</p>
                <p>Thus in arithmetical calculations if the base is not expressed it is understood
                    to be 10, so that log <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denotes log <hi rend="subscript">
                    10</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi>; but in analytical formulae it is understood to
                    be <hi rend="italic">e.</hi></p>
                <p>The logarithms to base 10 of the first twelve numbers to 7 places of decimals are
                    log 1 = 0 Ό000000 log 5 = 0’6989700 log 9 = 0’9542425</p>
                <p>log 2 = 0’3010300 log 6 = 07781513 log 10 = 1'0000000</p>

                <p>The integral part of a logarithm is called the index or characteristic, and the
                    fractional part the mantissa. When the base is 10, the logarithms of all numbers
                    in which the digits are the same, no matter where the decimal point may be, have
                    the same mantissa; thus, for example, log 2∙5613 = 0’4084604, log 25’613 =
                    Γ4084604, log 2561300 = 6‘4084604, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the case of fractional numbers <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> numbers in which
                    the integral part is 0) the mantissa is still kept positive, so that, for
                    example, log ∙25613=T∙4084604, log ∙0025613 = 3∙40846β4, &amp;c., the minus sign
                    being usually written over the characteristic, and not before it, to indicate
                    that the characteristic only and not the whole expression is negative; thus
                    l∙4084604 stands for -1 + ∙4084604.</p>
                <p>The fact that when the base is 10 the mantissa of the logarithm is independent of
                    the position of the decimal point in the number affords the chief reason for the
                    choice of 10 as base. The explanation of this property of the base 10 is
                    evident, for a change in the position of the decimal points amounts to
                    multiplication or division by some power of 10, and this corresponds to the
                    addition or subtraction of some integer in the case of the logarithm, the
                    mantissa therefore remaining intact. It should be mentioned that in most tables
                    of trigonometrical functions, the number 10 is added to all the logarithms in
                    the table in order to avoid the use of negative characteristics, so that the
                    characteristic 9 denotes in reality 1, 8 denotes 2, 10 denotes 0, &amp;c.
                    Logarithms thus increased are frequently referred to for the sake of distinction
                    as <hi rend="italic">tabular logarithms,</hi> so that the tabular logarithm =
                    the true logarithm + 10.</p>
                <p>In tables of logarithms of numbers to base 10 the mantissa only is in general
                    tabulated, as the characteristic of the logarithm of a number can always be
                    written down at sight, the rule being that, if the number is greater than <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n796/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0796-0773"/> unity, the characteristic is less by unity than
                    the number of digits in the integral portion of it, and that if the number is
                    less than unity the characteristic is negative, and is greater by unity than the
                    number of ciphers between the decimal point and the first significant
                    figure.</p>
                <p>It follows very simply from the definition of a logarithm that log <hi
                    rend="subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">b ×</hi> log <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 1, log⅛ <hi rend="italic">m</hi> = log <hi

                <p>10g&lt;ι <hi rend="italic">o</hi></p>
                <p>The second of these relations is an important one, as it shows that from a table
                    of logarithms to base <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the corresponding table of
                    logarithms to base <hi rend="italic">b</hi> may be deduced by multiplying all
                    the logarithms in the former by the constant multiplier —-—, which is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">modulus</hi> of log <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the system whose base is <hi rend="italic">b</hi> with
                    respect to the system whose base is <hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>The two systems of logarithms for which extensive tables have been calculated are
                    the Napierian, or hyperbolic, or natural system, of which the base is <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> and the Briggian, or decimal, or common system, of which
                    the base is 10; and we see that the logarithms in the latter system may be
                    deduced from those in the former by multiplication by the constant multiplier 1—
                    which is called the modulus of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> loge 10</p>
                <p>the common system of logarithms. The numerical value of this modulus is 0 <hi

                    John Napier, baron of Mcrchiston, in Scotland, with a unanimity which is rare
                    with regard to important scientific discoveries. The first announcement was made
                    in Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Mirifici</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic">canonis descriptio</hi> (Edinburgh, 1614),
                    which contains an account of the nature of logarithms, and a table giving
                    natural sines and their logarithms for every minute of the quadrant to seven or
                    eight figures. These logarithms are not what would now be called Napierian or
                    hyperbolic logarithms <hi rend="italic">(f.e.,</hi> logarithms to the base <hi
                    rend="italic">e),</hi> though closely connected with them, the relation between
                    the two being</p>

                    rend="italic">l</hi> denotes the logarithm to base <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and
                    L denotes Napier’s logarithm. The relation between N (a sine) and L its
                    Napierian logarithm is therefore</p>
                <p>_ L N = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> e ÏÔ», and the logarithms decrease as
                    the sines increase. Napier died in 1617, and his posthumous work <hi
                    rend="italic">Mirifici</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmorum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >canonis constructio,</hi> explaining the mode of construction of the table,
                    appeared in 1619, edited by his son.</p>
                <p>Henry Briggs, then professor of geometry at Gresham College, London, and
                    afterwards Savilian professor of geometry at Oxford, admired the <hi
                    rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">mirificus</hi> so much that he
                    resolved to visit Napier. In a letter to Ussher he writes, “Naper, lord of
                    Markinston, hath set my head and hands at work with his new and admirable
                    logarithms. I hope to see him this summer, if it please God; for I never saw a
                    book which pleased me better, and made me more wonder.” Briggs accordingly
                    visited Napier in 1615, and stayed with him a whole month. He brought with him
                    some calculations he had made, and suggested to Napier the advantages that would
                    result from the choice of 10 as a base, having explained them previously in his
                    lectures at Gresham College, and written to Napier on the subject. Napier said
                    that he had already thought of the change, and pointed out a slight improvement,
                    viz., that the characteristics of numbers greater than unity should be positive
                    and not negative, as suggested by Briggs. In 1616 Briggs again visited Napier
                    and showed him the work he had accomplished, and, he says, he would gladly have
                    paid him a third visit in 1617 had Napier’s life been spared.</p>
                <p>Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Logarithmorum chilias ρrimα</hi> was published,
                    probably privately, in 1617, after Napier’s death, as in the short preface he
                    states that why his logarithms are different from those introduced by Napier
                    “sperandum, ejus librum posthumum abunde nobis propediem satisfacturum.” The <hi

                    logarithms, is only a small octavo tract of sixteen pages, and gives the
                    logarithms of numbers from unity to 1000 to 14 places of decimals. There is no
                    author’s name, place, or date. The date of publication is, however, fixed as
                    1617 by a letter from Sir Henry Bourchier to Ussher, dated December 6, 1617,
                    containing the passage—“Our kind friend, Mr Briggs, hath lately published a
                    supplement to the most excellent tables of logarithms, which I presume he has
                    sent to you.” Briggs’s tract of 1617 is extremely rare, and has generally been
                    ignored or incorrectly described. Hutton erroneously states that it contains the
                    logarithms to 8 places, and his account has been followed by most writers. There
                    is a copy in the British Museum.</p>
                <p>Briggs continued to labour assiduously at the calculation of logarithms, and in
                    1624 published his <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >logarithmica,</hi> a folio work containing the logarithms of the numbers from 1
                    to 20,000, and from 90,000 to 100,000 (and in some copies to 101,000) to 14
                    places of decimals. The table occupies 300 pages, and there is an introduction
                    of 88 pages relating to the mode of calculation of the tables, and the
                    applications of logarithms.</p>
                <p>There was thus left a gap between 20,000 and 90,000, which was filled up by
                    Adrian Vlacq, who published at Gouda, in Holland, in 1628, a table containing
                    the logarithms of the numbers from unity to 100,000 to 10 places of decimals.
                    Having calculated 70,000 logarithms and copied only 30,000, Vlacq would have
                    been quite entitled to have called his a new work. He designates i⅛ however,
                    only a second edition of Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">logarithmica,</hi> the title running <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica sive logarith-mοrιι∕m chiliades

                    >per Adrianum Vlacq, Goudaηum.</hi> This table of Vlacq’s was published, with an
                    English explanation prefixed, at London in 1631 under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmicall Arithmetike . . . London, printed by George
                    Miller,</hi> 1631. There are also copies with a French title page and
                    introduction (Gouda, 1628).</p>
                <p>Briggs had himself been engaged in filling up the gap, and in a letter to Pell,
                    written after the publication of Vlacq’s work, and dated October 25, 1628, he
                    says :—</p>
                <p>“My desire was to have those chiliades that are wantinge betwixt 20 and 90
                    calculated and printed, and I had done them all almost by my seife, and by some
                    frendes whom my rules had sufficiently informed, and by agreement the busines
                    was conveniently parted amongst us; but I am eased of that charge and care by
                    one Adrian Vlacque, an Hollander, who hathe done all the whole hundred chiliades
                    and printed them in Latin, Dutche, and Frenche, 1000 bookes in these 3
                    languages, and hathe sould them almost all. But he hathe cutt off <hi
                    rend="italic">4 of</hi> my figures throughout; and hathe left out my dedication,
                    and to the reader, and two chapters the 12 and 13, in the rest he hath not
                    varied from me at all.”</p>
                <p>The original calculation of the logarithms of numbers from unity to 101,000 was
                    thus performed by Briggs and Vlacq between 1615 and 1628. Vlacq’s table is that
                    from which all the hundreds of tables of logarithms that have subsequently
                    appeared have been derived. It contains of course many errors, which have
                    gradually been discovered and corrected in the course of the two hundred and
                    fifty years that have elapsed, but no fresh calculation has been published. The
                    only exception is Mr Sang’s table (1871), part of which was the result of an
                    original calculation.</p>
                <p>The first calculation or publication of Briggian or common logarithms of
                    trigonometrical functions was made in 1620 by Gunter, who was Briggs’s colleague
                    as professor of astronomy in Gresham College. The title of Gunter’s oo , which
                    is very scarce, is <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >triangulorum,</hi> and it contains logarithmic sines and tangents for every
                    minute of the quadrant to 7 places of decimals.</p>
                <p>The next publication was due to Vlacq, who appended to his logarithms of numbers
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> of
                    1628 a table giving log sines, tangents, and secants for every minute of the
                    quadrant to 10 places; these were obtained by calculating the logarithms of the
                    natural sines, &amp;c., given in the <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Mathematicus</hi> of Pitiscus (1613).</p>
                <p>During the last years of his life Briggs devoted himself to the calculation of
                    logarithmic sines, &amp;c., and at the time of his death in 1631 he had all but
                    completed a logarithmic canon to every hundredth of a degree. This work was
                    published by Vlacq at his own expense at Gouda in 1633, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigonometria Britannica.</hi> It contains log sines (to 14
                    places) and tangents (to 10 places), besides natural sines, tangents, and
                    secants, at intervals of a hundredth of a degree. In the same year Vlacq
                    published at Gouda his <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >artificialis,</hi> giving log sines and tangents to every 10 seconds of the
                    quadrant to 10 places. This work also contains the logarithms of the numbers
                    from unity to 20,000 taken from the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> of 1628. Briggs appreciated clearly the
                    advantages of a centesimal division of the quadrant, and by dividing the degree
                    into hundredth parts instead of into minutes, made a step towards a reformation
                    in this respect, and but for the appearance of Vlacq’s work the decimal division
                    of the degree might have become recognized, as is now the case with the
                    corresponding division of the second. The calculation of the logarithms not only
                    of numbers but also of the trigonometrical functions is therefore due to Briggs
                    and Vlacq; and the results contained in their four fundamental works— <hi
                    rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> (Briggs),
                    1624; <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi>
                    (Vlacq), 1628; <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria Britannica</hi> (Briggs), 1633;
                    <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria</hi><hi rend="italic">artificialis</hi> (Vlacq),
                    1633—have never been superseded by any subsequent calculations.</p>
                <p>A translation of Napier’s <hi rend="italic">Descriptio</hi> was made by Edward
                    Wright, whose name is well known in connexion with the history of navigation,
                    and after his death published by his son at London in 1616 under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">A Description of the admirable Table of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Logarithmes</hi> (12mo); the edition was revised by Napier himself. Both the
                    <hi rend="italic">Descriptio</hi> (1614) and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Constructio</hi> (1619) were reprinted at Lyons in 1620 by Bartholomew Vincent,
                    who thus was the first to publish logarithms’on the Continent.</p>
                <p>Napier calculated no logarithms of numbers, and, as already stated, the
                    logarithms invented by him were not to base <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The first
                    logarithms to the base <hi rend="italic">e</hi> were published by John Speidell
                    in his <hi rend="italic">New</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmes</hi> (London,
                    1619), which contains hyperbolic log sines, tangents, and secants for every
                    minute of the quadrant to 5 places of decimals.</p>
                <p>In 1624 Benjamin Ursinus published at Cologne a canon of logarithms exactly
                    similar to Napier’s in the <hi rend="italic">Descriptio</hi> of 1614, only much
                    enlarged. The interval of the arguments is 10", and the‘results are given to 8
                    places; in Napier’s canon the interval is Γ, and the number of places is 7. The
                    logarithms are strictly Napierian, and the arrangement is identical with that in
                    the canon of 1614. This is the largest Napierian canon that has ever been
                    published.</p>
                <p>Kepler took the greatest interest in the invention of logarithms, and in 1624 he
                    published at Marburg a table of Napierian logarithms of sines, with certain
                    additional columns to facilitate special calculations.</p>
                <p>The first publication of Briggian logarithms on the Continent is due to Wingate,
                    who published at Paris in 1625 his <hi rend="italic">Arithmétique
                    logarithmétique,</hi> containing sevenfigure logarithms of numbers up to 1000,
                    and log sines and tangents from Gunter’s <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi> (1620). In
                    the following year, 1626, Denis Henrion published at Paris a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Traicté</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi rend="italic">Logarithmes,</hi>
                    containing Briggs’s logarithms of numbers up to 20,001 to 10 places, and
                    Gunter’s log sines and tangents to 7 places for every minute. In the same year
                    De Decker also published at Gouda a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Nieuwe

                    to 7 places for every minute. Vlacq rendered assistance in the publication of
                    this work, and the privilege is made out to him.</p>
                <p>The preceding paragraphs contain a brief account of the main facts relating to
                    the invention of logarithms. In describing the contents of the works referred to
                    the language and notation of the present day have been adopted, so that for
                    example a table to radius 10,000,000 is described as a table to 7 places, and so
                    on. Also, although logarithms have been spoken of as to the base <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> &amp;c., it is to be noticed that neither Napier nor
                    Briggs, nor any of their successors till long afterwards, had any idea of
                    connecting logarithms with exponents.</p>
                <p>The invention of logarithms and the calculation of the earlier tables form a very
                    striking episode in the history of exact science, and, with the exception of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi> of Newton, there is no mathematical work
                    published in the country which has produced such important consequences, or to
                    which so much interest attaches as to Napier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Descriptio.</hi> The calculation of tables of the natural trigonometrical
                    functions may be said to have formed the work of the last half of the 16 th
                    century, and the great canon of natural sines for every 10 seconds to 15 places
                    which had been calculated by Rheticus was published by Pitiscus only in 1613,
                    the year before that in which the <hi rend="italic">Descriptio</hi> appeared. In
                    the construction of the natural trigonometrical tables England had taken no
                    part, and it is remarkable that the discovery of the principles and the
                    formation of the tables that were to revolutionize or supersede all the methods
                    of calculation then in use should have been so rapidly effected and developed in
                    a country in which so little attention had been previously devoted to such
                    questions.</p>
                <p>The only possible rival to Napier in the invention of logarithms is Justus
                    Byrgius, who about the same time constructed a rude kind of logarithmic or
                    rather antilogarithmic table; but there is every reason to believe that Napier’s
                    system was conceived and perfected before that of Byrgius; and in date of
                    publication Napier has the advantage by six years. The title of the work of
                    Byrgius is <hi rend="italic">Arithmetische und geometrische
                    Progress-Tabulen</hi>; in his table he has log 1 = 0 and log 10 = 230270022. The
                    only contemporary reference to Byrgius is contained in the sentence of Kepler,
                    “Apices logistici Justo Byrgio multis annis ante editionem Neperianam viam
                    praeiverunt ad hos ipsissimos logarithmes,” which occurs in the “Praecepta”
                    prefixed to the <hi rend="italic">Tabulas Rudolphinae</hi> (1627); the <hi
                    rend="italic">apices</hi> are the signs <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi>, ', ",
                    used to denote the orders of sexagesimal fractions. The system of Byrgius is
                    greatly inferior to that of Napier, and it is to the latter alone that the world
                    is indebted for the knowledge of logarithms. The claims of Byrgius are discussed
                    in Kästner’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der Mathematik,</hi> vol. ii. p. 375,

                <p>An account of the facts connected with the early history of logarithms is given
                    by Hutton in his <hi rend="italic">History of Logarithms,</hi> prefixed to all
                    the early editions of his logarithmic tables, and also printed in vol. i. pp.
                    306-340 of his <hi rend="italic">Tracts</hi> (1812); but unfortunately Hutton
                    has interpreted all Briggs’s statements with regard to the invention of decimal
                    logarithms in a manner clearly contrary to their true meaning, and unfair to
                    Napier. This has naturally produced retaliation, and Mr Mark Napier has not only
                    successfully refuted Hutton, but has fallen into the opposite extreme of
                    attempting to reduce Briggs to the level of a mere computer. It seems strange
                    that the relations of Napier and Briggs with regard to the invention of decimal
                    logarithms should have formed matter for controversy. The statements of both
                    agree in all particulars, and the warmest friendship subsisted between them.
                    Napier at his death left his manuscripts to Briggs, and all the writings of the
                    latter show the greatest reverence for him. The words that occur on the title
                    page of the <hi rend="italic">Logarithmicall arithmetize</hi> of 1631 are “These
                    numbers were first invented by the most excellent lohn Neper, Baron of
                    Merchiston; and the same were transformed, and the foundation and use of them
                    illustrated with his approbation by Henry Briggs.” No doubt the invention of
                    decimal logarithms occurred both to Napier and to Briggs independently; but the
                    latter not only first announced the advantage of the change, but actually
                    undertook and completed tables of the new logarithms. For more detailed
                    information relating to Napier, Briggs, and Vlacq, and the invention of
                    logarithms, the reader is referred to the life of Briggs in Ward’s <hi

                    1873. It may be remarked that the date usually assigned to Briggs’s first visit
                    to Napier is 1616 and not 1615 as stated above, the reason being that Napier was
                    generally supposed to have died in 1618; but it was shown by Mr Mark Napier that
                    the true date is 1617.</p>
                <p>For a description of existing logarithmic tables, and the purposes for which they
                    were constructed, the reader is referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tables (Mathematical).</hi> In what follows only the most important events in
                    the history of logarithms, subsequent to the facts connected with their
                    invention and the original calculations, will be noticed.</p>
                <p>Nathaniel Roe’s <hi rend="italic">Tabulae logaritlimicae</hi> (1633) was the
                    first complete seven-figure table that was published. It contains sevenfigure
                    logarithms of numbers from 1 to 100,000, with characteristics unseparated from
                    the mantissae, and was formed from Vlacq’s table (1628) by leaving out the last
                    three figures. All the figures of the number are given at the heads of the
                    columns, except the last two, which run down theextreme columns,—1 to 50 on the
                    left hand side, and 50 to 100 on the right hand side. The first four figures of
                    the logarithms are printed at the tops of the columns. There is thus an advance
                    half way towards the arrangement now universal in sevenfigure tables. The final
                    step was made by John Newton in his <hi rend="italic">Trigononometria
                    Britannica</hi> (1658), a work which is also noticeable as being the only
                    extensive eight-figure table that has ever been published; it contains
                    logarithms of sines, &amp;c., as well as logarithms of numbers.</p>
                <p>In 1705 appeared the original edition of Sherwin’s tables, the first of the
                    series of ordinary seven-figure tables of logarithms of numbers and
                    trigonometrical functions such as are in general use now. The work went through
                    several editions during the last century, and was at length superseded in 1785
                    by Hutton’s tables, which have continued in successive editions to maintain
                    their position up to the present time.</p>
                <p>In 1717 Abraham Sharp published in his <hi rend="italic">Geometry Improv’d</hi>
                    the Briggian logarithms of numbers from 1 to 100, and of primes from 100 to
                    1100, to 61 places; these were copied into the later editions of Sherwin and
                    other works.</p>
                <p>In 1742 a seven-figure table was published in quarto form by Gardiner, which is
                    celebrated on account of its accuracy and of the elegance of the printing. A
                    French edition, which closely resembles the original, was published at Avignon
                    in 1770.</p>
                <p>In 1783 appeared at Paris the first edition of Callet’s tables, which correspond
                    to those of Hutton in England. These tables, which form perhaps the most
                    complete and practically useful collection of logarithms for the general
                    computer that has been published, have passed through many editions, and are
                    still in use.</p>
                <p>In 1794 Vega published his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus logarithmorum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">completus,</hi> a folio volume containing a reprint of the
                    logarithms of numbers <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0799-0776"/> from Vlacq’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> of 1628, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Trigonometria</hi><hi rend="italic">artificialis</hi> of 1633. The
                    logarithms of numbers are arranged as in an ordinary seven-figure table. In
                    addition to the logarithms reprinted from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigonometria,</hi> there are given logarithms for every second of the first
                    two degrees, which were the result of an original calculation. Vega devoted
                    great attention to the detection and correction of the errors in Vlacq <hi
                    rend="superscript"> v</hi> s work of 1628. He also published in 1797, in 2 vols.
                    8vo, a collection of logarithmic and trigonometrical tables which has passed
                    through many editions, a very usef ul one volume stereotype edition having been
                    published in 1840 by Hiilsse. The tables in this work may be regarded as to some
                    extent supplementary to those in Callet.</p>
                <p>If we consider only the logarithms of numbers, the main line of descent from the
                    original calculation of Briggs and Vlacq is Roe, John Newton, Sherwin, Gardiner;
                    there are then two branches, viz., Hutton founded on Sherwin and Callet on
                    Gardiner, and the editions of Vega form a separate offshoot from the original
                    tables. Among the most useful and accessible of modem ordinary sevenfigure
                    tables of logarithms of numbers and trigonometrical functions may be mentioned
                    those of Bremiker, Schron, and Bruhns. For logarithms of numbers only perhaps
                    Babbage’s table is the most convenient.</p>
                <p>In 1871 Mr Sang published a seven-figure table of logarithms of numbers extending
                    from 20,000 to 200,000; and the logarithms of the numbers between 100,000 and
                    200,000 were calculated <hi rend="italic">de novo</hi> by Mr Sang as if
                    logarithms had never been computed before. In tables extending from 10,000 to
                    100,000 the differences near the beginning of the table are large, and they are
                    so numerous that the proportional parts must either be very crowded, or some of
                    them have to be omitted; and to diminish this inconvenience many tables extend
                    to 108,000. By beginning the table at 20,000 instead of at 10,000, the
                    differences are halved in magnitude, while the number of them in a page is
                    quartered. In this table multiples of the differences, instead of proportional
                    parts, are given.</p>
                <p>As regards the logarithms of trigonometrical functions, the next great advance on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Trigonometria</hi><hi rend="italic">artificialis</hi> took
                    place more than a century and a half afterwards, when Michael Taylor published
                    in 1792 his seven-decimal table of log sines and tangents to every second of the
                    quadrant; it was calculated by interpolation from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trigonometria</hi> to 10 places and then contracted to 7. On account of the
                    great size of this table, and for other reasons, it never came into very general
                    use, Bagay’s <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles</hi><hi rend="italic">tables</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">astronomiques</hi> (1829), which also contains log sines and
                    tangents to every second, being preferred, but this work is now difficult to
                    procure. The only other logarithmic canon to every second that has been
                    published forms the second volume of Shortrede’s <hi rend="italic">Logarithmic
                    Tables</hi> (1849). It contains also proportional parts, and is the most
                    complete and accessible table of logarithms for every second. Shortrede’s tables
                    originally appeared in 1844 in one volume, during the author’s absence in India;
                    but, not being satisfied with them in some respects, he made various
                    alterations, and published a second edition in two volumes in 1849. There have
                    been subsequent editions of the volume containing the trigonometrical canon. The
                    work is an important one, and the pages are clear, although the number of
                    figures on each is very great.</p>
                <p>On the proposition of Carnot, Prieur, and Brunet, the French Government decided
                    in 1784 that new tables of sines, tangents, &amp;c., and their logarithms,
                    should be calculated in relation to the centesimal division of the quadrant.
                    Prony was charged with the direction of the work, and was expressly required
                    “Non seulement à composer des tables qui ne laissassent rien à désirer quant à
                    l’exactitude, mais à en faire le monument de calcul le plus vaste et le plus
                    imposant qui eût jamais été exécuté ou même conçu.” Those engaged upon the work
                    were divided into'three sections: the first consisted of five or six
                    mathematicians, including Legendre, who were engaged in the purely analytical
                    work, or the calculation of the fundamental numbers; the second section
                    consisted of seven or eight calculators possessing some mathematical knowledge;
                    and the third comprised seventy or eighty ordinary computers. The work, which
                    was performed wholly in duplicate, and independently by two divisions of
                    computers, occupied two years. As a consequence of the double calculation, there
                    are two manuscripts in existence, one of which is deposited at the Observatory,
                    and the other in the library of the Institute, at Paris. Each of the two
                    manuscripts consists essentially of seventeen large folio volumes, the contents
                    being as follows :—</p>

                    Lefort states that he has seen six copies, all incomplete, although including
                    the last page. Babbage compared his table with the <hi rend="italic">Tables du
                    Cadastre,</hi> and Μ. Lefort has given in his paper just referred to most
                    important lists of errors in Vlacq’s and Briggs’s logarithms of numbers which
                    were obtained by comparing the manuscript tables with those contained in the <hi

                    1628. These are almost the only uses that have been made of the French tables,
                    the calculation of which involved so great an expenditure of time and money.</p>
                <p>It may be mentioned here that the late Mr John Thomson of Greenock made an
                    independent calculation of the logarithms of numbers up to 120,000 to 12 places,
                    and that the manuscript of the table was presented in 1874 to the Royal
                    Astronomical Society by his sister. The table has been used to verify the errata
                    which Μ. Lefort found in Vlacq and Briggs by means of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tables du Cadastre.</hi> An account of Mr Thomson’s table, and of this and
                    other comparisons between it and the printed tables, is to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Monthly Notices</hi> of the Society, vol. xxxiv. pp. 447-75
                    (1874).</p>
                <p>Although the <hi rend="italic">Tables du Cadastre</hi> have never been published,
                    other tables have appeared in which the quadrant is divided centesimally, the
                    most important of these being Hobert and Ideler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelles</hi><hi rend="italic">tables</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >trigonométriques</hi> (1799), and Borda and Delambre’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">trigonométriques décimales</hi> (1800-1). The
                    former work contains natural and log sines, cosines, tangents, and cotangents to
                    7 places, up to 3° (centesimal) at intervals of 10" (centesimal), and thence to
                    50° at intervals of 1 ’. The latter gives log sines, cosines, tangents, and
                    cosines for centesimal arguments, viz., from 0 ’ to 10' at intervals of 10", and
                    from 0° to 50 <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> at intervals of 10', to 11 places,
                    and also, in another table, log sines, cosines, tangents, cotangents, secants,
                    and cosecants from 0 <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> to 3° at intervals of 10",
                    and thence to 50° at intervals of 1' to 7 places. After the work was printed it
                    was read by Delambre with the <hi rend="italic">Tables du Cadastre,</hi> and a
                    number of last-figure errors which are given in the preface were thus detected.
                    Callet’s tables already referred to contain in a convenient form logarithms of
                    trigonometrical functions for centesimal arguments.</p>
                <p>Two tables of logarithms of numbers which have been recently published may be
                    noticed, as they involve points of novelty. The first of these is Pineto’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">de logarithmes</hi> (St Petersburg,
                    1871). The tables are intended to give in a small space (56 pages) all the
                    results that can be obtained from a complete ten-figure table by means of the
                    following principle :—only the logarithms of the numbers from 1,000,000 to
                    1,011,000 are given directly, all other numbers being brought within the range
                    of this table by multiplication by a factor, the logarithm of which factor is to
                    be subtracted from the logarithm in the table. A list of the most convenient
                    factors and their logarithms is given in a separate table. The principle of
                    multiplying by a factor which is subsequently cancelled by subtracting its
                    logarithm is one that is frequently employed in the calculation of logarithms,
                    but the peculiarity of the present work is that it forms part of the process of
                    using the table. The other tables, which occupy only ten pages, were published
                    in a tract entitled <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    logarithmes à</hi> 12 <hi rend="italic">décimales jusqu' à</hi> 434 <hi
                    rend="italic">milliards</hi> by MM. Namur and Mansion at Brussels in 1877. The
                    fact that the differences of the logarithms of numbers near to 434294 (these
                    being the first figures of the modulus of the Briggian logarithms) commenced
                    with the figures 100..., so that the interpolations in this part of the table
                    are very easily and accurately performed, is ingeniously made use of. A table is
                    given of logarithms of numbers near to 434294, and other numbers are brought
                    within the range of the table by multiplication by one or two factors which are
                    indicated.</p>
                <p>In the ordinary tables of logarithms the natural numbers are all integers, while
                    the logarithms tabulated are incommensurable. In an antilogarithmic table, the
                    logarithms are exact quantities such as •00001, Ό0002, &amp;c., and the numbers
                    are incommensurable. The earliest and largest table of this kind that has been
                    constructed is Dodson’s <hi rend="italic">Antilogarithmic canon</hi> (1742),
                    which gives the numbers to 11 places, corresponding to the logarithms from <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 00001 to •99999 at intervals of <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 00001. The only other extensive tables of the same
                    kind that have been published occur in Shortrede’s <hi rend="italic">Logarithmic
                    tables</hi> already referred to, and in Filipowski’s <hi rend="italic">Table of
                    antilogarithms</hi> (1849). Both are similar to Dodson’s tables, from which they
                    were derived, but they only give numbers to 7 places.</p>
                <p>The most elaborate table of hyperbolic logarithms that existais due to Wolfram, a
                    Dutch lieutenant of artillery. His table gives the logarithms of all numbers up
                    to 2200, and of primes (and also of a great many composite numbers) from 2200 to
                    10,009, to 48 decimal places. The table 'appeared in Schulze’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Neue und erweiterte Sammlung logarithmischer Tafeln</hi> (1778), and was.
                    reprinted in Vee <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi> a ’ s <hi rend="italic"

                    Wolfram had been prevented from computing by a serious illness, were published
                    subsequently, and the table as given by Vega is complete. The largest hyperbolic
                    table as regards range was published by Zacharias Dase at Vienna in 1850 under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Tafel der natürlichen Logarithmen der Zahlen.</hi>
                    It gives hyperbolic logarithms of numbers from 1000 Ό to 10500 Ό at intervals of
                    *1 to 7 places, with differences and proportional parts, arranged like an
                    ordinary seven-figure table of Briggian logarithms. The table appeared in the
                    thirty-fourth part (new series, vol. xiv.) of the <hi rend="italic">Annals of
                    the Vienna Observatory</hi> (1851); but separate copies were issued.</p>

                    table by simple addition and subtraction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Logistic numbers</hi> is the old name for what would now be
                    called ratios or fractions. Thus a table of log , where <hi rend="italic">x</hi>
                    is the argument and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> a constant, is called a table of
                    logistic or proportional logarithms; and since log — = log <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi>- log a: it is clear that the tabular <hi rend="italic">X</hi> results
                    differ from those given in an ordinary table of logarithms only by the
                    subtraction of a constant and a change of sign. The first table of this kind
                    appeared in Kepler’s <hi rend="italic">Chilias logarithmomm</hi> (1624) already
                    referred to. The object of a table of log — is to facilitate the working out of
                    proportions in which the third term is a constant quantity <hi rend="italic"
                    >a.</hi> In most collections of tables of logarithms, and especially those
                    intended for use in connexion with navigation, there occurs a small table of
                    logistic logarithms in which <hi rend="italic">a</hi> = 3600" ( = l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> o</hi> or 1*), the table giving log 3600 - log <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> being expressed in minutes
                    and seconds. It is also common to find tables in which α=10800"( = 3° or 3*),
                    and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is expressed in degrees (or hours), minutes, and
                    seconds. Such tables are generally given to 4 or 5 places. The usual practice in
                    books seems to be to call logarithms logistic when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is
                    3600", and proportional when <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has any other value.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gaussian logarithms</hi> are intended to facilitate the finding
                    of the logarithms of the sum and difference of two numbers whose logarithms are
                    known, the numbers themselves being unknown; and on this account they are
                    frequently called addition and subtraction logarithms. The object of the table
                    is in fact to give log (α±δ) by only one entry when log <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    and log <hi rend="italic">b</hi> are given. The utility of such logarithms was
                    first pointed out by Leonelli in a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Supplément
                    logarithmique,</hi> printed at Bordeaux in the year XI. (1802-3); this work
                    being very scarce, a reprint of it was published by Μ. J. Houel in 1876.
                    Leonelli calculated a table to 14 places, but only a specimen of it which
                    appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Supplément</hi> was printed. The first table
                    that was actually published is due to Gauss, and was printed in Zach’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Monatliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Corresponded:,</hi> vol. xxvi. p.
                    498 (1812). Corresponding to the argument A it gives, to 5 places, B and C,
                    where</p>
                <p>A=logz, B = log(i + <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> C=log(l + z).</p>
                <p>so that C = A + B.</p>
                <p>We have identically log (α + δ)=logα + log ^1 + A) = l <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> g α + B(for argument logy); and, in using the table, the rule is to take
                    log <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to be the larger of the two logarithms, and to
                    enter the table with log <hi rend="italic">a -</hi> log <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    as argument; we then have log (α + δ) = log α + B, or, if we please, = log <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> + C. The formula for the difference is log (α - δ) = log
                    <hi rend="italic">b</hi> + A (argument sought in column C) if log <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi>- log <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is greater than <hi

                <p>The principal tables of Gaussian logarithms are (1) Mathiessen, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tafel zur bequemem Berechnung</hi> (Altona, 1818), giving B and C for argument
                    A to 7 places,—this table is not a convenient one; (2) Peter Gray, <hi

                    ordinary seven-figure table of logarithms.</p>
                <p>In 1829 Widenbach published at Copenhagen a small table of modified Gaussian

                <p>Gaussian logarithms are chiefly useful in the calculations connected with the

                    explained as follows. Suppose that the ratio of 10, or any other particular

                    unity, and if we denote it by the ratio of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to 1, then

                <p>Napier’s original work, the <hi rend="italic">Descriptio canonis</hi> of 1614,
                    contained, not logarithms of numbers, but logarithms of sines, and the relations
                    between the sines and the logarithms were explained by the motions of points in
                    lines, in a manner not unlike that afterwards employed by Newton in the method
                    of fluxions. An account of the processes by which Napier constructed his table
                    is given in the <hi rend="italic">Constructio canonis</hi> of 1619. These
                    methods apply, however, specially to Napier’s own kind of logarithms, and are
                    different from those actually used by Briggs in the construction of the tables
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica,</hi>
                    although some of the latter are the same in principle as the processes described
                    in an appendix to the <hi rend="italic">Constructio.</hi> It may be observed
                    that in the <hi rend="italic">Constructio</hi> logarithms are called
                    artificials, and this seems to have been the name first employed by Napier, but
                    which he subsequently replaced by logarithms. It is to be presumed that he would
                    have made the change of name also in the <hi rend="italic">Constructio,</hi> had
                    he lived to publish it himself.</p>
                <p>The processes used by Briggs are explained by him in the preface to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> (1624). His
                    method of finding the logarithms of the small primes, which consists in taking a
                    great number of continued geometric means between unity and the given primes,
                    may be described as follows. He first formed the table of numbers-and their
                    logarithms:</p>

                    To construct this table Briggs, using about thirty places of decimals, extracted
                    the square root of 10 fifty-four times, and thus found that the logarithm of

                    by means of a simple proportion deduced that log (1Ό0000 00000 00000 1) = 0O0000
                    00000 00000 04342 94481 90325 1804, so that, a quantity 1Ό0000 00000 00000 <hi

                    seventeen figures) having been obtained by repeated extraction of the square
                    root of a given number, the logarithm of 1Ό0000 00000 00000 <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> could then be found by multiplying <hi rend="italic">x</hi> by ∙00000

                <p>To find the logarithm of 2, Briggs raised it to the tenth power, viz., 1024, and
                    extracted the square root of 1Ό24 forty-seven times, the result being 1Ό0000
                    00000 00000 16851 60570 53949 77. Multiplying the significant figures by 4342 .

                    55936 90623 9336, which multiplied by 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 4τ</hi> gave
                    0Ό1029 99566 39811 95265 277444, the logarithm of 1Ό24, true to 17 or 18 places.
                    Adding the characteristic 3, and dividing by 10, he found (since 2 is the tenth
                    root of 1024) log 2 = <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 30102 99956 63981 195.
                    Briggs calculated in a similar manner log 6, and thence deduced log 3.</p>

                <p>Briggs also gave methods of forming the mean proportionals or square roots by
                    differences; and the general method of constructing logarithmic tables by means
                    of differences is due to him.</p>
                <p>The following calculation of log 5 is given as an example of the application of a
                    method of mean proportionals. The process consists in taking the geometric mean
                    of numbers above and below 5, the object being to at length arrive at 5Ό00000.
                    To every geometric mean in the column of numbers there corresponds the

                <p>Great attention was devoted to the methods of calculating logarithms during the
                    17th and 18th centuries. The earlier methods proposed were, like those of
                    Briggs, purely arithmetical, and for a long time logarithms were regarded from
                    the point of view indicated by their name, that is to say, as depending on the
                    theory of compounded ratios. The introduction of infinite series into
                    mathematics effected a great change in the modes of calculation and the
                    treatment of the subject. Besides Napier and Briggs, special reference should be
                    made to Kepler <hi rend="italic">{Chilias,</hi> 1624) and Mercator <hi
                    rend="italic">[Logarithmotechnia,</hi> 1668), whose methods were arithmetical,
                    and to Newton, Gregory, Halley, and Cotes, who employed series. A full and
                    valuable account of these methods is given in Hutton’s “Construction of
                    Logarithms,” which occurs in the introduction to the early editions of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mathematical Tables,</hi> and also forms tract 21 of his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mathematical Tracts</hi> (vol. i., 1812). Many of the early works
                    on logarithms were reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">logarithmici</hi> of Baron Maseres (6 vols. 4to, 1791-1807).</p>
                <p>In the following account only those formulae and methods will be referred to
                    which would now be used in the calculation of logarithms.</p>

                <p>The values of the other logarithms are given in the paper referred to.</p>
                <p>If the logarithms are Briggian all the series in the preceding formulae must be
                    multiplied by M, the modulus; thus, for example, l°gι <hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> (1 + <hi rend="italic">x)</hi> = M(x - ⅜z <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>

                    &amp;c. ), and so on.</p>
                <p>As has been stated, Abraham Sharp’s table contains 61-decimal Briggian logarithms
                    of primes up to 1100, so that the logarithms of all composite numbers whose
                    greatest prime factor does not exceed this number may be found by simple
                    addition; and Wolfram’s table gives 48-decimal hyperbolic logarithms of primes
                    up to 10,009. By means of these tables and of a factor table we may very readily
                    obtain the Briggian logarithm of a number to 61 or a less number of places or of
                    its hyperbolic logarithm to 48 or a less number of places in the following
                    manner. Suppose the hyperbolic logarithm of the prime number 43,867 required.
                    Multiplying by 50, we have 50 × 43,867 = 2,193,350, and on looking in

                    for a number near to this which shall have no prime factor greater than 10,009,

                <p>The principle of the method is to multiply the given prime (sup-Sosed to consist
                    of 4, 5, or 6 figures) by such a factor that the pro-uct may be a number within
                    the range of the factor tables, and such that, when it is increased by 1 or 2,
                    the prime factors may all be within the range of the logarithmic tables. The
                    logarithm is then obtained by use of the formula log«(a?-f-rf)=log«a:+-^- -⅜⅛

                    small as possible.</p>
                <p>If the logarithm required is Briggian, the value of the series is to be
                    multiplied by Μ.</p>
                <p>If the number is incommensurable or consists of more than seven figures, we can
                    take the first seven figures of it (or multiply and divide the result by any
                    factor, and take the first seven figures of the result) rfnd proceed as before.
                    An application to the hyperbolic logarithm of <hi rend="italic">π</hi> is given

                <p>The best general method of calculating logarithms consists, in its simplest form,
                    in resolving the number whose logarithm is required into factors of the form 1 -
                    ∙l&lt;∙n, where <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is one of the nine digits, and making
                    use of subsidiary tables of logarithms of factors of this form. For example,
                    suppose the logarithm of 543839 required to twelve places. Dividing by 10 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi> and by 5 the number becomes 1Ό87678, and resolving
                    this number into factors of the form 1 - <hi rend="italic">∙Vn</hi> we find
                    that</p>
                <p>543839 = 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 5</hi> × 5(1 - ∙1≡8)(1 — ∙1&lt;6)(1 - ∙l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> β</hi> 6)(l - ∙1 <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> 3)(1 - Ι <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 7</hi> 3)</p>
                <p>X (1 - ∙1 <hi rend="superscript"> 8</hi> 5)(1 - ∙l <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>
                    7)(l - ∙l <hi rend="superscript"> 10</hi> 9)(l - T <hi rend="superscript">

                    4</hi> 6 denotes 1 - ∙0006, &amp;c., and so on. All that is required therefore
                    in order to obtain the logarithm of any number is a table of logarithms, to the
                    required number of places, of <hi rend="italic">'n,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >'9n,</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> -</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >99ji,</hi> "999n, <hi rend="smallcaps">&amp;c.,</hi> for n=l, 2, 3, . . .
                    9.</p>
                <p>The resolution of a number into factors of the above form is easily performed.
                    Taking, for example, the number 1 ’ 087678, the object is to destroy the
                    significant figure 8 in the second place of decimals; this is effected by
                    multiplying the number by 1 - Ό8, that is, by subtracting from the number eight
                    times itself advanced two places, and we thus obtain l <hi rend="superscript">
                    -</hi> 00066376. To destroy the first 6 multiply by 1 - ∙0006 giving 1 ’
                    000063361744, and multiplying successively by 1 - ∙00006 and 1 - ∙000003, we
                    obtain 1 ’000000357932, and it is clear that these last six significant figures
                    represent without any further work the remaining factors required. In the
                    corresponding antilogarithmic process the number is expressed as a product of
                    factors of the form 1 + <hi rend="italic">'l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    n</hi><hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p>

                    of the form 1 - ∙l <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> n is generally known as

                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 01) <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> n, so that <hi
                    rend="italic">n</hi> had the values 1, 2, . . . 99; and subsequently he
                    constructed a similar table for factors of the form 1 + (∙01) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi> n∙ He also discovered a method of applying a table of
                    Hearn’s form (i,β., of factors of the form 1 + ’ l <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> 7i) to the construction of logarithms, and calculated a table of

                </table>
                <p>In Shortrede’s <hi rend="italic">Tables</hi> there are tables of logarithms and
                    factors of the form l±(<hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 01) <hi rend="superscript"
                    > r</hi> π to 16 places and of the form 1 ± (<hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> l)
                    <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> n to 25 places; and in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tables</hi><hi rend="italic">de Logarithmes à Tl Décimales</hi> (Paris, 1867)
                    Fédor Thoman gives tables of logarithms of factors of the form 1 ± ∙l <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> n. In the <hi rend="italic">Messenger of
                    Mathematics,</hi> vol. iii. pp. 66-92, 1873, Mr Henry Wace gave a simple and
                    clear account of both the logarithmic and antilogarithmic processes, with tables
                    of both Briggian and hyperbolic logarithms of factors of the form 1 ± T <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> n to 20 places.</p>
                <p>Although the method is usually known by the names of Weddle and Hearn, it is
                    really, in its essential features, due to Briggs, who gave in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arithmetica</hi><hi rend="italic">logarithmica</hi> of 1624 a table of the
                    logarithms of 1 + <hi rend="italic">'l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    r</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> up to r=9 to 15 places of decimals. It was first
                    formally proposed as an independent method, with great improvements, by Robert
                    Flower in <hi rend="italic">The Radix, a new way of making Logarithms,</hi>
                    which was published in 1771; and Leonelli, in his <hi rend="italic">Supplément
                    logarithmique</hi> (1802-3), already noticed, referred to Flower and reproduced
                    some of his tables. A complete bibliography of this method has been given by Mr
                    A. J. Ellis in a paper ‘ ‘ on the potential radix as a means of calculating
                    logarithms,” printed in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal
                    Society,</hi> vol. xxxi., 1881, pp. 401-407, and vol. xxxii., 1881, pp. 377-379.
                    Reference should also be made to Hoppe’s <hi rend="italic">Tafeln zur
                    dreissigstelligen logarithmischen Rechnung</hi> (Leipsic, 1876), which give in a
                    somewhat modified form a table of the hyperbolic logarithm of 1 + <hi
                    rend="italic">'Vn.</hi></p>
                <p>The preceding methods are only appropriate for the calculation of isolated
                    logarithms. If a complete table had to be reconstructed, or calculated to more
                    places, it would undoubtedly be most convenient to employ the method of
                    differences. A full account of this method as applied to the calculation of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Tables du Cadastre</hi> is given by Μ. Lefort in vol. iv. of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Annales de</hi><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic"
