                <p><label type="entry">LAND</label>, in the sense in which it will be used in this
                    article, which treats especially of its possession and tenure, includes that
                    portion of the earth of which industry has rendered either the surface or the
                    mineral riches underneath available for human requirements. It forms thus the
                    storehouse from which nearly all human wealth is drawn, since it nourishes the
                    animals and plants which supply mankind with food and clothing, and yields the
                    stone, the coal, and the metals which make existence possible and progressive.
                    The history of its use is therefore a main element in the history of our race,
                    and the manner of its tenure and employment lies at the root of political and
                    economic science. In the present article it is proposed to sketch in outline the
                    historical development of the ideas relating to land, and briefly to point out
                    the leading principles which influence its tenure and beneficial employment
                    under present circumstances.</p>
                <p>The history of land commences with the division of men into tribes, for the
                    division of tribes involves distinction of territory. The earliest age, when men
                    lived solely on wild fruits or on the produce of the chase, may still be
                    pictured to us in the habits of the North American Indians, while the second or
                    pastoral stage is represented in modern times by the life of the Tartars of the
                    Asian steppes. In both these conditions an immense tract of country is absorbed
                    in the support of a small population, but the hardships of existence, aided
                    sometimes by organized systems of child-murder, serve to keep the inhabitants
                    within the limits of subsistence. Under such circumstances each tribe jealously
                    guards its own territory from intrusion by others, but within its range all
                    members of the community have equal and unrestricted rights of use. Among
                    civilized nations the principle still survives. Each modern nation claims a
                    special ownership in the fisheries within a certain distance of its coasts; but
                    among the inhabitants of these coasts there is a common right to fish in the
                    waters thus reserved. So also each modern state recognizes the shores as far as
                    high water <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0275-0260"/> mark, and the estuaries with their harvests of
                    wild fowl, as the common property of its subjects. Even inland game is still not
                    individual property, and in countries where legal rights are so ancient or so
                    modern as in the Channel Islands and the United States of America, the local law
                    is alike liberal in allowing to every one the right of sporting over his
                    neighbour’s ground, except in so far as modified by express and recent
                    legislation.</p>
                <p>But the higher races very early discovered an ampler means of industrial
                    existence than the natural produce of the earth affords. At what period in human
                    history the artificial cultivation of plants was discovered it is impossible to
                    say. We know that it was posterior to the division of the Aryan currents that
                    flowed towards Hindustan and towards Europe, but before the subdivision of the
                    latter; for the words denoting a field, a plough, and some species of grain have
                    a common root in the Greek, the Latin, and the Germanic dialects, but not in the
                    Sanskrit. But so soon as agriculture began it involved of necessity an approach
                    to more settled habits. This change in the manner of life would combine with the
                    fuller and more regular supply of food to promote a rapid increase of
                    population. So long, however, as this did not exceed the resources of the
                    territory belonging to the tribe, it would not of itself involve any change in
                    the idea that its use was common to all. A certain portion of ground would be
                    devoted to tillage, a certain number of the tribe would be appointed to perform
                    the acts of cultivation, and the produce would be stored in the general barn. We
                    have at the present day examples of such a system in some of the allmends of the
                    Swiss canton of Valais, where a portion of the lands of the village is
                    cultivated by joint labour, and the produce devoted to joint feasting. But it
                    appears that in general this stage rapidly progressed to one of apportionment of
                    the land in separate and smaller districts. The tribe, augmenting in numbers and
                    perhaps in extent of territory, subdivided itself into villages, and each
                    village exercised a tolerably independent rule over its own district. Within
                    this range it still maintained a community of the forest and pasture, but the
                    special skill and toil demanded by husbandry in most cases soon led to the
                    appropriation to each family of a portion of the arable land in exclusive
                    property. Still, however, the principle of common right prevailed so far that
                    the village rulers changed every year the lots assigned for culture, so that one
                    year of crop, followed by a relapse into natural growth for a succession of
                    years, was the normal rotation. It is one which modern science cannot condemn,
                    for where space is ample and the use of manure is unknown, there is no sounder
                    method of cultivation. It is still, according to M. Laveleye, exemplified in the
                    Ardennes region of Belgium.</p>
                <p>It is at this stage that contemporary observers first describe the tenure of laud
                    in ancient times, and illustrations of its survival in modern periods grow
                    abundant. These will be hereafter pointed out. But except in special
                    circumstances it is obvious that progress could not stop here. As population
                    increased in each district, the available hunting grounds would diminish, and at
                    the same time the necessity of more extensive and more frequent cultivation of
                    crops would increase. By this process, in the absence of manure, the land would
                    inevitably become less productive. But just as it demanded more labour it would
                    become more definitely appropriated to a single family, for those who laboured
                    most would not willingly give place to those who had been less active. A stage
                    would then be reached in which community of possession would be limited to the
                    pasture lands of the village, and the arable lands would be possessed in
                    permanence by each family. There generally was, indeed, while the territory
                    still sufficed, a recognition of the right of each individual to an allotment
                    from the common land. But at last the period would come in which this could be
                    no longer afforded, and when either the tribe must migrate in a body, or cast
                    off a swarm to seek its fortunes elsewhere, or leave a certain number of its
                    members without the privilege of landed possession, to obtain subsistence in
                    services to the rest, or in trades. When the two former alternatives become
                    impracticable, the third is the inevitable course. Private property in land
                    becomes then established, and we have thenceforward a new system, involving
                    consequences for good and evil which legislation seeks to regulate.</p>
                <p>With this general notion of the course of development it will now be convenient
                    to trace, in some instances which have most affected the world’s progress, the
                    history and the results of the use and appropriation of land.</p>
                <p>In primitive Rome each household formed an absolute despotism, of which the
                    father was the despot; households were united into gentes by derivation from a
                    common ancestor, and the state consisted in a combination of gentes. To each
                    household there was originally assigned a small portion (2 jugera, 1∣ acres) of
                    land to be held in perpetuity as private property <hi rend="italic"
                    >(heredium),</hi> and it may be assumed that on the death of a paterfamilias
                    each son would be entitled to a like amount from the common lands of the gens.
                    These common lands formed the main possession of the gentes, and it appears that
                    they were to some degree cultivated in common, as well as used for pasturage.
                    The state, however, also held common lands, partly original, partly derived from
                    cession by each conquered neighbour, and these were let for rent <hi
                    rend="italic">(vectigal)</hi> in so far as not partitioned out. Cicero <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Rep.,</hi> ii. 9, 14) says that Numa was the first who divided
                    the conquered lands into private shares, but it is certain that the example was
                    only partially followed. But by the time of Servius Tullius the original private
                    portion of many households must have been greatly but unequally enlarged, for
                    his new military organization was based on the obligation of service imposed on
                    the freeholders <hi rend="italic">(assidui)</hi> as distinguished from the mere
                    labourers and breeders of children <hi rend="italic">(proletarii).</hi> The
                    “classes” of the assidui were five, those who possessed 20 jugera (12 j acres),
                    and who were specially denominated classici, and those who possessed
                    respectively 15, 10, 5, and 2∣ jugera. The first class, or classici, were about
                    the half of the whole number of assidui, the second, third, and fourth classes
                    comprised each about one-eighth of the entire number, and the fifth class was
                    slightly more numerous. The equites formed a separate order, based on the
                    possession of a still larger extent of land. At the same time a register of land
                    was established, in which each owner was required to enter his property, and
                    which was revised every four years, and sales were directed to be made before
                    two witnesses. These arrangements show that even at this epoch the system of
                    separate private property was in full operation, and that the difference of
                    wealth which it engenders had already reached an advanced stage.</p>
                <p>The progress of conquest, which at once enlarged the territory, brought in
                    tribute, and furnished slaves, rapidly increased such inequalities. Trade, which
                    followed conquest, and in which capitalists made large fortunes, tended in the
                    same direction. Very early in Roman legal history we come upon tenancy-at-will,
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">precarium,</hi> which of itself showed that
                    there must have been large estates capable of subdivision. But besides tenants,
                    each extensive landowner had a household of retainers, clients, freedmen, and
                    latterly slaves, who tilled his ground for his personal profit. Thus there would
                    be little demand for free labour, and the petty husbandman, whose small
                    inheritance was inadequate for a growing family, fell necessarily into debt. His
                    land would then be seized under the strict Roman law of bankruptcy, and he
                    himself <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n276/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0276-0261"/> would sink into slavery, or at best into the
                    already overcrowded class of labourers for insufficient hire. At the same time
                    the conquered lands, which by theory were the property of the state, and to
                    which every citizen had an equal right, were largely portioned out to the
                    existing landowners, who held the chief posts and influence in the government.
                    The revenues drawn from tribute were also farmed out to capitalists, and the
                    taxes on the public were augmented in consequence of the permitted frauds of the
                    collectors. At last came the crisis. The army, no longer representing the wealth
                    of the state, but rather the proletariat, mutinied, and from the Mons Sacer
                    menaced the city. It was the commencement of the long struggle of which the
                    successive <hi rend="smallcaps">Agrabian Laws</hi> fø.w.) were the landmark and
                    remedies.</p>
                <p>The object of these laws was well illustrated by the Licinian proposal(387
                    A.U.C.), nearly one hundred years after the first outbreak of discontent. It
                    enacted that no citizen should hold more than 500 jugera of the public lands,
                    that no one should graze more than one hundred oxen and five hundred sheep on
                    the common lands, and that every landowner should be obliged to employ a number
                    of free labourers proportioned to that of his slaves. But this, as all other
                    laws proposed on behalf of the people, was coupled with political changes of
                    which the main object was to open up new fields of ambition to those of the
                    plebeians who were already opulent. When that object was attained, the agrarian
                    remedies were suffered to fall into desuetude. The successful wars waged in the
                    6th and 7th centuries A.u.c. gave a temporary outlet to labour in the formation
                    of agricultural colonies. But it at the same time immensely increased the number
                    of slaves, who were treated as mere beasts of toil, to be worked out or sold off
                    when no longer profitable. The free population, on the testimony of Cato and
                    Polybius, diminished; the slave population increased, and became in many
                    districts an organized danger to public safety. A century later the Gracchi
                    again endeavoured to restore health to the body politic by a distribution of the
                    state lands among the proletariat. The attempt was stifled in blood, but the
                    necessity of the measure was proved by the fact that a full generation later
                    Caius Julius Caesar carried out the same reform.</p>
                <p>The time for remedy was, however, past. The great estates <hi rend="italic"
                    >(latifundia)</hi> had already been created; they were respected by the
                    reformers, alike popular and imperial; and their inevitable growth swallowed up
                    the small farms of new creation, and ultimately destroyed Rome. For its manhood
                    was gone; the wealth of millionaires could not purchase back honesty or courage;
                    and the defence of mercenaries failed to form any barrier against the wars of
                    hardy northern invaders. Pliny’s words “latifundia perdidere Italiam” embrace
                    the truth, yet more fully made clear in many a generation after he wrote.</p>
                <p>We shall now examine the systems prevalent in the nations by which the Roman
                    empire was overthrown. Two great Roman writers, Caesar and Tacitus, have given
                    us a vivid picture of the German customs showing us the tenure of land in its
                    earliest forms. Caesar <hi rend="italic">(De Bell. Gall.,</hi> vi.) says of the
                    Germans of his time :—</p>
                <p>“They are not much given to agriculture, but live chiefly on milk, cheese, and
                    flesh. No one has a fixed quantity of land or boundaries of his property, but
                    the magistrates and chiefs every year assign to the communities and families who
                    live together as much land and in such spots as they think suitable, and require
                    them in the following year to remove to another allotment. Many reasons for this
                    custom are suggested: one is that they should not be led by permanence of
                    residence to renounce the pursuits of war for agriculture, another that the
                    desire of extensive possession should not induce the more powerful to seize the
                    land of the weaker, another that they should not construct their houses with
                    greater care to keep out heat and cold, another that the love of money should
                    not create parties and disputes, and lastly that the mass of the people might
                    remain contented with the justice of an arrangement under which every one saw
                    his position as comfortable as that of the most powerful. As to the tribes
                    themselves, their chief glory is to have their territory surrounded with as wide
                    a belt as possible of desolated waste. They deem it not only a special mark of
                    valour that every neighbouring tribe should be driven to a distance, and no
                    stranger should dare to reside in their vicinity, but at the same time they view
                    it as a measure of precaution against the risk of sudden attacks.”</p>
                <p>A hundred years later the description of Tacitus shows that a certain
                    modification of habit had been induced. Bringing together the leading
                    particulars, we find he speaks of Germany as “covered with woods and morasses,
                    the land fairly fertile but unsuited for fruit trees, well adapted for pasture,
                    and carrying numerous herds of small sized polled cattle, in which the chief
                    wealth of the natives consisted.” But they seem no longer to have changed their
                    actual dwellings every year, but to have</p>
                <p>“Built them with a certain rough solidity, and in villages, though the houses
                    were not contiguous, but each was surrounded by a space of its own. The right of
                    succession by children was recognized, and in default of children brothers and
                    uncles took, but there was no right of making a will. They preferred to acquire
                    property by war rather than by industry. Interest on loans was unknown. The land
                    was apportioned (to villages apparently) according to the number of cultivators,
                    and divided among them according to their rank, there being ample room for all.
                    Every year they changed the arable land, which formed only a portion of the
                    whole, not attempting to make labour vie with the natural fertility and
                    abundance of the soil by planting orchards or setting out gardens and fields,
                    but content with a single crop. Their food consisted chiefly of wild fruits,
                    freshly killed game, and curds; their drink was a liquor prepared from barley or
                    wheat, feι <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> mented like wine. Their slaves were
                    not kept in the house, but each had a separate dwelling and an allowance of
                    food, and they were treated with humanity, as servants or tenants.”</p>
                <p>These institutions were then obviously based on the existence of an ample supply
                    of unenclosed and common land. But the natural increase of population, combined
                    with the pressure put on the Germanic tribes from the east by the Slavs, made
                    their territories too small for their ambition, if not for their maintenance,
                    and five or six succeeding centuries were marked in the history of Europe
                    chiefly by successive Germanic conquest and occupation of western and southern
                    territory. The enormous increase of power and possession made it impossible for
                    the original tribal government to survive; the great generals developed into
                    kings and emperors, and their lieutenants, more or less independent according to
                    individual capacity and distance from the capital, became dukes and counts.
                    Gradually military authority, embracing the old idea of the land being the
                    property of the state, evolved the new notion of feudalism. The sovereign
                    represented the state; to him in that capacity land conquered from the enemy, or
                    forfeited by unsuccessful rebellion, became subject; and he granted it to his
                    followers on condition of faithful service in war. They promised to be “his
                    men,” and from their own tenants they exacted in turn the like promise on the
                    like conditions. The general insecurity made even free owners willing to buy the
                    support of the sovereign on similar term^. Thus by degrees, less by derivation
                    from the ideas of Roman law, to which it is sometimes attributed, than by the
                    mere necessity of the times, and as a consequence of the incessant state of
                    warfare in which mankind existed, there came to be established the feudal
                    doctrine that all land was held of the sovereign on condition of suit and
                    service, and that each immediate tenant of the sovereign was entitled to
                    sub-infeudate his possession on the same principles. Gradually the further
                    attributes of property were added; service in war was commuted into , rent, and
                    the peaceful service of tilling the lord’s reserved domain. The right of
                    hereditary succession became grafted on the personal grant; the power of sale
                    and devise followed. Local usages still had influence, but it may be said
                    broadly that from about the 10th century private property, subject to feudal <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n277/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0277-0262"/> conditions, became the principle of the tenure of
                    land in Europe.</p>
                <p>There are, however, some nations in which feudalism has struck no root, or at
                    least has not succeeded iu seriously modifying the original type of common
                    possession. It will be best to advert to some of them before proceeding further
                    with the history of feudalism in its modern development.</p>
                <p>The Indian branch of the Aryan stock has preserved with great fidelity the
                    original notion of the possession of land. The village, consisting of detached
                    houses and surrounded with the district belonging to it, forms still a
                    self-regulating community. It is a legal person, to which the state looks for
                    its rights, but which when performing them is free from internal state
                    interference. It holds the forest and pasture ground in common property,
                    allowing their use to each person entitled to the village rights. To each family
                    is further apportioned a measure of arable land, but the stage is in general
                    passed at which this portion is changed in successive years, and it is therefore
                    the hereditary property of the family. But it is not in strictness subject
                    either to will, to mortgage, or to sale. It is divisible on the death of the
                    head of the family among his children, any of whom may transfer their shares to
                    another member of the village, but not, except with its leave, to a stranger.
                    These ancient customs have to some extent been modified by the introduction of
                    English law, which, among other things, has subjected the villagers to the
                    grinding exactions of the money-lenders, by giving creditors the security of an
                    English mortgage. It cannot but be regretted that the desire to act justly which
                    has led to the change should have been misled by the idea that whatever
                    institution exists in England is necessarily and everywhere else equally
                    equitable and necessary.</p>
                <p>In Europe the Slav peoples, the latest arrival of Aryan stock in Europe, have
                    preserved best the ancient characteristics of land tenure. Checked in their
                    advance to the south-east, they have formed a narrow borderland in Bulgaria,
                    Servia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, between the Germans on the one side and the Turks
                    on the other. Here, therefore, we have the case of a population growing within a
                    restricted area, under circumstances which prevented the development of
                    extensive military sway, and its consequent feudalism. Accordingly we find
                    prevailing a system midway between the ancient communism of the Germanic tribes
                    and the institution of private property. The tribes have become broken up into
                    families. Common lands, except where there is mountain or forest, have been
                    partitioned into the separate ownership of families. But within the families
                    there is still a strong sentiment of community. In the Servian and Bulgarian
                    villages each family household consists of probably several generations, all
                    housed under the same roof or within the same curtilage. The head of the family
                    is judge rather than master; any member of the family may depart, but in so
                    doing he abandons his claim to the family property, a claim, however, which in
                    some cases may revive should he return to the paternal home. All who remain work
                    in common at their appointed duties, and share in common the produce. The family
                    possessions are inalienable; the share of each member is untransferable.</p>
                <p>To the north and east the faculty of unlimited emigration to the unoccupied lands
                    of the steppe permitted or enforced the preservation of a still earlier type of
                    common property. When the Russian village found its lands inadequate to its
                    growing population, it threw off a swarm. The emigrants travelled in a compact
                    body till they passed beyond the limits of present cultivation, and then took up
                    their position on such lands as pleased them. For their protection against the
                    aboriginal hunters who still roamed over the plains they built their houses on
                    the uniform plan of an enclosed village, and the same reason concurred with
                    native habit to induce them to maintain the system of common pasturage, and of
                    united cultivation of the land apportioned to cropping. When the central
                    government became strong enough to assert its sway over the scattered
                    settlements, it levied its tax on the mir, or village community, and the
                    community apportioned the amount per capita among its members. But, as land was
                    ample in extent for all, it gave to each male, from the moment even of birth, a
                    right to a share. When the shares became inadequate a fresh migration took
                    place.</p>
                <p>Serfdom took its rise in the prohibition of these migrations. Forbidden to depart
                    to new lauds, the peasants were compelled to submit to the demands for their
                    labour either of the Government, where it held estates in the neighbourhood of a
                    village, or of nobles to whom grants of land had been made by the czar.
                    Generally they were thus forced to give half their time to labour for their
                    master. But they still continued possessors of their share in the village lands,
                    and entitled to apply the other half of their time to its cultivation.</p>
                <p>When emancipation came, their rights were regulated on the same basis. The
                    village was maintained as an industrial and fiscal organization. But each
                    peasant was declared to be entitled to a certain fixed minimum of land for his
                    own property, varying according to the district, but on an average about 12
                    acres. For this, in so far as being in excess of the village lands it had to be
                    made up from the land of adjoining owners, he is required to pay either
                    services, to the extent of forty days in the year, or rent, at an average rate
                    of about 2s. 4d. per acre. Such provisions can only be temporary. They resemble
                    much those which prevailed in Germany prior to the modern reforms in tenure.
                    They subject the peasant, untaught and unaccustomed to habits of individual
                    energy, to a tax which he is not able to meet, and the suffering and complaints
                    which are the consequence are at present general throughout Russia.</p>
                <p>In Switzerland also there has survived a system only slightly altered from that
                    of the original communities. For here also conquest with its attendant feudalism
                    was stayed, and freemen and free institutions survived the wreck which war made
                    throughout western Europe. In the forest cantons especially there still exists
                    an essential community of land right. The inhabitants possess separately and by
                    ordinary rules of inheritance certain portions of land. But in several cantons
                    the bulk of the land, both arable, forest, and pastoral, forms the allmend of
                    the state, or of the commune,—the common property, to which every descendant of
                    the original inhabitants has a right. This common laud is either partitioned out
                    by lot to each person entitled, or is let for a rent, which is applied to the
                    common benefit, or is made the subject of common labour, and the produce of
                    bread and wine is devoted to common merry-makings. When the arable land is
                    divided among cultivators, the period allowed before repartition is from five to
                    nine years, and it is stated that so strong is the feeling of common interest
                    that the shortness of the time does not interfere with the highest cultivation
                    by each successive occupant. In some districts it furnishes farms of 20 acres to
                    each family, in others it only suffices for allotments of a few perches.</p>
                <p>In France the custom of village proprietary survived in many districts down to
                    the middle of the 17th century. But previous to the middle of the 18th century
                    nearly the whole of the soil had passed into the hands of great landowners. The
                    tenants and peasants were ground down with heavy exactions, not only in the form
                    of rent, but of state taxation, and in services, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >corvées,</hi> to be rendered to the lord or to the state. The artificial life
                    of the nobles at court destroyed all sympathy between them and the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n278/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0278-0263"/> cultivators, and brought them to look on their
                    dependants as little more than beasts of burden, valuable only for the profit
                    that might be made of them. The feeling engendered on the other side broke out
                    in the Revolution. The country estates, from which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >emigres</hi> had fled, were sold in portions, and in many cases bought in fee
                    simple for a trifle by the former tenants of the farms. The law of equal
                    division among children continued the process of subdivision. It proceeds in an
                    augmenting ratio, and though a few large properties still subsist, the bulk of
                    the land in France is now held in small properties. It is not, however,
                    universally cultivated by the owner. There is a large proportion of tenants,
                    holding generally under leases not exceeding nine years; and there is no doubt
                    that the shortness of the term impairs production. Another evil is the <hi
                    rend="italic">morcellement</hi> caused by the law of compulsory division on
                    inheritance, but this must not be understood as objected to chiefly on the
                    ground of the small extent of ground held by each proprietor. The real
                    disadvantage complained of by French writers on agriculture is that through
                    successive family divisions each man’s total property consists of a number of
                    small plots scattered up and down; and the remedy desired is not an interference
                    with the present law of succession, but only an enactment to facilitate exchange
                    and consolidation of plots, so as to give to each cultivator his whole property
                    within one boundary.</p>
                <p>In France there are now about 2,000,000 properties under 12 acres, and 1,000,000
                    between 12 and 25 acres, while there are only 150,000 above 100 acres. Of the
                    whole population there are 1,750,000 who cultivate their own land with their own
                    hands, and who are not tenants, 850,000 who cultivate as tenants, and only
                    57,000 who cultivate by aid of a foreman or steward. Of farm labourers there are
                    only 870,000. Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and great portions
                    of Italy are similarly divided into small holdings cultivated in general by the
                    owner and his family.</p>
                <p>In Germany, although feudalism was fully developed as a legal system and as the
                    foundation of the aristocracy, it did not succeed in extirpating entirely the
                    ancient rights of the people. A large portion of the land was held always as
                    peasant properties, entirely free from any dues of service. Among these, in
                    certain districts, there survived an organization essentially identical with
                    that described by Taöitus. The village had its domain or mark, subdivided into
                    the arable, the pasture, and the forest. In some cases the first of these was
                    partitioned into individual and permanent properties, but in all the pasture and
                    forest remained the joint property of the village. Instances, however, were not
                    wanting even in our own days where the arable portion was subject to annual or
                    less frequent repartition, and to apportionment by lot to each cultivator for
                    the time which custom ordained. But even where this usage did not prevail, it
                    was incumbent on all the villagers (as in Russia) to cultivate their several
                    portions of the arable mark with the same crops and at the same seasons, for as
                    soon as the crops were removed the whole community enjoyed a right of pasturage
                    on the stubble. The rotation was, therefore, of the simplest, consisting in
                    general of a triennial succession of wheat or rye as winter-sown grain, followed
                    by oats and barley as spring-sown crop, and then fallow. It differed for the
                    worse from that of the ancient Germans in that the circumscribed limits of each
                    village domain made it now impossible to allow to the whole arable mark a period
                    of rest under pasturage.</p>
                <p>But intermixed everywhere with the relics of the free village institutions the
                    tree of feudalism struck its roots, and carried with it a species of serfage.
                    None who were not noble could as a rule purchase land. On the lands of the
                    nobles the tenants were bound to give to their lord a portion of their time in
                    gratuitous labour. They held, however, their farms under conditions of
                    permanency, subject to this tax of labour, and to a variety of small and
                    irregular exactions of the nature of rent On this state of things in Prussia the
                    Stein and Hardenberg reforms took effect. They gave to every peasant the same
                    power as the noble enjoyed to become a landowner. Between the nobles and their
                    tenants they partitioned the land in absolute property, the landlord retaining
                    one-third, the tenant receiving two-thirds. Common rights, and rents, were made
                    purchaseable by the owner of the soil at twenty years’ purchase of their
                    estimated value. And laws of 1821 and 1850 sanctioned the division of common
                    lands among all who previously had an interest in them. To aid the peasantry in
                    purchasing up the dues still payable to their former landlords, land credit
                    banks were introduced in 1850. These institutions advanced to the peasant owner
                    the sum necessary for the purchase of the old rights over his property, commuted
                    as they had already been to a definite sum. The advance thus made constituted a
                    first charge on the land, and was represented by debenture bonds for small
                    amounts. The owner might pay to their credit, at whatever time and in whatever
                    sums he was able, instalments towards their redemption, but he was bound to
                    redeem them fully within fifty years.</p>
                <p>These reforms have converted large parts of Germany into the property of small
                    owners residing on and tilling their own land, free from obligation to any other
                    person. There do not seem to be data for judging of the economic result, because
                    statistics do not distinguish between the produce of small properties and that
                    of the large properties intermixed with them. But the most careful observers
                    agree that the social results are similar in Germany to what they are elsewhere.
                    The peasants, attached to their holdings, form the most stable element in the
                    commonwealth. Their love of the land shows itself in the high prices given for
                    it, and, as we shall see elsewhere, in the tendency to borrow in order to
                    purchase more. It can at least be said that, whatever be the hardships of their
                    lot, they would not exchange it for any other.</p>
                <p>The tenure of land in Great Britain may be traced with &lt; sufficient accuracy
                    from the character of the elements of which the nation is composed. Under the
                    Celtic tribes there can be no doubt that the ideas which we know prevailed among
                    the ancient Irish and among the Scottish clans down to modern times formed the
                    universal rule. The land was the possession of the clan; the chief was the
                    leader but not the owner. The temporary and partial occupation by the Romans may
                    have introduced the notion of absolute private property, and we may assume that
                    it was at least asserted by such of the conquerors as cared to cultivate estates
                    taken from the barbarians. But the withdrawal of the Romans, followed by the
                    Saxon invasion, must have re-established the principle of common village
                    ownership which formed the basis of both Celtic and German tenure. In the later
                    Saxon period, however, there is no doubt that private ownership became gradually
                    more extended. Then the feudal idea began to make progress in England, as it did
                    at the same period on the Continent. It received an immense impulse from the
                    Norman Conquest. William may not have claimed the whole land of England as his
                    own, but the vast tracts which fell into his hands through confiscation of
                    rights of so-called rebels were granted by him in the character of lord to such
                    of the Saxons as he could trust, and to those of his own followers whom he
                    desired to reward. When law began to form a system, the early Norman lawyers
                    took this principle as the basis of their system. Thenceforth it became the
                    undisputed maxim of English law, as well as of Scottish (with the exception of
                    some isolated remains of “udal” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n279/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0279-0264"/> rights in Orkney), that the sovereign was supreme
                    lord of all the land, and that every one held under him as tenant in England,
                    vassal in Scotland, names which have survived in legal theory and language down
                    to the present day. They expressed then as now the unquestionable legal rule
                    that there is no such thing in our system as an absolute private right of
                    property in land, but that the state alone is vested with that right and
                    concedes to the individual possessor only a strictly defined subordinate right,
                    subject to conditions from time to time enacted by the community.</p>
                <p>Within Scotland the feudal system has been preserved in remarkable purity. The
                    majority of the larger estates, as well as many small ones, are still nominally
                    held of the crown, and pay an annual rent, or “feu-duty,” along with certain
                    fines on succession or alienation, nor is the title of any heir or vendee
                    complete till he has received the written acknowledgment of the sovereign. But
                    each owner who holds of the sovereign may grant a subordinate estate to be held
                    of himself as “superior” or lord, on such terms as he thinks fit, and the
                    “vassal” thus constituted must in future obtain recognition of his title from
                    his immediate superior, just as if he held directly of the crown. It is only
                    within the last few years that the subordinate vassals thus holding have been
                    allowed the means of commuting the services they had bound themselves to pay to
                    the “subject superior,” and of converting themselves into direct vassals of the
                    crown, which forms the nearest approach to private property permitted by the law
                    of Scotland.</p>
                <p>In England feudal forms became partially obliterated at an earlier period. In 18
                    Edward I. parliament had put an end to subinfeudation. The services due by the
                    crown’s tenants were by a statute of Charles IΓ. reduced to a form which left
                    them merely nominal. But at a very remote period there had sprung up a tenure
                    which in many respects was equivalent to feudal tenure. The serfs who cultivated
                    the lord’s lands, although at first subject to his absolute pleasure, yet, being
                    left undisturbed for a considerable series of years, fell under the doctrine of
                    English jurisprudence which recognizes custom as having the force of law. They
                    gained thus a right of occupation in permanence, paying only such rents or
                    services as were entered in the copy of the rolls of the manorial court, from
                    which their tenure came to be designated copyholds. By degrees they obtained
                    manumission from servitude, and with it the right of alienating or bequeathing
                    the land they thus held. There were therefore two principal classes of property
                    in England, freeholds, holding in general directly of the crown, and copyholds,
                    holding of a lord of the manor, but both with indefeasible title subject to
                    trifling services ascertained by custom or by statute. It would seem that in
                    these two forms a very large number of those whom we now should call yeomen or
                    peasant proprietors were established throughout the country. But in addition to
                    these there were on the large estates a great number of those whom we should now
                    properly call tenants-at-will, renting lands of the lord, and not established
                    for a sufficient length of time to have acquired the status of copyholders.</p>
                <p>About the middle of the 14th century English wool was found to be peculiarly well
                    adapted to the use of the weavers of the Low Countries, and brought a high
                    price. This led the owners of the large estates to substitute pasturage for
                    tillage, and by consequence many of the cultivating tenants-at-will were
                    evicted. Hence arose complaints precisely similar in motive and language to
                    those which in our own times have been excited by the clearings in Ireland and
                    the Highlands for the purpose of substituting sheep farming in place of
                    husbandry by cottars and crofters. During the 15th century, probably for the
                    same reason, the extensive wastes which covered a large part of England began to
                    be enclosed, to the consequent disturbance of a number of squatters (called at
                    the time “champions,” from <hi rend="italic">champs)</hi> who had settled on
                    them, and derived a not very sufficient subsistence from feeding a few animals
                    on the commons. It is noticeable that both Fitzherbert and Tusser, the earliest
                    English agricultural writers, and the latter himself one of the people, commend
                    the enclosures, on the ground that the land so reduced to separate ownership
                    produced much more than it had done as commons. But these causes, combining with
                    the breaking up of the monasteries, and the absorption of church lands into the
                    estates of the adjoining landowners, gave rise to much disorder and misery.
                    Parliament attempted to deal with the causes and effects by enactments directed
                    by turns against the high rate of wages, against the destruction of farm houses
                    and cottages, and against the idle or unemployed tramps who roamed over the
                    country. It was a period of dislocation of social relations, of which we are not
                    now in a position to judge accurately. But undoubtedly the ultimate result was a
                    considerable increase in the magnitude of the larger estates and farms, gained
                    by a proportionate decrease in the number of both of smaller size. It is from
                    this period that we must date the diminution of the class of yeomen which has
                    been the theme of lamentation with economists and historians down to our own
                    times.</p>
                <p>Contemporaneously with these changes the law was receiving those adjustments
                    which tended to preserve the large estates undiminished in the possession of
                    their hereditary owners. Entails were sanctioned by statute (De donis, 13 Edw.
                    I.), but broken down some two centuries later by the ingenious judicial devices
                    of fines and recoveries. Trusts were invented by the churchmen, but attacked by
                    parliament, only to be re-established under the technical name of trusts upon
                    uses. Lastly, estates for life were invented; and, being skilfully combined with
                    so much of the principle of entails as the courts had sanctioned, they have
                    formed the still existing method by which family estates are preserved from
                    dispersion. The rule of law is that all persons living at the date of a
                    settlement may be restricted to mere estates for their own lives, instead of
                    taking the fee simple with full right of alienation. In this way each son when
                    he succeeds finds himself merely a tenant for life, and as such possessed of no
                    power to prevent his own son from becoming owner in fee simple when he in turn
                    shall succeed. But a father so situated is little inclined to leave to his son
                    powers of which he himself is deprived, while his son is generally willing to
                    barter his future liberty for a present liberal allowance. Thus father and son
                    strike a bargain; the father buys the son’s surrender of his future right, and
                    the son, for a price, agrees to submit himself to the restraints of being merely
                    tenant for life when his father shall die. The process repeated from generation
                    to generation has re-established in practice the system of entails which the
                    courts had abrogated as contrary to public policy, and which every writer from
                    Bacon downwards has denounced as hurtful to the nation.</p>
                <p>Similar rules prevailed in Scotland. But, as entails were there of later
                    introduction, so they were much more strict, and from 1680 to 1848 land might be
                    settled in an endless succession of inconvertible life estates. In the latter
                    year an Act was passed which, with a good deal of complication, substantially
                    limits the right of creating life estates to one generation as in England. In
                    1875 another Act introduced the useful principle that the owner of a life estate
                    might in certain circumstances buy up and extinguish some of the contingent
                    interests in succession to his own at their present value, ascertained by
                    computation based on the expectation of life.</p>
                <p>The system of entails, or of creation of estates for life only, which has thus
                    prevailed for several centuries in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n280/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0280-0265"/> United Kingdom, is sufficient to account for the
                    fact that the large estates have continually augmented, in size and number, by
                    the corresponding absorption of the small properties of yeomen. These small
                    properties are seldom subjected to strict settlement. The owners occasionally
                    fall into difficulties, and then their land is sold to pay their debts. They are
                    frequently moved by natural affection either to divide their estates among
                    children, or to subject them to charges for children other than the heir, and
                    this also tends to bring them into the market for sale. But the large adjoining
                    properties, the owners of which have been induced by family pride to limit their
                    right to mere life interests, are not liable to be sold for debt. The immediate
                    possessor may be crippled during his life, but his heir will succeed to the
                    estate free from incumbrance by any prior possessor. In the same way the powers
                    of each successive owner to charge the estate for younger children, and the
                    liability to sale for payment of such charges, is restricted within narrow
                    limits. These properties therefore continue undiminished; and, when a small
                    adjoining freehold comes into the market, it is seldom that the owner of the
                    larger estate cannot find the money to effect its purchase. Once obtained, it is
                    included in the next settlement of the larger estate, and thus permanently
                    withdrawn from the operation of natural processes of disintegration. On the
                    whole, it follows that large estates tend to grow, and in precisely the same
                    proportion small ones tend to disappear.</p>
                <p>It may be further observed that this tendency is materially aided by an absurdly
                    bad and expensive conveyancing system, and by the law of mortgage. The costs of
                    transfer of land are so enormous in England that they form a very large
                    percentage on the price of small properties, and preclude any one from
                    purchasing them with the motive of making a living upon them. So also the
                    insecurity of title, which is greatest on the smaller properties, because they
                    have been dealt with less carefully, compels any owner who needs an advance to
                    pay usurious interest, by which his ruin is speedily effected, and the property
                    brought to sale. On the other hand a large property changes hands at less
                    comparative expense, and the necessity of a sale to meet temporary difficulties
                    is at less cost obviated by mortgage, which permits the owner to hold on till
                    some windfall of legacy or marriage once more reinstates him in easy
                    circumstances, and enables him to take advantage of his poorer neighbour’s
                    necessities. This does not mean that he cheats the small proprietor in the
                    bargain. Ou the contrary, the desire of the rich to augment their estates
                    induces them to give more than the real worth for the smaller properties. But
                    this concurrence of circumstances tends steadily in the direction of increasing
                    large estates and diminishing from age to age those that are small. The
                    practical result is easily shown by a few figures. The cultivated land of the
                    United Kingdom (including parks and permanent pastures, but not mountain or
                    waste) amounted in 1880 to 47,515,747 acres. The total acreage is 77,635,301
                    acres. By the Domesday Book of 1875 it appeared that one-fourth of the total
                    acreage (excluding plots under 1 acre) is held by 1200 owners, at an average for
                    each of 16,200 acres; another fourth by 6200 persons, at an average of 3150
                    acres; another fourth is held by 50,770 persons, averaging 380 acres each; and
                    the remaining fourth by 261,830 persons, averaging 70 acres each (Caird). Peers,
                    in number about six hundred, hold rather more than one-fifth of all the land in
                    the kingdom. Thus one-half of the whole territory is in the hands of only 7400
                    individuals; the other half is divided among 312,500 individuals. The total
                    population of the United Kingdom (not including Channel Islands and Isle of Man)
                    in 1881 was 35,100,000, so that barely one in a hundred owns more than an acre
                    of soil.</p>
                <p>Of tenant farmers there are in Great Britain 561,000, in Ireland 600,000. About
                    400,000 of those in Great Britain, but above 500,000 of those in Ireland, occupy
                    less than 15 acres of cultivated soil, the average size of the remaining
                    holdings being in Great Britain about 160 acres, in Ireland 75 acres.</p>
                <p>In the countries which have been colonized from England the system of small
                    properties rather than large has been generally adopted. The first settlers in
                    New England carried with them the idea of the village community. They decreed
                    that grants of land should be made to each householder to the extent of 20
                    acres, but the rest of the land apportioned to each village was to be held in
                    common. This system has been now expanded into the homestead law (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Homestead),</hi> prevailing over the whole United States, in
                    virtue of which a citizen of the States is entitled to a free grant of 160 acres
                    (∣ square mile) on condition of bringing it into cultivation within five years.
                    The influence of slavery in the Southern States tended, as in Rome, to create
                    large estates, but its abolition has arrested this course. On the whole, with
                    exception of a very few gigantic farms in the extreme west, it may be said that
                    both the United States and Canada are countries of small farms, seldom exceeding
                    150 to 300 acres, and almost universally cultivated by the owner. The pastoral
                    lands of Australia and New Zealand are still held in “runs” of immense extent,
                    but whenever cultivation makes way there is a growing movement in the direction
                    of opening them up to purchase in small farms.</p>
                <p>The above sketch, imperfect as the limits of space have compelled it to be, of
                    the history of land tenure throughout the world shows that it has pursued one
                    unvarying course. Commencing in community of tribal possession, land has
                    everywhere by degrees been appropriated to the villagers, to the family, and at
                    last to the individual. But in every stage the conditions of its enjoyment and
                    use have been absolutely regulated by the community in reference to the general
                    welfare. A history so uniform would seem to rest on principles of human nature,
                    and to be incapable of reversal. Nevertheless in the present age two opposite
                    parties have impugned its lessons. The one would revert to the almost
                    prehistoric times when community of property, of labour, and of wealth formed
                    the rule of existence. The other speaks of individual property, especially in
                    land, as a sacred and indefeasible principle, and denounces every restraint or
                    modification introduced by the state as spoliation. Between these extremes an
                    infinite variety of ideas for more or less making land or its produce public
                    property, or more or less restricting the right of the personal owner, have been
                    put forward, and are, with some confusion, strenuously advocated. A brief
                    attempt will now be made to discriminate between what in these ideas is sound
                    and what is impracticable.</p>
                <p>The principles of communism have unquestionably struck deep root in the minds of
                    large classes of the public, chiefly in Germany, but to no inconsiderable extent
                    in other countries and even in England. Nor can they be dismissed as merely
                    criminal and worthy of no answer but repression. The answer must rather be that
                    they are based on hopes and beliefs in the capability of human nature for
                    selfsacrifice, which we have no warrant in yet accepting as our practical guide.
                    A golden age may yet return, in which all shall be for the country and no one
                    for himself, and we may even imagine that each successive age shows its nearer
                    approach. But at least it has as yet not come. In every community there are
                    found a large number of individuals who would not work honestly except under the
                    compulsion of self-interest or of close superintendence. No socialistic scheme
                    has yet been devised which copes with this tendency.</p>

                <p>In all of them a vast hierarchy of official inspectorship would be demanded,
                    which, even if adequate, would eat up the profits. In all of them red-tapeism of
                    regulation would forbid the progress derived from freedom to experiment. For the
                    case of the culture of land, an art involving such variety of method applied to
                    such variety of circumstance, it seems, as yet, impossible to conceive
                    arrangements by which joint possession could result in beneficial production. We
                    know it even among families to be at present a hindrance and source of loss. Nor
                    has any definite scheme been yet proposed by socialists to show how it could be
                    worked by the state. Till its advocates at least do this, and permit us to judge
                    as men of business of the practical effect of their system in a given area and
                    with given machinery, it were waste of time to discuss their aspirations and
                    their imaginary results.</p>
                <p>Those who, at the opposite pole, refuse to admit the right of the state to impose
                    such conditions on private property as it deems for the general benefit may be
                    dismissed even more briefly. Not only do they show entire ignorance of the
                    history of land tenure at all times, but they belie the daily action of British
                    legislation. Parliament seldom lets a session pass without making laws which
                    assert the right of the state to take possession of property for public or
                    private benefit, to tax it, and to restrain or regulate the rights of its owners
                    over it. Nor is there any theory of the basis of property which does not tacitly
                    admit that it is subject to the authority of the community. If derived from
                    occupation, it owes its title to the agreement of the community to support that
                    title. If derived from labour, it is valid only for the life of the labourer,
                    and whoever succeeds to him must take it, not as a gift from a dead man whose
                    rights end with the grave, but as a gift from the state, which deems that there
                    is advantage in encouraging labour by the certainty of transmitting its produce.
                    In every view it must be admitted that the state, by whose regulations and force
                    property is maintained, must have an unqualified right to prescribe the
                    conditions under which it will confer its gifts on private individuals.</p>
                <p>The general object of supporting private property in land is to increase its
                    produce, by inducing the owner, through motives of self-interest and affection
                    for his family, to bestow on it the greatest amount of labour. It is agreed by
                    all practical authorities that the soil of Great Britain might be rendered
                    greatly more productive by the increased expenditure of capital, which when
                    explained means in one shape or other the larger employment of labour, both in
                    effecting permanent improvements and in conducting the arts of cultivation. The
                    interest of the public in strengthening the motives which may lead to such
                    additional production is unquestionable. The soil is the support of the nation,
                    furnishing to it primarily both its subsistence, its clothing, its fuel, and the
                    raw materials of its trade with other countries. Some indeed argue that freedom
                    of trade with other countries, permitting unrestricted import of all these
                    articles, has rendered the profitable use of the soil at home comparatively
                    unimportant. But this is inaccurate for several reasons. First, importation
                    involves at all events the expense of all that labour which is devoted to the
                    carrying trade. Secondly, it involves dependence on other nations for other
                    articles than food, to an extent which may easily become fatal. If, for
                    instance, agriculture in England were to employ less labour, because it was more
                    profitable to import wheat for subsistence and cotton on which to employ
                    labourers, there is not only the risk, sufficiently grave, that both may be
                    stopped by war, but the ever present probability that manufacturing industry may
                    be displaced by competition from countries where its raw material can be
                    obtained without the cost of carriage, and where in some cases labour may, owing
                    to climate or a lower standard of living, be cheaper. Such a rivalry is already
                    visible in America, in India, and in Russia. If through these causes the
                    manufactures should decay, and the artisans be driven to emigrate, certainly the
                    depopulated fields of Great Britain would be unable to maintain her in her
                    present rank among nations.</p>
                <p>An entirely opposite school has, however, stated a principle, which, though not
                    applied by it to the question of the tenure of land, would if true be hostile to
                    the application of further capital to the soil. Political economists (see, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Mill, bk. i. chap, xii.) have asserted that every
                    successive application of capital to cultivation must be less profitable than
                    the first. This is called the “law of diminishing production from land,” and it
                    has been said to be “the most important proposition in political economy.” But
                    the fact is that it is true only if the qualification be added “in the existing
                    state of knowledge.” That is to say, it is true that, if a given amount of
                    labour applied in raising wheat, for example, will raise 16 bushels on an
                    ordinary soil, twice the amount of labour will not, <hi rend="italic">per
                    se,</hi> raise 32 bushels on the same soil, or even 16 bushels on a very
                    inferior soil. But chemistry and experiment tell us that if, instead of spending
                    the second quantity of labour in merely ploughing twice instead of once, we
                    spend it in purchasing and applying nitrogen, phosphoric acid, and potash in
                    proper proportions to the soil, either directly as artificial manures, or still
                    more cheaply as manure from animals whose food has contained these elements, we
                    do get a return considerably more than double for the double amount of labour
                    which the application involves. This is exemplified in the fact that rents rose
                    about 20 per cent, in England when these appliances came into use, in spite of a
                    stationary range of prices, showing that the additional capital thus devoted to
                    agriculture gave a higher return than the capital that had been previously
                    employed.</p>
                <p>A further illustration may be found in the fact that the capital that has been
                    expended by the Improvement Companies in England, under the supervision of the
                    Inclosure Commissioners, has yielded on an average a return of 15 per cent, of
                    increased rental on the expenditure, over and above the profit made by the
                    tenant farmer (Caird). Since this average includes a few cases in which
                    defective knowledge has led to loss, it is evident that, when capital is applied
                    to agriculture with reasonable scientific knowledge and skill, it is capable of
                    still yielding returns at a full average rate, even after payment of the
                    salaries earned by the scientific and practical education which has directed its
                    employment. Nor is there any reason to believe that the process has come, or
                    nearly come, to an end. It certainly does not follow that soil is capable of
                    unlimited production; for it is quite certain that its powers in this respect
                    are sharply defined by the amount of light and heat which in any given situation
                    the plants growing on it can receive. But it is becoming daily more probable
                    that up to that limit advancing science and practical skill will tend to
                    equalize the cost of production, making the application of labour to inferior
                    soils as profitable as to superior, and making capital as productive when
                    approaching the limit of its useful application as when it is, in the form of
                    rude labour, applied to soils newly brought under cultivation.</p>
                <p>But, on the other hand, the doctrine that the land can be made more productive by
                    the application of more capital, and that the state has a strong interest in
                    increasing production, is fatal to all that variety of proposals which have been
                    made for what is called, in rather uncouth and exceedingly vague phrase,
                    “nationalization of the land.” All of these start with the suggestion that the
                    land of the country, being the property of the community, should be resumet <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n282/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0282-0267"/> by it for a new arrangement or distribution. In
                    some schemes it is proposed that the state shall buy out the present owners,
                    paying them the full value of the fee simple; in others it is proposed that the
                    state shall simply resume the land on the death of the present owners, without·
                    paying any compensation to their heirs. Conceding the abstract justice of both
                    propositions, it admits of little doubt that they would not be for the public
                    benefit. Under the first the state would make a very bad bargain. Land, on
                    account of its attractions as a subject of private property, brings a market
                    price nearly 30 per cent, above its actual value. It sells usually at a rate
                    computed to yield a clear return of not more than 3 per cent. But in order to
                    bring this return the owner is obliged to lay out, in maintenance of buildings,
                    drains, roads, fences, and other incidents, sums which on an average are not
                    much less than a third of the net produce. If then the state is to buy at the
                    rate of 3 per cent, what actually yields only 2 per cent., it is clear that the
                    public will be a loser on the transaction. On the other hand, if the state is to
                    take possession of land on the death of the present owners, either without
                    compensation or with a compensation less than the market value, the result would
                    be at once to stop all further improvement by the actual possessors. No one
                    would spend money on that which was to pass, not to his own heirs, but to the
                    public, and the land when it reverted to the state would be in a condition
                    requiring enormous outlay to restore its exhausted fertility, and to remedy the
                    general decay into which its appliances would have been suffered to fall. If
                    again it be urged that the state might obviate this evil by offering
                    compensation for the actual value of improvements which might be made, it can
                    only be answered that private landlords and tenants have not yet found a method
                    of satisfactorily ascertaining such value; that even when the principle is
                    accepted tenants frequently prefer, when certain of not obtaining a renewal of
                    their lease, to exhaust the land rather than trust to arbitration giving them an
                    equivalent; and that this tendency would be enhanced when the state became the
                    landlord and the valuers were appointed by it.</p>
                <p>Supposing, however, the operation to be accomplished, and the state to have
                    become the universal landowner, the next question is, What it is to do with the
                    land <hi rend="italic">1 On</hi> this there is a still greater variety of
                    suggestion. Some would have the land let by the state on lease merely, and would
                    apply the rental to extinguish taxation. Others would have the state to sell in
                    fee simple. But in both cases there arises the further question, To whom shall
                    the advantage of a lease or a sale be given? Here there breaks out the dispute
                    between the advocates of large and small estates and of large and small farms.
                    Some would offer the priority of choice to the existing tenants; but, as this
                    would result in the creation of a large proportion of estates or farms extending
                    to hundreds or even thousands of acres, its superiority over the present system
                    can only be considered as partial. Others would break up the whole land of the
                    country into peasant properties, and even go so far as to furnish each with a
                    house. But, considering that this scheme would further involve the abandonment
                    of most of the existing farm houses and farm buildings, which would be quite
                    useless to peasant proprietors, it would impose a heavy financial loss on the
                    nation.</p>
                <p>It must be further kept in view that there are only 47 millions of cultivable
                    acres to be divided among 35 millions of persons, and that the acres are of
                    every conceivable difference of value, dependent not merely on soil but on
                    situation, climate, cropping, capability for improvement, and a thousand other
                    circumstances. To divide these into plots of equal value would be a task of
                    enormous expense, and perhaps scarcely possible to be accomplished. But, if the
                    plots are to be of larger size and unequal value, it must be again asked, How is
                    the state to be guided in selecting the individuals to whom its special favours
                    are to be given? And if it be said that the state would exact a rent
                    proportioned to the value, and thus confer no favour, there would then arise the
                    further question whether the rent is to be fixed in perpetuity, which means a
                    gift to the lessees of all capability of improvement in the land, or whether it
                    is to be adjustable by valuation at intervals, which merely leaves the lessees
                    in the same position as the present lessees are. In the latter case nothing
                    would be gained except that some would be dispossessed in order that others
                    might be put in possession.</p>
                <p>It is, however, insisted that in any case the state would have the advantage of
                    drawing the rental of the land, and it is argued that this would do no wrong to
                    the lessees, because it would be only the rental derived from the original value
                    of the soil, and would not affect their profits from the capital and labour they
                    employ on it. This principle, if sound, might, however, be applied with equal
                    force to every other species of material wealth. The state would be quite as
                    fully entitled to acquire, by purchase or by annexation on death of the owner,
                    factories and consols, as it is to acquire land for which it has suffered the
                    former owner to pay a price. But there is a greater disadvantage in the state
                    becoming the universal landlord. A farm is dependent not only on the soil but on
                    the seasons and the markets, and its profits cannot be guaranteed. A rent for
                    the use of the mere soil may be fair on an average of years, but occasionally
                    there comes a series of years in which no rent at all can be paid without
                    bankruptcy of the tenant. Private landlords can and do meet these bad times by
                    concession and agreement, but the state can only act by laws, and in justice to
                    the community it must be hard to its debtors. It is in fact the system which has
                    been tried to be carried out in India, with a considerable variety of method,
                    but with uniformity of failure,—a failure to be attributed mainly to the fact
                    that state taxation, necessarily inelastic, is disastrous when applied to income
                    so fluctuating as that from land must be. In fact a tenant, paying full value
                    for the unimproved land to the state, would be in precisely the position
                    occupied at present by an owner who is mortgaged up to the ears; and, since the
                    rent is to be in perpetuity also, he would be unable ever to redeem himself from
                    the burden. An occupant so situated is the most unhappy of men, and the worst of
                    cultivators, and that the state should hold the mortgage over him would only
                    make his position the harder.</p>
                <p>These considerations apply also to the recommendations which have been made that
                    the land tax should be increased and that the “unearned increment in the value
                    of land” should be appropriated by the state. Including tithe and local rates,
                    land is taxed at present to an average of about 30 per cent, on its net profits.
                    An additional tax on land would operate to prevent investment of capital on its
                    improvement, since capital will not be invested where its returns are below the
                    average. The “unearned increment in value of land” is often strikingly apparent
                    in and near towns; but it does not exist in the bulk of agricultural districts.
                    Corn has not risen in price within the last hundred years, and, if meat has, so
                    has the cost of raising and importing the food of cattle. The rise in the value
                    of agricultural land generally is not on the whole more than a fair return for
                    the capital that has been invested in improvements, and for the immense sums
                    that have been lost in the experiments out of which the improvements have
                    sprung. The cases in which it is more than this would be incapable of being
                    discriminated, and would not be worth the trouble if it were possible. The idea
                    would probably <pb break="no"

                    spectacle of the enormous fortunes accruing to those who have had the good luck
                    to inherit or to purchase land useful for building purposes. If limited to such
                    cases, the principle of the right of the community to resume the benefit arising
                    from its own concentration in particular spots may be supported by different and
                    very good reasons, due regard being had to the reimbursement to the private
                    owner of all sums actually expended by him in purchase or building.</p>
                <p>The right of the public to mineral wealth under the soil stands on as clear a
                    footing. By the common law gold and silver mines belong to the crown, no matter
                    who is the owner of the soil. The principle obviously applies equally to all
                    minerals. They are a part of the country itself, not merely material from which
                    profit can be extracted, and when they are gone they cannot be replaced. As the
                    law forbids the selling of land to foreigners, it might with equal justice
                    forbid the selling of coal for foreign exportation. The discovery of valuable
                    minerals is often due to mere accident, and they resemble treasure-trove, which
                    by law belongs to the crown. Nor would difficulty arise in working mines by
                    crown lessees or under crown superintendence. Where they already are worked it
                    would be right to pay the estimated value to the private owner, since hitherto
                    they have been deemed subject of private property, but all future increase or
                    all new discoveries might justly be held to belong to the nation, without
                    compensation to the owner of the surface who had no knowledge of their
                    existence.</p>
                <p>Approaching now the question how the state without actual resumption of the land
                    may so regulate its possession as to encourage the maximum production from it,
                    we are in the beginning met with the dispute between the advocates of large and
                    small estates, the former cultivated by tenants, the latter by the owners. But
                    we may first disembarrass this question from one source of confusion. Large
                    estates are never cultivated in a block. They are invariably broken up into
                    farms, sometimes indeed extending to several thousand acres, but far more
                    generally ranging between the limits of 500 and 50 acres. Below 100 acres the
                    tenant is usually himself the cultivator, with more or less assistance, and
                    below 50 acres he will seldom require any assistance outside his own family.
                    Now, as there is no advantage accruing from one landlord holding a number of
                    such farms, we may state the question as regards cultivation as not being
                    between large and small estates, but as being between farms of which the tenant
                    does the work and those in which he only superintends the work of others.</p>
                <p>Thus stated, the answer admits of no dispute. It has been already discussed in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Agriculture</hi>; but it may suffice to advert
                    here to the conclusive argument derived from the superior efficacy and therefore
                    cheapness and productiveness of the labour given by a man in working entirely
                    for his own behoof, as compared with that which he pays others to do for him. It
                    would scarcely be too much to sty that capital in the form of personal labour
                    will yield twice the return of capital employed in hired labour. It applies not
                    merely to the man but to his wife, sons, and daughters, and not only to the
                    actual amount of work done, but to the zeal and care with which it is
                    directed.</p>
                <p>Against this advantage on the part of the small cultivator there is only to be
                    set in favour of the large that he can better employ machinery. But, though he
                    may be the first, he is not necessarily the only one to employ machinery.
                    Reaping and mowing machines may be (and often are) employed on the smallest
                    holdings; threshing machines are now made to be worked by hand or by one or two
                    horses; even steam-engines are made with power down to one horse or half a
                    horse. These very small machines are slightly more wasteful of coal for the
                    power they give out; but on a small scale this is quite inappreciable, and is
                    far more than balanced by the greater economy induced by their being driven by
                    the owner himself. A very elementary resort to combination among small
                    cultivators affords them in any case the same advantages as the large
                    cultivator. Their energy and aptitude are not less, and with the advance of
                    education may be directed with the same knowledge. Most persons connected with
                    land know of many instances in which even at present the small cultivator is as
                    advanced in his scientific practice as the larger. It is generally admitted that
                    during the recent disastrous seasons the smaller farmers have been better able
                    to meet their engagements than the larger. The reason is, not merely that their
                    outlay is smaller in cost of labour, but that by close attention and the power
                    of availing themselves of every opportunity they have suffered less actual loss
                    than the farmer on a more extensive scale.</p>
                <p>It is of course understood that, to enable a farmer of a small acreage to produce
                    the same result as a larger holder, he must have the same advantages provided to
                    him by investment of owner’s capital. He needs the same buildings for farm
                    purposes, the same drains and fences, in proportion to his extent of farm. But
                    he does not need more; and, as his own house is only an equivalent for the
                    labourer’s cottage, which must in any case be provided, there is the saving of
                    the more expensive residence which a farmer cultivating several hundred acres
                    thinks himself entitled to. Again, the tenant’s capital invested must also be as
                    much in the one case as in the other. The small tenant ought to have as much and
                    as good stock on the farm in proportion to its extent as the large. But he saves
                    much capital in the item of wages, because, till profits come in, his own labour
                    costs him only his own food, and even the rent of his house is postponed, so
                    that it is probable that he will be able to spend on the land a capital larger
                    in proportion than the extensive farmer at a greatly less actual outlay of money
                    Those who argue that the capital invested by the larger tenants is greater than
                    that invested by the small cultivator forget that capital in agriculture must be
                    measured not solely by expenditure of money but in a great measure by
                    expenditure of labour to which a whole family may cheaply but effectively
                    contribute.</p>
                <p>The importance of encouraging investment of capital j forms perhaps the main
                    argument in favour of the system i of cultivation by the joint interests of
                    landlord and tenant, <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> In this combination the
                    landlord furnishes the land and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="subscript"> f</hi> (in Scotland always, in England frequently) the
                    buildings, <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> &lt;fcc. The tenant’s capital is
                    therefore limited in its application to operations of tillage and manuring. The
                    landlord’s contribution is commonly estimated at five-sixths, the tenant’s at
                    one-sixth of the total capital employed, and while the landlord’s yields less
                    than 3 percent, interest, the tenant’s has, by Mr Caird, been estimated as
                    bringing in 10 per cent, per annum. This, however, on an average of years and of
                    farmers is probably too high an estimate. The conclusion, however, is drawn that
                    the system is beneficial to the farmer because the capital required for
                    permanent investment is advanced by the landlord at a low rate of interest,
                    while the whole of the tenant’s capital is invested at a high rate of interest.
                    But in this argument it seems to be forgotten that the tenant’s 10 per cent,
                    includes not merely interest on capital subject to risk, but salary for time and
                    skill, and is, therefore, not really 10 per cent, on capital. Now, undoubtedly,
                    if any one desires to risk his whole capital in trade, he is entitled to at
                    least 10 per cent, on it, and he makes, while prosperous, a large income. But if
                    he prefers to invest five-sixths of it in a secure investment, yielding only 3
                    per cent., and to risk only one-sixth, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n284/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0284-0269"/> while at the same time giving his personal labour
                    and skill, his income may be considerably smaller, but it will be to the same
                    extent the more secure. It is entirely a question for each person to solve for
                    himself, and it would be no national loss if a certain number of farmers were to
                    elect to purchase farms of only one-sixth the extent of those which they occupy
                    as tenants, and to cultivate them with their own labour. Or, if the present
                    tenants should be reluctant to exchange their higher incomes, subject to the
                    greater risk, for smaller but more secure incomes, it cannot be said that there
                    is any national gain in their occupying land which in the hands of small owners
                    would yield crops as large and at no greater cost, though with a different
                    distribution of profits.</p>
                <p>What is true in the argument appears to be this. It would be a distinct loss to
                    the nation if landlords were to withdraw their capital from the land before
                    other persons are prepared to put as much in. At present tenants in general
                    cannot put in more capital, because they have not got more. They could not,
                    therefore, buy their present farms. But they could buy farms of smaller extent,
                    and on these raise crops fully as good. And if there were enough of other
                    persons prepared to buy the remainder of the land, and to cultivate it
                    themselves with equal skill, there would be equal advantage in their doing so.
                    But, since skill in farming needs both education and practice, there are not
                    enough of persons as yet possessed of these qualifications and also of the
                    needful capital. Hence any sudden break in the present system of tenure by
                    landlord and tenant would be hurtful to the country, leading to abstraction of
                    capital, and worse cultivation and less produce. But a gradual process of
                    change, permitting all persons who had capital (however small) and aptitude, to
                    become owners and cultivators, would be a national benefit, since it would not
                    diminish the capital employed, but would render it on the contrary more
                    productive through the stimulus of being applied wholly for the benefit of the
                    cultivator himself.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the system of division of capital and rights between
                    landlord and tenant is intrinsically bad. Neither is full owner, nor can do even
                    with his own share exactly what is best for himself and the public. The landlord
                    is generally short of means with which to make permanent improvements; in any
                    case he can make none without the tenant’s sanction, and of course he makes none
                    unless the tenant agrees to pay him at least 3 but more often 5 per cent. The
                    tenant, on the other hand, having only a temporary interest, spends nothing
                    except when he sees a certainty of being repaid before the end of his term.
                    Land, however, yields only slow returns, and much is thus left undone because
                    the full profit cannot be reaped till after a lapse of years. The system of
                    leases, universal in Scotland, palliates but does not remedy the mischief. It is
                    recognized that the tenancy, usually of nineteen years, is in practice divided
                    into three equal portions. The first is spent in restoring the exhaustion of the
                    soil by the preceding tenant, the second gives a full profit, the third is (if
                    no renewal of lease be expected) devoted to the gradual withdrawal of capital,
                    with corresponding reduction of fertility. Compensation for unexhausted outlay
                    is an excellent principle; but it has not yet been found so trustworthy in
                    application as to afford sufficient security to induce the continuous
                    application of capital till the end of the lease. It is very doubtful whether
                    any form of legislative interference, passing beyond a mere enactment of
                    equitable presumptions in absence of express contract, would improve the
                    relation between the two parties, because such enactments when not agreeable to
                    both parties can always be indirectly broken through. It is only cultivation by
                    the actual owners that gives at once the freedom and security necessary for full
                    development of the capacity of the land and the adoption of the results of
                    modern science.</p>
                <p>The history of land tenure in Ireland illustrates these principles, and they in
                    turn afford a standard by which to judge recent legislation. Leaving out of view
                    a certain number of estates on which the landlord supplied, in addition to the
                    land, the capital represented by buildings, drains, &amp;c., in the greater part
                    of Ireland he supplied nothing. The tenant, under a general custom of permanence
                    of holding, in many cases did a great deal; but, as the custom was not enforced
                    by law, the occasional seizure of his improvements caused a sentiment of alarm
                    and distrust which seriously limited them. The Act of 1870 aimed at giving him
                    additional security by not merely recognizing his right to compensation for his
                    own outlay if he should be removed, but by imposing a fine on the landlord if he
                    should evict a tenant. But, as it avoided to prohibit the landlord from raising
                    the rent, the insecurity was just as great as before, while the introduction of
                    a legal relation between the two parties led many landlords to restrict more
                    than ever their expenditure on improvements. The Act of 1881, therefore,
                    proceeded to the necessary consequence of fixing the rent, by means of a court
                    of valuation, and of giving to the tenant a positive right to permanent
                    occupancy, subject to a revaluation every fifteen years. But it is obvious that
                    this scheme also, though valuable as an immediate palliative, fails to have the
                    elements of a permanent settlement. The landlord will be less and less inclined
                    to spend on improvements; and even if he desired to do so the tenant can, and in
                    nearly every case will, prevent him, for the plain reason that he will not
                    desire the landlord’s share in the joint property to be increased. Yet the
                    tenant will on his part be impeded from full confidence in making improvements,
                    even when he has the means, lest at the next valuation his own outlay may be
                    valued against him. The interests are no longer joint but conflicting. Thus far
                    the remedial legislation has only succeeded in reaching the stage in which
                    Prussia stood before the reforms of Stein and Hardenberg were proposed, when
                    nobles and serfs had both certain legal rights, which neither could attack, but
                    which neither could convert into independent property. But the Prussian method
                    of reform by apportioning the land to each party in absolute property, but in
                    fractions representing their respective interests, could not be applied in
                    Ireland, both because the holdings are in general too small to bear partition,
                    and because the landlords have not, as in Prussia, been in the habit of
                    cultivating their own domain, and they would, therefore, again introduce the
                    vicious system of letting to tenants even that part which might be assigned to
                    them in unencumbered fee. The state will, therefore, have to become the
                    intermediary of transfer, but the better course would probably have been that it
                    should at the first have assumed this function on the over-rented and
                    ill-managed estates, leaving those which were fairly rented and liberally
                    managed unaffected by legislation which they did not need.</p>
                <p>The legal basis of the recent land legislation in Ireland is, however, as it was
                    in Prussia, the recognition that prescriptive possession, even under a title of
                    mere tenancy, confers a right to continuance of such possession. The same
                    principle formed the basis of the conversion of copyholds in England from being
                    tenancies at will into tenancies in perpetuity. It might justly be applied still
                    in cases in Great Britain in which tenancies have continued without change for a
                    long period. Especially it might be applied to check the system of “clearances”
                    in the Highlands, where the right of the crofters to continue in possession
                    rests on the original community of possession by the tribe, and is fortified by
                    an almost immemorial continuance of possession by each family.</p>

                <p>In any view of ownership, however, whether on a large or small scale, it is
                    obviously of prime importance that the owner should be possessed of cash
                    sufficient to make the improvements required. This is a situation in which an
                    owner who is already in debt cannot possibly be. To hold land subject to a
                    mortgage is, therefore, to hold it under conditions disadvantageous to the
                    owner, the tenant, and the nation. The evil is intensified by the fact that an
                    owner so burdened possesses an apparent estate far in excess of his real means,
                    and occupies a social station involving an expenditure that exhausts his
                    resources in every way. It would be greatly for his pecuniary advantage if the
                    law were such as would compel him to sell sufficient land to pay off his debts,
                    for he would thus relieve himself of interest at the rate of 4 to 5 per cent, by
                    selling property which gives only 2 or 2J per cent, on the price that would be
                    obtained. His net income would then not only be greater, but as his apparent
                    estate would be smaller he would not be tempted to live in so expensive a style,
                    and he would thus have the means of gaining larger returns from his property by
                    improving it. It has, therefore, been proposed to abolish mortgages by
                    prohibiting land from being made security for special debts. It would then form
                    part of the general assets of the owner, liable equally for all his debts; and
                    any one who desired to raise money would practically be obliged to do it by sale
                    instead of by pledge. Land would be confined to its proper purpose as a means of
                    production, instead of being injured for that purpose by being used as a means
                    of credit.</p>
                <p>The same principle forbids that life interests in land should be permitted. The
                    mere tenant for life or holder under settlement or entail has actually in
                    frequent instances a motive against cultivating his estate to the best
                    advantage. If he is not on good terms with the next in succession, or if, as so
                    often happens, the next successor is a distant relative, while the present
                    tenant has only daughters, his motive, and often indeed his duty, must be to
                    impoverish the estate in order to save money for those whom he loves best. In a
                    less degree, if he has a large family, he must save money out of the rents of
                    the estate to provide for his younger children, and he is correspondingly
                    disinclined to lay out money on improvements which must accrue only to the
                    benefit of his eldest son.</p>
                <p>All these considerations are equally applicable to small as to large estates in
                    land. It is as injurious to the peasant cultivator as to the extensive landowner
                    to be hampered by a burden of debt, or to be deprived of the power of directing
                    who shall be his successor. In France, in Germany, in Switzerland, in America,
                    and in India, indebtedness is the great curse of the small farmer. The
                    money-lender is a far harder master than the landlord, for he has less mercy and
                    less interest in being merciful.</p>
                <p>It has been assumed throughout these observations that land is to be applied to
                    its natural use, the production of the materials of food and clothing. In the
                    hands of rich persons it is, however, sometimes devoted to purposes of luxury
                    and enjoyment, such as the formation of large parks, game preserves, and deer
                    forests. Within moderate limits such purposes may be defended on the plea that
                    man does not live by bread alone but by all the enjoyments which he is framed
                    for appreciating, and which in moderation contribute to mental health. But they
                    are most defensible when open to the most general enjoyment, and it is
                    peculiarly to the credit of many of the English nobility that they open their
                    parks to the resort of the neighbouring villagers and townspeople, often at some
                    inconvenience to the owners themselves. On the other hand, the conversion of
                    large tracts of ground to the object of preserving game, which implies at the
                    same time exclusion of the public, and diminution of production of food, for the
                    sole recreation of one or two individuals, is a use of national resources which
                    has, since the formation of the New Forest by William the Conqueror, been
                    generally reprobated. The latest phase of its development has been in the
                    conversion of immense areas of the Highlands of Scotland into grouse shootings
                    and deer forests, a process which involves the removal of the small tenantry,
                    and even, in the case of deer forests, the ceasing to graze cattle and sheep.
                    The landowners find that the game rents are much more profitable to them than
                    the farming rents, but it is at the cost of the nation, which suffers a
                    diminution in the employment of labour and in the production of food, and which
                    consequently must see its inhabitants emigrate and pay for imported grain, wool,
                    and meat grown by foreign labour. The ultimate remedy of this abuse will
                    probably be found in measures tending to break up large estates into small ones,
                    for the system requires the reservation of extensive areas free from the
                    presence of man, and the interposition of small cultivated holdings would
                    effectually destroy it.</p>
                <p>It may, however, be well to notice here an argument which has been sometimes
                    pushed to excess. It has been urged that even grazing should be prohibited on
                    the ground that from the same area a much larger production of food can be
                    obtained in the shape of corn than of meat. The difference is indeed very
                    striking. An acre of good land will yield 40 bushels of wheat, weighing 2500
                    ft), while in grass it would yield only 250 ft&gt; of meat, and it is still more
                    striking if we deduct the water from each, when we have 2200 ft) of dry grain
                    against 188 ft) of dry flesh and fat. But man being semi-carnivorous must have a
                    proportion of flesh, and the value he assigns to meat as compared with corn
                    shows very correctly its relative importance in the human economy. The fact is
                    that the test of market prices, which are now regulated by the production and
                    demand of the whole world, assigns to dry meat and fat a value just about twelve
                    times as great as that of corn, and consequently an acre of grass land gives a
                    profit quite equal to that of an acre of wheat. Nor could the equality be
                    impaired even if we were all to become vegetarians. For the most ardent
                    disciples of that faith admit the necessity of using milk, and about 2 pints of
                    milk is a necessary addition to a daily allowance of 2 ft) of grain for health
                    and the performance of work. But to furnish this quantity of milk throughout the
                    year nearly an acre of ordinary land would be required, or as much as would give
                    about half a pound of meat per day, so that there are no means by which we can
                    dispense with the use of a considerable extent of land for the feeding of
                    animals, by which its produce is converted into the proximate products demanded
                    by the human constitution; and the amount to be so used is best determined by
                    the demand of the public.</p>
                <p>The conclusion to be drawn from the review of the whole questions relating to
                    tenure of land is that they are best solved by freedom of action of individual
                    owners, guided by self-interest and family affection, and only restrained by law
                    when the special circumstances of a high civilization introduce abnormal
                    conditions. Since these motives operate most fully and healthily when land is
                    held in small estates, it only remains to glance at the methods which in
                    different countries and by different authorities have been suggested to
                    encourage subdivision.</p>
                <p>The most general method is that of equal division of the inheritance among
                    children. It is compulsory in the Channel Islands, in France, and several other
                    European countries, and it forms the rule of intestacy under the law of
                    gavelkind in Kent, in most of the British colonies, and in the United States. To
                    its existence in the latter form no reasonable objection can be taken. To its
                    compulsory enforcement there applies, though in a modified degree, the same
                    objections that apply to a compulsory rule of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n286/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0286-0271"/> primogeniture, with the additional objection that
                    it tends to limit the growth of population. Parents who are compelled to give an
                    equal portion to every child avoid the risk of subdivision by not having many
                    children, a course which, if commendable when the Old World seemed in peril of
                    over population, is a source of national impoverishment when the world affords
                    profitable employment for hundreds of millions more than exist. Among the
                    children themselves the certainty of succession abates the sentiment of filial
                    duty, and the desire to bestow a special bounty on one child who is favoured
                    above the rest may sometimes induce the parents to spend less than they
                    otherwise would in the improvement of the whole estate.</p>
                <p>Subdivision of property may, however, be gradually effected by prohibiting
                    excessive bequests. It has always been recognized that the state has an
                    unquestionable right to deal with property at the moment of its transmission
                    from the dead to the living, and no objection could be made to a rule that no
                    one should leave by will or through intestacy more than a certain sum, or land
                    of equivalent value, to one individual. This would not generally affect the
                    desire during life to amass and improve property, because the improved value
                    would still be available for division among all whom the owner wished to
                    benefit. But it would in one generation reduce all estates of abnormal size to
                    properties of such dimension as in the opinion of parliament would be most
                    serviceable for cultivation, and consequently most conducive to national
                    benefit.</p>
                <p>The abolition of the right to raise money by mortgage of land would also tend to
                    promote its subdivision, since an owner in debt would be obliged to sell a
                    portion of his estate in order to pay his debts. The improvement of
                    conveyancing, which would follow from the general abolition of all interests in
                    land except that of simple and absolute ownership, would also facilitate the
                    sale of land. The leading principle which should guide legislation is in short
                    that land should be made capable of the easiest transmission from one owner to
                    another, and of the fullest use by him to whom for the time it belongs. The
                    ordinary motives of human nature will then concur in transferring it from those
                    who are least to those who are most capable of making it productive, and of
                    inducing each successive owner to bestow on it the labour and outlay by which
                    the maximum of beneficial production will be secured.</p>
