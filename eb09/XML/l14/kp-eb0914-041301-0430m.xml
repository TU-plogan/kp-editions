                    according to some accounts, at Toulouse) in 1752. He was brought up at Paris,
                    where he completed his studies at the Collège Mazarin. His first published
                    writings consist of some articles forming part of the <hi rend="italic">Traité
                    de Mécanique</hi> (1774) of the Abbé Marie, who was his professor; Legendre’s
                    name, however, is not mentioned. Soon afterwards he was appointed professor of
                    mathematics in the École Militaire at Paris, and he was afterwards professor in
                    the École Normale. In 1782 he received the prize from the Berlin Academy for his
                    “Dissertation sur la question de balistique,” a memoir relating to the paths of
                    projectiles in resisting media. He also, about this time, wrote his “Recherches
                    sur la figure des planètes,” published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of
                    the French Academy, of which he was elected a member in succession to D’Alembert
                    in 1783. He was also appointed a commissioner for connecting geodetically Paris
                    and Greenwich, his colleagues being Méchain and Cassini; General Roy conducted
                    the operations on behalf of England. The French observations were published in

                    had been decreed, he was one of the three members of the council established to
                    introduce the new system, and he was also a member of the commission appointed
                    to determine the length of the metre, for which purpose the calculations,
                    &amp;c., connected with the arc of the meridian from Barcelona to Dunkirk were
                    revised. He was also associated with Prony in the formation of the great French
                    tables of logarithms of numbers, sines, and tangents, and natural sines, called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Tables du Cadastre, in</hi> which the quadrant was divided
                    centesimally; these tables have never been published (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Logarithms).</hi> He also served on other public commissions. He was examiner
                    in the École Polytechnique, but held few important state offices, and he seems
                    never to have been much noticed by the different Governments; it has indeed been
                    generally remarked that the offices he held were not such as his reputation
                    entitled him to. Not many facts with regard to his personal life seem to have
                    been published, but in a letter to Jacobi of June 30, 1832, he writes—“Je me
                    suis marié à la suite d’une révolution sanglante qui avait détruit ma petite
                    fortune; nous avons eu de grands embarras et des moments bien difficiles à
                    passer, mais ma femme m’a aidé puissamment à restaurer progressivement mes
                    affaires et à me donner cette tranquillité d’esprit nécessaire pour me livrer à
                    mes travaux accoutumés et pour composer de nouveaux ouvrages qui ont ajouté de
                    plus en plus à ma réputation, de manière à me procurer bientôt une existence
                    honorable et une petite fortune dont les débris, après de nouvelles révolutions
                    qui m’ont causé de grandes pertes, suffisent encore pour pourvoir aux besoins de
                    ma vieillesse, et suffiront pour pourvoir à ceux de ma femme bien-aimée quand je
                    n’y serai plus.”</p>
                <p>He died at Paris on January 10, 1833, in his eighty-first year, and the discourse
                    at his grave was pronounced by Poisson. He was engaged in mathematical
                    investigations almost up to the time of his death. The last of the three
                    supplements to his <hi rend="italic">Traité des Fonctions Elliptiques</hi> was
                    published in 1832, and Poisson in his funeral oration remarked—“M. Legendre a eu
                    cela de commun avec la plupart des géomètres qui l’ont précédé, que ses travaux
                    n’ont fini qu’ avec sa vie. Le dernier volume de nos mémoires renferme encore un
                    mémoire de lui, sur une question difficile de la théorie des nombres; et peu de
                    temps avant la maladie qui l’a conduit au tombeau, il se procura les
                    observations les plus récentes des comètes à courtes périodes, dont il allait se
                    servir pour appliquer et perfectionner ses méthodes.”</p>
                <p>Legendre was the author of separate works on elliptic functions, the integral
                    calculus, the theory of numbers, and the elements of geometry, besides numerous
                    papers which were published chiefly in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of
                    the French Academy; and it will be convenient, in giving an account of his
                    writings, to consider them under the different subjects which are especially
                    associated with his name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Elliptic Functions. —</hi> This is the subject with which
                    Legendre’s name will always be most closely connected, and his researches upon
                    it extend over a period of more than forty years. His first published writings
                    upon the subject consist of two papers in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of
                    the French Academy for 1786 upon elliptic arcs. In 1792 he presented to the
                    Academy a memoir on elliptic transcendents. The contents of these memoirs are
                    included in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Exercices de Calcul
                    Intégral</hi> (1811). The third volume (1816) contains the very elaborate and
                    now well-known tables of the elliptic integrals which were calculated by
                    Legendre himself, with an account of the mode of their construction. In 1827
                    appeared the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fonctions elliptiques</hi> (2 vols., the first dated 1825, the
                    second 1826); a great part of the first volume agrees very closely with the
                    contents of the <hi rend="italic">Exercices</hi>; the tables, &amp;c., are given
                    in the second volume. Three supplements, relating to the researches of Abel and
                    Jacobi, were published in 1828-32, and form a third volume. Legendre had pursued
                    the subject which would now be called elliptic integrals alone from 1786 to
                    1827, the results of his labours having been almost entirely neglected by his
                    contemporaries, but his work had scarcely appeared in 1827 when the discoveries
                    which were independently made by the two young and as yet unknown mathematicians
                    Abel and Jacobi placed the subject on a new basis, and revolutionized it
                    completely. The readiness with which Legendre, who was then seventy-six years of
                    age, welcomed these important researches, that quite overshadowed his own, and
                    included them in successive supplements to his work, does the highest honour to
                    him. The sudden occurrence, near the close of his long life, of these great
                    discoveries relating to a subject which Legendre had so completely made his own
                    and apparently exhausted, and their ready acceptance by him, form one of the
                    most striking episodes in the history cf mathematics. A very full account of the
                    contents of Legendre’s work and of the results obtained by Abel and Jacobi has
                    been given in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Infinitesimal Calculus,</hi> vol.

                    Eulerian integrals and to quadratures. The second volume (1817) relates to the
                    Eulerian integrals, and to various integrals and series, developments,
                    mechanical problems, &amp;c., connected with the integral calculus; this volume
                    contains also a numerical table of the values of the gamma function. The latter
                    portion of the second volume of the <hi rend="italic">Traité</hi><hi

                    devoted to the Eulerian integrals, the table being reproduced. Legendre’s
                    researches connected with the gamma function are of importance, and are well
                    known; the subject was also treated by Gauss in his memoir <hi rend="italic"

                    miscellaneous a character to admit of being briefly described. In 1788 Legendre
                    published a memoir on double integrals, and in 1809 one on definite
                    integrals.</p>

                    (1801) are still the standard works upon this subject. The first edition of the
                    former appeared in 1798 under the title <hi rend="italic">Essai sur la Théorie
                    des Nombres</hi>; there was a second edition in 1808; a first supplement was
                    published in 1816, and a second in 1825. The third edition, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">Théorie des Nombres,</hi> appeared in 1830 in two volumes. To
                    Legendre is due the theorem known as the law of quadratic reciprocity, the most
                    important general result in the science of numbers which has been discovered
                    since the time of Fermat, and which was called by Gauss the “gem of arithmetic.”
                    It was first given by Legendre in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the
                    Academy for 1785, but the demonstration that accompanied it was incomplete. The

                <p><hi rend="italic">Attractions of Ellipsoids.—</hi> Legendre was the author of
                    four important memoirs on this subject. In the first of these, entitled
                    “Recherches sur l’attraction des sphéroïdes homogènes,” published in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the Academy for 1785, but communicated to it at
                    an earlier period, Legendre introduces the celebrated expressions which, though
                    frequently called Laplace’s coefficients, are more correctly named after
                    Legendre. The definition of the coefficients is that if (1-2⅛cos0 + Λ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 2</hi>)~ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> be expanded in
                    ascending powers of <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and if the general term be denoted
                    by <hi rend="italic">P</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">B</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> n</hi> is of the Legendrian
                    coefficient of the nth order. In this memoir also the function which is now
                    called the potential was, at the suggestion of Laplace, first introduced.
                    Legendre shows that Maclaurin’s theorem with respect to confocal ellipsoids is
                    true for any position of the external point when the ellipsoids are solids of
                    revolution. Of this memoir Todhunter writes—‘ ‘ We may affirm that no single
                    memoir in the history of our subject can rival this in interest and importance.
                    During forty years the resources of analysis, even in the hands of D’Alembert,
                    Lagrange, and Laplace, had not carried the theory of the attraction of
                    ellipsoids beyond the point which the geometry of Maclaurin had reached. The
                    introduction of the coefficients now called Laplace’s, and their application,
                    commence a new era in mathematical physics.” Legendre’s second memoir was
                    communicated to the Academy in 1784, and relates to the conditions of
                    equilibrium of a mass of rotating fluid in the form of a figure of revolution
                    which does not deviate much from a sphere. The third memoir relates to Laplace’s
                    theorem respecting confocal ellipsoids. Of the fourth memoir Todhunter writes,
                    “It occupies an important position in the history of our subject. The most
                    striking addition which is here made to previous researches consists in the
                    treatment of a planet supposed entirely fluid; the general equation for the form
                    of a stratum is given for the first time and discussed. For the first time we
                    have a correct and convenient expression for Laplace’s nth coefficient.” See
                    Todhunter’s <hi rend="italic">History of the Mathematical Theories of Attraction

                    twenty-fourth, and twenty-fifth chapters of which contain a full and complete
                    account of Legendre’s four memoirs. For the theory of the Legendrian
                    coefficients and the analysis connected with them, the reader is referred to
                    Heine’s <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der Kugelfunctionen</hi> (Berlin, 1878), to

                    coefficients have been recently termed· zonal harmonics by some writers.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geodesy.—</hi> Besides the work upon the geodetical operations
                    connecting Paris and Greenwich referred to above, and of which Legendre was one
                    of the authors, he published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the
                    Academy for 1787 two papers on trigonometrical operations depending upon the
                    figure of the earth, containing many theorems relating to this subject. The best
                    known of these, which is called Legendre’s theorem, is usually given in
                    treatises on spherical trigonometry; by means of it a small spherical triangle
                    may he treated as a plane triangle, certain corrections being applied to the
                    angles. Legendre was also the author of a memoir upon triangles drawn upon a
                    spheroid. Legendre’s theorem is a fundamental one in geodesy, and his
                    contributions to the subject are of the greatest importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Method of Least Squares.—</hi> In 1806 appeared Legendre’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelles Méthodes pour la détermination des orbites dés
                    Comètes,</hi> which is memorable as containing the first published suggestion of
                    the method of least squares. In the preface Legendre remarks, “La méthode qui me
                    paroit la plus simple et la plus générale consiste à rendre minimum la somme des
                    quarrés des erreurs, ... et que j’appelle méthode des moindres quarrés”; and in
                    an appendix in which the application of the method is explained his words are, *
                    ‘ De tous les principes qu’on peut proposer pour cet objet, je pense qu’il n’en
                    est pas de plus général, de plus exact, ni d’une application plus facile que
                    celui dont nous avons fait usage dans les recherches précédentes, et qui
                    consiste à rendre minimum la somme des quarrés des erreurs.” The method was
                    proposed by Legendre only as a convenient process for treating observations,
                    without reference to the theory of probability. It had, however, been applied by
                    Gauss as early as 1795, and the method was fully explained, and the law of
                    facility for the first time given by him in 1809. Laplace also justified the
                    method by means of the principles of the theory of probability; and this led
                    Legendre to republish the part of his <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Méthodes</hi>
                    which related to it in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the Academy for
                    1810. Thus, although the method of least squares was first formally proposed by
                    Legendre, the theory and algorithm and mathematical foundation of the process
                    are due to Gauss and Laplace. Legendre published two supplements to his <hi
                    rend="italic">Nouvelles Méthodes</hi> in 1806 and 1820.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Elements of Geometry.—</hi> Legendre’s name is most widely
                    known on account of his <hi rend="italic">Eléments de géométrie,</hi> the most
                    successful of the numerous attempts that have been made to supersede Euclid as a
                    text-book on geometry. It first appeared in 1794, and went through very many
                    editions, and has been translated into almost all languages. An English
                    translation, by Sir David Brewster, from the eleventh French edition, was
                    published in 1823, and is well known in England. The earlier editions did not
                    contain the trigonometry. In one of the notes Legendre gives a proof of the
                    irrationality of τr. This had been first proved by Lambert in the Berlin <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> for 1768. Legendre’s proof is similar in principle to
                    Lambert’s, but much simpler. On account of the objections urged against the
                    treatment of parallels in this work, Legendre was induced to publish in 1803 his
                    <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Théorie des parallèles.</hi> His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geometry</hi> gave rise in England also to a lengthened discussion on the
                    difficult question of the treatment of the theory of parallels.</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that Legendre’s works have placed him in the very foremost
                    rank in the widely distinct subjects of elliptic functions, theory of numbers,
                    attractions, and geodesy, and have given him a conspicuous position in connexion
                    with the integral calculus and other branches of mathematics. He published a
                    memoir on the integration of partial differential equations and a few others
                    which have not been noticed above, but they relate to subjects with which his
                    name is not especially associated. A good account of the principal works of
                    Legendre is given in the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle de
                    Genève</hi> for 1833, pp. 45-82. (J. W. L. G.)</p>
