                <p><label type="entry">LEVER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, novelist,
                    was born at Dublin on the 31st of August 1806 (not 1809 as usually stated), and
                    died at Trieste on the 1st of June 1872. The accounts of the earlier part of his
                    life are, considering the time at which he lived, singularly meagre, confused,
                    and conflicting. His father was an architect, and he entered Trinity College,
                    Dublin, in 1822, taking his degree in 1827. Many of the adventures of college
                    life recorded in <hi rend="italic">Charles O'Malley</hi> are believed to have
                    actually happened. Later, Lever studied at Gottingen, and obtained a degree
                    there. At some time or other before 1832 (for in this unsatisfactory way most of
                    the facts of this part of his life are recorded) he is said to have visited
                    America, and to have sojourned with the Indians, adopting their dress and mode
                    of life, and going through adventures afterwards utilized in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Con Cregan</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Arthur O'Leary.</hi> But it is
                    impossible to be certain as to this period; it is only towards the cholera
                    outbreak of 1832 that something like a firm ground offers itself to the
                    biographer. Lever had taken up the profession of medicine, and he was appointed,
                    first to a district of which the headquarters was Kilrush in Galway, where <hi
                        rend="italic">Harry Lorrequer</hi> was begun, local stories being largely
                    embodied in it, and then to a district in Ulster, around Coleraine and Newtown
                    Limavady, where material was gathered for <hi rend="italic">Charles
                        O'Malley</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Knight of Gιvyηηe.</hi> He married
                    Miss Kate Baker, but even here the mist of uncertainty which envelops him
                    exists, and it is not clear what the real date of the marriage was. After his
                    cholera work was done he proceeded to Brussels. It has been usual to represent
                    him as physician to the embassy, and even Thackeray (who knew him well) has
                    given currency to the description by a quotation in the <hi rend="italic">Book
                        of Snobs.</hi> But it is certain that Lever was never formally appointed
                    physician to the embassy, though he had letters of introduction to the secretary
                    of the English legation there, and unquestionably practised. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Harry Lorrequer</hi> was completed at Brussels, and it began to be
                    published in 1837. It was followed by <hi rend="italic">Charles O'Malley</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Jack Hinton.</hi> All these stories, but <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0505-0486"/> especially the first two, were made up to a
                    great extent of experiences through which Lever had gone, or stories which he
                    had heard in Ireland, and of the reminiscences and oddities of English residents
                    at Brussels, where there were then many retired English officers who had gone
                    through the Peninsular and other campaigns of the great war. It is said in
                    particular that Major Monsoon was almost a photograph of a well-known living
                    character at the time, and much the same thing has been asserted of other
                    personages. This piecing together of scraps accounts for the incoherency and
                    absence of plot in the earlier books— defects which were increased by the
                    author’s habit of composing them in fragments, and revising them for the press
                    with the utmost carelessness. The abundance and variety of his materials,
                    however, his skill as a <hi rend="italic">raconteur,</hi> and the fresh and
                    almost boisterous good humour which blew through all his work, made him very
                    popular, and he found a congenial illustrator in H. K. Browne. After a time
                    proposals were made to him to undertake the editorship of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dublin Uniυersity Magazine,</hi> which he accepted, and held the post from
                    1842 to 1845. During this time his income was considerable, amounting, according
                    to his biographer, to fully three thousand a year. He lived not in Dublin but a
                    little way out of it, and exercised boundless hospitality to visitors. Besides
                    this, he was an inveterate card player, and not on the whole a lucky one, and he
                    was very fond of horses, which he kept in large numbers for himself and all his
                    family. He was indefatigable in novel writing, <hi rend="italic">Tom Burke, The
                        O' Donoghue, The Knight of</hi><hi rend="italic">Gwynne,</hi> &amp;c.,
                    following those already named. But the work of editing was irksome to him, and
                    for the reasons just named residence in Ireland made it comparatively
                    unprofitable. He therefore resigned his editorship in the year 1845, and went
                    abroad, where he was always more at home than in England or even in Ireland. At
                    first he lived at Carlsruhe, where G. P. R. James was also residing; then he
                    pitched his tent in a castle of Tyrol, w hich is said to be pretty accurately
                    described in <hi rend="italic">A Day's Bide.</hi> Afterwards he wandered about,
                    finally settling at Florence. This neighbourhood became specially agreeable to
                    him, uniting as it did abundant society with the possibility of enjoying it
                    without great expense. In November 1858 he received from Lord Derby one of the
                    rare pieces of patronage which have fallen in modern days to the share of
                    Englishmen of letters, by being appointed consul at Spezzia. During this period
                    of wandering or settled life on the Continent, he changed his style of novel
                    writing. His method was, as has been hinted already, always one rather of
                    observation and reproduction than of deliberate creation, and as he had formerly
                    drawn on the humours of Irish life, or the oddities of Wellington’s veterans, so
                    now he dealt with those of travelling Britons abroad, and with similar subjects.
                        <hi rend="italic">The Daltons, The Dodd Family Abroad, Davenport Dunn,</hi>
                    &amp;c., belong to this time and family for the most part, though some of them
                    rather fall under the earlier class in style and date of composition. <hi
                        rend="italic">One of Them, Barrington, The Fortunes of Glencore,</hi>
                    &amp;c., led up to the most singular of all Lever’s books, <hi rend="italic">A
                        Day's Bide, a Life's Romance.</hi> This book, which was published in <hi
                        rend="italic">All the Year Bound,</hi> was said at the time—with what truth
                    it is not easy to say—to have positively lowered the sale of that publication,
                    yet it contains some of Lever's best work, and displays an originality not
                    common with him. The mixture of burlesque and sentiment was, it may be supposed,
                    either uncongenial or incomprehensible to the ordinary reader.</p>
                <p>As he grew older, Lever, whose politics had been a rather indefinite Toryism,
                    became more of a party man, and showed this in the papers published in <hi
                        rend="italic">Blackwοocl's Magazine,</hi> under the name of “Cornelius
                    O’Dowd,” papers of a miscellaneous kind, but often political. He is said to have
                    thought of engaging, or to have been invited to engage, in regular journalism,
                    but wisely declined. In 1867 he was transferred from Spezzia to Trieste, a
                    change pecuniarily advantageous, but involving the loss of the society which he
                    passionately loved. The last years of Lever’s life were somewhat clouded. His
                    health had never been good, and he had not lived carefully. His wife, to whom he
                    was much attached, died before him. But he was still active with his pen, and
                    the novels of his last period, if less lively than his earlier ones, are far
                    better written as well as far more regular and careful in construction. Such are
                        <hi rend="italic">Sir Brooke Fosbrooke, That Boy of Norcott's, Sir Jasper
                        Carew, The Bramleighs of Bishop’s Folly,</hi> and his last book, <hi
                        rend="italic">Lord Kilgobbin.</hi> He died, as has been said, in the summer
                    of 1872. Novels not yet mentioned are <hi rend="italic">Roland Cashel, Luttrell
                        of Arran, Tony Butler, Maurice Tiemay, the Martins of Cro' Martin, St

                <p>Lever deserves an honourable place among the secondary novelists of the 19th
                    century, but it is not very probable that any single novel of his will have a
                    long lease of popularity. He is one of the authors who do not take the trouble
                    to learn the mechanism of their art until the heyday of their imaginative force
                    is past. The defects of his earlier works have been already indicated. They are
                    written with almost inconceivable carelessness, the same incidents occurring
                    over and over again, and the chronology being altogether bewildering. This is
                    especially the case with <hi rend="italic">Charles O'Malley,</hi> which,
                    however, owing to the liveliness of its adventures and the personage of Mickey
                    Free the Irish servant, is still perhaps the most popular of all. With young and
                    uncritical readers this popularity is likely to be maintained until some
                    supplanter in the same kind arises, or until the state of manners and society
                    becomes too obsolete for anything more than historical interest. Then Lever,
                    like all writers whose formal excellence is not sufficient to save them, will be
                    forgotten; for his later work, though almost always amusing and sometimes more,
                    has little abiding interest. The sole authority for Lever’s biography is the <hi
                        rend="italic">Life</hi> by Dr W. J. Fitzgerald (London, 1879). (G. SA.)</p>
