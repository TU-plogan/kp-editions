                    (1616-1704), an indefatigable pamphleteer on the royalist and court side during
                    the Restoration epoch, but principally remarkable as the first English man of
                    letters of any distinction who made journalism a profession, was born at
                    Hunstanton in Norfolk, December 17, 1616. In 1644, during the civil war, he
                    headed a conspiracy to seize the town of Lynn for the king, under circumstances
                    which led to his being condemned to death as a spy. The sentence, however, was
                    not executed, and after four years’ imprisonment in Newgate he escaped to the
                    Continent. He was excluded from the Act of Indemnity, but in 1653 was pardoned
                    by Cromwell upon his personal solicitation, and lived quietly until the
                    Restoration, when after some delay his services and sufferings were acknowledged
                    by his appointment as licenser of the press. This office was administered by him
                    in the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0502-0483"/> spirit which might be expected from a zealous
                    cavalier. He made himself notorious, not merely by the severity of his literary
                    censorship, but by his vigilance in the suppression of clandestine printing. The
                    inconsistency of this course with his actions and professions when himself
                    opposed to the party in power naturally aggravated the unpopularity inevitably
                    attaching to his office. Few men have been more heartily abused than L’Estrange,
                    and it is undoubtedly true that the rights of free speaking and printing, the
                    indispensable conditions of civil and religious liberty, have seldom had a more
                    determined or more dangerous opponent. At the same time there is no ground for
                    questioning his integrity, and he was probably no more intolerant than any
                    similar official of any Government in that day, inspired by an equal strength of
                    conviction, would have been in his place. The representation of him in Grant’s
                    <hi rend="italic">History of the Newspaper Press</hi> as a mere political
                    hireling is entirely contrary to truth. He was a militant loyalist, who used the
                    pen as he had been wont to use the sword, and proved his zeal for his party by
                    the production of a mass of pamphlet literature, above the ordinary standard of
                    the time in ability, and quite on a par with it in virulence and coarseness.
                    These productions still possess an historical value, but their titles are not
                    worth enumerating here. His memory is more honourably preserved by his connexion
                    as an author with the journalism which as a licenser he laboured to cripple and
                    emasculate. In 1663 he commenced the publication of <hi rend="italic">The Public
                    Intelligencer and the News,</hi> succeeded in February 1665 by <hi rend="italic"
                    >The London Gazette,</hi> not to be confounded with the official journal still
                    existing, which appeared for the first time at the close of that year, and was
                    at first printed at Oxford. In 1679 he established <hi rend="italic">The</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Observator,</hi> a journal specially designed to vindicate the
                    court from the charge of a secret inclination to popery. This line of political
                    controversy, and it may be hoped some natural humanity and good sense as well,
                    obliged him to discredit the Popish Plot, and he manfully resisted the delusion
                    by which many wiser and better men were carried away. The suspicion he thus
                    incurred was increased by the conversion of his daughter to Romanism, but there
                    seems no reason to question the sincerity of his own attachment to the Church of
                    England. In 1687 he gave a further proof of independence by discontinuing <hi
                    rend="italic">The</hi><hi rend="italic">Observator</hi> from his unwillingness
                    to advocate James II.’s Edict of Toleration, although he had previously gone all
                    lengths in support of the measures of the court. The Revolution cost him his
                    office as licenser, and the remainder of his life was spent in obscurity. He
                    died in 1704. L’Estrange’s place is rather in history than in literature. The
                    importance of the part he played as licenser would be more exactly known if it
                    could be more accurately ascertained how much literature he may have been the
                    means of suppressing. The post he held so long was in itself an unmitigated
                    mischief, but at the same time an evil which men of all parties, with the rare
                    exception of men so far in advance of their time as Milton, then deemed
                    necessary; and no obloquy should attach to L’Estrange for having discharged its
                    functions with zeal and efficiency. As a pamphleteer he is but slightly above
                    mediocrity, and he labours under a special imputation of having contributed to
                    corrupt his native language. The same charge is brought against journalists in
                    all ages, and there are obvious reasons why ⅛ should be true to a certain
                    extent. The practice of daily writing for the press is undoubtedly one of the
                    numerous forces which tend to wear down and degrade a language, but it also
                    keeps the diction of the cultivated classes in contact with the speech of the
                    people, and prevents the absolute divorce between them which seems to have
                    existed in ancient times. It is to L’Estrange’s credit that among the agitations
                    of a busy political life he should have found time for much purely literary work
                    as a translator of Josephus, Cicero, Seneca, Quevedo, and other standard
                    authors. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
