                <p><label type="entry">LAUREL</label>. There are at least four shrubs or small trees
                    which are called by this name in Great Britain, viz., the common or cherry
                    laurel <hi rend="italic">(Cerasus</hi><hi rend="italic">Laurocerasus,</hi>
                    Lois.), the Portugal laurel (C. <hi rend="italic">lusitanica,</hi> Lois.), the
                    bay or sweet laurel <hi rend="italic">(Laurus nobilis,</hi> L.), and the spurge
                    laurel <hi rend="italic">(Daphne</hi><hi rend="italic">Laureola,</hi> L.). The
                    first two belong to the rose family <hi rend="italic">(Rosacea),</hi> and are
                    regarded by Bentham and Hooker as a subgenus of <hi rend="italic">Prumcs,</hi>
                    L. <hi rend="italic">(Genera Plantarum,</hi> i. p. 610), to which genus Linnaeus
                    referred them.</p>
                <p>The common laurel is a native of the woody and subalpine regions of the Caucasus,
                    of the mountains of northern Persia, of north-western Asia Minor, and of the
                    Crimea. It was received into Europe in 1576 (De Candolle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ρrοd.,</hi> ii. p. 540), and flowered for the first time in 1583. Ray in 1688
                    relates that it was first brought from Trebizonde to Constantinople, thence to
                    Italy, France, Germany, and England. Parkinson in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paradisus</hi> records it as growing in a garden at Highgate in 1629; and in
                    Johnson’s edition of Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Herbal,</hi> published in 1633,
                    it is recorded that the plant “is now got into many of our choice English
                    gardens, where it is well respected for the beauty of the leaues and their
                    lasting or continuai! greeunesse” (see Loudon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arboretum,</hi> ii. p. 717). The leaves of this plant are rather large, broadly
                    lanceshaped, and of a leathery consistence, the margin being somewhat serrated.
                    They are remarkable for their poisonous properties, giving off the odour of
                    bitter almonds when bruised; the vapour thus issuing is sufficient to kill small
                    insects. Cherry laurel water is a solution of the volatile oil. The leaves when
                    cut up finely and distilled yield the oil of bitter almonds and hydrocyanic
                    (prussic) acid. Sweetmeats, custards, cream, &amp;c., are often flavoured with
                    laurel-leaf water, as it imparts the same flavour as bitter almonds; but it
                    should be used sparingly, as it is a dangerous poison, having several times
                    proved fatal. The first case occurred in 1731, which induced a careful
                    investigation to be made of its nature, which was discovered by Schrader in 1802
                    to be hydrocyanic acid. The effects of the distilled laurel-leaf water on living
                    vegetables is to destroy them like ordinary prussic acid; while a few drops act
                    on animals as a powerful poison. It was introduced into the British
                    pharmacopoeia in 1839, but is more generally superseded by the use of
                    hydrocyanic acid. The following varieties of the common laurel are in
                    cultivation :—the Caucasian <hi rend="italic">(Ρrunus Laurocerasus
                    caucasica),</hi> which is hardier and beaçs very rich dark-green glossy foliage;
                    the Versailles laurel <hi rend="italic">(P. L. latifolia),</hi> which has larger
                    leaves; the Colchican <hi rend="italic">(P. L. colchica),</hi> which is a
                    dwarf-spreading bush with narrow sharply serrated pale green leaves. There is
                    also the variety <hi rend="italic">rotund ifolia</hi> with short broad leaves,
                    the Grecian with narrow leaves, and the Alexandrian with very small leaves. See
                    Hemsley’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook of Hardy Trees,</hi> &amp;c., p. 141.</p>
                <p>The Portugal laurel is believed to be a native of Portugal and Madeira. This
                    tree, together with a variety called <hi rend="italic">Hixa,</hi> Ser., which
                    bears larger leaves and has the flowers more loosely disposed, were found
                    growing together in 1827 on the Serra de Gerez in Portugal, the former being 20
                    feet high while the latter attained to 70 feet. It was introduced into England
                    about the year 1648, when it was cultivated in the Oxford Botanic Gardens.
                    During the first half of the 18th century this plant, the common laurel, and the
                    holly were almost the only hardy evergreen shrubs procurable in British
                    nurseries. They are all three tender about Paris, and consequently much less
                    seen in the neighbourhood of that city than in England, where they stand the
                    ordinary winters but not very severe ones. There is a variety <hi rend="italic"
                    >(myrtifolia)</hi> of compact habit with smaller narrow leaves, a variegated
                    variety, and one of recent introduction <hi rend="italic">(azorica),</hi>
                    probably not so hardy as the Continental form. See <hi rend="italic">Handbook of
                    Hardy Trees,</hi> &lt;fcc., p. 141.</p>
                <p>The evergreen glossy foliage of the common and Portugal laurels render them well
                    adapted for shrubberies, while the racemes of white flowers are not devoid of
                    beauty. The former often ripens its insipid drupes, but the Portugal rarely does
                    so. It appears to be less able to accommodate itself to the English climate, as
                    the wood does not usually “ripen” so satisfactorily. Hence it is rather more
                    liable to be cut by the frost. According to Prof. A. Gray neither the common nor
                    the Portugal laurel stands either the summer or the winter climate of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>The bay or sweet laurel <hi rend="italic">(Laurus nobilis,</hi> L.), belongs to
                    the family <hi rend="italic">Lauraceae,</hi> which contains sassafras, benzoin,
                    camphor, and other trees remarkable for their aromatic properties. It is a large
                    evergreen shrub, sometimes reaching the height of 60 feet, but rarely assuming a
                    truly tree-like character. The leaves are smaller than those of the preceding
                    laurels, possessing an aromatic and slightly bitter flavour, and are quite
                    devoid of the poisonous properties of the cherry laurel. The small
                    yellowish-green flowers are produced in axillary clusters, and consist of a
                    calyx only, which encloses nine stamens in the male, the anthers of which
                    dehisce by valves which lift upwards as in the common barberry, and carry
                    glandular processes at the base of the filament. The fruit consists of a
                    succulent berry surrounded by the persistent base of the calyx. The bay laurel
                    is a native of Italy, Greece, and North Africa, and is abundantly grown in the
                    British Isles as an evergreen shrub, as it stands most winters. The date of its
                    introduction is unknown, but must have been previous to 1562, as it is mentioned
                    in Turner’s <hi rend="italic">Herbal</hi> published in that year. A full
                    description also occurs in Gerard’s <hi rend="italic">Herbal,</hi> 1597, p.
                    1222. It was used for strewing the floors of houses of distinguished persons in
                    the reign of Elizabeth. Several varieties have been cultivated, differing in the
                    character of their foliage, as the <hi rend="italic">undulata</hi> or
                    wave-leafed, <hi rend="italic">salicifolia</hi> or willow-leafed, the
                    variegated, the broad-leafed, and the curled; there is also the double-flowered
                    variety. The bay laurel was carried to North America by the early colonists,
                    but, like the others, apparently does not thrive there.</p>
                <p>This laurel is generally held to be the <hi rend="italic">Daphne</hi> of the
                    ancients, though at least Dr Lindley, following Gerard <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Herbal,</hi> 1795, p. 761), asserts that the Greek <hi rend="italic"
                    >Daphne</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Ruscus racemosus.</hi> Among the Greeks the
                    laurel was sacred to Apollo, especially in connexion with Tempe, in whose laurel
                    groves the god himself obtained purification from the blood of the Python. This
                    legend was dramatically represented at the Pythian festival once in eight years,
                    a boy fleeing from Delphi to Tempe, and after a time being led back with song,
                    crowned and adorned with laurel. Similar <hi rend="italic">ba(pvn&lt;hoplaι</hi>
                    were known elsewhere in Greece. Apollo, himself purified, was the author of
                    purification and atonement to other penitents, and the laurel was the symbol of
                    this power, which came to be generally associated with his person and
                    sanctuaries. The relation of Apollo to the laurel was expressed in the legend of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Daphne</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> The victors in
                    the Pythian games were crowned with the laurels of Apollo, and thus the laurel
                    became the symbol of triumph in Pome as well as in Greece. As Apollo was the god
                    of poets, the <hi rend="italic">Laurea Apollinaris</hi> naturally belonged to
                    poetic merit, and so we still have a poet laureate. The various prerogatives of
                    the laurel among the ancients are collected by Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Hist.
                    Nat.,</hi> xv. 30). It was a sign of truce, like the olive branch; letters
                    announcing victory and the arms of the victorious soldiery were garnished with
                    it; it was thought that lightning could not strike it, and the <pb break="no"

                    similar superstition still exists among the peasants of the Pyrenees.</p></note>
                    From its association with the divine power of purification and protection, it
                    was often set before the door of Greek houses, and among the Romans it was the
                    guardian of the gates of the Caesars (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met.</hi>, i. 562
                    <hi rend="italic">sq. ).</hi> The laurel worn by Augustus and his successors had
                    a miraculous history: the laurel grove at the imperial villa by the ninth
                    milestone on the Flaminian way sprang from a shoot sent from heaven to Livia
                    Drusilla (Suetoιι., <hi rend="italic">Galba,</hi> i). Like the olive, the laurel
                    was forbidden to profane use. It was employed in divination; the crackling of
                    its leaves in the sacred flame was a good omen (Tibull., ii. 5, 81), and their
                    silence unlucky (Propert., ii. 21); and the leaves when chewed excited a
                    prophetic afflatus <hi rend="italic">(δaφvηφayoι,</hi> comp. Tibull., <hi
                    rend="italic">ut supra,</hi> line 63). There is a poem enumerating the ancient
                    virtues of the laurel by J. Passeratius, 1594.</p>
                <p>The last of the plants mentioned above under the name of laurel is the so-called
                    spurge laurel <hi rend="italic">{Daphne</hi><hi rend="italic">Laureola,</hi>
                    L.). This and one other species <hi rend="italic">(D. Mezereum,</hi> L.), the
                    mezereon, are the sole representatives of the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thymelaceae</hi> in Great Britain. The spurge laurel is a small evergreen
                    shrub, with alternate somewhat lanceolate leaves with entire margins. The green
                    flowers are produced in early spring, and form drooping clusters at the base of
                    the leaves. The calyx is four-cleft, and carries eight stamens in two circles of
                    four each within the tube. The pistil forms a berry, green at first, but finally
                    black. De Candolle says they are poisonous to all animals except singing birds.
                    The mezereon differs from it in blossoming before the leaves are produced, while
                    the flowers are lilac instead of green. The bark furnishes the drug <hi
                    rend="italic">Cortex Mezerei,</hi> for which that of the spurge laurel is often
                    substituted. Both are powerfully acrid, but the latter is less so than the bark
                    of mezereon. It is now only used as an ingredient of the compound decoction of
                    sarsaparilla <hi rend="italic">(Pharmacog</hi><hi rend="italic">raphia,</hi> p.
                    487). Of other species in cultivation there are <hi rend="italic">D.
                    Fortunei</hi> from China, which has lilac flowers; <hi rend="italic">D.
                    p&gt;ontica,</hi> a native of Asia Minor; <hi rend="italic">D. alpina,</hi> from
                    the Italian alps; <hi rend="italic">D. collina,</hi> South European; and <hi
                    rend="italic">D. Cneorum,</hi> the garland flower or trailing daphne, the
                    handsomest of the hardy species. See Hemsley’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook of
