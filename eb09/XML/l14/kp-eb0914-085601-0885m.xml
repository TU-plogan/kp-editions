                    languages in the new university of Virginia. There he married his first wife,
                    the widow of Colonel Selden. In 1828 he returned to England to accept the Greek
                    professorship in the newly-founded university of London. His introductory
                    lecture in 1828 was followed in 1830 by another entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations on the Study of the Latin and Greek Languages.</hi> The
                    etymological appendix to this lecture is of interest in the history of classical
                    philology in England, as illustrating the scientific comparative method of
                    teaching the Greek and Latin languages .first adopted in the London university
                    by himself and his colleague, Professor Key. He published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summary of Herodotus</hi> (1829), and editions of Herodotus (1830-33) and
                    Xenophon’s <hi rend="italic">Anabasis</hi> (1831). He was one of the founders of
                    the Royal Geographical Society in 1830, and was for twenty years a member of the
                    council, or officer of the society; in the same year he joined the committee of
                    the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge, and was till 1846, when the
                    society was dissolved, one of its most active workers. In 1831 he resigned his
                    professorship and became editor of the society’s <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                    Journal of Education</hi> (1831-35), for which he wrote many articles. He wrote
                    for the society’s Library of Entertaining Knowledge the two volumes of <hi
                    rend="italic">The British Museum: Egyptian Antiquities</hi> (1832-36), and
                    edited, improved, and wrote parts of the companion volumes <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles</hi> (1833) and <hi rend="italic">Townley
                    Marbles</hi> (1836). He planned and edited for the Library of Useful Knowledge a
                    <hi rend="italic">Geography of America and the West Indies</hi> (1841), of which
                    he wrote a small part, and a <hi rend="italic">Geography of Great Britain: Part
                    I. England and Wales,</hi> part of which he also wrote himself. He contributed
                    two maps of Egypt and Persia, ancient and modern, to the society’s Atlas (1831).
                    From 1833 to 1846 he was engaged on the great labour of his life, the editing of
                    the twenty-nine volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Penny Cyclopaedia,</hi> to
                    which he was also an extensive contributor of articles. The committee appointed
                    Long and Charles Knight editors, but after the publication of a few numbers
                    Knight took no part in the superintendence of the work, and all the editorial
                    labour was done by Long.</p>
                <p>A more colossal and the final venture of the society was its <hi rend="italic"
                    >Biograf)hical Dictionary,</hi> of which Long was also appointed editor. He
                    wrote numerous articles in the seven volumes which appeared (1842-44), but the
                    great expense did not allow it to proceed beyond the letter A. Long was also a
                    member of the committee of the Society for Central Education, instituted in
                    London in 1837, and contributed two essays to its <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Third Publications</hi> (1838-39). In 1837 he was called
                    to the bar at the Inner Temple. He accepted in 1842 the professorship of Latin
                    in University College, vacated by his friend Mr Key, which he resigned in 1846,
                    on being appointed by the benchers of the Middle Temple their reader on
                    jurisprudence and the civil law. <hi rend="italic">Two Discourses delivered in
                    the Middle Temple Hall, ινith an Outline of the Course,</hi> were published in
                    1847. He wrote all the articles on Roman law in the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary
                    of Greek and Roman Aηtiqzιities,</hi> edited by Dr William Smith (1842), and
                    contributed also to the companion <hi rend="italic">Dictionaries</hi> of <hi
                    rend="italic">Biography</hi> (1844-49) and <hi rend="italic">Geography</hi>
                    (1854- 57). His translation of thirteen of Plutarch’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lives,</hi> with copious notes, first came out in five of Knight’s
                    weeklyvolumes under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Civil Wars of Rome</hi>
                    (1844— 48). He planned and edited Knight’s <hi rend="italic">Political
                    Dictionary</hi> (1845-46), a revision of articles from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Penny Cyclopaedia.</hi> Knight published in parts his <hi rend="italic">History
                    of France and its Revolutions,</hi> 1789-1848 (1850).</p>
                <p>In 1849 he left London and went to Brighton College, where he was classical
                    lecturer until midsummer 1871. He was an excellent teacher, and was beloved by
                    both masters and pupils. Whilst here he edited, at first jointly with the Rev.
                    A. J. Macleane, and after that gentleman’s death by himself, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Classica</hi> series, to which
                    he himself contributed the edition of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic">Orations</hi>
                    (1851— 62), a task for which his legal knowledge eminently qualified him. He
                    also revised, making many corrections and additions, Macleane’s editions of
                    Juvenal and Persius (1867) and Horace (1869). He made for Bell’s Grammar School
                    Classics editions, with introductions and notes, of Cicero’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >De</hi><hi rend="italic">Senectute</hi> and <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Amicitia,</hi> with a selection from his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epistolae</hi> (1850), Caesar’s <hi rend="italic">Gallic War</hi> (1853), and
                    Sallust’s <hi rend="italic">Catilina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jugurtha</hi>
                    (1860). He also edited an <hi rend="italic">Atlas of Classical Geography</hi>
                    (1854). His translation (f the <hi rend="italic">Thoughts of the Emperor Μ.
                    Aurelius Antoninus</hi> was published in 1862. The same year appeared
                    anonymously the amusing and instructive little volume called <hi rend="italic"
                    >An Old Man’s Thoughts about Many Things.</hi> He was sixty-four when he issued
                    the first of the five large octavo volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Decline of
                    the Roman Republic.</hi> In 1871 he resigned his post at Brighton College, and
                    retired to Portfield, Chichester, to take a rest well-earned but from labours
                    ill-rewarded. In 1873 the Queen, on the recommendation of Mr Gladstone, granted
                    him a pension of £100 a year. At Portfield he completed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Roman History</hi> (1874), and translated <hi rend="italic">The Discourses of
                    Epictetus, with the Eηcheiridion and Fragments</hi> (1877). This was the last
                    work of his laborious and useful life. He died after a long and painful illness
                    on the 10th of August 1879.</p>
                <p>In addition to the works already noticed, Long was the author of two papers in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,</hi> a few in
                    the early numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Penny Magazine,</hi> and several in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Classical Museum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">English
                    Journal of Education.</hi> He also wrote on “Grammar Schools,” in Knight’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Store of Knowledge.</hi></p>
                <p>Long has exercised by his writings, and indirectly through some of his London
                    university pupils, a wide influence on the teaching of the Greek and Latin
                    languages in England. The publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Classica</hi> (begun in 1851) did important
                    service, and set English scholars an excellent example, at a time when editions
                    with English notes containing accurate learning and sound scholarship were, with
                    very few exceptions, not to be found. Some of the volumes of this series still
                    remain the standard <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n886/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0886-0857"/> English editions. In the knowledge of Roman law
                    Long stood by himself amongst English scholars, and his well-known articles on
                    that subject were the first valuable contribution to the study from any English
                    writer. He had also a profound knowledge of ancient geography. He was an
                    excellent French, German, and Italian scholar, and also read Spanish. His
                    extensive and accurate learning may be explained from the combination of a
                    tenacious memory with a clear judicial intellect. His character was as elevated
                    as his intellect. Its simplicity and manly independence may be seen partly in
                    his writings. His faculty for discriminating evidence and his strong common
                    sense appear in everything that he wrote. (H. J. Μ.)</p>
