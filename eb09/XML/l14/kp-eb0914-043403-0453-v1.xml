                    (1617-1680), a celebrated painter, was born at Soest, Westphalia, in 1617. His
                    father, a military captain and a native of Holland, was originally called Van
                    der Vaes; the nickname of Le Lys or Lely, by which he was generally known, was
                    adopted by his son as a proper surname. After studying for two years under Peter
                    de Grebber, an artist of some note at Haarlem, Lely, induced by the patronage of
                    Charles I. for the fine arts, removed to England in 1641. There he at first
                    painted historical subjects and landscape; and he soon became so eminent in his
                    profession as to be employed by Charles to paint his portrait shortly after the
                    death of Vandyck. He afterwards portrayed Cromwell. At the Restoration his
                    genius and gentlemanly manners won the favour of Charles 11., who made him his
                    state-painter, and afterwards knighted him. He formed a famous collection, the
                    best of his time, containing drawings, prints, and paintings by the best
                    masters; it sold by auction forno less than .£26,000. His great example,
                    however, was Vandyck, whom, in some of his most successful pieces, he almost
                    rivals. Lely’s paintings are carefully finished, warm and clear in colouring,
                    and animated in design. The graceful posture of the heads, the delicate rounding
                    of the hands, and the broad folds of the draperies are admired in many of his
                    portraits. The eyes of the ladies are drowsy with languid sentiment, and
                    allegory of a commonplace sort is too freely introduced. His most famous work is
                    a collection of portraits of the ladies of the court of Charles II., preserved
                    at Hampton Court, and known by the title of the Windsor Beauties. Of his few
                    historical pictures, the best is Susannah and the Elders, at Burleigh House. His

                    worthy of note. Lely was nearly as famous for crayon work as for oil-painting.
                    Towards the close of his life he often retired to an estate which he had bought
                    at Kew. He died of apoplexy in London (the Piazza, Covent Garden) in 1680, and
                    was buried in Covent Garden Church, where a monument was afterwards erected to
                    his memory. Pepys characterized Lely in a few graphic words—“a mighty proud man
                    and full of state.” The painter married an English lady of family, and left a
                    son and daughter, who died young. His only disciples were Greenhill and
                    Bucks-horn; he did not, however, allow them to obtain an insight into his
                    special modes of work.</p>
