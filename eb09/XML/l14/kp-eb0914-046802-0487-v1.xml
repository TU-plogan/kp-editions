                    member of the second Roman triumvirate, was a son of M. Aemilius Lepidus, who
                    had been consul in 137 B.c. He joined the party of Caesar in the civil wars, and
                    was by the dictator thrice nominated <hi rend="italic">magister</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">equitum</hi> and raised to the consulship 46 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He was a man of great wealth and influence, and
                    it was probably more on this ground than on account of his ability that Caesar
                    raised him to such honours. In the beginning of 44 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> he was sent to Gallia Narbonensis, but before he had left the
                    city with his army Caesar was murdered. Lepidus, as commander of the only army
                    near Rome, became a man of great importance in the troubles which followed.
                    Taking part with Antony, he joined in the reconciliation which the latter
                    effected with the senatorial party, and afterwards sided with him when open war
                    broke out. Antony, after his defeat at Mutina, joined Lepidus in Gaul, and in
                    August 43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Octavian, who had forced the senate to
                    make him consul, effected an arrangement with Antony and Lepidus, and the
                    triumvirate was organized at Bononia. Antony and Octavian soon reduced Lepidus
                    to an inferior position. His province of Gaul and Spain was taken from him; and,
                    though he was included in the triumvirate when it was renewed in 37 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> his power was only nominal. He made an effort in
                    the following year to regain some reality of power, conquered part of Sicily,
                    and claimed the whole island as his province, but Octavian found means to sap
                    the fidelity of his soldiers, and he was obliged to supplicate for his life. He
                    was allowed to retain his fortune and the office of <hi rend="italic">pontifex
                        maximus,</hi> to which he had been appointed in 44 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.,</hi> but had to retire into private life. He died 13 <hi

                <p>Lepidus was the <hi rend="italic">cognomen</hi> of a Roman family in the
                    patrician <hi rend="italic">gens</hi><hi rend="italic">Aemilia.</hi> The first
                    of this name of whom anything is recorded is Μ. Aemilius Lepidus, consul 285
                    B.C. From this time onwards the family continued in an almost unbroken series of
                    distinguished men till in the 1st century after Christ it disappears. Another Μ.
                    Aemilius Lepidus was one of the three ambassadors sent to Egypt as <hi
                        rend="italic">tutores</hi> of the infant king Ptolemy V. He was consul in
                    187 and 175, censor 179, pontifex maximus from 180 onwards, and was six times
                    chosen by the censors <hi rend="italic">princeps senatus.</hi> He died in 152.
                    It is uncertain whether he is the Lepidus who is commemorated on a coin of the
                        <hi rend="italic">gens Aemilia</hi> as having slain an enemy and saved a
                    citizen’s life at the age of fifteen, while still dressed in the boy’s <hi
                        rend="italic">toga</hi><hi rend="italic">praetcxta.</hi> Another of the same
                    name was consul 137 B.c. Being sent to Spain to conduct the Numantine war, he
                    began against the will of the senate to attack the Vaccaei. This enterprise was
                    so unsuccessful that he was deprived of his command in 136 and condemned to pay
                    a fine. He was among the greatest of the earlier Roman orators, and Cicero
                    praises him for having introduced the well-constructed sentence and even flow of
                    language from Greek into Roman oratory. He contributed much to forming the style
                    of Tiberius Gracchus.</p>
                <p>Another of the same name was infamous for his oppressive praetorship in Sicily
                    (81 B.c.). In the civil wars he sided with Sulla and bought much of the
                    confiscated property of the Marian partisans. Afterwards he became leader of the
                    popular party, and was with the help of Pompey elected consul for 78 B.c.,
                    against the will of Sulla. When the dictator died, Lepidus tried in vain to
                    prevent the burial of his body in the Campus Martius, and to alter the
                    constitution established by him. His colleague Lutatius Catulus found a tribune
                    to place his veto on Lepidus’s proposals; and the quarrel between the two
                    parties in the state became so inflamed that the senate made the consuls swear
                    not to take up arms. Lepidus was then ordered by the senate to go to his
                    province, Transalpine Gaul; but he stopped in Etruria on his way from the city
                    and began to levy an army. He was declared a public enemy early in 77 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and forthwith marched against Rome. A battle
                    took place in the Campus Martius, Pompey and Catulus commanding the senatorial
                    army, and Lepidus was defeated. He sailed to Sardinia, where he was also
                    repulsed; and soon after he died. One of his two sons was L. Aemilius Paullus,
                    consul 50, who built during his aedileship in 55 the Basilica Aemilia in the
                    forum.</p>
