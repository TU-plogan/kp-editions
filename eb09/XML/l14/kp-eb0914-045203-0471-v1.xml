                <p><label type="entry">LEO I</label>., <hi rend="smallcaps">Flavius,</hi> surnamed
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thrax,</hi>
                    emperor of the East, was born about 400 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> in the
                    country of the Bessi, Thrace, and succeeded Marcian in February 457. At the time
                    of his elevation he was an obscure military tribune, but had become steward to
                    Aspar, patrician and commander of the guards, who might himself have aspired to
                    the purple had he not been tainted with the Arian heresy. In recommending his
                    servant to the soldiers, who proclaimed him emperor, Aspar hoped through him to
                    be able to exercise the reality of power. The election of Leo was ratified by
                    the senate; his coronation by Anatolius, the patriarch of Constantinople, is
                    said to have been the earliest instance of such an ecclesiastical ceremony. The
                    precise nature of the military success against thé barbarians which, according
                    to the chronicles, the new emperor achieved in the first year of his reign is
                    not accurately known. Of the more conspicuous incidents of his subsequent life,
                    the first in chronological order is his intervention in the politico-religious
                    troubles in Egypt, where the Eutychians had gained the upper hand, and,
                    encouraged by the Arianizing Aspar, had made their own nominee, Timotheus
                    Ailurus, patriarch of Alexandria. Leo made peace by deposing and banishing the
                    new patriarch, and, when reminded by Aspar that it ill became a wearer of the
                    purple to be guilty (as in this case he had been) of promise-breaking, retorted
                    that it was equally unbecoming that a prince should be compelled to resign his
                    own judgment and the public interest to the will of a subject. In 466 the Huns,
                    invading Dacia, were defeated by Leo’s generals Anthemius and Anagastus, and
                    again by the latter in 468. In 468 Leo, in concert with Anthemius, whom in the
                    intervening year he had caused to be made emperor of the West, equipped a naval
                    armament against the Vandals of Africa, who, under Genseric, had long been the
                    scourge of Italy and the Mediterranean. The large fleet of more than one
                    thousand vessels was intrusted to the command of Leo’s brother-in-law
                    Basiliscus, who, after a prosperous passage, disembarked his troops safely at
                    Cape Bona within 40 miles of Carthage, but weakly granted a truce of five days
                    to the enemy; during the interval, favoured by the wind and the darkness of the
                    night, the fleet of Genseric, with several fireships in tow, attacked the Roman
                    vessels, burning and sinking one half of them, and thus causing the entire
                    failure of the expedition. A widespread belief that the Arian Aspar had somehow
                    helped to bring about this disastrous defeat furnished Leo with a pretext for
                    getting rid of this dangerous kingmaker, who accordingly was treacherously put
                    to death, along with one of his sons, in 471. To avenge (as they alleged) the
                    murder, the Goths invaded Thrace, and ravaged the country almost to the walls of
                    the capital. In October 473 Leo associated with himself his child grandson Leo
                    II., and in the following year he died (February 3, 474); his successor survived
                    him fora few months only. The somewhat misleading surname of Great borne by Leo
                    I. is due solely to the obsequious gratitude of the orthodox party; by the
                    Arians he was, not without some show of justice, nicknamed Macellarius
                    (“butcher”).</p>
