                <p><label type="entry">LATONA</label> is the Latin name of the Greek Leto, mother of
                    Apollo and Artemis. In Greece she belongs rather to the sphere of mythology than
                    of religion; she forms part of the surroundings of these two great deities, but
                    is not usually a goddess to whom worship is paid or temples built. Different
                    forms of the Latona legend are found in the various seats of Apolline religion.
                    Of these seats the chief are Delos and Delphi, and the tradition which has
                    obtained the widest literary currency is a union of the legends of these two
                    places, formed doubtless under the unifying influence of the Delphic oracle.
                    Latona, pregnant by Zeus, long seeks in vain for a place of refuge to be
                    delivered. She wanders from Crete over Athens, the coasts of Thrace and Asia
                    Minor, and the islands; at last the barren desolate isle of Delos offers itself.
                    Pindar and later poets tell that Delos was a wandering rock borne about by the
                    waves, till it was fixed to the bottom of the sea to serve for the birth of
                    Apollo. Hence arose the belief that Delos could not be shaken by earthquakes,—a
                    belief that was disproved by several shocks in historical times (Herod., vi. 98;
                    Plin., iv. 66). In the oldest forms of the legend Hera is not mentioned; but
                    afterwards the wanderings of Leto are ascribed to the jealousy of Hera, enraged
                    at her amour with Zeus. In the legend the foundation of Delphi follows
                    immediately on the birth of the god; and on the sacred way between Tempe and
                    Delphi the giant Tityus offers violence to Leto, and is immediately slain by the
                    arrows of Apollo and Artemis. Such are the main facts of the Leto legend in its
                    common literary form, which is due especially to the two Homeric hymns to
                    Apollo. We must turn from mythology to actual religion in order to discover the
                    true character of the myth. Then we shall find that Leto is a real goddess, and
                    not a mere mythological figure. The honour paid to her in Delphi and Delos might
                    be explained as part of the cultus of her son Apollo; but temples to her existed
                    in Argos, in Mantinea, and in Xanthus of Lycia; her sacred grove was on the
                    coast of Crete. In Lycia graves are frequently placed under her protection (see
                    <hi rend="italic">Corpus hιscr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Craec.,</hi> No. 4259,
                    4300, 4303, &lt;fcc.) <hi rend="italic">j</hi> and she is also known as a
                    goddess of fertility and as <hi rend="italic">κoυρoτρo(f&gt;o&lt;s.</hi> In
                    these attributes we recognize the earth-goddess. Now, although in the common
                    legends Apollo and Artemis are called the twin children of Leto, yet she appears
                    far more conspicuously in the Apolline myths than in those which grew round the
                    great centres of Artemis worship; moreover, in the older forms of the Apolline
                    myths Artemis is hardly mentioned except as an after-thought, and the Homeric
                    hymn makes them born in different places <hi rend="italic">(τηv μev</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">èv</hi><hi rend="italic">Opτυγig,</hi><hi rend="italic">τον</hi>
                    δe <hi rend="italic">κpavarj</hi><hi rend="italic">èvi</hi> ∆τ)λω). Facts such
                    as these will be readily explained if one recognizes that the idea of Apollo and
                    Artemis as twins is one of later growth on Greek soil, and that the two
                    religions come from different origins in Asia Minor. Again Lycia, one of the
                    chief homes of the Apolline religion, is precisely the country where most
                    frequent traces are found of the worship of Leto as the great goddess.
                    Etymological considerations point in the same direction. The Greeks always
                    connected the word Leto with the root seen in <hi rend="italic">λανθάνω,
                    λήθη,</hi> &amp;c.; but it is more probable that the resemblance is delusive,
                    and that the origin is to be found in words which are not so distinctively
                    Greek. Leto and Leda are both probably forms of the Lycian word <hi
                    rend="italic">Lada,</hi> which means woman or lady; and the island of Lade or
                    Late (Plin., v. 35), the town Lete, the rivers Ladon and Lethaeus, were all
                    named from the goddess.</p>
                <p>It is clear then that Latona or Leto was the great goddess of a religion which
                    found its way into Greece, where its mythology was harmonized to a certain
                    extent with that of the other religious systems of the country. Everything
                    points to Lycia as the earlier home of this religion. Zeus, by whatever name he
                    was called, and Leto are heaven and earth; their offspring is Apollo, the ever
                    young god of light and of the sun, born afresh every spring. The myth is the
                    same that occurs over and over again with different names in every district of
                    Greece and Asia Minor. But in Greece Hera was recognized as the supreme consort
                    of Zeus, and Latona could only rank with many other goddesses of antique
                    religions as his concubine; though even in Greece the oldest forms of the
                    tradition recognize her as the goddess-consort, <hi rend="italic">κv8pη
                    τταpακoιτl&lt;s,</hi> of Zeus. Sappho calls her and Niobe “loving companions.”
                    The father of Leto, Coeus, must be a god in the almost forgotten religion to
                    which she belongs.</p>
                <p>In Greek art Leto appears usually in company with her children; in vase paintings
                    especially she is often represented with Apollo and Artemis. The statue of Leto
                    in the Letoon at Argos was the work of Praxiteles.</p>
