                    rend="italic">(Viscum</hi><hi rend="italic">album,</hi> I..), a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Viscum,</hi> of the family <hi rend="italic">Loranthaceae.</hi>
                    The whole genus is parasitical, and seventy-six species have been described; but
                    only the mistletoe proper is a native of Europe. It forms an evergreen bush,
                    about 4 feet in length, thickly crowded with (falsely) dichotomous branches and
                    opposite leaves. The leaves are about 2 inches long, obovate-lanceolate,
                    yellowish green; the dioecious flowers, which are small and nearly of the same
                    colour but yellower, appear in February and March; the fruit, which when ripe is
                    filled with a viscous semitransparent pulp (whence birdlime is derived), is
                    almost always white, but there is said to be a variety with red fruit. The
                    mistletoe is parasitic both on deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, and “it
                    would be difficult to say on what dicotyledonous trees it does not grow”
                    (Loudon). In England it is most abundant on the apple tree, but rarely found on
                    the oak. The fruit is eaten by most frugivorous birds, and through their agency,
                    particularly that of the thrush (hence missel-thrush or mistle-thrush), the
                    plant is propagated. (The Latin proverb has it that “Turdus malum sibi cacat”;
                    but the sowing is really effected by the bird wiping its beak, to which the
                    seeds adhere, against the bark of the tree on which it has alighted.) The growth
                    of the plant is slow, and its durability proportionately great, its death being
                    determined generally by that of the tree on which it has established itself. See
                    Loudon, <hi rend="italic">Arboretum</hi><hi rend="italic">et Fruticetum
                    Britannicum,</hi> vol. ii. p. 1021 (1838). The mistletoe so extensively used in
                    England at Christmas tide is largely derived from the apple orchards of
                    Normandy.</p>
                <p>Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H. N.,</hi> xvi. 92-95; xxiv. 6) lias a good deal to
                    tell about the <hi rend="italic">viscτvm,</hi> a deadly parasite, though slower
                    in its action than ivy. He distinguishes three “genera.’’ “On the fir and larch
                    grows what is called <hi rend="italic">stelis</hi> in Euboea and <hi
                    rend="italic">hyphcar</hi> in Arcadia." Viscum, called <hi rend="italic">dryos
                    hyphcar,</hi> is most plentiful on the esculent oak (quercus), but occurs also
                    on the robur, <hi rend="italic">Prunus</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvestris,</hi>
                    and terebinth. Hyphear is useful for fattening cattle if they are hardy enough
                    to withstand the purgative effect it produces at first; viscum is medicinally of
                    value as an emollient, and in cases of tumour, ulcers, and the like; and he also
                    notes it “conceptum fceminarum adjuvare si omnino secum habeant.” Pliny is also
                    our authority for the reverence in which the mistletoe when found growing on the
                    robur was held by the Druids. The robur, he says, is their sacred tree, and
                    whatever is found growing upon it they regard as sent from heaven and as the
                    mark of a tree chosen by God. Such cases of parasitism are rare, and when they
                    occur attract much attention (est autem id rarum admodum inventu et repertum
                    magna religione petitur), particularly on ’the sixth (day of the) moon, with
                    which their months and years and, after the lapse of thirty years, their “ages”
                    begin. Calling it in their own language “all heal” (omnia sanantem), after their
                    sacrifices and banquets have been duly prepared under the tree, they bring near
                    two white bulls whose horns are then for the first time bound. The priest
                    clothed with a white robe ascends the tree, cuts [the mistletoe] with a golden
                    hook; it is caught in a white mantle. They then slay the victims, praying God to
                    prosper His gift to them unto whom He has given it. Prepared as a draught, it is
                    used as a cure for sterility and a remedy for poisons. The mistletoe figures
                    also in Scandinavian legend as having furnished the material of the arrow with
                    which Baldur (the sun-god) was slain by the blind god Höder. Most probably this
                    story had its origin in a particular theory as to the meaning of the word
                    mistletoe.</p>
