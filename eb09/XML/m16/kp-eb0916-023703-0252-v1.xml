                    and the State of Wisconsin. The Lower Peninsula is bounded on the W., N., and E.
                    by Lakes Michigan, Huron, St Clair, and Erie, and the St Clair and Detroit
                    rivers, and on the S. by the States of Ohio and Indiana. The general contour of
                    the Lower Peninsula approaches that of a horse-shoe, with an average width of
                    about 200 miles from east to west and a length of about 300 miles from north to
                    south. Its surface gradually rises in gentle undulations from the surrounding
                    lakes to an elevation of about 400 feet above Lake Huron, no point reaching an
                    altitude of more than 600 feet. The Upper Peninsula is much more rugged in
                    contour and surface, at some points reaching an elevation of about 1100 feet.
                    The territory was originally covered with forests, with only here and there a
                    small open prairie. It abounds in fine inland lakes, with areas varying from a
                    few acres to several miles. The rivers are not large enough to be navigable, but
                    they afford ample water-power, and are particularly valuable for floating down
                    the logs of the lumbering districts. The coast-line of the State is not less
                    than about 1600 miles in length; and along the whole of this distance vessels of
                    2000 tons may pass without losing sight of land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geological Formation.—</hi> The Lower Peninsula occupies the
                    central part of a great basin, the borders of which extend to the east as far as
                    London, Ontario, and to the west as far as Madison, Wisconsin. Within these
                    limits the traveller starting in any direction from the centre of the State
                    encounters successively the outcropping edges of older and older strata. The
                    whole series has been likened to a nest of wooden dishes; it embraces not only
                    the Laurentian and Huronian systems but also the numerous groups that go to make
                    up the Silurian, the Devonian, the Carboniferous, and the Quaternary systems.
                    These several formations are covered almost universally with a drift of finely
                    comminuted and triturated rock, borne thither by moving glaciers and floating
                    icebergs, or washed to its present position by currents of water, while the
                    surface was still submerged. This loose material varies in thickness, sometimes
                    extending to a depth of 200 or 300 feet. While the lower formations contain
                    almost inexhaustible deposits of copper, iron, gypsum, and salt, the surface
                    soil is pre-eminently fertile, uniting all the mineral constituents necessary
                    for the most luxuriant growth of plants. There are limited areas of light and
                    somewhat sterile drift soil; but even these have shown themselves under proper
                    treatment to be capable of yielding a rich vegetation. For the most part the
                    drift soil is composed of a mixture of clay with sand and gravel. It is easily
                    cultivated, is retentive of moisture, and is sufficiently porous to prevent the
                    injury of crops by excessive rains.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Natural Products.—</hi> The mean temperature of
                    Lansing, the capital of the State, as determined by observations extending
                    through eighteen years, is 46 <hi rend="superscript"> 0-</hi> 71 Fahr., or about
                    the same as that of Berlin. During the summer months the mean temperature is
                    nearly the same as that of Vienna; in the winter it is nearly that of Stockholm.
                    The annual rainfall during the eighteen years previous to 1882 was about 31
                    inches. This is very evenly distributed throughout the year, though a little
                    more than half the amount falls in the five months from May to October. The
                    average snowfall in the centre of the State is about 4 feet, though it is seldom
                    that more than 12 inches lie on the ground at any oné time. The winter
                    temperature is much modified by the open water of the adjacent lakes. The severe
                    winds are commonly from the west and north-west; but in sweeping across the open
                    waters of Lake Michigan they are so far softened as to make the climate much
                    milder than that found in the same latitude on the western side of the lake.
                    This peculiarity is specially favourable to the growth of fruits. Peaches are
                    grown successfully along the 45th parallel, and figs thrive in the open air in
                    lat. 42∣ <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi>. The modifying influence of the lake
                    winds also gives great variety to the flora. The predominant woods are oak,
                    maple, beech, elm, ash, cherry, hickory, walnut, basswood, and pine. All these
                    grow luxuriantly in the vast forests of the State, and afford an abundant supply
                    of the best timber. There are 165 species of trees and shrubs indigenous to
                    Michigan; and the entire flora of the State makes a list of 1634 species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cereals and Fruits.—</hi> The most important crop of Michigan
                    is wheat, and the average yield per acre, as shown by the latest census, is
                    greater than that of any other State in the Union. The acres sown in 1879 were
                    reported as 1,822,749, and the amount produced as 35,532,543 bushels. These
                    figures show that Michigan is fourth in rank of the wheatproducing States, the
                    number of bushels grown being exceeded by the crops of Illinois, Ohio, and
                    Indiana. In 1879 the yield in bushels of the other principal cereals is shown by
                    the following figures :—Indian corn, 32,461,452; oats, 18,190,793; barley,
                    1,204,316; rye, 294,918; buckwheat, 413,062; clover seed, 313,063; pease,
                    538,332. The crop of potatoes in the same year was 8,025,475 bushels, and the
                    hay amounted to 1,051,115 tons. Of the fruits grown in the State apples are the
                    most important, and these are believed to be unsurpassed in excellence in any
                    country in the world. The sales in 1880 were 4,834,936 bushels, a considerable
                    quantity going to the markets of Europe. Next in importance is the peach crop,
                    annually gathered from more than fifty of the counties of the State. In 1880 the
                    peach orchards were reported as covering 12,908 acres, and the fruit sold as
                    amounting to 413,418 bushels. The long coast-line of Lake Michigan affords easy
                    access to market even for the most perishable fruits. Besides the facilities
                    thus afforded, the railroads that now thread the State, with an aggregate length
                    in March 1882 of 4332 miles, afford abundant means of rapid transportation. As
                    the fruit belt extends from north to south more than 200 miles, the danger of
                    disastrous competition in the markets is obviated by prolongation of the season
                    of ripening. At the meeting of the State Horticultural Society held in 1881 it
                    was . reported that the average value of the peach crop per acre was above $125.
                    The ten volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the State
                    Horticultural Society published since its organization in 1870 show that the
                    development of fruit culture within the last decade has been much more rapid
                    than in any other State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lumber.—</hi> The timber produce in Michigan is of superior
                    quality, and the amount is so great that about two-thirds of the best lumber
                    sold in New York, Philadelphia, and Boston go out from its mills. The logs are
                    borne along the lakes, rivers, and small watercourses to the booms of mills
                    situated at convenient points, where the lumber is sawed and shipped for the
                    different markets of the world. Of these manufacturing districts those known as
                    the Saginaw, the Grand River, and the Muskegon valleys are the most important.
                    The Saginaw receives the waters of the Tittabawasse, the Cass, the Flint, the
                    Shiawasse, the Bad, the Pine, the Chippewa, the Tobacco, and their numerous
                    tributaries, draining a vast region that still yields an undiminished supply of
                    pine. The forests of the western parts of the State are easily accessible by the
                    Grand River and its tributaries, while those still farther north find a natural
                    outlet through the numerous streams that flow into Lake Michigan. On the banks
                    of these watercourses are <pb break="no"

                    world. In 1854, when the first effort was made to collect statistics of this
                    industry, it was found that there were only sixty-one mills in operation, and
                    that the entire annual product was only 108,000,000 feet. Eighteen years later,
                    in 1872, it was estimated that the annual product was not less than 2,560,000
                    feet of oak, 12,700,000 of staves, 300,000,000 lath, 400,000,000 shingles, and
                    2,500,000,000 of sawed pine. The number of saw-mills had already reached about
                    1500, the number of persons employed 20,000, and the capital represented
                    $25,000,000. In 1881 the manufacture of pine lumber amounted to 3,919,500,000
                    feet, the value of which exceeded $60,000,000. The aggregate value of the forest
                    products of the State was estimated in 1881 to have reached more than
                    $1,000,000,000. <hi rend="italic">Forestry Bulletin,</hi> No. 6, issued December
                    1, 1881, estimated the amount of standing white pine of merchantable quality at
                    35,000,000,000 feet, and the amount of standing hard wood at 700,000,000 cords.
                    Besides these amounts, the same authority estimates the amount of hemlock at
                    7,000,000,000 feet, with 7,000,000 cords of bark, and an aggregate of 70,000,000
                    of cedar and tamarack. It is probable that before many years the hard wood
                    produced by the State will approach in value the figures representing the value
                    of the pine now sent to the markets of the world. It is probable that Michigan
                    for many years to come will maintain its precedence as a lumber-producing
                    State.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mineral Resources.—</hi> Of the mineral products of Michigan
                    the most important is iron. As early as 1842 the report of the first State
                    geologist, Dr Douglas Houghton, called attention to the presence of haematite
                    ore, though for a considerable time after this it was not found in such
                    quantities as to make it certain that mining could be made profitable. Before
                    1860, however, it became known that iron in the Upper Peninsula not only existed
                    in vast quantities, but also that it was of superior quality. From that time
                    iron-mines were rapidly developed, until in 1881 they had come to exceed in
                    value, though not in amount, even the products of Pennsylvania. In 1880 the
                    product was 1,834,712 tons, with a value at the mines of $6,034,648, as against
                    the yield in Pennsylvania of 2,185,675 tons, with a value of $5,517,079. The
                    product of Michigan in 1882 was 2,948,307 tons of ore, with a market value of
                    about $25,000,000. The Michigan minerals are of extraordinary richness,—62 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> -</hi> 9 per cent, being the average of the first-class
                    ores, while the furnace books often show a much higher yield.</p>
                <p>Next in importance to the iron-mines are those of copper. These are also situated
                    in the Northern Peninsula, in the mountain range of trappean rocks which crown
                    the point of land extending northwards into Lake Superior. This secondary
                    peninsula or cape, known as Keweenaw Point, rises to an average height of about
                    600 feet above the lake, the highest pinnacles reaching nearly double that
                    altitude. This point contains what are believed to be the richest copper-mines
                    ever discovered; the metal is not found as an ore, but as virgin copper almost
                    chemically pure. It has only to be separated from its rocky matrix, when it is
                    ready for the market. The largest of the copper-mines, that at Calumet, has
                    built up an industry which employs 2000 men, and its total product of refined
                    copper in 1882 was no less than 50,770,719 lb, or one-eighth of the annual
                    production of copper in the world. In quality the copper of the Lake Superior
                    district is such that it commands the highest price at home and abroad. Its
                    tenacity is remarkable, and therefore it is eagerly sought after for cartridges
                    by all the great military powers. In 1882 the copper-mines paid dividends
                    amounting to $2,900,000,— making an aggregate of $28,248,000 since they were
                    opened.</p>
                <p>Within a few years the salt-works of Michigan have also come to exceed those of
                    any other State in the Union. The first well was sunk in 1859-60, but in 1882
                    the production was found to have exceeded that of the famous works in New York,
                    and to have amounted in that year to no less than 3,204,921 barrels. The
                    extraordinary development of this industry is due to several causes. A careful
                    system of inspection by State authority has kept its salt unsurpassed in purity.
                    The salt basin is not only accessible by navigable waters, so as to have the
                    advantage of cheap transportation, but the wells are situated in the great
                    lumber-producing districts, and the manufacture is thus carried on at very small
                    expense, in connexion with the saw-mills. The power is furnished by the same
                    engines, the exhausted steam is used for the evaporation of brine during the
                    day, and during the night evaporation is still carried on by means of refuse
                    wood and sawdust, while the staves for barrels are made from rejected timber. By
                    this system the best quality of salt is obtained at a minimum expense. The chief
                    reservoir of salt is the series of sandstones and shales constituting the
                    Waverly group. This salt-producing rock covers no less than about 8000 square
                    miles, and it is safe to presume that the supply is inexhaustible. The average
                    depth of the wells is about 800 feet, but in some localities wells sunk to
                    nearly 2000 feet have been remunerative. Important salt-works have recently been
                    developed in the western part of the State.</p>
                <p>There are also certain other minerals of considerable importance. Deposits of
                    gypsum, easily accessible, practically inexhaustible in quantity, and superior
                    in quality, are found in several localities both in the eastern and in the
                    western parts of the Lower Peninsula. In the outskirts of Grand Rapids the
                    deposit crops out at the surface, and at an average depth of from 40 to 70 feet
                    extends over an area of 10 or 12 square miles. The rock is easily quarried, and
                    is either ground for use as a fertilizer or calcined into plaster of Paris. The
                    deposits of coal are supposed to cover about 8000 square miles, but as yet the
                    product at any one point has not been very considerable. In quality the coal is
                    highly bituminous, and is not sufficiently pure to be useful for smelting or for
                    the manufacture of gas. For these reasons the stock of coal in the State is
                    practically untouched. If future explorations and experiments should make these
                    deposits available, a new era in the manufacture of iron will be the result. At
                    present the coal for smelting the Lake Superior ores is brought chiefly from
                    Ohio and Pennsylvania. Quarries of limestone and of sandstone have been opened
                    in various parts of the State. The brown stone of the Upper Peninsula is of
                    excellent quality, and is capable of receiving a high finish. The supply is
                    inexhaustible, and the accessibility of the quarries by water gives promise of a
                    thriving industry. The grindstones taken from the Huron county quarries are of
                    superior quality, and the slates found in unlimited quantities on the shores of
                    the Huron Bay are unsurpassed in point of durability and colour. Clays and sands
                    of commercial value are found in great abundance. Though the manufacture of
                    glass is yet in its infancy, sands in large quantities have been discovered in
                    Monroe county suitable for the manufacture of plate glass of excellent quality.
                    Brick and tile clays are found in all parts of the State. Though native silver
                    has been found in small quantities in the Upper Peninsula, the systematic mining
                    of this metal has not yet been carried on with successful results. The <hi

                    the fact that its fresh-water fisheries are the most productive in the United
                    States. The most important varieties of fish aι∙ lake-trout, <pb break="no"

                    brook-trout, grayling, and whitefish. General laws for the protection of fish
                    have been passed; and a fish commission has been maintained for some years for
                    the purpose of propagating the best varieties and planting them in waters
                    adapted to their natural development. Up to the close of 1880 the commissioners
                    had planted about 80,000,000 young whitefish, 1,000,000 silver eels, 1,000,000
                    lake-trout, ‘2,000,000 salmon, and 500,000 brook-trout, besides smaller numbers
                    of shad, grayling, pike, and bass. Excellent results have followed, especially
                    in the multiplication of white-fish, salmon, and eels. In 1879 the total “take”
                    was 24,013,100 ft, of which 12,902,250 ft were white-fish, the most valuable
                    lake-fish known to epicures and to commerce. During winter large quantities
                    preserved by freezing are taken to Eastern markets, where they are readily sold
                    at a high price.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Educational Institutions.—</hi> As early as 1785 the law of
                    congress which provided for the sale of lands north of the Ohio river reserved
                    for the support of public schools “section 16” of each township. This
                    fundamental law devoted to educational purposes one-thirtysixth of all the lands
                    of that vast domain known as the northwestern territory. The “ordinance of
                    1787,” by which this territory was organized, further provided that “schools and
                    the means of education shall for ever be encouraged.” In 1826 this congressional
                    action was supplemented by a grant to Michigan of two townships of land for the
                    founding and support of a university. When Michigan became a State in 1837, its
                    educational policy took definite form. The constitution provided, not only that
                    the grant of “section 16” should be devoted exclusively to the support of
                    schools of the primary grade, but also that the State and not each township
                    should be the custodian of the lands so appropriated. The constitution expressly
                    provided that the proceeds from the sale of “school lands” should be held by the
                    State as a perpetual fund, the interest of which should be annually applied to
                    the support of primary schools. The lands devoted to school purposes in Michigan
                    under these provisions amounted to 1,077,209 acres, of which, in September 1881,
                    675,000 acres had been sold. On the sum realized by these sales, $3,095,679, the
                    State pays interest at 7 per cent., and the resulting income, amounting to
                    $216,645, is annually distributed to the schools. This source is supplemented
                    from local taxes, so that in 1881 the total sum realized from all sources for
                    the primary schools was $3,644,778.</p>
                <p>The schools organized under State law are known as graded and ungraded. In the
                    small districts where the schools are under the charge of but one or two
                    teachers, grading is impracticable. Of ungraded districts there were in 1881
                    6120, attended by 219,570 children, while the graded schools were 404 in number,
                    with an attendance of 152,043. The school census includes all children between
                    the ages of five and twenty, amounting in 1881 to 518,317, of whom there was an
                    average attendance of 391,401. To all children of school age the public schools
                    are free, though a fee may be required for advanced studies in the high schools.
                    The immediate administration of the schools is entrusted to school officers
                    elected annually by the tax-payers of the individual districts. The State
                    constitution requires that a free school shall be in session at least three
                    months of every year in each district. In districts of more than 30 and less
                    than 800 children, the law requires at least five months of school; while in
                    districts of more than 800 children, the session must be not less than nine
                    months in length. In the graded schools the division is into primary schools,
                    grammarschools, and high schools, each of these divisions retaining the scholar
                    ordinarily four years. At the end of the course the student is ready for the
                    university, to which, under certain restrictions provided by the university
                    itself, he is admitted on diploma from the high school. The university of
                    Michigan, situated at Ann Arbor, was first opened for instruction in 1841. It
                    now (1883) consists of the department of literature, science, and the arts, the
                    department of medicine, the department of law, the college of homoeopathic
                    medicine, the school of pharmacy, the college of dental surgery, and the school
                    of political science. Connected with the medical departments are the State
                    hospitals. In 1881-82 there were 86 officers of instruction and 1534 students.
                    The total income for the year 1879-80 from Federal grant, State grants, and fees
                    was $231,339. The general control of the university is placed in the hands of
                    eight regents elected by popular suffrage at the biennial spring elections, two
                    regents being chosen at each election. The normal school, situated at Ypsilanti,
                    and generously supported by the State, may be said to complete the school
                    system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Charitable and Reformatory Institutions. —</hi> A school for
                    the deaf, dumb, and blind, instituted under an Act passed in 1848, is situated
                    at Flint, about 60 miles north-west of Detroit; in February 1882 it had 249
                    pupils. In 1879 a distinct school for the training of the blind was established
                    at Lansing. The “State public school for dependent and neglected children” is
                    devoted to the systematic education of such children as otherwise would have to
                    be maintained in the county poorhouses. The pupils are divided into “families”
                    of about thirty each, and are cared for in separate cottages, each cottage being
                    under the charge of a “cottage manager.” The school receives dependent children
                    of sound health, and free from contagious disease; and it is made the duty of
                    the officers having charge of the poor to send all such children between the
                    ages &lt; ι' three and twelve to it. This institution, the pioneer of its kind,
                    and one of the most useful of charitable schools, is situated at Coldwater, 132
                    miles south-west of Detroit. In February 1882 there were 320 children and 21
                    officers and teachers. The “Reform School” at Lansing is designed to reclaim
                    juvenile offenders who have been convicted of some offence. A farm of 224 acres
                    connected with the school is, in considerable part, tilled by the boys. The
                    number of inmates in February of 1882 was 325. A similar school at Adrian has
                    recently been instituted for girls. There are State asylums for the insane at
                    Kalamazoo (715 patients) and Pontiac (499 patients). The legislature of 1881
                    provided for the establishment of an additional asylum in one of the northern
                    counties of the Lower Peninsula.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Government.—</hi> The State of Michigan is part of
                    the territory that was first settled by the French, and until the fall of Canada
                    into the hands of the British after the middle of the 18th century was under the
                    government of New France. The territory was explored by Jesuit missionaries in
                    the 17th century; but, although it was known at an early period that the lands
                    were of exceptional excellence, very little progress was made in developing the
                    resources of the territory until after the completion of the first half-century
                    of the American Union. The surveyors employed by the general government to
                    inspect the lands and report as to their fitness for settlement by the soldiers
                    of the war of 1812 appear to have derived their impressions almost exclusively
                    from the low lands in the south-eastern corner of the territory. The report,
                    accordingly, was not favourable; and consequently the tide of immigration that
                    had already begun to set in flowed steadily past Michigan into the territories
                    farther west. It was largely for this reason that the early development of
                    Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin was somewhat more rapid than that of
                    Michigan. But gradually the false impressions concerning the soil and climate
                    were dispelled; and within the past few years the increase of the population and
                    the growth of wealth have been very rapid. In 1851 the valuation of the State
                    for purposes of taxation (which excludes much valuable property) was
                    $30,976,270; in 1861, $172,055,808; in 1871, $630,000,000; at 1881,
                    $810,000,000. The State constitution, adopted in 1837 at the time of admission
                    to the Union, has been modified in some minor particulars; but in most respects
                    it remains unchanged. The governor is elected for two years, with no restriction
                    as to re-election. The legislature meets biennially in the first week of
                    January, and usually continues in session till May. The supreme court consists
                    of four judges chosen by popular vote for terms of eight years, one being
                    elected every second year. Judges have been so frequently re-elected that the
                    office may be said to be practically a permanent one, with a provision for
                    termination in case of need. The State is divided into twenty-two judicial
                    districts, in each of which a circuit court sits fi&gt;r the trial of causes of
                    original jurisdiction, and of causes appealed from the justice courts. The
                    judges of the circuit courts are also elected by popular suffrage. On political
                    questions voting is open to all naturalized citizens of the male sex more than
                    twenty-one years of age unless prevented by some natural disqualification. At
                    school meetings the right of suffrage is extended so as to include tax-payers of
                    either sex.</p>
