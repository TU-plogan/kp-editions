                    Although with the exception of Rutland it is the smallest county in England, its
                    population is exceeded by that of Lancashire only. Its total area is 181,317
                    acres, of which 2592 acres are common or waste lands. The longest straight line
                    that can be drawn in the county is one of nearly 28 miles from the north-eastern
                    extremity near Waltham Abbey to the southwestern at Staines. From north to south
                    in the broadest part the distance is about 15 miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Surface and Geoloyy.—</hi> The greater portion of the county is
                    flat, although there are sufficient undulations to allow of a proper drainage of
                    the land. A range of hills runs along the Hertfordshire border by Barnet,
                    Elstree, Stanmore, and Pinner, averaging 400 feet in height; another range
                    occupies the ground just north of London by Hornsey, Highgate, and Hampstead;
                    Harrow occupies an isolated eminence between the two ranges.</p>
                <p>The county lies entirely within the basin of the Thames, and the London Clay
                    extends over a large portion of the surface. This formation stretches from the
                    mouth of the estuary of the Thames to the neighbourhood of Marlborough. It
                    attains its greatest breadth (little short of 30 miles) in the neighbourhood of
                    London, and extends northward until it is lost beneath the drift of Suffolk and
                    Norfolk. The following is a table of the various beds of rock which occur at the
                    surface, with their greatest thickness (in feet) in the district:—</p>

                <p>Chalk comes to the surface in so very'few places that it is scarcely worth
                    mention. It is seen near Harefield and on the north-west side of South Mimms.
                    The depth from the surface to the chalk varies greatly in different parts of the
                    county. This has been proved by the borings for wells; thus at Isleworth the
                    depth is 400 feet and at Hampstead 378, while at Ruislip it is 76 feet and at
                    Pinner only 60. The Reading beds (plastic clays) are brought to the surface at
                    Windsor. They follow roughly the course of the river Colne from the north of
                    Uxbridge along the flank of the hills north-eastward, but are sometimes cut back
                    southward along small side valleys. An outlying mass is exposed at Pinner. The
                    Bagshot sands, consisting of gravel and sand permeable to water, once stretched
                    over the whole extent of the London Clay, but they are now to be found only on
                    the high grounds at Hampstead, Highgate, and Harrow. A corner of the main mass
                    enters the south-west corner of the county near Littleton. Beds of brick-earth
                    occur in the drift between West Drayton and Uxbridge.</p>
                <p>Several deep borings in the London basin prove the existence beneath the chalk of
                    beds which do not crop out in Middlesex. Three of these are in the county; and
                    the most interesting is that at Meux’s Brewery, Tottenham Court Road (about 1146
                    feet), which passes through the following formations :—gravel and clay, 21 feet;
                    London Clay, 64 feet; Reading beds, 51 feet; Thanet sand, 21 feet; chalk, 655
                    feet; Upper Greensand, 28 feet; gault, 160 feet; Lower Greensand, 64 feet;
                    Devonian, 80 feet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers and Canids.—</hi> The Thames is very tortuous in the 44
                    miles of its course from Staines to Blackwall, and makes a remarkable bend at
                    the eastern limit of the county where it forms the so-called Isle of Dogs. The
                    width at Staines is 200 feet, at Chiswick opposite Barnes 340 feet, at
                    Hammersmith 525 feet, at Fulham 820 feet, at Westminster Bridge 1100 feet, but
                    at London Bridge it is less than 800 feet; above the junction of the Lea at the
                    Isle of Dogs the width is 1350 feet. The ordinary rise of the tide at London
                    Bridge is 16 feet, and the tide-way ends at Teddington. The port of London
                    begins below London Bridge, and the channel for from 2 to 3 miles is called the
                    Pool.</p>
                <p>The Colne from Hertfordshire enters Middlesex at the north-western corner of the
                    county. It then runs south, joining the Thames at Staines, and in its course
                    divides Middlesex from Buckinghamshire for 15 miles. After the river leaves
                    Uxbridge it divides out into several small channels. The Lea from Hertfordshire
                    enters Middlesex at the north-eastern corner of the county near Waltham Abbey.
                    It runs south, dividing Middlesex from Essex for 15 miles, and falls into the
                    Thames at Bow Creek. Several branches flow off from the river during its course.
                    The Brent from Hertfordshire enters Middlesex near Finchley. It takes a
                    circuitous direction southward through the middle of the county by Hendon,
                    Kingsbury, Twyford, Greenford, and Han well to the town of Brentford, where it
                    unites with the Thames. Where the river crosses the Edgeware Road (about 3 miles
                    south of the town of Edgewarc) it is expanded by artificial means into an
                    extensive reservoir. The Cran (or Yedding Brook) rises in the district between
                    Harrow and Pinner and flows under Cranford Bridge; it crosses Hounslow Heath,
                    and bends round to Twickenham and Isleworth, where in a divided stream it falls
                    into the Thames.</p>
                <p>There were several other small streams in the neighbourhood of London which have
                    left their mark in the names of places, but which are now merely sewers, such as
                    the Wallbrook, the Westbourn, the Tyburn, the Fleet river, &lt;fcc. The
                    last-mentioned, which runs into the Thames near Blackfriars Bridge, was formerly
                    navigable as far as Holborn Bridge; but, the Fleet Ditch, as it was then called,
                    having become in the last century a dangerous nuisance, the lord mayor and
                    citizens were empowered by Act of Parliament to arch it over. The work was
                    commenced in 1734, and in 1737 Fleet market, occupying the site of the space
                    from Holborn Bridge to Fleet Bridge, was opened to the public. The New River, an
                    artificial water-course constructed by Sir Hugh Myddelton in the reign of James
                    I. to supply London with water, runs through the county from north to south a
                    little to the west of the river Lea. It derives its waters from the springs of
                    Amwell and Chadwell, increased by a cut from the Lea, in the neighbourhood of
                    Ware, and enters Middlesex from Hertfordshire about 2 miles north of Enfield. It
                    passes Enfield, Tottenham, Hornsey, and Stoke Newington, and is received into
                    the reservoir in Clerkenwell known as the New River Head.</p>
                <p>The Grand Junction Canal leaves the Thames at Brentford<pb break="no"

                    Hanwell and Cranford to West Drayton; thence in a northerly direction it follows
                    the valley of the Colne. It passes Uxbridge, and after leaving the county takes
                    its further course by Rickmansworth through Hertfordshire. The Paddington Canal
                    leaves the Grand Junction Canal at Cranford, and passes Northolt, Apperton,
                    Twyford (where it is carried over the Brent by an aqueduct), and Kensal Green.
                    At Paddington it joins the Regent’s Canal, which κ asses the north of Regent’s
                    Park, and after proceeding through the eastern portions of London joins the
                    Thames at Limehouse. The Regent’s Canal is joined to the river Lea by means of
                    Sir George Duckett’s Canal, and thus there is a through communication from the
                    north-eastern corner of the county to the south-eastern corner, thence from east
                    to west, and north ward to the north-west corner.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate, Soil, Agriculture, &lt;I.∙c.—</hi> The climate of the
                    county is equable and good, and the shelter of the northern hills makes the air
                    mild. Highgate, Hampstead, and some other parts are supposed to be specially
                    healthy, and are recommended for invalids by the medical profession.</p>
                <p>The heavy poor clay in the north and north-western portion of Middlesex is
                    chiefly covered with permanent grass. In some parts it has been made fit for
                    arable cultivation by the addition of chalk, lime, and ashes. The rich deposits
                    from the Thames have formed a soil which when well manured is specially suitable
                    for market gardens. From its nearness to London the district has long been
                    famous for high farming, and the divisions devoted to different kinds of farming
                    are well marked. The greater part of Gore and Ossulston hundreds, portions of
                    Spelthorne and Edmonton hundreds, and a strip down the western side of Elthorne
                    hundred are devoted to meadow and pasture. The arable land is chiefly found on
                    the western side, and between the Great Western Railway and the Thames. It is
                    also to be seen in the north-western district. With the constant increase of
                    London, houses have encroached upon the fields, and most of the market gardens
                    which were situated in the neighbourhood of Islington and Hackney have
                    disappeared. The strip of land by the Thames from Brentford to Chelsea was given
                    up almost entirely to market gardens, but Fulham is fast being built over.</p>
                <p>According to the returns for 1882, the area occupied by grain and green crops,
                    grass, &amp;c., was 116,470 acres. Of this amount, 16,337 acres were under corn
                    crops (wheat, 6410; barley, 3083; oats, 3895; and beans and pease, 2636); 13,451
                    under green crops (includingpotatoes, 3019; turnips, 1539; mangolds, 1692;
                    cabbage, λc., 1188); 3025 under clover and grasses sown in rotation; and 82,782
                    under permanent pasture. Orchards occupied 3419 acres; market gardens, 6900;
                    nursery grounds, 447; and woods, 2382. In the same year the horses numbered 5939
                    (4188 used for agricultural purposes); cattle, 23,283 (cows, 15,390); sheep,
                    23,916; and pigs, 12,035.</p>
                <p>The following were the landowners in the county (exclusive of London) at the time
                    of the Domesday survey:—the king, the archbishop of Canterbury, the bishop and
                    canons of London, the abbeys of Westminster and Holy Trinity at Caen, the
                    nunnery of Barking, the Earls Roger and Morton, Geoffrey de Mannevele, Ernulf de
                    Heading, Walter Fitz Other, Walter de St Walery, Richard Fitz Gilbert, Robert

                    William Fitz Ansculf, Edmund do Salisbury, Aubrey de Vere, Ranulf Fitz ∏ger,
                    Derman, Countess Judith, and the king's almoners.</p>
                <p>In 1873, according to the <hi rend="italic">Return of Owners of Land,</hi> the
                    total number of owners in the county (also exclusive of London) was 11,881, of
                    whom 9006 owned less than an acre. The extent of lands (including common or
                    waste lands) is given as 145,605. The gross estimated rental was £1,611,655.
                    Sixteen owners each possessed over 1000 acres. The crown owned 2382 acres
                    (annual value £5503); the duchy of Lancaster, 2273 acres (£4492); Ecclesiastical
                    Commissioners, 1308 acres (£46,519); All Souls’ College, Oxford, 1813 acres
                    (£4724); Christ Church, Oxford, 1132 acres (£1635); and King’s College,
                    Cambridge, 1097 (£1084).</p>
                <p>Many villages of Middlesex, especially those near to London, were formerly famous
                    for their mineral springs.</p>
                <p>Some places are still supplied with water from wells; but the Barnet, the East
                    Middlesex, the Grand Junction, the West Middlesex, and the New River Water
                    Companies serve a large part of the county.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures and Trade.—</hi> There is little to remark with
                    regard to the manufactures of the county outside of London. Brick-making and
                    tile-making have always flourished, and malting, distilling, and soap-making are
                    favourite industries. Gunpowder mills exist at Twickenham and Bedfont. The
                    market-towns for corn are Uxbridge, Brentford, and Staines, for cattle and sheep
                    Southall. A horse and cattle fair is held at South Mimms and Barnet.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways and Roads.—</hi> As London is the centre of the
                    railway system of England, it is evident that many of the lines must run through
                    Middlesex. For similar reasons it is well provided with roads.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Population.—</hi> The total population of Middlesex was
                    2,539,765 in 1871 and 2,920,485 in 1881, or excluding the seven metropolitan
                    boroughs lying within the county 276,028 in 1871 and 394,089 in 1881. Most of
                    the towns and villages have largely increased during the period between 1871 and
                    1881; the populations of Acton and Tottenham have more than doubled, and
                    Chiswick, Ealing, Edmonton, and Willesden have almost doubled. Of the larger
                    places the least increase has been at Brentford, which numbered 10,271 in 1871,
                    and reached 11,808 in 1881. At the time of the Domesday survey the population of
                    Middlesex, exclusive of London, was 2302.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Government.—</hi> Unlike other counties, Middlesex has no high
                    sheriff appointed by the sovereign. It is subject to the City of London, and one
                    of the sheriffs appointed by the lord mayor is sheriff for Middlesex. When Henry
                    I. came to the throne he gave the city an extensive charter, and one of the
                    privileges either granted or confirmed by the king was the perpetual sheriffwick
                    of Middlesex.</p>
                <p>The whole of the county is included in the diocese of London, and is divided
                    between the archdeaconries of London and Middlesex. When Henry VIII. created the
                    bishopric of Westminster he allotted the whole county (the parish of Fulham
                    alone excepted) for its diocese. Edward VI., however, dissolved the bishopric in
                    the fourth year of his reign.</p>
                <p>The county is divided into six hundreds, which remain the same as they were at
                    the time of the Domesday survey, except that the name of one has been
                    changed:—Ossulston (Osulvestane D. ), Edmonton (Delmetone D.), Gore (Gara D.)
                    <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> Elthorne (Heletorne or Helethorne D.), Spelthorne
                    (Speletorne or Spelethorne D. ), Isleworth (Honeslaw D., <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Hounslow). The division into hundreds is now merely a name, and a
                    record of a former system of local government.</p>
                <p>There are thirty-two poor-law unions, but the unions beyond London are only eight
                    in number, viz., Brentford, Edmonton, Fulham, Hackney, Hampstead, Hendon,
                    Staines, Uxbridge.</p>
                <p>The majority of hospitals are in London, but there is a training hospital at
                    Tottenham, St John’s Hospital at Twickenham, and cottage hospitals at Enfield,
                    Ealing, Hayes, Hillingdon, Sudbury, and Teddington. The Royal India Lunatic
                    Asylum is at Ealing, and the two county asylums at Colney Hatch and Hanwell.</p>
                <p>The county is within the jurisdiction of the central criminal court and also of
                    the metropolitan police (with the exception of the City).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Parliamentary Representation. —</hi> There are nine
                    constituencies in Middlesex, returning nineteen members, viz., two for the
                    county, four for the City of London, two for each of the boroughs of
                    Westminster, Finsbury, Marylebone, the Tower Hamlets, Chelsea, and Hackney, with
                    one for the university of London.</p>
                <p>In the parliament of 1295 Middlesex was represented by two members; in 1298
                    London sent two members as well as the county. For the parliament of 1320 and
                    subsequent parliaments London elected four members, but it does not appear that
                    all were allowed to sit. From the 15th century, however, the city has always
                    sent four members to parliament. In 1547 Westminster first sent her two members,
                    and from that time until 1832 the only seats were those for the county and the
                    two boroughs. In 1832 the boroughs of Finsbury, Marylebone, and Tower Hamlets
                    were added, and in 1866 the boroughs of Chelsea and Hackney and the university
                    of London.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The district now included in Middlesex was
                    largely occupied by forest up to a comparatively recent period, and its
                    population must always have been very sparse. A few prehistoric remains have
                    been discovered at various times,—bones of the elephant, hippopotamus, deer,
                    &amp;c., at Old Brentford, elk horns near Chelsea Hospital, fossil teeth, fish,
                    fruit, &amp;c., at Highgate, and quite recently, in 1879, while the foundations
                    were being dug out for Drummond’s New Bank at Charing Cross, a large number of
                    prehistoric animal remains. Flint instruments have also been found to cover a
                    considerable area. During the British period the district is supposed to have
                    been inhabited by the Trinobantes, but <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0298-0281"/> the late Dr Guest affirms that the valley of the
                    Lea was the western boundary of that tribe. In answer to the question—What
                    became of the district between the Lea and the Brent? this great authority
                    states that the district was merely a march of the “Catuvellauni,” a common
                    through which ran a wide trackway, but in which was neither town, village, nor
                    inhabited house. Dr Guest also declares that the boundaries of the
                    Catuvellaunian state, a central kingdom formed or much extended by
                    Cassivellaunus, can be traced in part along the northern limit of Middlesex by
                    following an earthwork called Grimesditch “from Brockley Hill to the woodland of
                    the Colne Valley and thence to the Brent, and down the Brent to the
                    Thames.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Lecture on the
                    Origin of London,” <hi rend="italic">Athenxum,</hi> 1866, No. 2022.</p></note>
                    Some earthworksand encampments still exist which are attributed to the
                    Britons.</p>
                <p>When the country was under Roman rule great improvements, due to the growing
                    importance of Londinium, were made in this district. Several roads in connexion
                    with the city must have been constructed, more especially the great northern and
                    eastern roads. Dr Guest does not believe that the present Watling Street could
                    have had any connexion with the Watling Street which came down the Edgeware
                    Road, passed along by Park Lane, and crossed the Thames at Westminster. In the
                    Antonine Itinerary mention is made of three stations, viz., Londinium,
                    Sulloniacae, and Pontes. Sulloniacae is now Brockley Hill; Pontes is supposed by
                    Stukeley to mean Staines, but Horsley held that it was intended for Old Windsor,
                    and others supported the claims of Coinbrook and Longford. Roman camps have been
                    found in many parts of the county, and Dr Stukeley supposed that the Brill, near
                    St Paneras, was the site of the battle between Boadicea and the Roman legions
                    which has left a slight record in the name of Battle Bridge. The Roman remains
                    found at different times are too numerous to mention here in detail. Coins,
                    urns, and tiles were found at Enfield, a sepulchral urn at Hampstead, and
                    numerous gold coins and ornaments at Bentley Priory, Great Stanmore, in
                    1781.</p>
                <p>Cowey Stakes, about a furlong west of Walton Bridge, is supposed to be the
                    locality of the ford by which Julius Caesar crossed the Thames. Caesar makes
                    special mention of the sharp stakes which he had to encounter, and Bede says
                    that the remains of the stakes were to be seen in his day. Camden was the first
                    to fix upon this as the spot where Caesar crossed, and he is supported by Dr
                    Guest, but the identification is not undisputed. Although a ford existed here as
                    late as 1807, and stakes were found up to the end of the 18th century, it has
                    been affirmed that they were placed in their position with another object than
                    to oppose an enemy’s progress. Roman remains have been found at Shepperton near
                    Halliford, at the Middlesex end of the ford. A vase was dug up in 1817, and the
                    remains of a Roman cemetery have also been discovered.</p>
                <p>As to the earliest Saxon occupation we are left very much to conjecture, and the
                    name itself is somewhat of a puzzle. It is evident that no tribe could have
                    obtained the name of Middle Saxons until after the settlement of the districts
                    on each side of it by the East and the West Saxons. As Middlesex was for a
                    period dependent upon the kingdom of Essex, it is probable that the name did not
                    come into use until London had become a Saxon city, although there is reason to
                    believe that previously Saxon settlements had been made on several places by the
                    river and elsewhere. Bede tells us that London was in the hands of King Saeberct
                    in 604, and was then the chief town of Essex. Just a century afterwards—that is,
                    in 704 —the king of the East Saxons granted away land at Twickenham, showing
                    that Middlesex was then dependent upon Essex. It is worthy of note that the two
                    districts now forming the counties iu which London and Southwark are situated
                    were separated from the kingdoms to which they originally belonged probably on
                    account of the importance of the city of London and the borough of Southwark,
                    Middlesex from the kingdom of Essex and Surrey or the South Ridge (A.-S.
                    SιΓδ-rige) from the kingdom of Kent.</p>
                <p>Middlesex appears never to have been independent. The administrative shire was
                    let to the men of London and their heirs to be held in farm of the king and his
                    heirs, and “the subject shire has to submit to the authority of the sheriffs
                    chosen by the ruling city.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Middlesex is only once mentioned in the Saxon Chronicle, under date 1011, where
                    it is noticed as one of the districts overrun by the Danes. One manuscript (A.
                    Winchester) mentions the Middle Saxons as receiving the true faith under their
                    aiderman Peada in 653; but this is evidently a mistake of the scribe, for the
                    fact is taken from Bede, and he writes Middle. Angles, as do the other MSS. of
                    the Chronicle.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the
                    above passage from the Chronicle, where the districts overrun by the Danes in
                    1011 are enumerated, the shires, which took their names from their chief towns,
                    are distinctly marked off from the districts which took their names from the
                    peoples who inhabited them. Of the latter there are, besides the Middle Saxons,
                    the East Angles, the Rentings, and the South Saxons. Middlesex is styled an
                    administrative shire, because it was not historically a shire, but only one for
                    the purposes of administrative organization. Of the present forty counties
                    twenty-eight are and twelve are not shires. Wessex was divided into six shires,
                    and Mercia into eighteen, with the subsequent addition of Rutland, taken (it is
                    believed) from Northamptonshire. Yorkshire was taken from Northumbria,
                    Lancashire from Cumbria, and, last of all, Monmouthshire from Wales, by an Act
                    of Henry VIII.’s reign.</p></note></p>
                <p>The Saxons appear to have settled over a large portion of the district, and for
                    the purpose of settlement they must have made considerable clearings in the vast
                    forest of Middlesex. There seems to be good reason for believing that previous
                    to their coming the roads passed through waste lands. By the time of Edward the
                    Confessor a large proportion of the present towns and villages were in
                    existence. Mr Elton, in his <hi rend="italic">Origins of English
                    History,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Pp.

                    curious fact with relation to the tenures which prevailed in some of these
                    places. He alludes to a ring of manors encircling ancient London where the
                    custom of Borough English or junior right was prevalent.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Corner gives the number cf instances he
                    has found at sixteen.</p></note> He then goes on to point out that in this
                    cluster of manors there are several varieties of the custom:—“Its benefit in
                    Islington and Edmonton was confined to the youngest son; at Ealing, Acton, and
                    Isleworth it extended to the brothers and male collateral heirs; and in a great
                    number of instances the privilege was given to females as well as to males in
                    every degree of relationship. These variations are of no very great importance,
                    the custom being modified in all parts of the country by the rule that special
                    proof must be given of any extension of that strict form of Borough English for
                    the benefit of the younger son of which alone the courts have cognizance. But it
                    is of the greater interest to observe that in several places near London ‘it is
                    the custom for the land to descend to the youngest, if it is under a particular
                    value of five pounds, but if it is worth more, it is parted among all the sons ’
                    <hi rend="italic">{First Real Property Commission Evidence,</hi> p. 254).”</p>
                <p>The great forest of Middlesex continued long after the Norman Conquest, and even
                    as late as the reign of Elizabeth portions of it still existed quite close to
                    London. Fitz Stephen, the monk of Canterbury and secretary of Thomas a Becket,
                    mentions in his interesting description of London the immense forest with its
                    densely wooded thickets, and its coverts of game, stags, fallow deer, boars, and
                    wild bulls. A few years after Fitz Stephen’s death, in the reign of Henry III.
                    (1218), the forest was disafforested, and some of the wealthy citizens took the
                    opportunity of purchasing land and building upon it. Matthew Paris, in his life
                    of the twelfth abbot of St Albans, describes the woods contiguous to the Watling
                    Street between London and St Albans as almost impenetrable, and so much infested
                    by outlaws and by beasts of prey that the numerous pilgrims who travelled along
                    the Roman road, to the shrine of Albanus were exposed to imminent danger.</p>
                <p>There is little further history that can be told of Middlesex. There are many
                    interesting incidents connected with some of the places, but corporate life has
                    been crushed out of the county by the greatness of London. Not a single place
                    except London has grown into importance, and nowhere outside of London is there
                    a building of first-rate interest. The villages on the Thames early began to
                    increase in size on account of the convenience of locomotion supplied by the
                    river. It is only since the extension of the railway system that the villages to
                    the north and north-west of London have grown in size, and this growth has been
                    mainly due to the building of houses for the use of the Londoners.</p>
