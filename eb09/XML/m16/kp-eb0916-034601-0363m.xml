                <p>NATURAL objects which are homogeneous in their mass, and in which no parts formed
                    for special purposes can be distinguished, are termed “minerals”; and the branch
                    of natural science which treats of these is termed mineralogy. Minerals differ
                    from the structures treated of in botany and zoology in the three following
                    particulars. (1) They differ in the mode of their formation; this has been
                    accomplished, not by assimilation of matter, producing growth from within, but
                    by augmentation of bulk through accretion of particles from without. (2)
                    Minerals are not heterogeneous. While the objects treated of in the other
                    departments of natural history consist of beings possessed of life, and having
                    parts which, being mutually dependent, cannot be separated from one another
                    without a more or less complete destruction of the individual, the objects
                    treated of under the department of mineralogy have so uniformly consistent an
                    individuality that they are not destroyed by any separation of parts,—each
                    portion or fragment possessing the same properties and the same composition as
                    the whole. And (3), while those beings which are possessed of life have their
                    component elements grouped into complexes, for the most part capable of more or
                    less freedom of motion and susceptible of change, minerals have a constitution
                    resulting from chemical attractions alone and an arrangement of their parts,
                    under physical influences, which has resulted in rigidity and an absence of all
                    tendency to change.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Form of Minerals—Crystallography.</hi></p>
                <p>The most precise definition of a mineral would be—an inorganic body possessed of
                    a definite chemical composition, and usually of a regular geometric form. Of
                    these, the second is in one respect the direct outcome of the first; while many
                    of the most important physical properties possessed by minerals are outcomes of
                    the second.</p>
                <p>Both the geometric form and the composition of minerals are produced and modified
                    under the influence of general laws.</p>
                <p>Mineral bodies occur in the three physical conditions of solid, liquid, and gas.
                    Those now found in the last two states are few in number, and are of altogether
                    inferior interest to those which occur as solids; but there is reason to believe
                    that the minerals we know as solids once existed in the liquid or gaseous state,
                    and that their present structure was determined in the process of
                    solidification. All bodies thus formed may be divided into two great
                    classes:—</p>
                <p>1. Amorphous bodies, or such as do not possess a definite and characteristic
                    geometrical form. These (when transparent) refract light singly in every
                    direction (except when under stress); they are equally easy or equally difficult
                    to break in all directions; when broken they exhibit a conchoidal or an earthy
                    fracture; they are equally hard throughout all their parts; they are equally
                    elastic in all directions; they conduct heat with equal rapidity and in equal
                    amount in all directions.</p>
                <p>2. Crystalline bodies, or such as occur in definite geometrical forms bounded by
                    flat surfaces. These present greater facilities of separation of their
                    particles, or “cleavage,” in certain directions lying in determinate planes than
                    they do in others; most of them are neither equally hard nor equally elastic in
                    all directions, conduct heat more rapidly in certain directions than they do in
                    others, and, when transparent, refract light doubly except in certain
                    directions.</p>
                <p>Mineral bodies are found in both of the above classes; and the same mineral body
                    may occur in both the amorphous and the crystalline condition. This is seen in
                    the piece of gold shown in fig. 1, where the upper portion has a sharply angular
                    and a well-defined shape, while the lower presents curvilinear and rugged
                    outlines, similar to one another in no part. Under favouring circumstances, it
                    is possible that every substance whose composition is capable of being
                    represented by a definite chemical fornιula— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> which
                    has an unvarying composition—may be capable of assuming a definite crystalline
                    form.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Size and Form of Crystals.—</hi> They are of every size from
                    over a yard in diameter to mere specks requiring a high power of the microscope
                    to reveal their existence. Beryls have been obtained in America more than 4 feet
                    in length by 2⅛ in thickness, weighing 2∣ tons. Equally large crystals of
                    apatite have been found in Canada. There is a rock crystal at Milan 3} feet long
                    by 5∣ in circumference, weighing 870 lb. The highest perfection of form, and
                    hence of other properties, is only found, however, in crystals of moderate or of
                    small size.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Variety of Form, and Constancy of Form.—</hi> The same mineral
                    may be found in different localities, or sometimes in the same locality,
                    exhibiting an almost endless variety of forms. Calc-spar occurs at a Scottish
                    locality in acicular pyramidal crystals of which the length may be ten or more
                    times as great as the width (fig.</p>
                <p>2); in flat plates as thin as paper, in which the length is not the hundredth
                    part of the width; also in prisms, pyramids, and rhombohedra, which at first
                    sight (as in figs. 3, 4) seem destitute of any relationship to each other. This
                    substance has elsewhere been noted in several hundred forms. The minerals
                    fluorite, pyrite, and baryte have each been observed in over a hundred diverse
                    forms. Nevertheless, however great the number, all the forms, in the case of
                    each mineral, may be reduced or referred to a single type, by the simple process
                    of examining its internal structure or the mode of arrangement of its molecules.
                    This is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n364/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0364-0347"/> accomplished in two ways—(l)by finding the weak
                    joints in that arrangement, through splitting the crystal, and (2) by measuring
                    the angular inclination of the outside surfaces which bound the form and, from
                    these measurements, by simple mathematical laws, arriving at what has been
                    termed its “primitive” or simplest form.</p>
                <p>As regards the mere recognition of a substance, such measurement in itself
                    suffices,—the angular inclination, if the same surfaces be measured, being
                    unvarying in each species. It can, moreover, be shown that the possible range of
                    external variety of form is governed by fixed mathematical laws, which determine
                    precisely what crystalline forms are or may be produced for each species.
                    Comparatively few of these actually occur in nature; but crystallographic laws
                    can point out the range of those which can possibly occur, can delineate them
                    even before they are found, and can in all cases show the relationship which
                    subsists between them and the simple or fundamental form from which or out of
                    which they all originate. It must be observed that in crystalline bodies the
                    internal structure—that is, the arrangement of the molecules— is as regular in
                    an outwardly shapeless mass as in the modelled crystal which presents itself as
                    a perfect whole.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Definitions of Crystals, and their Members or Parts.—</hi> A
                    crystal is a symmetrical solid, either opaque or transparent, contained within
                    surfaces which theoretically are flat, and of a perfect polish, but which are
                    actually frequently curved, striated, or pitted. These surfaces are called
                    “planes,” or “faces.” The external planes of a crystal are called its “natural
                    planes”; the flat surfaces obtained by splitting a crystal are called its
                    “cleavage planes.” The intersections of the bounding planes are called “edges,”
                    and planes are said to be similar when their corresponding edges are
                    proportional and their corresponding angles equal. Crystals bounded by equal and
                    similar faces are termed “simple forms.” The cube, bounded by six equal squares,
                    the octahedron, bounded by eight equilateral triangles, and the rhombohedron,
                    bounded by six equal rhombs, are thus simple forms. Crystals of which the faces
                    are not all equal and similar are termed compound forms, or “combinations,”
                    being regarded as produced by the union or combination of two or more simple
                    forms. Edges are termed rectangular, obtuse, or acute, according as the angle at
                    which the faces which form the edge meet is equal to, or greater or less than, a
                    right angle. Edges are similar when the planes by the intersection of which they
                    are formed are respectively equal and equally inclined to one another; otherwise
                    they are unlike or dissimilar.</p>
                <p>When a figure is bounded by only one set of planes, it is said to be “developed.”
                    When an edge is cut off by a new plane, it is said to be “replaced”; when cut
                    off by a plane which forms an equal angle with each of the original faces which
                    formed the edge, it is said to be “truncated.” When an edge is cut off by two
                    new faces equally inclined to the two original faces respectively, it is said to
                    be “bevelled.” When a solid angle is cut off by a new face which forms equal
                    angles with all the faces which went to form the solid angle, it is said to be
                    truncated.</p>
                <p>In classifying crystals and studying their properties, it is found convenient to
                    introduce certain imaginary lines called “axes.” Axes are imaginary lines
                    connecting points in the crystal which are diametrically opposite,— such as the
                    centres of opposite faces, the apices of opposite solid angles, the centres of
                    opposite edges. Different sets of axes may thus be drawn through the same
                    crystal; but there is always one set, usually of three, but in one special class
                    of crystals of four, axes, by reference to which the geometrical and physical
                    properties of a crystal can be most simply explained. These axes intersect one
                    another, either at right angles, producing “orthometric” forms, or at oblique
                    angles, producing “clinometric” forms. The axes may be all equal, or only two
                    equal, or all unequal.</p>
                <p>There is a definite conventional position in which for purposes of description a
                    crystal is always supposed to be held. With reference to this position one of
                    the axes,— that which is erect or most erect,— is termed the “vertical,” and the
                    others the “lateral.” The planes in which any two of the axes lie are called the
                    “axial” or “diametral planes,”—sometimes “sections.” By these the space around
                    the centre is divided into “sectants.” If there are, as is generally the case,
                    only two lateral axes, the space is divided into eight sectants, or octants;
                    but, if there are three lateral axes, it is divided into twelve sectants.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Primitive Forms of Crystals.—</hi> If we attempt to arrive,
                    through a study of the internal structure of crystals, as evidenced by
                    directions of weakness of cohesion, at the total number of primitive or parent
                    forms which can exist, we find that there are thirteen such forms and no
                    more.</p>
                <p>Nine of these may be regarded as prisms standing upon a base, three as octahedra
                    standing upon a solid angle; and tnere is one twelve-sided figure, or
                    dodecahedron.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Prisms.—</hi> Of the prisms eight have a four-sided base</p>
                <p>If the base is square and the prism stands erect—that is, if its sides or lateral
                    planes, as they are called, are perpendicular to the base—the form is termed a
                    “right square prism” (fig. 6). In this the four lateral planes are rectangular
                    and equal; they may be either oblong or square; in the latter case the form is
                    the “cube” (fig. δ). When the base is a rectangle instead of a square, the form
                    is a “right rectangular prism’’ (fig. 7). In each of the above three forms the
                    edges are twelve in number. In the cube all the edges are equal. In the square
                    prism the lateral edges are all equal, but are different from the four equal
                    edges of the base. In the rectangular prism, two at each base differ in length
                    from the other two, while both differ from the lateral; hence there are here
                    three sets of edges, four in each. In each of the three forms, however, the
                    solid angles are eight in number, all equal, and each enclosed by three right
                    angles.</p>
                <p>When the base is a rhombus, and the prism stands erect, the form is a “right
                    rhombic prism” (fig. 8). Two of the angles in the base being here acute and two
                    obtuse, two of the solid angles corresponding each with each must differ from
                    the others. So also must two of the lateral angles be acute and two obtuse.</p>
                <p>The four lateral faces are equal.</p>
                <p>When the base is a rhomboid, and the prism stands erect, it is only the opposite
                    lateral faces that can be equal. The form is called a “right rhomboidal prism”
                    (fig. 9).</p>
                <p>When the base is a rhombus, but the prism stands obliquely on its base, the form
                    is called an ‘ ‘ oblique rhombic prism” (fig. 10). Here the basal edges of the
                    lateral planes are all equal in length, but on account of the inclination of the
                    prism the angles which these edges form with the lateral edges of the lateral
                    planes are two acute and two obtuse.</p>
                <p>If all the edges of an oblique rhombic prism are equal in length to the breadth
                    of the base, and if the lateral planes are rhombi equal in all respects to the
                    basal, the form is called a“rhombohedron” (fig. 11). This is included within six
                    equal planes, like <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n365/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0365-0348"/> the cube, but these planes have oblique angles.
                    The rhombohedron thus bears the same relation to the oblique rhombic prism which
                    the cube does to the right square prism. Of the eight solid angles of a
                    rhombohedron only two are contained by three equal plane angles, and these two
                    “apices,” as they may be called, are opposite one another. According as the
                    apices are acute or obtuse, we have an acute or obtuse rhombohedron.</p>
                <p>When the base of an oblique prism is a rhomboid, the prism becomes an “oblique
                    rhomboidal prism” (fig. 12). In this form, only diagonally opposite edges are
                    similar, as regards equality of length and the value of the included angle. Only
                    opposite solid angles are equal, as are also the opposite and parallel
                    faces.</p>
                <p>A right prism may have an equilateral six-sided base; it is then called an
                    “hexagonal prism.” This form may be developed in two positions relatively to
                    each other, —one in which the transverse axes pass from the centres of opposite
                    faces (fig. 13), the other in which they pass from the centres of opposite edges
                    of the planes (fig. 14). The faces of the one set mutually truncate the edges of
                    the other. If a rhombohedron be positioned so as to rest upon one of its apices,
                    the faces of one hexagonal prism would truncate the lateral <hi rend="italic"
                    >edges of</hi> the rhombohedron, while the faces of the other hexagonal prism
                    would truncate its lateral <hi rend="italic">solid angles.</hi> Hexagonal prisms
                    may be longer or shorter than the width of their bases. The interfacial lateral
                    angles are 120°. The angle between the lateral and terminal faces is 90°.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Octdhedra.—</hi> The planes of these eight-faced solids are
                    triangular, and they may be regarded as made up of two four-sided pyramids
                    applied to each other, base to base. They are always positioned so that they
                    stand upon a solid angle with the “basal plane ”—that is, the plane which is the
                    common base of the two pyramids—horizontal. In the primitive forms now under
                    consideration the vertices of the two pyramids will in this position be
                    vertically above and below the centre of the base. The upper and lower solid
                    angles are then termed the “vertical solid angles,” and the four lateral solid
                    angles are called the basal solid angles.</p>
                <p>There are three octahedrons. In the “regular” octahedron (fig. 15) the base is a
                    square, and the eight faces are equilateral triangles of equal size. There are
                    twelve edges, which are all equal. The faces incline to each other at an angle
                    of 109° 28' 16", and have the plane angles all 60°. There are six equal solid
                    angles. When the base of the octahedron is square, but the other edges, although
                    equal to one another, are either longer or shorter than the edges of the base,
                    the form is a “right square octahedron” (fig. 16). In this the faces are
                    isosceles triangles, the equal angles being at the basal edge of the planes.
                    These basal edges are equal and similar, but differ in length and in angles from
                    the eight equal pyramidal edges. When the base of an octahedron is a rhombus, it
                    is called a “right rhombic octahedron” (fig. 17).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dodecahedron.—</hi> This (fig. 18) has each of its twelve faces
                    a rhombus. It is, like the cube and the octahedron, a solid which is
                    symmetrical. The interfacial angles are all 120°, the plane angles are 109° 28'
                    16" and 70° 31' 44". The edges are twenty-four, and similar. There are fourteen
                    solid angles, of which six are formed each by the meeting of four acute plane
                    angles, and eight by the meeting of three obtuse plane angles.</p>
                <p>It has been said that the above simple forms were arrived at through a study of
                    the internal structure of crystals, chiefly as disclosed by cleavage. Inasmuch,
                    however, as there are some minerals which cleave in only one direction, and many
                    which cannot be cleaved in any direction, this method of investigation fails.
                    Its employment, moreover, frequently led to conflicting or embarrassing results.
                    A conflicting result is when a substance has more than one set of
                    cleavages,—that is, splits up in directions which would result in the production
                    of more than one of the above primary or simple forms. Thus the mineral fluorite
                    occurs with much the greatest frequency in the form of the cube, and it might
                    very consistently be held that its frequent occurrence in this form was a clear
                    natural indication that the cube was the primary or simplest form of fluorite;
                    but it splits up into an octahedron. Galena crystallizes frequently in the form
                    of the octahedron; yet to cleavage galena yields a cubic primary form. It might
                    be conceived that there had been, in each case, some special tendency to assume
                    the cubic form and the octahedral form; but one and the same piece of rock may
                    bear on its surface cubic crystals of fluor and octahedral crystals of galena, —
                    each of the minerals having here assumed the primitive cleavage form of the
                    other in preference to its own. The mineral blende crystallizes not unfrequently
                    in octahedra, which yield the dodecahedron on cleavage. Fluor crystallizes in
                    dodecahedra, yet yields the octahedron to cleavage. Argyrite crystallizes in
                    cubes and in octahedra, but yields the dodecahedron on cleavage. Pyrite
                    crystallizes in cubes, octahedra, and dodecahedra, and yields both the cube and
                    the octahedron on cleavage.</p>
                <p>These are most embarrassing results, but they clearly indicate so intimate a
                    relationship to subsist between three of the above simple forms that it is
                    obvious that one alone would serve as a type form for representing the others.
                    The selection of that one should be based upon grounds of most eminent
                    simplicity, and this again is to be arrived at by a consideration of the
                    smallness of number of parts, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of faces, edges, and
                    solid angles. In such a consideration we find that the dodecahedron, with its
                    higher number of each of these, at once gives place. The cube has six faces, the
                    octahedron eight; simplicity here is in favour of the cube. The cube has twelve
                    edges, the octahedron has twelve; in this respect they are equal. The cube has
                    eight solid angles, the octahedron six; here the greater simplicity is on the
                    side of the octahedron. So that this method of adjudicating by simplicity fails,
                    and we are thrown back upon the relationships which may be unfolded through a
                    consideration of the other elements of crystals,— their axes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Systems of Crystals and Laws of Crystallization.</hi></p>
                <p>This consideration led, first, to the remarkable discovery that several of the
                    above primary forms are mere modifications of each other, and ultimately showed
                    that all crystals found in nature may be referred to six systems, based on
                    certain relations of their axes, and that every face which could occur upon a
                    crystal bears a definite and simple relation, in position and in angular
                    inclination, to these axes.</p>
                <p>As regards mere geometric measurement, there are several directions in which axes
                    may with nearly equal advantage be projected. For example, in the cube (fig. 19)
                    they may be drawn from the centres of opposite faces, as lettered O; or from
                    opposite solid angles, as lettered C; or from the centres of opposite edges, as
                    lettered D. There is abundance of evidence that each of these directions must be
                    regarded as lines of dominant accretion of molecules.</p>
                <p>But the accretion may be not only dominant but overwhelmingly so in one only of
                    these directions in certain cases, or existent along one set of axes alone in
                    certain others. In a specimen of native silver from Alva in Scotland (fig. 20),
                    along O this is so much the case that the concreting molecules have done little
                    more than delineate the form of an octahedron, and this they have only been able
                    to do by <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n366/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0366-0349"/> aggregating themselves in lines of minute
                    crystals of the very shape of which they were projecting the skeleton form.
                    Moreover, a polar aggregation at the terminal ends of these octahedral axes is
                    here shown by the amount of concreting and crystallizing material being larger
                    at the terminations of these axes than elsewhere. In the hollow-faced cube again
                    (fig. 21), an aggregation of molecules in the direction of the lines D and C has
                    filled the edges and solid angles, while none have been deposited along 0.</p>
                <p>This occurs in crystals of salt. In the hollow-faced octahedron, again (fig. 22),
                    there has been no deposition of matter along the line C. Cuprite often shows
                    this form; and it as frequently occurs in hollow-faced dodecahedra, wherein the
                    vacuity is in the direction of D.</p>
                <p>In the specimen of pyrite from Elba (fig. 23), a deposition along D and C would
                    ultimately have erected the scaffolding of a hollθλv cube, in twelve lines of
                    minute combinations of the cube and octahedron. Such directional arrangements
                    may, moreover, not only be intermittent but often alternate. The pyrite from
                    Traversella (fig. 24) is an illustration of the first. A large pentagonal
                    dodecahedron having been completed, a new accession of material has been
                    attached, not uniformly spread over the pre-existent crystal, to enlarge it, but
                    locally arranged, in equal amount, at the poles of 0. But here the special
                    method of the arrangement has determined the formation of a number of small
                    crystals of the same form as that originally projected.</p>
                <p>An alternation, as it were, in plan is shown in such a crystal of calcite as that
                    in fig. 25. Here a scalenohedron is seen in the centre of the figure; then a
                    rhombohedron has been perched upon its summit, and lastly both have been
                    sheathed in a six-sided prism with trihedral summits. Different as these three
                    forms are, it is found that they all here stand in a definite position one to
                    the other; that definite position is the relation which they bear to one of the
                    sets of axes, and this set may be assigned, not only to all the three crystals
                    here combined, but also to all the crystals belonging to the same mineral,
                    wherever occurring. This general applicability constitutes one of the respects
                    in which one special set of axes is, in each of the systems, preferred to the
                    others.</p>
                <p>Another respect is the intensity with which the molecules cohere in the different
                    parts of the crystal, as refeιτed to these axes, and the resultant different
                    hardness of certain parts of crystals. It will be afterwards found that this
                    obtains in a very limited manner in the crystals which belong to the first of
                    the following systems, on account of its regularity and sameness as a whole. It
                    may be laid down as a general rule that the edges of crystals are harder than
                    the centres of their faces, and the solid angles harder than the edges. This is
                    markedly the case in the diamond. But, apart from this, there is no distinctive
                    hardness in any one part, side, or end of the crystals of the first system. It
                    is otherwise with the crystals which fall to be considered in all the other
                    systems. So different is the hardness of the various portions of these, so
                    diverse the appearance of their parts in lustre, colour, polish, &amp;c., so
                    varying the amount of the recoil of these when struck, so unequal their power of
                    conducting heat, so dissimilar their power of resisting the agencies of decay,
                    and so irreconcilable their action upon transmitted light, that we cannot but
                    conclude that the molecules which build them up are packed with greater force,
                    if not in greater number, in certain directions in preference to others. There
                    thus remains no question that these nature-indicated sets of axes are those
                    along which there has been a specially selective or “polar” arrangement.</p>
                <p>The six systems are founded upon the relationships of the axes in number, in
                    length, and in angular inclination. All crystals may be divided into
                    “orthometric” or erect forms and “clinometric” or inclined forms; and in similar
                    manner may the systems be, through a consideration of the relative lengths of
                    their axes, divided into three classes. In the first, or most regular, of these
                    the axes are all equal, that is, they are of one length; in the second there is
                    one axis which differs in length from the others, and therefore they are of two
                    lengths; while in the third the axes are all unequal, and therefore they are of
                    three lengths. Of the six systems one belongs to the first class, two to the
                    second, and three to the third. Hence they are thus classed :—</p>

                <p>Though the grouping of the systems into three classes in virtue of axial
                    dimensions is markedly borne out by optical and other properties, yet it is
                    altogether insufficient for determining the relationships of the myriad forms in
                    which bodies crystallize. Such knowledge is only attained by combining the
                    consideration of axial length with axial inclination; and it is through a due
                    regard of both of these that the six systems are instituted.</p>
                <p>The above table may be read in two different ways,— either across or
                    consecutively up and down the page. The six systems may be treated of in either
                    of these ways; <pb break="no"

                    them at least first by the former method.</p>
                <p>We consider first, as the more essential, the relative lengths of the axes, and,
                    secondly, the angular inclination of these.</p>
                <p>1. In the cubic system the axes are all equal, and all intersect at right angles.
                    Here is the most perfect simplicity, and the most perfect regularity.</p>
                <p>2. In the tetragonal system two only of the axes are equal; but all still
                    intersect at right angles. Here is a departure from simplicity as regards the
                    length of one axis, but no departure as regards the angular inclination.</p>
                <p>3. In the right prismatic system none of the axes are equal, but all still
                    intersect at right angles. Here is total loss of regularity in the first
                    particular, but still none in the second.</p>
                <p>4. In the oblique prismatic system none of the axes are equal, and only two
                    intersect at right angles. Here there is again a total loss of simplicity in the
                    first particular, and a certain amount of departure from it in the second.</p>
                <p>5. In the anorthic system none of the axes are equal, and none of them intersect
                    at right angles,—so that here, as expressed by the name, there is a total
                    departure from regularity in both particulars.</p>
                <p>6. The hexagonal system is anomalous in relation to this mode of consideration.
                    It is regarded as having four axes, three of which lie in one plane, parallel to
                    the base, and intersect each other at equal angles</p>
                <p>(necessarily angles of 60°). The fourth axis intersects these at right angles,
                    and may be longer, shorter, or equal to them. This system is generally
                    considered after the tetragonal system, as having one axis which differs in
                    length from the others, and only one which cuts the others at right angles. By
                    some a rhombohedron is considered as the primary of this system; it then comes
                    to have three axes, all equal, but none intersecting at right angles.</p>
                <p>In considering these systems, or in describing the form of a crystal, the
                    vertical or erect axis is named the principal axis of the figure, and that axis
                    is chosen as the vertical which is the only one of its kind. In the cubic system
                    there is no such axis, so <hi rend="subscript"> w</hi> that any one may be
                    chosen as the vertical.</p>
                <p>It will be convenient, before proceeding to the consideration of the laws of
                    crystallography and the combinations of forms,—especially in view of the
                    terminology that must be employed in illustrating those general aspects of the
                    subject,—to give an outline of one of the six systems here. For this preliminary
                    description the cubic system, as the simplest and most regular, naturally
                    suggests itself as the most suitable.</p>
                <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The, Cubic System.—</hi> Here the axes are all equal, and
                    all intersect at right angles. The “cube” (fig. 26), “octahedron” (fig. 30), and
                    “rhombic dodecahedron” (fig. 33), which are here included, are alike in their
                    perfect symmetry; the height, length, and breadth are equal; and their axes are
                    equal, and are rectangular in their intersections.</p>
                <p>In the cube (fig. 5) these axes connect the centres of opposite faces; in the
                    octahedron (fig. 15) the apices of opposite solid angles; in the dodecahedron
                    (fig. 18) the apices of opposite acute solid angles. The relation of these forms
                    to each other, and the correspondence in their axes, will be made manifest
                    through a consideration of the transition between the forms. If a cube be
                    projected with the axes in the above position, or if a model of it in any
                    sectile material be employed, and if the eight angles are sliced off evenly,
                    keeping the planes thus formed equally inclined to the original faces, we first
                    obtain the form in fig. 27, then that in fig. 28 and fig. 29, and finally a
                    regular octahedron (fig. 30); and the last disappearing point of each face of
                    the cube is the apex of each solid angle of the octahedron. Hence the axes of
                    the former, being in no way displaced, necessarily connect the apices of the
                    solid angles of the latter. By cutting off as evenly the twelve edges of another
                    cube, the knife being equally inclined to the faces, we have the form in fig.
                    31, then fig. 32, and finally the rhombic dodecahedron (fig. 33), tvith the axes
                    of the cube connecting the acute angles of the new form. These forms are thus
                    mutually derivable. Moreover, they are often presented by the same mineral
                    species, as is exemplified in galena, pyrites, and the diamond.</p>
                <p>The process may be reversed, and the cube made from the octahedron, as will be
                    readily understood from a comparison, in reverse order, of figs. 26 to 30. Or
                    the cube may be similarly derived from the dodecahedron, as seen by inspecting
                    figs. 33, 32, 31, 26.</p>
                <p>The octahedron also is <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> changed to a rhombic
                    dodecahedron by removing its twelve edges (figs. 34, 35), and continuing the
                    removal till the original faces are obliterated, thus producing the
                    dodecahedron.</p>
                <p>It will be observed that throughout all these changes the position of the axes,
                    as determinants of dimensions, need not be altered,—that, in fact, one set of
                    axes has served for all the forms.</p>
                <p>The relationships of the principal forms of this system being thus disclosed, the
                    forms themselves have next to be considered.</p>

                <p>The cube (fig. 26) is bounded by six equal squares, has twelve edges formed by
                    faces meeting at 90°, and eight solid trigonal angles. The axes are taken as
                    joining the centres of each two opposite faces. Examples are hallite, galena,
                    and fluor.</p>
                <p>The octahedron (fig. 30), bounded by eight equilateral triangles, has twelve
                    equal edges with planes meeting at 109° 28' 16", and six tetragonal angles. The
                    principal axes join the opposite solid angles. Examples: magnetite, gold,
                    cuprite.</p>
                <p>The rhombic dodecahedron (fig. 33) is bounded by twelve equal and similar rhombi,
                    has twenty-four equal edges oi 120°, and has six tetragonal and eight trigonal
                    angles. Each of the principal axes joins two opposite tetragonal angles.
                    Examples: garnet, cuprite, blende.</p>
                <p>The tetrakishexahedrons (figs. 36, 37, 38, varieties of icositetrahedron) are
                    bounded by twenty-four isosceles triangles, placed so as to form four-sided
                    pyramids on the faces of the cube, arranged in six groups of four each. They
                    have twelve longer edges, which correspond to those of the primitive or
                    inscribed cube, and twenty-four shorter edges placed over each of its faces. The
                    angles are eight hexagonal and six tetragonal, the latter joined two and two by
                    the principal axes. Examples: fluorite, gold. This form varies much in general
                    aspect. The four-sided pyramid which rests on the edges of each face of the cube
                    may be so low as almost to fall into it (fig. 36); or it may rise so high that
                    each side forms a level surface with that which is adjacent to it upon the
                    nearest cubic face (fig. 38). In the latter case the form has become the rhombic
                    dodecahedron; so that the more or less acute varieties of the form are but
                    stages of a passage of the cube into the latter figure, through an increasing
                    accretion of matter in the lines of the axes of the cube. This is termed a
                    “transition by increment.”</p>
                <p>The triakisoctahedrons, fig. 39 (variety of icositetrahedron, fig. 40), are
                    bounded by twenty-four isosceles triangles, in eight groups of three, arranged
                    as pyramids on the edges of the faces of the octahedron. Like the previous form
                    they vary in general aspect, the variation here being from the octahedron on one
                    side to the rhombic dodecahedron on the other; while the increased accretion
                    here is in the direction of lines joining the centres of the faces of the
                    octahedron or the solid angles of the cube. The passage of the forms is similar
                    to that illustrated in the last-considered form. The edges are twelve longer,
                    corresponding with those of the inscribed octahedron, and twenty-four shorter,
                    three and three over each of the faces. The angles are eight trigonal and six
                    ditetragonal (formed by eight faces), the latter angles joined two and two by
                    the principal axes. Examples: galena, diamond.</p>
                <p>The icositetrahedrons (fig. 40) are bounded by twenty-four deltoids. This form
                    varies from the octahedron to the cube, sometimes approaching the former and
                    sometimes the latter in general aspect. A four-sided pyramid rests on the angles
                    of the faces of the cube. When increased accretion takes place along the cubic
                    axes, an octahedron results. When it is along lines joining the solid angles of
                    the cube, that form itself results. The edges are twenty-four longer and
                    twenty-four shorter. The solid angles are six tetragonal joined by the principal
                    axes, eight trigonal, and twelve rhombic or tetragonal with unequal angles.
                    Examples: analcime, garnet.</p>
                <p>The hexakisoctahedrons (fig. 41), bounded by forty-eight scalene triangles, vary
                    much in general aspect, approaching more or less to all the preceding forms,
                    into all of which they may pass; but most frequently they have the faces
                    arranged either in six groups of eight on the faces of the cube, or eight of six
                    on the faces of the octahedron, or twelve of four on the faces of the
                    dodecahedron. There are twenty-four long edges, often corresponding to those of
                    the rhombic dodecahedron or bisecting the long diagonal of the trapezohedron,
                    twenty-four intermediate edges lying in pairs over each edge of the inscribed
                    octahedron, and twenty-four short edges in pairs over the edges of the inscribed
                    cube. There are six ditetragonal angles joined by the principal axes, eight
                    hexagonal, and twelve rhombic angles. Examples: diamond, fluorite.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">General Laws of Crystallography.—</hi> The seven forms of
                    crystals now described are related to each other in the most intimate manner.
                    This will appear more distinctly from the account which is to follow of the mode
                    of derivation of the forms, with which is conjoined an explanation of the
                    crystallographic signs or symbols by which they are designated. These symbols
                    were introduced by Naumann, in the belief that they not only mark the forms in a
                    greatly abbreviated manner, but also exhibit the relations of the forms and
                    combinations in a way which words could hardly accomplish. In order to follow
                    out this <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n369/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0369-0352"/> derivation of forms, it is necessary to state
                    briefly the following laws, which have been established in crystallography. It
                    is to be remembered that these laws apply, not merely to the cubic system just
                    described, but to all the systems.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Law of the Invariability of the Angles of Crystals,</hi>
                    which was established by Romé de 1’Isle, may be thus stated :—the angles of
                    inclination of the faces of a crystal are constant, however unequally the faces
                    may be developed. The corresponding angles of different crystalline specimens of
                    the same body do not, however, always absolutely agree. Differences have been
                    found, amounting sometimes even to 10'.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">The Law of Symmetry,</hi> discovered by Haiiy, may be thus
                    expressed :—(1) similar parts of crystals—faces, edges, angles, and consequently
                    axes—are all modified in the same manner, and dissimilar parts are modified
                    separately or differently; (2) the modifications produce the same effect on the
                    faces or edges which form the modified part, when they are equal; when they are
                    not equal, they produce a different effect. That is, if an edge be truncated or
                    bevelled, every similar edge will be similarly truncated or bevelled; if an
                    angle be truncated or acuminated, every similar angle will be similarly
                    truncated or acuminated; and consequently every similar axis will be equally
                    affected by the modifications. Thus the cube has eight similar angles and twelve
                    similar edges. In the physical production of the cube, if one of the angles or
                    edges be modified, all will be similarly modified. This, which is the most
                    important law of crystallography, is, however, subject to an exception which was
                    fully formulated by Weiss. The law was—all the similar parts of crystals, faces,
                    edges, angles, and consequently axes, are modified at the same time and in the
                    same manner; the forms resulting from this law are termed “holohedral.” The
                    exception is that half of them or one-fourth of them only may be similarly
                    modified. When only half of the similar parts are modified, we get the
                    “hemihedral” forms; when one-fourth only are modified, which occurs only rarely,
                    we get “tetartohedral” forms.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Law of the Parallelism of the Faces of a Crystal,</hi>
                    discovered by Romé de 1’Isle, may be expressed as follows :—every face of a
                    crystal has a similar face parallel to it; or every figure is bounded by pairs
                    of parallel faces (with the exception of certain hemihedral forms).</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Law of Zones,</hi> first established by Weiss, may be
                    thus enunciated :—the lines in which several faces of a crystal intersect each
                    other (or would do so if they were produced until they met) frequently form a
                    system of parallels. Such a series of faces is termed a “zone.” Sometimes the
                    zones are parallel to one of the symmetrical axes. Thus, in every prism, the
                    -faces of the prism constitute a zone which encircles the axis of the prism.
                    Faces may be in a zone although they do not actually intersect on the form.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">The Law of the Rationality of the Parameters</hi> of the
                    faces of crystalline series, first indicated by Malus, is that the position of
                    planes may be assigned by numbers bearing some simple ratio to the relative
                    lengths of the axes of the crystal. This law was the outcome of investigations
                    into the relationship of forms glanced at in commencing the consideration of the
                    cubic system, and was arrived at through the study of the mode of derivation of
                    forms.</p>
                <p>The derivation of forms is that process hy which, from one form chosen for the
                    purpose, and considered as the type,—the fundamental or primary form,—all the
                    other forms of a system may be produced, according to fixed principles or
                    general laws. In order to understand this process or method of derivation, it
                    must be noted that the position of any plane is fixed when the position of any
                    three points in it, not all in one straight line, is known. To determine the
                    position, therefore, of the face of a crystal, it is only necessary to know the
                    distance of three points in it from the centre of the crystal, which is the
                    point in which the axes intersect each other. As the planes of all crystals are
                    referred to their axes, the points in which the face (or its supposed extension)
                    meets the three axes of the crystal are chosen, and the portions of the axes
                    between these points and the centre are named parameters of the face; and the
                    position of the face is sufficiently known when the relative length or
                    proportion of these parameters is ascertained. When the position of one face of
                    a simple form is thus fixed or described, all the other faces of the form are in
                    like manner fixed in accordance with law 2, since they are all equal and
                    similar, and have equal parameters—that is, intersect the axis in the same
                    proportions. Hence the expression which marks or describes one face marks and
                    describes the whole figure, with all its faces.</p>
                <p>The octahedron is adopted as the primary or fundamental form of the cubic system,
                    and distinguished by the first letter of the name, 0. Its faces cut the
                    half-axes at equal distances from the centre; so that these semiaxes, the
                    parameters of the faces, have to each other the proportion 1:1:1. In order to
                    derive the other forms from the octahedron, the following construction is
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Suppose a plane to be laid down perpendicular to one axis, and consequently
                    parallel to the two other axes (or to cut them at an infinite distance,
                    expressed by ∞, the sign of infinity); then the hexahedron or cube is produced,
                    designated by the crystallographic sign ooO∞,—expressing the proportion of the
                    parameters of its faces, or oo: 1: ∞. If a plane is supposed placed on each
                    edge, parallel to one axis, and cutting the two other axes at equal distances,
                    the resulting figure is the rhombic dodecahedron, designated by the sign ooθ,
                    the proportion of the parameters of its faces being oo: 1: 1. The
                    triakisoctahedron arises when, on each edge of the octahedron, planes are placed
                    cutting the axis not belonging to that edge at a distance from the centre <hi
                    rend="italic">m,</hi> which is a rational number greater than 1. The proportion
                    of its parameters is therefore <hi rend="italic">m:l</hi>: 1, and its sign <hi
                    rend="italic">mθ</hi>; the most common varieties are ⅞0, 20, and 30, seen in
                    diamond and fluorite. When, on the other hand, from a similar distance <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> in each two semiaxes prolonged a plane is drawn to the
                    other semiaxis, or to each angle, an icositetrahedron is formed; the parameters
                    of its faces have consequently the proportion <hi rend="italic">m: m</hi>: 1,
                    and its sign is <hi rend="italic">mθm</hi>; the most common varieties are 202
                    and 303,—the former very frequent in leucite, analcime, and garnet, the latter
                    in gold and amalgam. When, again, planes are drawn from each angle, or the end
                    of one semiaxis of the octahedron, parallel to a second axis, and cutting the
                    third at a distance <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> greater thanl, then the
                    tetrakishexahedron is formed; the parameter of its faces is ∞: <hi rend="italic"
                    >n:</hi> 1; its sign is ooOn; and the most common varieties in nature are ∞0f,
                    ∞02, and oo03. Finally, if in each semiaxis of the octahedron two distances <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be taken, each greater than 1,
                    and <hi rend="italic">m</hi> also greater than <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and
                    planes be drawn from each angle to these points, so that the two planes lying
                    over each edge cut the second semiaxis belonging to that edge at the smaller
                    distance <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and the third axis at the greater distance
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> then the hexakisoctahedron is produced; the parameters
                    are <hi rend="italic">m</hi><hi rend="italic">: n</hi>: 1, its sign <hi
                    rend="italic">mθn,</hi> and the most common varieties 30⅜, 402, and 50∣, seen in
                    diamond and fluorite.</p>
                <p>It must be observed that the numbers in the above signs refer to the parameters
                    of the faces,—not to the axes of the crystal, which are always equal. One
                    parameter also has always been, in the above, assumed =1, and then, either one
                    only of the two other parameters, marked by the number before 0, or both of
                    them, marked by the numbers before and after 0, have been changed.</p>
                <p>In the above consideration of the mode of derivation of these forms actually
                    found in nature, which belong to the cubic system, it will be observed (though
                    the illustrations were limited) that the value of <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> in these indicated, by the precision of the proportions
                    ⅞, 2, or 3, a definite numerical relationship. This at once led up to the
                    extended observations which established the law above stated of proportionality
                    in the modification of crystals, or the rationality of the parameters, which
                    gives a mathematical basis to the science, adding to symmetry of arrangement a
                    numerical relation in the position of the planes.</p>
                <p>To illustrate this in a general form (and not merely with special reference to
                    the mode of notation or expression of Naumann, which is that adopted in the
                    subsequent descriptions), let A0A', BOB', COC' (fig. 42) be the three axes of a
                    crystal, drawn in perspective, and cutting one another in the centre 0. The
                    semiaxes OA, OB, 00 are three parameters. Now in the line OA take 0α <hi

                    as many points as may be necessary between OA, <hi rend="italic">rational
                    fractions</hi> of OA. Subdivide OB and OC in a similar manner. Further produce
                    OA, OB, OC to Ao, Bo, Co, in each direction to an infinite distance, or to a
                    supposed infinite distance, as expressed by the arrow-head; and suppose these
                    extended axes to be divided in a manner similar to the subdivisions of the
                    parameters, by rational multiples of OA, OB, and OC. <hi rend="italic">All the
                    planes of a crystal will be parallel to one or other of the planes which pass

                <p>First, in order to apprehend the relationship of faces to these axes, or to the

                    the three parameters OA, OB, OC at their extremities A, B, C, which it must be
                    remembered are points equidistant from the centre; or let it be supposed that a
                    glass plate rests upon three intersecting wires at such points. It is evident
                    that such a plane or plate will have a definite inclination or slope. Suppose
                    further a second plane or plate to exist, which cuts the three semiaxes in the
                    points α <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, ⅛ ⅜ which have been measured off (along
                    with α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic

                    equidistant from O. It will be evident that such a plane, though smaller, will
                    be parallel to the first, seeing that, like it, it cuts the three parameters at
                    equal distances from 0.</p>
                <p>A little consideration will show that, whatever the absolute distances from the
                    centre may be, so long as the supporting subdivisions are equal, no new slope of
                    the glass plates or planes is possible; planes so situated must be parallel and
                    similar. Any sign which may be adopted to express the slope of one of such
                    planes must be applicable to all. A plane, however, cutting the points α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, ft <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, c <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> will have quite a different slope.</p>
                <p>Let us now suppose a plane to cut a different set of the semiaxes, namely, 0A',
                    OB', 0C', in the points -α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >-b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">, -c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> Such a plane would be
                    parallel to one cutting the points - α <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, - <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">,
                    -</hi> c <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, and also to the set of planes first
                    described, but on the opposite side of the centre of the crystal. If again,
                    however, we had a plane cutting the semiaxes 0A' and OB' in - α <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, - δ <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, but the semiaxis 00'
                    in the point - c <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, it is clear that the slope of
                    this plane would be quite different from that of the planes just described, but
                    it would be parallel to the plane cutting the points <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">, b</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">, c</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi> This slope, like the other, evidently depends,
                    not on the absolute lengths of the portions of 0A', OB', 0C <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> cut off, but upon their proportions or ratios; and
                    such is the case with all the planes which are referred to the same axes.</p>
                <p>As there are three axes, and each or all of them may be cut at any points and at
                    any ratios, it is evident that the number of planes which is possible is
                    infinite; and it must be also evident that the inclinations of all are fixed or
                    determinate if we know the ratios. While, however, the possible number of planes
                    is infinite, the actual number occurring among minerals is either small or
                    moderate, in virtue of the fact that the ratios of subdivision of the axes are
                    always simple, and not numerous.</p>
                <p>Naumann’s symbols for the notation or individualizing of planes have been glanced
                    at. A simpler method is that of employing as indices the denominators (if simple
                    fractions) of the fractional parts of the axis cut. Thus 111 is used for any
                    plane parallel to that cutting the axes in <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="italic">, b</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> x</hi><hi rend="italic">, c</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> x</hi>;
                    122 for those parallel to α <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">, c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi>; 313 for <hi rend="italic">a</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> 3</hi><hi rend="italic">, b</hi><hi rend="italic

                    subscript"> 3</hi>; and so on.</p>
                <p>When any of the points referred to have negative signs, the corresponding indices
                    have negative signs placed over them. Thus 122 is the index for a plane parallel
                    to <hi rend="italic">a'</hi><hi rend="italic                 subscript">

                    rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 2</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>
                    103 is the index of the plane α' <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, <hi rend="italic"

                    here indicates infinity; that is, the plane never would cut the axis B however
                    far it were extended; in other words, it is parallel to it. The necessity for
                    elongating the axes is brought about by the occurrence of highly acuminating
                    planes, which in many cases would not meet the axes at all unless these were
                    prolonged.</p>
                <p>If the axes are unequal, as in the trimetric forms, then the ratio is of the same
                    character, except that the relative lengths of the axes come into consideration;
                    but here, as in the regular system, irrational values cannot occur, and in even
                    the most complex crystals they seldom exceed seven, either as aliquot parts or
                    multiples.</p>
                <p>It will thus be seen that in crystals there is no haphazard scattering of faces,
                    but a complete subserviency to law, a law which may be said to be the linear
                    equivalent to the law of multiple proportions by weight, and Gay Lussac’s law of
                    multiple proportions in combination by volume.</p>
                <p>In abbreviation of all the systematic modes of notation, letters of the Latin and
                    Greek alphabets are frequently employed in a more or less arbitrary manner,
                    and·with advantage in the case of highly complex forms.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The. Law of Symmetry of Crystalline Combination</hi> is the
                    consequence of the law of symmetry and the law of the rationality of the
                    parameters, and has been partially stated in enunciating these laws. It is thus
                    expressed ·</p>
                <p>(1) a substance can only crystallize in forms, whether simple or compound, which
                    have the same relative symmetry, that is, belong to the same crystalline system,
                    and the parameters of the faces of which bear a simple relation to each other,
                    that is, belong to the same axis; (2) a form cannot be modified by faces
                    belonging to a different system, or a different series.</p>
                <p>Certain exceptions to the first part of this law occur. The element carbon occurs
                    as the diamond, which is cubic, and as graphite, which is hexagonal. Sulphur
                    occurs near volcanoes in needle crystals belonging to the oblique prismatic
                    system, and also in caves (deposited apparently from solution) in crystals
                    belonging to the right prismatic system. Titanic acid is tetragonal in rutile,
                    and right prismatic in brookite. Carbonate of lime is hexagonal in calcite, and
                    prismatic in aragonite. These are probably only apparent exceptions. The
                    elementary substances which go to form them occur in different allotropic
                    states, with different amounts of specific heat; and it is probable that in
                    these different states they go to form the above modifications, which are
                    therefore, in every respect, except in their chemical composition, different
                    mineral bodies. The physical differences between diamond and graphite may
                    suffice as an illustration. The diamond is transparent, colourless, brittle, and
                    extremely hard; graphite is opaque, black, tough, and so soft as to be utilized
                    as a lubricant.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Spheres of Projection.—</hi> The foregoing scheme for the
                    development of the relation which subsists between faces of crystals and their
                    axes affords but slight aid in displaying the position of the faces, or their
                    mutual relationships. The delineation even of a considerable series of crystal
                    forms does not indeed go far in effecting this,—on account, first, of very
                    unequal development in the size of the faces of crystals, and, secondly, on
                    account of the <hi rend="italic">habit</hi> of development of these faces not
                    only differing largely, but being special to certain localities,—as in the
                    entire absence of some faces, and in the preponderance of others.</p>
                <p>Maps of the whole domain occupied by the forms of each mineral have been happily
                    projected for such display. The projection is laid down as on a globe, in
                    accordance with stereographic projection, and admitting of calculation according
                    to the laws of spherical trigonometry. These globe maps are called “spheres of
                    projection.” The centre O is the common centre of the crystal and of the sphere
                    in which the axes intersect. The three axes will of course meet the
                    circumference of the sphere in six points, called the “poles of the axes.” From
                    the centre radii are supposed to be drawn, meeting each plane perpendicularly.
                    It is evident that such radü will have fixed inclinations to each other. They
                    are called “normals” to the planes, and the points in which when produced they
                    meet the circumference of the sphere of projection are called the “poles” of the
                    corresponding faces. A face and its pole thus call for only one symbol. The
                    angle included by any two normals is the supplement of that included by the two
                    corresponding faces.</p>
                <p>It is thus easy to determine the angles of any two normals when that of the
                    corresponding faces is known, or <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Thus, if the
                    angle between two faces is 125°, that of the normals will be 55°. The spheres of
                    projection are specially adapted to enable us to avail ourselves of the aid to
                    calculation afforded by the forenoted fact that sets of faces lie parallel to
                    each other, forming zones; for, when &lt; projected on such a sphere, the
                    normals of the parallel faces will all lie in one plane; and the poles, all
                    cutting its surface in the direction of one line, may be connected, and so form
                    a great circle on the sphere. This is called the “zone circle.” A line drawn
                    through the cen⅛e of the <pb break="no"

                    “zone axis”; it is parallel to all the faces, and intersections of the faces (if
                    they are extended enough to intersect), of the zone. A face may be common to two
                    or more zones; its normals will then coincide with the intersections of the
                    several zone planes.</p>
                <p>In the absence of actual spheres upon which to detail the facts which go to form
                    the “sphere of projection” of each substance, the hemisphere is represented on a
                    plane surface. This has of necessity the disadvantage, except as regards the
                    circumferential zone, of introducing spherical distancedistortion—foreshortening
                    of all parts lying near the circumference; but the eye soon gets accustomed to
                    this. Fig. 43 presents the principal zones of the cubic system, and shows the
                    position of the poles of the faces of the cube, the octahedron, and the rhombic
                    dodecahedron, o <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>, o <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>, o

                    those of the rhombic dodecahedron. It will be observed that the faces of the
                    cube fall into the zone circles of the octahedron and dodecahedron, while those
                    of the octahedron fall into those of the rhombic dodecahedron. Considering this
                    as a delineation of a globe, these zone circles come to represent latitude and
                    longitude; and, as almost all the faces in this system fall into some zone
                    circle, it is clear that the latitude and longitude of all normals may be
                    readily laid down, and their relations at once determined by spherical
                    trigonometry Fig. 44 shows the arrangement of tho poles of all the forms
                    belonging to the cubic system noticed above, or referred to in the present
                    article,—delineated on an octant of the sphere of projection. It displays the
                    perfect regularity of the system.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Hemihedral and Tetartohedral Forms.—</hi> The exception to the
                    second law (that of symmetry), which was formulated by Weiss, was to the effect
                    that one-half or even one-fourth only of the faces which go to form t:
                    holohedral crystal may be present. When but one-half of the faces present
                    themselves, the form is termed hemihedral; when only one-fourth, it is
                    tetartohedral. These restrained developments have now to be considered. In
                    hemihedral forms the development is restrained, but symmetry is not deranged;
                    half the similar parts are still alike, though unlike the other half.</p>
                <p>There are two classes of hemihedral forms :—</p>
                <p>I. Those forms in which half the similar angles or edges are modified

                <p>4. In the rhombohedral system, by the replacements of the alternate basal edges
                    or angles of the rhombohedron, forms usually called “tetartohedral” or quarter
                    forms, on the ground that mathematically the rhombohedron is a hemihedral form
                    derived from the hexagonal prism, which is the type of the hexagonal system.
                    Rock crystal is usually developed according to this law.</p>

                <p>1. In the nιonometric system “pyritohedral” forms, by a replace, ment of the
                    edges or angles; as in pyrites. Such forms have opposite faces parallel, and are
                    often called parallel hemihedrons.</p>
                <p>2. In the dimetric system “pyramidal” and “scalenoidal” forms, by a replacement
                    of the eight solid angles of the primary prism, according to two methods.</p>
                <p>3. In the hexagonal system “pyramoidal ’ ' and “gyroidal” forms, by a replacement
                    of the solid angles of the hexagonal prism, or of the six lateral angles of the
                    rhombohedron, according to two methods; as in quartz and apatite.</p>
                <p>The above illustrations show that hemihedrism is not only divided into two
                    classes, but is of various kinds, and these have been systematized as
                    follows:—“holomorphic,” in which the occurring planes pertain equally to the
                    upper and lower (or opposite) ranges of sectants, as in ordinary hemihedrons;
                    and (2) “hemimorphic,” in which each set of planes pertains to either the upper
                    or the lower range, but not to both. As to the relative position of the sectants
                    which contain the planes, the forms may be vertically direct, as in baryte;
                    vertically alternate, as in the tetrahedron, the rhombohedron, and the
                    plagihedral faces of quartz; and vertically oblique, as in many forms of
                    chondrodite.</p>
                <p>In hemimorphic forms symmetry is deranged; the crystals are bounded at the
                    opposite ends of their main axes by faces belonging to distinct formε or
                    modifications,—always, however, of the same system; hence only the upper or the
                    under half of each crystal can be regarded as complete, as regards the form
                    there seen; and so for each end it is half formed.</p>
                <p>Fig. 45 represents a crystal of tourmaline, which is bounded on the upper end by
                    the planes of the rhombohedrons R (P) and - 2R (o), and on the lower end by the
                    basal pinacoid <hi rend="italic">(k</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">).</hi> In fig. 46

                    symmetric solids, which stand in an inverse position to one another. When the
                    modifications affect the upper righthand solid angle, the resulting form is
                    called +; when the upper lefthand angle it is -.</p>

                <p>It has been found that all hemimorphic crystals become electrically polar when
                    heated, that is, exhibit opposite kinds of electricity at opposite ends of the
                    crystal. The subject will be more fully considered under the electricity of
                    minerals.</p>
                <p>The hemihedral forms of the cubic system are the following :—</p>
                <p>1. The tetrahedron (fig. 47), hemihedral of the octahedron, is bounded by four
                    equilateral triangles. It has six equal edges with faces meeting at 70° 32', and
                    four trigonal angles. The principal axes join the middle points of each two
                    opposite edges. Examples: fahlore, boracite, and helvine.</p>
                <p>2. The trigonal dodecahedrons (fig. 48), hemihedral of the icositetrahedron, are
                    bounded by twelve isosceles triangles, and vary in general form from the
                    tetrahedron to the cube. There are six longer edges corresponding to those of
                    the inscribed tetrahedron, and twelve shorter, placed three and three over each
                    of its faces, and four hexagonal and four trigonal angles. Example:
                    tetrahedrite.</p>
                <p>3. The deltoid dodecahedrons (fig. 49), hemihedral of the triakis∙ octahedron,
                    are bounded by twelve deltoids, and vary in general form from the tetrahedron on
                    the one hand to the rhombic dodecahedron on the other. They have twelve longer
                    edges lying in pairs over the edges of the inscribed tetrahedron, and twelve
                    shorter edges, three and three over each of its faces. There are six tetragonal
                    (rhombic), four acute trigonal, and four obtuse trigonal angles. The principal
                    axes join, two and two, opposite rhombic angles. Example: tetrahedrite.</p>
                <p>4. The hexakistetrahedrons (fig. 50), hemihedral of the hexakisoctahedron, are
                    bounded by twenty-four scalene triangles, and most commonly have their faces
                    grouped in four systems of six each. The edges are twelve shorter and twelve
                    longer, lying in groups of three over each face of the inscribed tetrahedron,
                    and twelve intermediate in pairs over its edges. The angles are six rhombic,
                    joined in pairs by the principal axes, and four acuter and four obtuser
                    hexagonal angles. Example: diamond.</p>
                <p>In these forms, often named “tetrahedral,” the faces are oblique to each other.
                    Their derivation and signs are as follows. The tetrahedron arises when four
                    alternate faces of the octahedron, two opposite above and two intermediate
                    below, are enlarged so as to obliterate the other four; and its sign is hence -.
                    But, as either</p>
                <p>2</p>
                <p>four faces may be thus enlarged or obliterated, two tetrahedrons can be formed,
                    similar in all respects except in position, and together making up the
                    octahedron. These are distinguished by the signs + and -, added to the above
                    symbol, but only the latter in general expressed, thus - - . In all hemihedric
                    systems two forms similarly related occur, which may thus be named complementary
                    forms. The trigonal dodecahedron is derived from the icositetrahedron by the
                    expansion of the alternate trigonal groups of faces, <hi rend="subscript">
                    τx</hi>. . τnθτn ., , ... 202</p>

                    result of the increase of the alternate trigonal groups of faces of the
                    triakisoctahedron, and its sign is . Lastly, the hexakistetrahedron arises in
                    the development of alternate hexagonal groups of faces in the
                    he∑a-kisoctahedron, and its sign is <hi rend="italic

                <p>2</p>
                <p>Two semitesseral forms with parallel faces occur. (1) The pentagonal
                    dodecahedrons (fig. 51), bounded by twelve <hi rend="italic">symmetrical</hi>
                    pentagons, vary in general aspect between the cube and the rhombic dodecahedron.
                    They have six regular (and in general longer) edges, lying over the faces of the
                    inscribed cube, and twenty-</p>
                <p>four, generally shorter (seldom longer), edges, usually lying in pairs oyer its
                    edges. The solid angles are eight of three equal interfacial angles, and twelve
                    of three interfacial angles, of which only two are equal. Each principal axis
                    unites two opposite regular edges. This form is derived from the
                    tetrakishexahedron, and its <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ⅛ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> n</hi> is —2~ · It is found frequently in iron pyrites and
                    cobaltine. (2) The dyakisdodecahedron (fig. 52), bounded by twenty-four
                    trapezoids with two sides equal, has twelve short, twelve long, and twenty-four
                    intermediate edges. The angles are six equiangular rhombic, united in pairs by
                    the principal axes, eight trigonal, and twenty-four irregular tetragonal angles.
                    It is derived from the hexakisoctahedron, and its sign is , the brackets being
                    used to distinguish it from the hexakistetrahedron, also derived from the same
                    primary form. It occurs in iron pyrites and cobaltine. The two other
                    semitesseral forms, the pentagonal dodecahedron (fig. 53), and the pentagonal
                    icositetrahedron (fig. 54), both bounded by <hi rend="italic">irregular</hi>
                    pentagons, have not yet been observed in nature.</p>

                    system (and this is true also of the five other systems of crystallization) not
                    only occur singly, but often two, three, or more occur united in the same
                    crystal, forming what are named combinations.</p>
                <p>In this case it is evident that no one of the individual forms can be complete,
                    because the faces of one form must interfere with, by diminishing, the faces of
                    other forms. A combination therefore implies that the faces of one form shall
                    appear symmetrically disposed between the faces of other forms, and consequently
                    take the place of certain of their edges and angles. These edges and angles are
                    thus, as it were, cut off, and a greater number of new ones produced in their
                    place, which properly belong neither to the one form nor the other, but are
                    angles of combination. These new faces are hence termed modifications, and the
                    original or primary or simple form is said to be modified. Usually one form
                    predominates more than the others, or has more influence on the general aspect
                    of the crystal, and hence is distinguished as the predominant form, the others
                    being considered subordinate.</p>
                <p>The sign of the combination consists of those of its constituent forms, written
                    in the order of their influence or importance in the combination, with a point
                    between each pair.</p>
                <p>It will be readily seen that such combinations may be exceedingly numerous, or
                    rather infinite; and only a few of the more common <pb break="no"

                    occur in the descriptive part of this article. Among holohedral combinations,
                    the cube, octahedron, and rhombic dodecahedron are the predominant forms. In
                    fig. 27 the cube has its angles replaced by the faces of the octahedron, which
                    truncate the angles, and the sign of this combination is 00O∞, 0. In fig. 28
                    this process may be regarded as having proceeded still farther, so that the
                    faces of the octahedron nearly equal those of the cube, while in fig. 29 they
                    now predominate; the sign, still of the same two elements, but in reverse order,
                    is 0, ooθ∞. It will thus be seen that, through an increase in the amount of the
                    abstraction of the faces of the cube, the figure gradually passes over into that
                    of the octahedron. This may occur in all cases, and is termed the passage of the
                    cube into the octahedron (or <hi rend="italic">vice versa),</hi> or a
                    “transition by decrement.”</p>
                <p>In fig. 31 the cube has its edges replaced by the faces of the rhombic
                    dodecahedron, which truncate the edges, the sign being οοΟοο,οοΟ; while in fig.
                    32 there is the same combination, nut with the faces of the cube subordinate,
                    and hence the sign is ooθ, ooθ∞. The former figure, it will be seen, has more
                    the general aspect of the cube, the latter of the dodecahedron. Here the solid
                    angles of the latter are truncated by the faces of the cube, and we have the
                    passage of the cube into the dodecahedron by decrement. The same transition,
                    through truncation or decrement, could be shown in all cases of combinations,
                    and in both directions, the last stage of the passage into one or other form
                    always consisting of the replacement of its solid or interfacial angles by faces
                    of the departing figure, more or less minute. A few illustrations of this may be
                    given, in the three most important forms.</p>
                <p>The relationship of the tetrakishexahedron to the cube has above been stated to
                    be, that its faces form six low quadrilateral pyramids, which rest upon or
                    spring from the edges of the cube. (From this the form derives its trivial name
                    of four-faced cube.) Hence these faces bevel the edges of the cube. The first
                    stage of such bevelling (or the last stage of the truncation of the
                    tetrakishexahedron by the faces of the cube—whichever way it may be regarded) is
                    seen in fig. 55. As the cubic face is here dominant, the sign is ooθ∞, ∞03. Fig.
                    56 shows a somewhat similar stage in the modification produced through the
                    combination of the icositetrahedron with the cube. The trilateral pyramid which
                    this form places upon the faces of the cube rests upon its solid angles, instead
                    of, as in the last case, upon its edges’; hence it is these solid angles which,
                    in the process of decrement, it replaces by faces which form a low three-sided
                    pyramid. The triakisoctahedron, again, modifies the solid angles of the cube, as
                    shown in fig. 57, by a low three-sided pyramid, positioned at right angles to
                    that considered in the last combination. As the hexakisoctahedron is merely the
                    two-faced form of that last considered, the pyramid which modifies the solid
                    angles is, in its combination with the βube, six-sided, as in fig. 58.</p>
                <p>As the faces of the rhombic dodecahedron truncate the edges of the octahedron,
                    fig. 34 represents the first stage of such truncation or combination; while fig.
                    35 may be taken as representing the last, the faces of the octahedron being
                    there nearly totally removed.</p>
                <p>Fig. 59 shows the first stage of the passage of the octahedron into the
                    icositetrahedron, in the truncation of the solid angles of the former form by a
                    four-sided pyra mid formed by the (6 × 4) faces of the latter. The faces of the
                    octahedron truncate the three-faced solid angles of the rhombic dodecahedron.
                    Fig. 35 shows the first stage of this truncation, while fig. 34 shows an
                    advanced amount. The faces of the icosi tetrahedron truncate the edges of the
                    rhombic dodecahedron, as in fig. 60; while those of the latter truncate the
                    unequal-angled tetragonal (or rhombic) angles of the former (fig. 61). The faces
                    of the hexakisoctahedron bevel the edges of the ι¾ombic dodecahedron.</p>
                <p>While such transitions may appear indefinite, yet certain minerals have either in
                    themselves a habit, or have at certain localities a habit, of crystallizing so
                    markedly <hi rend="italic">in a certain stage</hi> of these transitions as to be
                    absolutely capable of recognition thereby.</p>
                <p>Combinations of hemihedral or, as they have been called, semitesseral forms are
                    of three classes :—those with holohedral forms, those in which the faces fall
                    obliquely on one another, and those with parallel faces. Fig. 62 shows the
                    combination of a right-</p>
                <p>handed tetrahedron with the cube, which truncates its edges, the tetrahedron here
                    being dominant. Fig. 63, again, shows a combination of the cubo-dodecahedron
                    with a right-handed tetrahedron, the first or holohedral form being in this case
                    markedly dominant.</p>
                <p>Fig. 64 is an illustration of the second class, combinations of oblique-faced
                    semitesseral forms with each other. In it a right-handed tetrahedron has its
                    solid angles truncated by the faces of one which is left-handed; and so its sign
                    is 2- , - -2 . Fig. 65 2 2</p>

                <p>Parallel-faced hemihedrons generally form combinations with holohedral forms; and

                    while fig. 68 shows an increase in the amount of truncation effected by the
                    latter. Fig. 69 shows the combination of the cube with the dyakidodecahedron,
                    the former being dominant. In fig. 70 an octahedron, in dominance, is combined
                    with the vertical-faced pentagonal dodecahedron: in fig. 71 the faces of these
                    forms are of nearly equal size, while in fig. 72 the octahedral faces are nearly
                    removed. The solid angles of the octahedron are modified in fig. 73 by the faces
                    of the dyakisdodecahedron. In fig. 68 a vertical-faced pentagonal dodeca hedron
                    is the prevailing form in combination with the cube; while in fig. 74 the faces
                    of the octahedron are superadded. In fig. 75 its octahedral angles are modified
                    by the faces of the icositetrahedron,</p>
                <p>In each of the five systems which follow there is this difference from the cubic
                    system that one axis is always unequal to (longer or shorter than) the others.
                    This is placed erect, and named the chief axis; its ends are poles, and the
                    edges connected with them polar edges. The other axes are named subordinate or
                    lateral axes, and the plane that passes through them is the base. A plane
                    through the chief and a lateral axis is a normal chief section. In these systems
                    also occur the three forms of “pyramids,” “prisms,” and “pinacoids.” (1) The
                    pyramids have their faces triangles. Pyramids in crystallography are each
                    composed of two geometric pyramids placed base to base, and named “closed
                    forms,” as the crystals are shut in by definite faces on every side. (2) The
                    prisms are bounded by plane faces parallel to one axis. They are thus of
                    unlimited extent in the direction of that axis, and therefore named “open
                    forms,’’but in solid crystals are shut in by faces of other forms. (3) The
                    pinacoids, or tables, have two faces intersecting one axis and parallel to the
                    others, and thus are also open forms, or unlimited in the direction of these
                    axes. Forms (2) and (3), when conjoined, mutually shut in each other, or produce
                    closed forms.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Pyramidal or Tetragonal System.—</hi> This system has three
                    axes at right angles, two of them equal, and the chief axis longer or shorter.
                    The name tetragonal is derived from the form of the base, which is usually
                    quadrangular.</p>
                <p>There are eight tetragonal forms, of which five are closed. (1) Tetragonal
                    pyramids (figs. 78, 79) are enclosed by eight isosceles triangles, with four
                    middle edges all in one plane, and eight polar edges. There are three kinds of
                    this form, distinguished by the position of the lateral axes. In the first these
                    axes unite the opposite angles; in the second they intersect the middle edges
                    equally; and in the third they lie in an intermediate position, or divide these
                    edges unequally,— the last being hemihcdral forms. These pyramids are also
                    distinguished as obtuse (fig. 78) or acute (fig. 79), according as the vertical
                    angle is greater or less than in the regular octahedron. (2) Ditetragonal
                    pyramids (fig. 80) are bounded by sixteen scalene triangles, whose base-lines
                    are all in one plane. This form rarely occurs except in combinations. (3)
                    Tetragonal sphenoids (fig. 81), bounded by four isosceles triangles, are the
                    hemihedral forms of the first variety of tetragonal pyramids. (4) The tetragonal
                    scalenohedron (fig. 82), bounded by eight scalene triangles, whose bases rise
                    and fall in a zigzag line, is the hemihedral form of the ditetragonal pyramid.
                    Nos. (3) and (4) are rare. (5) The tetragonal trapezohedron is not found in
                    minerals as a simple form. The three open forms are—(1) tetragonal prisms,
                    bounded by four planes parallel to the principal axis, which may be either
                    longer (fig. 83) or shorter (fig. 84) than the lateral axes; (2) ditetragonal
                    prisms, bounded by eight similar planes; and (3) the basal pinacoid, consisting
                    merely of two parallel faces bounding the prisms at the ends, above and below. .
                    , <hi rend="subscript"> j r</hi></p>
                <p>The various series of tetragonal crystals are distinguished from eneh other onlv
                    bv their relative dimensions. To determine these, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0375-0358"/> one of the series must be chosen as the primary
                    form, and for this purpose a tetragonal pyramid of the first variety, designated
                    by P as ns sign, is selected. The angle of one of its edges, especially the
                    middle edge, found by measurement, determines its angular dimensions, whilst the
                    proportion of the principal axis <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to the</p>
                <p>Now if <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be any (rational) number, either less or greater
                    than unity, and if from any distance <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> in the principal
                    axis planes be drawn to the middle edge of P, then new tetragonal pyramids of
                    the first order, but more or less acute or obtuse than P, are formed. The
                    general sign of these pyramids is τnP, and the most common varieties ⅜P, 2P, and
                    3P,—with the chief axis half, twice, or thrice that of P. If <hi rend="italic"
                    >m</hi> becomes infinite, then the pyramid passes into a prism, indefinitely
                    extended along the principal axis, and with the sign oo P. If τn = O, which is
                    the case when the lateral axes are supposed infinite, then it becomes a
                    pinacoid, consisting properly of two basal faces open towards the lateral axes,
                    and designated by the sign OP. Theditetra-gonal pyramids are produced by taking
                    in each lateral axis distances <hi rend="italic">n</hi> greater than 1, and
                    drawing two planes to these points from each of the intermediate polar edges.
                    The parameters of these planes are therefore <hi rend="italic">m</hi>: 1: <hi
                    rend="italic">n,</hi> and the general sign of the form τnPn, the most common
                    values of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> being ⅜, 2, 3, and oo. When <hi rend="italic"
                    >n=∞,</hi> a tetragonal pyramid of the second order arises, designated generally
                    by <hi rend="italic">mP∞</hi>, the most common in the mineral kingdom being P∞
                    and 2P∞. The relation of these to pyramids of the first order is shown in fig.
                    85, where ABBBC is the first and ACCCX the second order of pyramid. In like
                    manner, from the prism ∞P, the ditetragonal prisms <hi rend="italic">ao^Pn</hi>
                    are derived, and, finally, when <hi rend="italic">n≈∞</hi> the tetragonal prism
                    of the second order, whose sign is ooPoo.</p>
                <p>The combinations of the tetragonal system are either holohedral or hemihedral;
                    but the latter are rare. Prisms and pinacoids must always be terminated on the
                    open sides by other forms. Thus in fig. 86 a square prism of the first order is
                    terminated by the primary pyramid, and has its lateral angles again replaced by
                    another more acute pyramid of the second order, so that its sign is ooP, P,
                    2P∞.</p>
                <p>In fig. 87 a prism of the second order is first bounded by the fundamental
                    pyramid, and then has its edges of combination replaced by a ditetragonal
                    pyramid; its sign is ooPoo, P, 3P3. In fig. 88 the polar edges of the pyramid
                    are replaced by another pyramid, its sign being P, Poo. In fig. 89 a hemihedric
                    form, very characteristic of chalcopyrite, is represented,—P and P' being the
                    two sphenoids, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> the basal pinacoid, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b, c</hi> two ditetragonal pyramids.</p>
                <p>III. <hi rend="italic">The Hexagonal System.—</hi> The essential character of
                    this system is that it has four axes,—three equal lateral axes intersecting each
                    other in one plane at 60°, and one principal axis at right angles to these. The
                    plane through the lateral axes, or the base, from its hexagonal form, gives the
                    name to the system. As in the last system, its forms are either closed or open.
                    They are divided into holohedral, hemihedral, and tetartohedral,—the last, which
                    are rare, having only a fourth part of the faces developed. Only a few of the
                    more common forms require to be here described.</p>
                <p>The hexagonal pyramids (figs. 90, 91) are bounded by twelve isosceles triangles,
                    and are of three kinds, according as the lateral axes fall in the angles, in the
                    middle of the lateral edges, or in another point of these edges, the last being
                    hemihedral forms. They are also classed as acute or obtuse, but without any
                    precise limits. The trigonal pyramid is bounded by six triangles, and may be
                    viewed as the hemihedral form of the hexagonal. The dihexagonal pyramid is
                    bounded by twenty-four scalene triangles, but has never been observed alone, and
                    rarely even in combinations. The more common prisms are the hexagonal of six
                    sides; in these the vertical axis may be either longer than the lateral, as in
                    fig. 92, or shorter, as in fig. 93. There are also dihexagonal, of twelve
                    sides.</p>
                <p>A particular pyramid P is chosen as the fundamental form of this system, and its
                    dimensions determined either from the proportion of the lateral to the principal
                    axis (1: <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> or from the measurement of its angles. From
                    this form (τnP) others are derived exactly as in the tetragonal system. Thus
                    dihexagonal pyramids are produced with the general sign wιPn, the chief
                    peculiarity being that, whereas in the tetragonal system <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> might have any rational value from 1 to oo, in the hexagonal system it
                    can only vary from 1 to 2, in consequence of the geometric character of the
                    figure. When n=2, the dihexagonal changes into an hexagonal pyramid of the
                    second order, whose sign is ?nP2. When <hi rend="italic">m = oo</hi>, various
                    prisms arise from similar changes in the value of τι; and when <hi rend="italic"
                    >m —</hi> 0 the basal pinacoid is formed.</p>
                <p>Few hexagonal mineral species form perfect holohedral combinations. Though quartz
                    and apatite appear as such, yet properly the former is a tetartohedral, the
                    latter a hemihedral species. In holohedral species the predominant faces are
                    usually those of the hexagonal prisms ooP (fig. 92) and α&gt;P2, or of the
                    pinacoid OP (fig. 93); whilst the pyramids P and 2P2 are the most common
                    subordinate forms. Fig. 94 represents the prism, bounded on the extremities by
                    two pyramids,—one, P, forming the apex, the other, 2P2, the rhombic <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n376/mode/1up"

                    is a similar form, the upper part of the pyramid being replaced by the pinacoid.
                    In some crystals the lateral edges of the prism are replaced by the second prism
                    ∞P2 (fig. 96), producing an equiangular twelve-sided prism, which always
                    represents the combination ∞P, &lt;x&gt;P2, and cannot occur as a simple form.
                    Figs. 97, 98 are combinations in this system seen in beryl. An example of a more
                    complicated combination is seen in fig. 99, of a crystal of apatite, whose sign
                    with the corresponding lettersis ooP(J∕), ∞P2(e), 0P(P), ⅛P(r), P(χ), 2P(z).
                    P2(α), 2P2(s), 4P2(d).</p>
                <p>Hexagonal minerals frequently crystallize in those series of hemihedral forms
                    that are named “rhombohedral,” from the prevalence in them of rhombohedrons.
                    These (figs. 100, 101) are bounded by six rhombi, whose lateral edges do not lie
                    in one plane, but rise and fall in a zigzag manner. The principal axis unites
                    the two trigonal angles, formed by three equal plane angles; and in the most
                    common variety the secondary axes join the middle points of two opposite edges.
                    When the polar edges form an angle of more than 90°, the rhombohedrons are named
                    obtuse; when of less than 90°, acute; fig. 102 represents the first, fig.</p>
                <p>103 the second. Hexagonal scalenohedrons (fig. 104) are bounded by twelve scalene
                    triangles, whose lateral edges do not lie in one plane. The principal axis joins
                    the two hexagonal angles, and the secondary axis the middle points of two
                    opposite lateral edges.</p>
                <p>The rhombohedron is derived from the first order of hexagonal pyramid by the
                    hemihedral development of its alternate faces. Its general sign should therefore
                    be; but on several grounds it is <hi rend="italic">**</hi> found better to
                    designate it by R or wιR, and its complementary figure by - mR. When the prism
                    or pinacoid arises as its limiting form, they are designated by ooR and OR,
                    though in no respect changed from the limiting forms ®P and 0P of the pyramid.
                    The scalenohedron is properly the hemihedral form of the dihexagonal pyramid,
                    but is more easily understood as derived from the inscribed rhombohedron mR. If
                    the halves of the principal axis of this be multiplied by a definite number n,
                    and then planes be drawn from the extremities of this enlarged axis to the
                    lateral edges of the rhombohedron, as in fig. 105, the scalenohedron is
                    constructed. It is now designated by mR» (the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> on the
                    right here referring to the chief axis), and the dihexagonal prism in this
                    series by ∞Rn (formerly mR" and ooR <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>).</p>
                <p>The combinations of rhombohedral forms are very numerous, several hundreds having
                    been described in calc-spar alone. Among the most common is the prism in
                    combination with a rhombohedron, as seen in the twin crystal of calcspar (fig.
                    106), with the sign » R, - ⅛R, the lower ħalt being the same form with the
                    upper, but turned round 180°. In fig. 107 the rhombohedron wιRhas its polar
                    edges replaced by another rhombohedron - ⅜τnR, and in fig. 108 its lateral edges
                    bevelled by the scalenohedron <hi rend="italic">mRn.</hi> A more complex
                    combination of five forms is represented in the crystal of calcspar fig. 109,
                    its sign, with the letters on the faces, being R <hi rend="superscript"> δ</hi>

                    characterized by three unequal axes, all at right angles to each other. Any one
                    of these may be assumed as the chief axis, when the others are named
                    subordinate. The plane passing through the secondary axes, or the base, forms a
                    rhombus, and from this one of its names is derived. As prismatic forms are most
                    frequent (the prism standing vertically on the rhombic base), it is best defined
                    as the right prismatic. This system comprises only a few varieties of forms that
                    are essentially distinct, and its relations are consequently very simple.</p>

                    scalene triangles, with their lateral edges not in one plane, and are hemihedral
                    forms of the rhombic pyramid. They are of very infrequent occurrence. The open
                    forms, again, are rhombic prisms bounded by four planes parallel to one of the
                    axes, which is indefinitely extended, and may be longer than the lateral, as in
                    fig. 114, or shorter as in fig. 115. They are divided into upright (as in the
                    above figs.) and horizontal prisms, according as either the principal or one or
                    other of the lateral axes is supposed to become infinite. For the latter form
                    the name doma or dome has been used; and two kinds, the macrodome (fig. 116) and
                    the brachydome (fig.</p>
                <p>117), have been distinguished.</p>
                <p>. Rhombic pinacoids also arise when one axis becomes = 0 and the two others are
                    indefinitely extended; and so we have macropinacoids (fig. 118) and
                    brachypinacoids (fig. 119),—the qualifying term thus designating the axis to
                    which the faces of the dome or pinacoid are parallel.</p>
                <p>In deriving these forms from a primary, a particular rhombic pyramid P is chosen,
                    and its dimensions determined either from the angular measurement of two of its
                    edges, or by the linear proportion of its axes <hi rend="italic">a: b</hi>: c,
                    the greater lateral axis <hi rend="italic">b</hi> being assumed equal to 1. To
                    the greater lateral axis the name macrodiagonal is given, to the shorter that of
                    brachydiagonal; and the two principal sections are in like manner named
                    macrodiagonal and brachydiagonal, according to the axis they intersect. The same
                    terms are applied throughout all the derived forms. They consequently mark only
                    the position of the faces in respect to the axes of the fundamental crystal, and
                    frequently of necessity without reference to the relative magnitude of the
                    derived axes.</p>
                <p>By multiplying the principal axis by any rational number <hi rend="italic"
                    >m,</hi> greater or less than 1, a series of pyramids arise, whose general sign
                    is <hi rend="italic">mP,</hi> and their limits are the prism and pinacoid; the
                    whole series being contained in this formula, OP . . . . wιP . . . . P . . . .
                    <hi rend="italic">mP ....</hi> ooP,—which is the fundamental series, the lateral
                    axes always remaining unchanged.</p>
                <p>From each member a new series may, however, be developed in two directions, by
                    increasing one or other of the lateral axes. When the macrodiagonal is thus
                    multiplied by any number <hi rend="italic">n</hi> greater than 1, and planes
                    drawn from the distance <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to the polar edges, a new
                    pyramid is produced, named a macropyramid, with the sign <hi rend="italic"
                    >mPn,</hi> the mark over the P pointing out the axis enlarged. When n=oo, a
                    macrodome results, with the sign <hi rend="italic">mP∞.</hi> If the shorter axis
                    is multiplied, then brachy-pyramids and brachydomes are produced, with the signs
                    <hi rend="italic">mPn</hi> and mPoo. So also from the prism ∞P, on the one side,
                    originate numerous macroprisms oopn, with the limiting macropinacoid ooPα&gt;;
                    on the other, numerous brachy-prisms <hi rend="italic">∞Pn,</hi> with the limit
                    form ooP&lt;x&gt;, or the brachypinacoid. In figs. 120, 121 the two domes are
                    shown in their relation to the primitive pyramid.</p>
                <p>The pyramids seldom occur independent, or even as the predominant forms in a
                    combination; sulphur, however, is an exception. Prisms or pinacoids usually give
                    the general character to the crystal, which then appears either in a columnar or
                    tabular or even rectangular pyramidal form. The determination of the position of
                    these crystals, as vertical or horizontal, depends on the choice of the chief
                    axis of the fundamental form. In the topaz crystal (fig. 122) the brachyprism
                    and the pyramid are the predominant elements, associated with the prism, its
                    sign and letters being ooI&gt;2(Z), P(o), ooP(jlf). Fig. 123 of stilbite is
                    another example, the macropinacoid oo Poo or <hi rend="italic">Μ</hi> being
                    combined with the pyramid P(r), the brachypinacoid oofrx&gt;(T), and the basal
                    pinacoid 0P(P). Another instance is fig. 124 of a lievrite crystal, where the
                    brachyprism and pyramid combine <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n378/mode/1up"

                    above figures are very common forms of barytes,—figs. 125 and 126 being both
                    composed of the pinacoid OP, a brachydome, and a macrodome, with sign 0P(c), f ∞
                    (∕), ⅜P∞ <hi rend="italic">(d).</hi> The variation in aspect arises from the
                    predominance of different faces; and fig. 127 consists of the macrodome ⅜Poo,
                    the prism ooPtø), and the pinacoid OP.</p>
                <p>V. <hi rend="italic">The Oblique Prismatic System.—</hi> This system is
                    characterized by three unequal axes, two of which intersect each other at an
                    oblique angle, and are cut by the third at right angles. One of the oblique axes
                    is chosen as the chief axis, and the other axes are then distinguished as the
                    orthodiagonal (right-angled) and clinodiagonal (oblique-angled). The same terms
                    are applied to the chief sections, and the name of the system refers to the fact
                    that these two planes form with the base two right angles and one oblique angle
                    C.</p>
                <p>The forms of this system approach very near to those of the right prismatic
                    series, but the inclination of the axis, even when almost a right angle, gives
                    them a peculiar character, by which they are always readily distinguished. Each
                    pyramid thus separates into two altogether independent forms or
                    hemipyramids.</p>
                <p>Three varieties of prism also occur—vertical, inclined, and Horizontal—with faces
                    parallel to the chief axis, the clinodiagonal, or the orthodiagonal. The
                    horizontal prisms, like the pyramids, separate into two independent partial
                    forms named hemiprisms or hemidomes. The inclined prisms are often designated
                    clinodomes, the term prism being restricted to the vertical forms.
                    Orthopinacoids and clinopinacoids are also distinguished, from their position in
                    relation to the axes. The monoclinic pyramids (fig. 128) are bounded by eight
                    scalene triangles of two kinds, four and four only being similar. Their lateral
                    edges lie all in one plane, and the similar triangles are placed in pairs on the
                    clinodiagonal polar edges.</p>
                <p>The two pairs in the acute angle between the orthodiagonal and basal sections are
                    designated the positive hemipyramid, whilst the two pairs in the obtuse angles
                    of the same sections form together the negative hemipyramid. But, as these
                    hemipyramids are wholly independent of each other, they are rarely observed
                    combined. More frequently each occurs alone, and then forms a prism-like figure,
                    with faces parallel to the polar edges, and open at the extremities. Hence, like
                    all prisms, they can only appear in combination with other forms. The vertical
                    prisms are bounded by four equal faces parallel to the principal axis, and the
                    cross section is a rhombus; the clinodomes have a similar form and section;
                    whilst the horizontal prisms or domes have unequal faces, and their section is a
                    rhomboid.</p>
                <p>The mode of derivation of these forms closely resembles that of the rhombic
                    series. A complete double pyramid is assumed as the fundamental form, and
                    designated ±P, in order to express the two portions of which it consists. Its
                    dimensions are given when the proportion of its axes <hi rend="italic">a</hi>:
                    δ: <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and the angular inclination of the oblique axes C,
                    which is also the inclination of the orthodiagonal section to the base, are
                    known.</p>
                <p>The fundamental series of forms is OP . . . . ±τnP . . . . ±P .... ±mP .... ooP,
                    from each of whose members, by changing the dimensions of the other axes, new
                    forms may be again derived. Thus from ±mP, by multiplying the orthodiagonal by
                    any number <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> a series of orthopyramids ±mP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 0</hi> τι is'produced, with the ortho, domes τnP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> c</hi> ∞ as limiting forms. The clinodiagonal produces a
                    similar series of clinopyramids ±τnP <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> n, with the
                    limiting clinodome mP <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> oo always completely
                    formed, and therefore without the signs ± attached. From ooP arise orthoprisms
                    ooP°n and the orthopinacoid ooP <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> oo, and
                    clinoprisms ooP <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> ιι and the clinopinacoid ooP <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> oo. In these signs the <hi rend="italic">o</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> attached to the P indicates that the orthodiagonal (o)
                    or clinodiagonal (c) axis has been multiplied. Formerly the latter forms were
                    enclosed in brackets, thus <hi rend="italic">(mP∞)</hi> =mPoo.</p>
                <p>The combinations of this system may be easily understood from their resemblance
                    to those of the right prismatic, the chief difficulty being in the occurrence of
                    <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> forms, which, however, closely resemble the
                    hemihedral forms of the previous systems. A few examples only need therefore be
                    given.</p>
                <p>Fig. 129 represents a very common form of gypsum crystals, α&gt;P <hi

                <p>Fig. 131 is a crystal of common felspar or orthoclase, composed of the

                    basal pinacoid 0P(P), and the hemidomes 2P <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> ∞(y)∙,
                    to which, in fig. 132 of the same mineral, the hemipyramid P(o) and the
                    clinodome 2P <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> ∞ <hi rend="italic">(n)</hi> are
                    added.</p>
                <p>VI. <hi rend="italic">Anorthic or Triclinic System.—</hi> This is the least
                    regular system, and departs the most widely, indeed almost absolutely, from
                    symmetry of form. The axes are all unequal, and inclined at angles none of which
                    are right angles,—so that, to determine any crystal, or series of forms, the
                    proportion of the axes <hi rend="italic">a: b: c,</hi> and also their angles, or
                    those of the inclination of the chief sections, must be known. As in the
                    previous systems, one axis is chosen as the principal axis, and the two others
                    distinguished as the macrodiagonal and brachydiagonal axes. In consequence of
                    the oblique position of the principal sections, this system consists entirely of
                    partial forms wholly independent of each other, and each composed only of two
                    parallel faces. The complete pyramid is thus broken up into four distinct
                    quarter-pyramids, and the prism into two hemiprisms. Each of these partial forms
                    is thus nothing more than a pair of parallel planes, and the various forms
                    consequently mere individual faces. This circumstance renders many triclinic
                    crystals very unsymmetrical in appearance.</p>
                <p>Triclinic pyramids (fig. 133) are bounded by eight triangles whose lateral edges
                    lie in one plane. They are equal and parallel two and two to each other, each
                    pair forming, as just stated, a tetartopyramid or open form, only limited by
                    combination with other forms, or, as we may suppose, by the chief sections. The
                    prisms are again either vertical or inclined; the latter are named domes, and
                    their section is always rhomboidal. In deriving the forms, the fundamental
                    pyramid is placed upright with its brachydiagonal axis to the spectator, and the
                    partial forms designated, the two upper by 'P and P', the two lower by <hi
                    rend="subscript"> z</hi> P and P,, as in the figure. The further derivation now
                    follows as in the right prismatic system, with the modifications already
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>Some combinations of this system, as the series exhibited by most of the
                    felspars, approach very near to the oblique prismatic svstem: whilst others, as
                    cyanose and axinite, show great incompleteness<pb break="no"

                    determination of the forms is often difficult. In the albite crystal (figs. 134,
                    135) <hi rend="italic">P</hi> is the basal pinacoid OP; <hi rend="italic">Μ</hi>

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Measurement of the Angles of Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>The permanence of the angular dimensions of crystals shows the importance of some
                    accurate method of measuring their angles,—that is, the inclination of two faces
                    to each other. Instruments for this purpose are called goniometers.</p>
                <p>Two have been specially used for this purpose—the common or contact goniometer,
                    invented by Caringeau, and the reflecting goniometer of Wollaston. The former is
                    simply two brass rulers turning on a common centre, between which the crystal is
                    so placed that its faces coincide with the edges of the rulers, and the angle is
                    then measured on a graduated arc. This instrument is sufficiently accurate for
                    many purposes and for large crystals, but for precise determination is far
                    inferior to the reflecting goniometer. This requires smooth and even faces, but
                    these may be very small, even the hundredth of an inch; and, as small crystals
                    are generally the most perfect, far greater accuracy can be attained.</p>
                <p>The reflecting goniometer is represented in fig. 138. It consists essentially of
                    a graduated circle <hi rend="italic">mm,</hi> divided on its edge into twice
                    180°, or more frequently into half-degrees, the minutes being read off by the
                    vernier <hi rend="italic">hh.</hi> This circle turns on an axis connected with
                    <hi rend="italic">tt,</hi> so that by turning this the circle is moved round,
                    but it is stopped at 180°, when moving in one direction, by a spring at <hi
                    rend="italic">k.</hi> The other part of the instrument is intended to attach and
                    adjust the crystal to be measured. The first axis of <hi rend="italic">mm</hi>
                    is hollow, and a second axis, <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> passes through it from
                    <hi rend="italic">ss,</hi> so that this and all the connected parts from <hi

                    turning the arm <hi rend="italic">og,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pq</hi> a
                    fourth axis, in like manner movable in <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and with a
                    small knob at <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> to which the crystal to be measured is
                    attached.</p>
                <p>When about to be used, the instrument should be placed on a table, with its base
                    horizontal (which is readily done by the screws in it), and opposite to a window
                    at about 12 or 15 feet distance, so that its axis shall be parallel to the
                    horizontal bars of the window. One of the upper bars of the window, and also the
                    lower bar, or, instead of the latter, a white line on the floor or table
                    parallel to the window, should then be chosen, in order to adjust the crystal.
                    The observer places himself behind the instrument with the side <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> at his right hand. The crystal is then attached to g by a
                    piece of wax, with the two faces to be measured upwards, ana the edge of union
                    of the faces, including the angle to be measured, as nearly as possible in the
                    line of <hi rend="italic">aa.</hi> The eye being brought near to the first face
                    of the crystal, the axes αα and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> are turned till the
                    image of the window is seen reflected in the face with the horizontal and
                    vertical bars in their position. The axis <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is then
                    turned through a considerable angle (say 60°), and the image of the window again
                    sought and brought into its proper place by turning the axis∕, without moving
                    <hi rend="italic">p.</hi> When this is done that face is brought into its true
                    position, normal to <hi rend="italic">d, so</hi> that no motion of <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> can disarrange it. Hence the image of the window may now be
                    sought in the second face, and brought into its true position, with the
                    horizontal bars seen horizontal, by moving the axes <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> When this is done the crystal is properly “adjusted.”
                    The angle is measured in the following manner. First bring the zero of the
                    circle and vernier to coincide, and then turn the inner axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ss,</hi> and move the eye till the image of the
                    upper bar of the window reflected from the more distant face of the crystal
                    coincides with the lower bar or horizontal line seen directly. Keeping the eye
                    in its place, turn the other axis <hi rend="italic">tt</hi> till the reflected
                    image of the upper bar in the other face in like manner coincides with the lower
                    line; the angle of the two faces is then read off on the divided circle. As the
                    angle measured is not directly that of the faces but of the rays of light
                    reflected from them, or the difference between the angle wanted and 180°, the
                    circle has the degrees numbered in the reverse direction, so as to give the
                    angle without the trouble of subtracting the one from the other.</p>
                <p>The apparatus figured is for adjusting the crystal, and is an improvement
                    suggested by Naumann. In the original instrument the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >fo</hi> was made to push in or out in a sheath, and had a small brass plate,
                    bent at right angles, inserted in a cleft at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> to which
                    the crystal was attached. The crystal was adjusted as formerly by moving the
                    plate, or the axis <hi rend="italic">fo,</hi> and by slight motion of the arm
                    <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> which should be at right angles nearly to <hi
                    rend="italic">be</hi> when used. A very marked improvement is to have a small
                    mirror fixed on the stand below the crystal, with its face parallel to the axis
                    <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi> and inclined at 45° to the window, when the lower
                    line can be dispensed with, and the instrument used for various other purposes
                    of angular measurement. Many more perfect instruments have been introduced for
                    the purpose of insuring greater accuracy; but the simple instrument is
                    sufficient for all purposes of determinative mineralogy, and the error from the
                    instrument will, in most cases, be less than the actual variations in the angles
                    of the crystals.</p>

                <p>Such departures may be regulated by law, or may result from an undue operation of
                    the force of accretion in certain directions.</p>

                    parallel.</p>
                <p>Fig. 20 shows the first, where cohesion sufficient for stability requires that
                    the minute octahedra must mutually penetrate somewhat into each other. Fig. 139
                    shows the same in baryte. If we suppose octahedra united, the upper left-hand
                    face of the one with the lower right-hand face of the other, there would be
                    parallelism of their axes. Re-entering angles would, in such cases, prove a
                    plurality of individuals, but if a number of cubes were superimposed in similar

                    in the individual, acicular.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Twins and Hemitropes.—</hi> Though closely related, formed
                    under the operation of very similar laws, and to a certain extent passing into
                    one another, these are not the same. In the first case a plurality of
                    individuals must be present; in the second this is not necessary. In fig. 140
                    two individuals evidently intersect one another; in figs. 141, 142 one
                    individual may be supposed to have been bisected in a certain direction, and the
                    two halves reattached, but in a position differing in some definite manner from
                    their relative position before the separation.</p>
                <p>There are four varieties of true twins: those of apposition, of intersection, of
                    partial or completed interpenetration, and of incorporation.</p>
                <p>The first is exemplified by spinel, as in fig. 143; the second by staurolite, as
                    in fig. 144; the third by calcite, as in fig. 146, and by blende, as in fig.
                    145, where the two individuals of fig. 143 may be supposed to have been forced
                    vertically into one another: and the last by quartz, as in fig. 147.</p>
                <p>The following are the laws of union of twins. 1. The face of union of twins,
                    termed the “face of composition,” must be either a plane which does occur in the
                    mineral twinned, or which can occur in accordance with the fifth law of
                    symmetry. A face of union in twins is also a face of union in hemitropes of the
                    same mineral. 2. From the above it results that the axes of the united crystals
                    are either parallel (fig. 148) or inclined (fig. 149). The former generally
                    occur among hemihedric forms; and the two crystals are combined in the exact
                    position in which they would be derived from or would reproduce the primary
                    holohedral form. The class with oblique axes occur both in holohedric and in
                    hemihedric forms; and the two individuals are then placed in perfect symmetry,
                    in accordance with law 1.</p>
                <p>Twins are generally recognized by having re-entering angles (figs. 150, 151); but
                    sometimes the crossed faces coincide in one plane, when the combination appeal’s
                    as a single individual (figs. 152, 153). The line of union may then be
                    imperceptible, or it may be disclosed by the intersection of two sets of striae
                    (figs. 154,155), or by some physical diversity in the characters of the two
                    faces.</p>
                <p>The formation of twin crystals may be again, or many times, repeated,—forming
                    groups of three, four, twenty-four, or more. When the faces of union are
                    parallel to each other, the crystals form rows of indeterminate extent. When
                    they are not parallel, they may return into each other in circles, as in rutile;
                    or form bouquet or rosette groups, as in chrysoberyl (fig. 156); or stellate
                    groups, as in calcite (fig. 157) and in cerussite (figs. 158, 159).</p>
                <p>When the crystals are of different size, greater complexity results; but a number
                    of minute crystals are frequently arranged upon a larger at those points where
                    the angles of a single large crystal would protrude. Occasionally a simple form
                    is twinned with a more complex one, as in chabasite (fig. 160).</p>

                <p>Hemitrope crystals we may imagine as having beep formed from a single crystal,
                    which has been cut into two halves in a particular direction, and one half
                    turned round 180°, or 90°, or 60°. The line about which the revolution is
                    supposed to take place is called the “axis of revolution.” From the amount of
                    turn usually being 180°, Haiiy gave the name hemitrope. The position of the two
                    halves in this case resembles that of an object and its image in a mirror, whose
                    surface then would represent the plane of reunion.</p>
                <p>The following are the laws of hemitropes. The axis of revolution is always a
                    possible crystallographic line,—either an axis, a line parallel to an axis, or a
                    normal to a possible crystalline plane. The plane normal to the axis of
                    revolution is called the twin plane; it is either an occurring or a possible
                    plane, and usually one of the more frequently recurring planes. Both the axis
                    and the twin plane bear the same relation to both halves of the crystal in their
                    reversed positions; consequently the parts of hemitrope crystals are symmetrical
                    with reference to the twin plane (except in triclinic forms and some hemihedral
                    crystals). The face of composition very frequently coincides with the twin
                    plane; when not coinciding, the twin plane and the face of composition are
                    generally at right angles to each other, so that the composition face is
                    parallel to the axis of revolution. But in twins of incorporation the surfaces
                    of composition have exercised a disturbing influence on one another, so that the
                    surface of union is exceedingly irregular. Still in these cases the axis and the
                    plane of twinning retain a definite position; but the face of composition, being
                    no longer defined, is useless as a determinant.</p>
                <p>There are three modes in which the composition may take place in hemitropes.
                    These may be explained by dividing a crystal into halves, with the plane of
                    division vertical, and then turning one of the halves round.</p>
                <p>I. One of the halves may be inverted, as if by revolution through 180° on a
                    horizontal axis <hi rend="italic">at right angles to the plane of section,</hi>
                    and the two faces again united by the surfaces which were separated. Here the
                    surfaces of union are the original ones, but the base of one of the halves has
                    taken the place of its summit. Examples: selenite (fig. 161) and orthoclase.</p>
                <p>2. One of the halves may be turned round through 180", as if by revolution on <hi
                    rend="italic">a horizontal axis, parallel to the plane of section,</hi> and the
                    face opposite and parallel to that of the plane of section—an originally
                    external face—may then be applied to the other half. Here, not only has the base
                    of one-half become a summit, but a lateral and external face of the original
                    crystal has been thrust to its centre so as to become a face of internal union.
                    Example: labradorite (fig. 162).</p>
                <p>3. One of the halves may be turned round through 180°, as if by revolution <hi
                    rend="italic">on a vertical axis,</hi> parallel to the plane of section, the
                    external face opposite and parallel to the plane of section becoming a face of
                    union. Here, however, both the original summits retain their position as
                    summits. Example: orthoclase.</p>
                <p>The first of these modes of composition may occur in each of the systems, but it
                    is not always apparent until disclosed by optical properties. The second is
                    rare, and the third still more so.</p>
                <p>In hemitrope crystals (less frequently in true twins) the halves of the crystal
                    are frequently reduced in thickness in the direction of the ordinary twin axis;
                    and when there is a parallel repetition of hemitropes, which frequently occurs,
                    they are often reduced to very thin plates, not the thickness of paper, giving
                    to the surface of the aggregate a striated structure and appearanee.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">cubic system</hi> the faces of composition, both of
                    twinning and of hemitropic revolution, are those of the cube, the dodecahedron,
                    and the octahedron.</p>
                <p>In the first case we have the axes of the two crystals necessarily in some cases
                    parallel, or, more correctly, falling into one; but, as in this system all the
                    axes are alike, or all the cubic faces similar, composition may occur along or
                    parallel to all alike, and double or triple twins occur. We have examples in
                    twins of the pentagonal dodecahedron (fig. 163) made up by the interpenetration
                    of a right and a left ( + and - ), and of the tetrahedron, as seen in pyrite and
                    fahlerz respectively. In virtue of the position required by law 2, it will be
                    seen that the position of the solid which is common to both intersecting
                    crystals is in the twin of pyrite the four-faced cube, which is the holohedral
                    form of the pentagonal dodecahedron, while in the case of the fahlerz twin (fig.
                    164), the common portion is an octahedron, the holohedral form of the
                    tetrahedron.</p>
                <p>Twinning on an octahedral face is seen in the apposition twin of spinel (fig.
                    143), the tetrahedral twin of blende (fig. 165), the interpenetrative octahedral
                    twin of blende seen in fig. 166, and. the intersecting cubes of fluor (fig.
                    167).</p>
                <p>This is also the usual twin face for hemitropes of the cubic system.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n382/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0382-0365"/>
                <p>Itis seen in fig. 168 of blende, where the two parts of the rhombic dodecahedron
                    are united by it. Magnetite, spinel, and diamond frequently occur in octahedral
                    hemitropes of the same composition (fig. 169).</p>
                <p>This is also the face of composition for tetartohedral hemitropes.</p>
                <p>Fig. 170 is that of the diamond. Here six of the faces of the six faced
                    octahedron, with six faces diagonally opposite, form a low double six-sided
                    pyramid (a portion of an octahedral face truncating each) through an 180°
                    revolution of one set of these. Garnet sometimes shows both twins and hemitropes
                    of the dodecahedron, of dodecahedral composition.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">tetragonal system,</hi> twin crystals are very uncommon,
                    but hemitropes frequent. With parallel axes they very seldom occur, but are seen
                    in chalcopyrite. When the axes are inclined, the plane of union is usually one
                    of the faces of the primary pyramid; and, as these faces are all similar,
                    composition may take place simultaneously parallel to all. Very complicated
                    forms hence result, as seen in chalcopyrite and in cassiterite (fig. 171)∙</p>
                <p>In cassiterite the plane of union is frequently one of the faces of the pyramid
                    P∞, sometimes one of those faces that replace the polar edges of P (figs. 172
                    173). From the bend the latter form is termed geniculated.</p>
                <p>Hausmannite occurs in hemitropes of the primary P; and on the polar edges of this
                    other twins are symmetrically repeated, a central individual appearing like a
                    support to the others (figs. 174, 175).</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">hexagonal system</hi> twins are very common among the
                    rhombohedral (the hemihedral) and the tetartohedral forms; while hemitropes
                    prevail among the hexagonal or holohedral forms. The twins are generally formed
                    by the interpenetration of two rhombohedrons, a + and a -, the vertical axis
                    being the axis of composition; as in chabasite (fig. 176), cinnabar, levyne,
                    calcite, &amp;c. Sometimes six or more crystals, united parallel to the
                    prismatic planes, form rosettes; as in chabasite from Giant’s Causeway. The
                    almost endless stellate forms of crystals of snow are built up in this manner.
                    Many of the most beautiful combinations to be seen among crystals result from
                    this mode of arrangement.</p>
                <p>Parallel groupings of hexagonal prisms also occur, as in apatite (fig. 177).</p>
                <p>Rock crystal, in consequence of the tetartohedral character of its
                    crystallization, exhibits twins in which the double hexagonal pyramid P may be
                    said to be separated into two rhombohedrons <hi rend="italic">P</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">r;</hi> these, though geometrically similar, are physi cally
                    distinct. In fig. 178 the two individuals have not entirely interpenetrated, and
                    might be regarded as simply grown together with parallel axes; but in fig. 147
                    there is so complete an interpenetration that the composite character of the
                    crystal is only evidenced through a difference in the character of the surfaces
                    of the two halves, which are most irregularly disposed.</p>
                <p>The hemitropes of this system often form regular crystals, when the two halves
                    have been united by a plane parallel to the base, so as to appear like a simple
                    crystal, as in fig. 179. Here each end shows the forms ooR, - ⅜R, but the
                    terminal faces appear in parallel instead of alternate position. Something of
                    the same is seen in fig. 180, a hemitrope scalenohedron from Derbyshire.
                    Hemitropes with the face of the primitive rhombohedron as the face of
                    composition are also common; and they are sometimes joined by a face of - ⅜R,
                    the two axes forming an angle of 127° 34'. Occasionally a third individual is
                    interposed in a lamellar form, as in fig. 181, where the faces of the two outer
                    portions become parallel. This is found in some pieces of Iceland spar. When the
                    crystals unite in a face of the primary rhombohedron, they form an angle of 89°
                    8'; hemitropes on this law are easily recognized by their differing so little
                    from a right angle in the re-entering bend (figs. 182, 183).</p>
                <p>The faces which in this species act as faces of composition are exceedingly
                    numerous; other examples are figs. 142, 146, 148, and 149.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">right prismatic system</hi> twin crystals with parallel
                    axes are rare, but with oblique axes common, the faces of union being one of the
                    faces of the prism α&gt;P. Twins of this kind occur frequently in <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0383-0366"/> aragonite, cerussite, mispickel, and marcasite.
                    In aragonite the crystals are partly interpenetrating, and partly merely in
                    juxtaposition, as in fig. 184, where the individuals are formed by the
                    combination ooP(J∕), ooPco(Λ), P∞(⅛). In fig. 185 several crystals of the same
                    combination form a series with parallel planes of union, the inner members of
                    which are often so shortened that they form mere films, which appear as striae
                    on the faces P∞ and ooPα&gt; of the twin.</p>
                <p>In fig. 186 four crystals, each of the combination ooP, 2P∞, having united in
                    inclined planes, form a circular group, which returns into itself. Cerussite
                    occurs in similar groups, building up a composite hexagonal crystal. It also
                    occurs in stellate twins of two or three individuals, as in figs. 158, 159.
                    Similar stellate combinations are also common in chrysoberyl. In staurolite,
                    individuals of the prismatic combination ooP, ot&gt;Poo, OP combine, either as
                    in fig. 144 by a face of the brachydome, having their chief axes almost at right
                    angles, or as in fig. 140 by a face of the brachypyramid ⅞P⅜, the chief axes and
                    the brachypinacoids (o) of each of the crystals meeting at an angle of about
                    60°. This mineral, which is very frequently twinned, also forms combinations
                    with the axes parallel (fig. 187).</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">oblique prismatic system,</hi> twins are by no means so
                    frequent as hemitropes. Twins of interpenetration with parallel axes, but the
                    one turned as regards the other round a vertical axis, are common in orthoclase
                    (figs. 188, 189). Such crystals are termed right-handed (fig. 188) and
                    left-handed (fig. 189), according to the side of the crystal which has been
                    turned. In this mineral hemitropes occur around an axis normal to <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ,</hi> to <hi rend="italic">P,</hi> and to <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> (fig. 529); double twins of the last two are common (fig. 530).</p>
                <p>Harmotome and phillipsite form first hemitropes, and <hi rend="italic">then</hi>
                    twins of these, which are arranged sometimes as crosses and sometimes as double
                    crosses (fig. 190). In hemitropes of gypsum the two halves are united by a face
                    parallel to the orthodiagonal section, as in fig. 161, where the two halves have
                    united so regularly that the faces P ’, P form only one plane. In a similar
                    manner the two halves of the augite crystal represented in fig.</p>
                <p>130 are in fig. 191 united so perfectly and symmetrically that the line of
                    junction cannot be observed on the clinopinacoid. The two hemipyramids P(s)
                    (like - P (Z) in the gypsum crystal) form at one end of the crystal a
                    re-entering, at the other a salient angle.</p>
                <p>Hornblende (fig. 192) and wolfram exhibit a similar appearance. This results in
                    the imparting a pseudo-hemimorphism to certain oblique prismatic twins, which is
                    well seen in the twins of sphene (figs. 193 and 589), and in exalting the
                    characteristic appearance of true hemimorphs, as seen in the twin of acmite
                    (fig. 194). In other cases the individuals partially penetrate each other in the
                    direction of the orthodiagonal. This mode of union is not uncommon in gypsum,
                    and is very frequent in orthoclase. Two crystals of the latter of the
                    combination (ooPo <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi>), ooP, OP, 2P∞ as in fig. 131,
                    are often pushed into each other, as shown in fig. 195.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">anorthic system</hi> some twin formations are of great
                    importance, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as a means of distinguishing the
                    triclinic from the mono clinic species of felspar. In one variety the twin axis
                    is the normal to the brachydiagonal chief section. But in the anorthic felspars
                    this section is not perpendicular to the base, and consequently the two bases
                    form on one side a re-entering, on the other a salient angle; whereas in the
                    oblique prismatic felspars (where the brachydiagonal chief section corresponds
                    to the clinodiagonal) no twin crystals can be produced in conformity to this
                    law, and the two bases fall in one plane.</p>
                <p>and <hi rend="italic">P</hi> (as well as those of 'P'∞, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x'),</hi> are a very characteristic appearance,
                    marking out this mineral at once as a triclinic species. Usually the twin
                    formation is repeated, three or more crystals being combined, when those in the
                    centre are reduced to mere plates. When very numerous, the surfaces <hi
                    rend="italic">P</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x</hi> are covered with fine striae,
                    often only perceptible with a microscope. A second law observed in triclinic
                    felspars, particularly in albite and labradorite, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n384/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0384-0367"/> is that the twin axis corresponds with that
                    normal of the brachydiagonal which is situated in the plane of the base. In
                    pericline, a variety of albite, these twins appear as in fig. 198, where the two
                    crystals are united by a face of the basal pinacoid P, whilst the faces of the
                    two brachypinacoids (Jf and <hi rend="italic">AΓ)</hi> form edges with very
                    obtuse angles (173° 22'), re-entering on the one side and salient on the other.
                    These edges, or the line of junction between <hi rend="italic">Μ</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">M',</hi> are also parallel to the edges formed by these faces and
                    the base, or those between <hi rend="italic">Μ</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi> In this case also the twins are occasionally several times repeated,
                    when the faces appear covered by fine striae.</p>
                <p>Cause <hi rend="italic">of the Fσrmation of Twins and Hemitropes.—</hi> It has
                    been shown above that the relative position of the molecules of crystals is
                    determined by a polarity in the molecules themselves. This polarity must exist
                    along three lines which intersect in the centre of the molecules; and unlike
                    poles must attract each other. It has been supposed that compound crystals
                    result from a reversion of the original polarity of the molecules of a crystal,
                    after it has attained <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> ά</hi> certain size. Heat and
                    electricity, resulting from movements in strata, might occasion such reversion
                    during the formation.of a crystal, and this would suffice for the explanation of
                    hemitropes, though not directly of geniculated crystals, and still less of
                    intersecting twins. Twins have accordingly been divided into ‘ ‘ paragenetic”
                    and “metagenetic.” The first term is applied to the ordinarily occurring twins,
                    in which the compound structure is supposed to have had its beginning in a
                    nucleal compound molecule, or to have been compound in its very origin. In
                    metagenetic twins the crystal was at first simple, but afterwards, through some
                    change in the material furnished for its increase or possibly induced in itself,
                    it received new layers, or an extension <hi rend="italic">in a reversed
                    position.</hi></p>
                <p>Rutile occurs in crystals like fig. 173, but with a bend at both extremities,
                    instead of one only. Here the middle portion of the crystal is supposed to have
                    attained a length of half an inch, and then it became geniculated simultaneously
                    at both extremities; indeed, in this mineral such geniculatione are frequently
                    repeated until the ends are bent into one another, and produce short hexagonal
                    prisms with central depressions or even vacuities. The repeated twinning which
                    produces striation, as in calcite and the felspars, and the peculiar rippled
                    structure of amethyst, are ascribed to a similar operation, acting in an
                    oscillatory manner.</p>
                <p>Certain intersecting twins in the cubic system may be explained simply through
                    excessive or undue accretion of molecules along certain lines. At page 351 it
                    was shown how the three-faced octahedron (fig. 39) was formed through an
                    accretion of molecules upon the faces of the octahedron along axes joining the
                    centres of its faces (those which connect the solid angles of the cube). It was
                    also shown that when through this accretion two faces of the triakisoctahedron
                    (fig. 199), adjacent along the edge of the octahedron, rose into one plane the
                    rhombic dodecahedron resulted. If now accretion still goes on along the same
                    axes, so that the trihedral pyramid rises above the level of the dodecahedral
                    planes, fig. 200 results. This is the twin of the three-faced tetrahedron (fig.
                    201).</p>
                <p>If the accretion is still along the same axes until the lateral edges of the
                    adjacent pyramids fall into the same line, fig. 202 results; and this is the
                    twin of the simple tetrahedron (fig. 203). Here accretion upon the faces of a
                    complex holohedral form has produced a twin of a simple hemihedral form.</p>
                <p>Again, starting from the six-faced octahedron (fig. 204), there is produced by
                    the same process first fig. 205, the twin of the sixfaced tetrahedron (fig.
                    206), and ultimately fig. 207, the twin of the three-faced tetrahedron (fig.
                    208).</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Departure, from, Regularity on Account of Undue Accretion in
                    certain Directions.—Distortion of Crystals.—</hi> The laws of crystallization
                    should produce crystal forms of perfect symmetry; these laws, however, are
                    subject, not only to the influence of other laws, but also frequently to
                    disturbing influences which are subject to no law. Absolute symmetry, therefore,
                    is very uncommon, crystals being generally so distorted and disguised through
                    interference during their formation that either familiarity on the one hand or
                    skill on the other is necessary for their recognition. As the magnitude of the
                    angles may vary somewhat, even this guide may sometimes perplex. Hence it is
                    necessary to be familiar with such departures from symmetry; and some of the
                    more common are here noticed.</p>
                <p>In the cubic system a cube (fig. 26), lengthened or shortened along one axis,
                    becomes a right square prism (fig. 209), and if elongated in the direction of
                    two axes is changed to a rectangular prism (fig. 7). Cubes of pyrites, galena,
                    fluor-spar, &amp;c., are generally thus distorted. It is very unusual to find a
                    cubic crystal that is a true symmetrical cube. In some species the cube or
                    octahedron (or other monometric form) is lengthened into a capillary <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n385/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0385-0368"/> crystal or needle, as happens in red copper and
                    pyrites. Crystals of acicular pyrites occur at the Newton-Stewart lead-mine.</p>
                <p>An octahedron flattened parallel to two of its faces is reduced to a tabular
                    crystal (fig. 210). If lengthened in the same direction, it takes the form in
                    fig. 211; or if it is still further lengthened, to the obliteration of two
                    opposite octahedral faces, it becomes an acute rhombohedron (same figure).</p>
                <p>When an octahedron is extended in the direction of a line between two opposite
                    edges, it has the general form of a rectangular octahedron; and still further
                    extended, as in fig. 212, it is changed to a rhombic prism with dihedral
                    summits. The figure repre- .</p>
                <p>sents this prism lying on its acute edge (spinel, fluor,, magnetite).</p>
                <p>The dodecahedron when lengthened in the direction of the upright axis becomes a
                    square prism with pyramidal summits (fig. 213); and when shortened along the
                    same axis it is reduced to a square octahedron with truncated basal angles (fig.
                    214). Both these forms are modifications of the square prism; the first mode of
                    distortion is common in garnet, rendering it liable to be considered zircon; the
                    second is seen in aplome, when it might be taken for stannite. When the first of
                    these forms is flattened, as in fig. 215 it resembles a form of stilbite.</p>
                <p>When a dodecahedron again is lengthened along a diagonal between the obtuse solid
                    angles, it becomes a six-sided prism with trihedral summits, as in fig. 216; and
                    when shortened in the same direction, it becomes a rhombohedron which has its
                    six acute angles truncated (fig. 217). In the first case, a crystal of green
                    garnet or uwarowite would resemble dioptase; in the latter, colourless garnet
                    would resemble; calcite. ’</p>
                <p>The trapezohedron is exceedingly subject to distortions which frequently disguise
                    it much. When elongated in the direction of the upright axis it becomes a double
                    eight-sided pyramid with four-sided summits (fig. 218); a further elongation
                    along the same axis would result in the obliteration of these summit faces, and
                    in the production of a perfect double octagonal pyramid (fig. 219). The first of
                    these distortions is exceedingly common in analcime and not uncommon in garnet;
                    the latter rarely occurs in analcime. Lengthened along an octahedral axis it
                    becomes fig. 220; shortened along the same it becomes fig. 221. Both are seen in
                    analcime.</p>
                <p>When the tetrakishexahedron is lengthened along a single octahedral axis it
                    assumes the form of fig. 222; still further elongated, with obliteration of one
                    half of its planes, it becomes a scalene dodecahedron. resembling the “dog
                    tooth” form of calcite (fig. 223). Fig. 224 is a hemihedron of this form,
                    produced by shortening along an octahedral axis, with obliteration of all the
                    planes which do not touch the poles of that axis.</p>
                <p>In the case of modified crystals of this system the distortions are more complex.
                    Fig. 225 represents a crystal of cinnamonstone from Aberdeenshire; it is a
                    combination of the dodecahedron and the trapezohedron. Only four dodecahedral
                    faces remain (&lt;Z), and those of the trapezohedron (n) are of unequal size. It
                    may be best understood by regarding it as fig. 218 with the four vertical faces
                    of fig. 213; so that it combines the distortions of both of these figures.</p>
                <p>Crystals of diamond are very frequently distorted, though generally through
                    curvatures of their faces.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Imperfections in the Surfaces of Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>Of these the most important are striae, caverns, and curvatures.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Striated Surfaces.—</hi> The parallel furrows on the
                    surfaces of crystals are called striae, and such surfaces are said to be
                    striated.</p>
                <p>Each ridge on a striated surface is enclosed by two narrow planes. These planes
                    often correspond in position to a secondary or to the primary planes of the
                    crystal, and we may suppose these ridges to have been formed by repeated
                    oscillation in the operation of those causes which give rise, when acting
                    uninterruptedly, to larger planes. By this means the surfaces of a crystal are
                    marked in parallel lines with a succession of narrow planes, meeting at angles
                    alternately re-entering and salient, and constituting the ridges referred to.
                    This combination of different planes in the formation of a surface has been
                    termed an oscillation of faces.</p>
                <p>Cubes of pyrites are generally striated in such a way that the striae on adjacent
                    faces are at right angles to one another. These lines are parallel to the
                    intersections of the primary faces with the planes of the pentagonal
                    dodecahedron, which is the most common form of pyrites; and they have evidently
                    resulted from an oscillation between the primary and this secondary form.</p>
                <p>The rhombic dodecahedron is often striated parallel either with the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n386/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0386-0369"/> edges, or with the longer or the shorter diagonal
                    of its faces. In the first case, seen in garnet (fig. 226), there is a passage
                    into the sixfaced octahedron; the second results from an oscillatory combination
                    of the dodecahedron with the regular octahedron, as in magnetite; and the last
                    with the cube, as in aplome.</p>
                <p>Rhombohedrons of chabasite are often striated parallel to the terminal edges
                    (fig. 227), indicating an oscillatory combination between the primary faces and
                    a secondary plane which bevels these edges.</p>
                <p>Striation of faces is more frequent in the rhombohedral system than in any of the
                    others. Horizontal striae are of almost invariable occurrence in the prismatic
                    faces of quartz, whatever be the form of the crystal. The oscillation here has
                    taken place between the pyramidal and the prismatic faces (figs. 228, 229, 230).
                    During its growth there seems to have been a continued effort to complete the
                    crystal by the assumption of the terminal planes,—which effort was
                    intermittently overcome by a preponderating one to continue the deposition of
                    matter along its main axis. Quartz crystals, from these alternate efforts, often
                    taper to a point, without having any regular pyramidal face.</p>
                <p>Tho lateral planes of prisms of tourmaline are very frequently convex, owing to
                    oscillation between several lateral faces. In all such cases the interfacial
                    angles cannot be determined, as they are lost in the rounding.</p>
                <p>The striations on the lateral faces of foliated minerals are merely the edges of
                    laminae. Examples: mica and gypsum.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Cavernous Crystals.—</hi> Crystals not unfrequently occur
                    with a deep pyramidal depression occupying the place of each plane, as is often
                    observed in common salt, galena (fig. 21), and sulphur. In the solution of
                    crystals through atmospheric exposure, an approach to the same form is sometimes
                    obtained, owing to the fact that the centres of the faces yield sooner than the
                    edges and angles. Crystals of redruthite are often thus cavernous. Sometimes
                    octahedrons occur with a triangular cavity, in place of each face (fig. 22). The
                    same is met with in other forms.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Curved Surfaces. —</hi> Curved surfaces sometimes result
                    from the oscillatory combination already noticed. Otters result from a curvature
                    in the laminae constituting the crystal. Crystals of diamond have convex faces,
                    and are sometimes almost spheres. This mode of curvature, in which all the faces
                    are equally convex, is less common than that in which a convex surface is
                    opposite and parallel to a corresponding concave surface. Rhombohedrons of
                    spathic iron and pearl spar are usually thus curved, as is shown in fig. 231.
                    The saddle-shaped crystals of the same mineral (fig.</p>
                <p>232) are remarkable instances of several reversed curvatures in the same face. A
                    singular curvature is shown in fig. 233, of calcite. The conical crystals of
                    brown zinc blende, and the lenticular and conical crystals of gypsum, are other
                    examples. Crystals of quartz are sometimes curved and twisted. When this takes
                    place in the left-handed and right-handed crystals, the twist is to the right or
                    left according as the crystal is rightor left-handed.</p>
                <p>The surfaces of crystals are frequently far from flat, on account of fracture,
                    with dislocation of the several fragments, occasioned by motion in the enclosing
                    rock, the material of which is forced, or it may be transfused, into the rents.
                    The tourmalines and beryls (fig. 234) which occur in granitic dykes are very
                    subject to this, the fragments being often bent as well as displaced. A more or
                    less simultaneous effort in the crystallization of two substances may produce a
                    structure with the external form of one, the interior of which exhibits imbedded
                    crystals of the other, more or less perfect in their development. In pegmatite
                    or graphic granite, rude crystals of felspar contain skeleton forms of quartz,
                    of which generally only one side of the prism and two of the pyramid occur,
                    forming a rude lettering. Similar hollow quartz forms occur imbedded in garnet,
                    radiating from its centre (fig. 235), and roughening its surface from
                    protrusion, without distorting its form. Totally imbedded microscopic crystals,
                    “microliths,” are, as in the latter cases, chemically non-assimilable. These are
                    frequently arranged in layers in the including crystal, as in augite and
                    leucite. When there is a certain amount of chemical resemblance there may occur
                    a definiteness in the arrangement; and if the enclosed substance crystallizes in
                    a system differing from that of the mineral which includes it, the angles of the
                    latter are more or less distorted. This is the case in “microcline,” where the
                    intrusion of a plagioclastic felspar causes some departure from the
                    rectangularity of orthoclase. Foreign amorphous matter caught up or attaching
                    itself to the surfacer of a crystal, during the process of its growth, causes
                    lines of feeble cohesion,—as in the case of capped crystals of quartz. Here an
                    occasional selectiveness in the sets of faces to which the foreign matter
                    adheres seems to indicate that it has been to some extent under the influence of
                    a polarity in its adhesion. Something of the same kind seems to have influenced
                    the arrangement of the quartz grains caught up during the formation of the
                    crystal of garnet shown in fig. 236. The perfect modelling of rock crystals is,
                    however, but little interfered with by the almost numberless substances which
                    they contain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Aggregation of Crystals.</hi></p>
                <p>Crystalline aggregates which pass into amorphous masses may, in their more marked
                    or perfect form, be assigned to an imperfect twinning.</p>
                <p>Crystals are often grouped in linear series, as in native copper and silver, and
                    thus constitute long threads or reticulations. In clustered crystals those
                    adjoining each other are generally parallel in position, and are united by a
                    plane parallel to one of the principal sections, or to planes of common
                    occurrence. Senarmont mentions a union in galena, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n387/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0387-0370"/> parallel to the octahedral faces, as common; and
                    he also describes an instance where the union was parallel to the plane 3∣.</p>
                <p>The positions of crystals on the supporting rock seem at first to be without any
                    regularity. But by closer inspection we detect even here the same law of harmony
                    that governs the formation of the simple and compound crystal. The various
                    positions assumed correspond generally with the more common kinds of composition
                    in twin crystals. This regularity is not always manifest on account of the
                    unevenness of the surface on which they rest. In general, however, on glancing
                    over a surface covered with crystals, a reflexion from one face will be
                    accompanied with reflexions from the corresponding face in each of the other
                    crystals, showing that the crystals are similarly positioned throughout.</p>
                <p>This tendency to parallelism in the positions of associated crystals is apparent
                    even in crystalline aggregates. In granite, for example, which is composed of
                    felspar, quartz, and mica, the felspar crystallizations have usually a common
                    position; that is, the corresponding extremities lie in the same direction, or
                    nearly so. On this account granite is cleavable in one direction more easily
                    than in others, and this direction is that of the perfect cleavage plane of the
                    felspar; the second less perfect cleavage of the felspar permits of fracture of
                    the rock nearly at right angles to the first; but, as there is no such third
                    cleavage in the felspar, the workman, in fashioning the blocks of granite for
                    paving stones, is compelled to chip or dress them off in the third
                    direction.</p>
                <p>The dominant action of polarity may, moreover, give a parallel position to the
                    main axes of different minerals belonging to the same system, when crystallizing
                    in association, and even to those which belong to different systems. Fig. 237 is
                    an illustration of the first of such cases, where a crystal of zircon is
                    implanted into a crystal of xenotime, and has its main axis identically in the
                    same line. As illustrations of the latter—a parallel position of the axes of
                    crystals of different systems—there are records of such association in crystals
                    of cyanite and staurolite, of muscovite and haughtonite, of albite and
                    orthoclase. The same has been observed between crystals of rutile and specular
                    iron,—the crystals of rutile in this case having the vertical axis in the
                    direction of a lateral axis of the specular iron. Haidinger has observed
                    pyroxene and hornblende crystals associated in parallel positions.</p>
                <p>A prism of calcite terminating in the planes <hi rend="italic">g</hi> (fig. 106)
                    has been observed, in which each plane was covered with small crystals of quartz
                    all lying symmetrically, with their pyramids pointing towards the summit of the
                    calcite crystal. When one mineral is changed into another, a polarity of
                    accretion is still often seen to have dominated in the arrangement. In a crystal
                    of calcite which had been changed into a number of minute crystals of aragonite,
                    the main axes of the latter all lay in the direction of the main axis of the
                    original crystal of calcite.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Irregular Aggregation of Crystals.—</hi> Besides the regular
                    unions now described, crystals are often aggregated in peculiar ways, to which
                    no fixed laws can be assigned.</p>
                <p>Thus some crystals, apparently simple, are composed of concentric crusts or
                    shells, which may be removed one after the other, always leaving a smaller
                    crystal like a kernel, with smooth distinct faces. Some specimens of quartz from
                    Beeralston in Devonshire consist apparently of hollow hexagonal pyramids placed
                    one within another. Other minerals, as fluor-spar, apatite, idocrase, heavy
                    spar, and calc-spar, disclose a similar structure by bands of different colours.
                    A growth rendered intermittent through the deposition of a thin layer of foreign
                    matter is thus developed.</p>
                <p>Many large crystals, again, appear like an aggregate of numerous small crystals,
                    partly of the same partly of different forms. Thus some octahedrons of
                    fluor-spar from Schlaggenwald are made up of small dark violet-blue cubes, whose
                    projecting angles give a drusy character to the faces of the larger form. Such
                    polysynthetic crystals, as they may be called, are very common in calc-spar.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Forms of Crystalline Aggregates.—</hi> Crystals have often been
                    produced under conditions preventing the free development of their forms; and,
                    according to the direction of the axis in which the development has been
                    checked, they may be divided into “columnar” and “lamellar” arrangements.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">columnar</hi> structure is made up of a more or less
                    fibrous arrangement; and this may be supposed to have accrued from the
                    simultaneous growth of a multitude of crystals from a single or from closely
                    adjacent centres of support, so that, while the crystals were free to elongate
                    themselves in the direction of their main axis, their increase was restrained
                    laterally, by their impact upon one another. When the surfaces of support are
                    level, or consist of the opposing sides of a vein, the columns or fibres,
                    frequently exceedingly delicate, are parallel, and not unfrequently they then
                    have a silky lustre. In the latter of the above circumstances the fibres are
                    disposed transversely to the vein. Examples: gypsum, chrysotile, satin-spar.
                    When the surface of support is rough, or has angular projections, the fibres
                    radiate from certain of these in all directions, producing, in a thin vein, a
                    starlike form, whence the arrangement is called “stellular.” Example: wavellite.
                    When this takes place in an open cavity, producing brush-like forms, they are
                    termed “radiant.” Examples: antimonite, needlestone. When the points of
                    divergent growth are so positioned that the radiating groups interlace with one
                    another, the structure is said to be “reticulated,” from its resemblance to a
                    net. Example: tremolite. When individual members of such fibrous structure
                    project above the general surface with acuminated extremities, they are said to
                    be “acicular”; when the protruding columns are of uniform thickness they are
                    termed “bacillary,” or rod-like. Such terms as straight, curved,
                    twisted-columnar, diverging, or confused-fibrous explain themselves. Such
                    fibrous arrangements as the above may occur imbedded centrally in a rock mass,
                    which had been the magma out of which they were formed; or they may line the
                    inner surface of cavities, filled originally either with water or aqueous
                    vapour. These modes of occurrence have been distinguished by Mohs as crystal
                    groups and druses. The former includes all unions of imbedded crystals round a
                    central nucleus; the latter those of crystals of simultaneous or regularly
                    successive growth on a common support. In the first case, there may be
                    spheroidal, ellipsoidal, cockscomb, or other forms, frequently seen in
                    marcasite, pyrite, and gypsum. In the second, spheroidal forms are less rare,
                    but are seen in the case of several of the fibrous zeolites. In such cases
                    surfaces more or less rough are coated, and diminished in angularity, through
                    the hemispherical forms produced by the radiation of a multitude of fibres.
                    Certain imitative outlines thus result from the successive deposition of layers
                    of these crystals. These forms or uniting masses are termed “globular” when
                    nearly spherical, “botryoidal” when like bunches of grapes, “reniform” or
                    kidney-shaped when the spheres are larger, more confluent, and less distinct,
                    and “mammillated” when the masses are nearertohemispheres. Mesolite occurs in
                    globular forms; prehnite in botryoidal; haematite and chalcedony in reniform;
                    and siderite and calamine in mammillated. In all the above cases the transverse
                    fracture of such structures discloses the fibrous arrangement of the parts; but,
                    if the growth has been intermittent, lines of deposit, concentric with the
                    central nucleus of each sphere, are evidenced by layers of distinct colours.
                    Fracture or separation frequently takes place, also, along such lines. In such
                    drusy cavities—termed “geodes” when they are circular— after a certain number of
                    such lines of deposit, grouped arrangements which have somewhat more of free
                    crystalline development may assume other imitative forms in which there is a
                    certain dependence on the crystallographic character of the mineral concerned.
                    There are thus produced coralloidal or coral-like groups, fruticose or
                    cauliflower-like groups, capillary or hair-like, and filiform or thread-like or
                    wire-like forms. Often these groups expand in several directions, and produce
                    arborescent, dendritic, plumose, mossy, dentiform, or other forms. Such are
                    common among the native metals; as gold, silver, and copper. Mesolite is very
                    frequently plumose. A “drusy crust” is the term applied to a thin rough layer of
                    crystals, which invests either a large crystal or the surface of some other body
                    lodged in the interior of cavities.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">lamellar</hi> structure a development along the main
                    axis would appear to have been checked, and the crystallographic force to have
                    expended itself laterally; though this is not the invariable habit of a species
                    under all circumstances, as exemplified by baryte. This structure consists of
                    flat crystals, plates, or leaves. It is termed “tabular” when the plates are of
                    uniform thickness, “lenticular” when they are thinner on the edges,
                    “wedge-shaped” when sharp on one edge, “scaly” when the plates are thin and
                    small, “foliaceous” when larger and easily separable; “micaceous” is also used
                    to describe this kind of structure. It may also be curved lamellar and straight
                    lamellar. Wollastonite, when flat lamellar, is called tabular spar; gypsum is
                    frequently lenticular, talc scaly. Lamellar minerals when radiating from a
                    centre often form fanshaped, wheel-like, almond-shaped, comb-like, and other
                    groups.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">granular</hi> structure, the force of crystallization
                    nas been exerting itself along all the axes; but, from the multiplicity of
                    crystallizing centres, there has been such mutual interference that no single
                    individuals havo been able to assume perfect or even characteristic forms. The
                    particles in a granular structure differ much in size. When coarse, the mineral
                    is described as coarsely granular; when fine, finely granular; if not
                    distinguishable by the naked eye, the structure is termed impalpable. Examples
                    of the first may be observed in granular carbonate of lime, of the <pb

                    last in chalcedony, opal, and other species.</p>
                <p>The above terms are indefinite, but of necessity, as there is every degree of
                    fineness of structure in the mineral species, from perfectly impalpable, through
                    all possible shades, to the coarsest granular. The term phanero-crystalline has
                    been used for varieties in which the grains are distinct, and crypto-crystalline
                    for those in which they are not discernible without the aid of a lens. Granular
                    minerals, when easily crumbled in the fingers, are said to be friable.</p>
                <p>The minute or crypto-crystalline minerals form aggregates somewhat similar to the
                    above. When globular or oolitic, the minute crystals often appear to radiate
                    from a centre, or form concentric crusts. These are often globular or nodular;
                    as in dolomite. Somewhat similar are the stalactites and stalagmites, in which
                    the mineral (especially rock-salt, calc-spar, malachite, haematite, limonite)
                    has been deposited from a fluid dropping slowly from some overhanging body, or
                    some rent in the roof of a cave. In this case there is generally found a long
                    pendent cylinder or cone, the principal axis of which, generally hollow, is
                    vertical, whilst the marginal parts are arranged at right angles to it, except
                    where they curve round the termination of the tube, when they become
                    hemispherical.</p>
                <p>By far the largest masses of the mineral kingdom have, however, been produced
                    under conditions in which a free development of their forms was excluded, and
                    are termed amorphous. This has been the case with the greater portion of the
                    minerals composing rocks or filling veins and dykes. The structure of these
                    masses on the large scale belongs to geology, but some varieties of the
                    textures, visible in hand specimens, may be noticed. The individual grains or
                    masses have seldom any regular form, but appear round, long, or flat, according
                    to circumstances, and as each has been more or less checked in the process of
                    formation. Even then, however, a certain regularity in the position of the parts
                    is often observable, as in graphic granite, where the axes of the skeleton
                    crystals of quartz are parallel. The rock is termed massive when the grains
                    which form it are small, or granular when they are longer and more distinct.
                    Sometimes the rock becomes slaty, dividing into thin plates; or concretionary,
                    forming roundish masses; at other times the interposition of some foreign
                    substance (gas or vapour) has rendered it porous, cellular, or vesicular, giving
                    rise to drusy cavities. These cavities are often empty, but have occasionally
                    been more or less filled by products of change in the rock. It is named
                    amygdaloidal when the cavities so filled have the form of an almond.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Changes of Crystalline Structure.</hi></p>
                <p>“Pseudomorphs” are minerals which appear under a form of crystallization which
                    does not belong to the species. They may be recognized either by their having no
                    cleavage, which is most usual, or by their cleavage being altogether different
                    in direction from that of the mineral imitated. Generally they have rounded
                    angles, rough and dull surfaces, and when broken show a granular structure. The
                    faces of the crystal, moreover, are often covered with minute crystals of a form
                    different from that of the mineral imitated, but which is that belonging to the
                    substance now present. Occasionally the resemblance to real crystals is so
                    perfect, from the perfect polish of the faces, that they are distinguished with
                    difficulty. They may be frequently found still undergoing change.</p>
                <p>Pseudomorphs have been classed under four heads</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Pseudomorphs by Alteration.—</hi> Formed by a gradual change
                    of composition in a species. Of these there are two varieties: they may be
                    pseudomorphous by loss of an ingredient, or by addition of an ingredient; change
                    of augite to steatite is an example of the first, and of galena into anglesite
                    is one of the second.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pseudomorphs by Substitution.</hi> —Those formed by the
                    replacement of a mineral which has been removed, or is gradually undergoing
                    removal; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> galena takes the form of pyromorphite.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pseudomorphs by Incrustation.—</hi> Those formed through the
                    incrustation of a crystal, which may be subsequently dissolved away. Often the
                    cavity is afterwards filled by infiltration; <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> change
                    of fluor to quartz.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Pseudomorphs by Paramorphism.—</hi> Those formed when a
                    mineral passes from one dimorphous state to another; <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> change of aragonite to calcite.</p>
                <p>These different kinds of change are not always distinguishable. In some cases a
                    change may take place through alteration of the surface, and then, this process
                    ceasing, the interior may be dissolved out, leaving a pseudomorph like one of
                    incrustation; or a pseudomorph that appears to be a result of mere chemical
                    alteration may be wholly due to substitution simply.</p>
                <p>Again, changes of scapolite to a felspar, and of augite to uralite (hornblende),
                    have been considered by Scheerer examples of paramorphism,—scapolite being
                    considered dimorphous with some felspars, and augite with hornblende. But, while
                    such paramorphic changes undoubtedly take place with aragonite, their occurrence
                    in these silicates—which are common associates in the same rock, and must have
                    been formed under like circumstances—is hardly probable.</p>
                <p>Where mineral bodies have taken the form of organisms, it is more a case of
                    molecular replacement than of true pseudomorphism.</p>
                <p>Pseudomorphism should be understood, however, to consist, not simply in
                    alteration of crystals, but in many instances of changes in beds of rock. Thus
                    all serpentine, whether in mountain masses or in simple crystals, has been
                    formed through a process of pseudomorphism—or, iu more general language, of
                    metamorphism—of olivine and augite. The same is true of other magnesian rocks,
                    as steatitic, talcose, and chlorite slates. The crystalline rocks often offer
                    examples of a change similar in nature. The graphite of these rocks is probably
                    but a metamorph of some vegetable organism. Thus the subject of metamorphism, as
                    it bears on all crystalline rocks, and that of pseudomorphism, are but branches
                    of one system of phenomena; the chemistry of both is the same, and a knowledge
                    of such changes is indispensable to a study of the older rock strata of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>The common change of pyrites, forming the main ingredient of the upper part of
                    metallic lodes, to earthy red or brown iron ore, thus producing the “gossan” of
                    miners, is one of many examples of these processes now in progress. Often the
                    gossan contains disseminated silver or gold, derived from the decomposed ores.
                    This is a case of pseudomorphism, as truly as when a simple crystal of pyrites
                    becomes limonite; the mode of change and its laws are the same. Again,
                    phosphates, vanadiates, and arsen ia tes of lead, &amp;c., as well as carbonates
                    and sulphates, are among the surface species, or those that occupy the upper
                    part of metallic lodes; they are the results of alteration within those depths
                    to which atmospheric agencies penetrate.</p>
                <p>Pseudomorphs are always records of past existences, in some cases they may be the
                    only evidence we possess of such prior existence. Figs. 238, 239 are
                    pseudomorphs of quartz or hornstone after datholite; the measured angles of
                    these crystals show that the imitated crystal was datholite; but that mineral
                    does not now occur in crystals of either of these forms.</p>
                <p>The process of petrification of organic bodies is in reality a species of
                    pseudomorphic formation, and has been produced in all the above modes. External
                    and internal casts of organic bodies are not uncommon. In other cases the
                    original substance has been replaced by some mineral which has preserved, not
                    merely the external form, but even the minutest detail of internal structure,
                    —so that the different kinds of wood have been distinguished in their silicified
                    trunks. The most common petrifying substances are silica and carbonate of lime.
                    In encrinites, echinites, belemnites, and other fossils, the crystals of
                    calc-spar often occur in very regular positions. In some varieties of petrified
                    wood both the ligneous structure and the cleavage of the calc-spar are
                    observable.</p>
                <p>Different from the above are mineralized bodies, in which the original structure
                    is still retained, but their chemical nature partially changed. In these a
                    complete series may be often traced, as from 'wood or peat, through the
                    varieties of brown coal, common coal, anthracite, and graphite.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Causes of Change.—</hi> The causes of change are the simplest
                    and most universal operations about us :—(1) the process of gradual alteration
                    to which some substances are liable on account of the presence of oxygen and
                    carbonic acid in the atmosphere, and the reaction of substances thus formed on
                    adjacent ingredients, aided or promoted by electrical currents or by heat; (2)
                    the solvent power of ordinary waters, cold or hot, or of steam; (3) reactions,
                    in accordance with chemical principles, of the ⅛gredients <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0389-0372"/> dissolved in these waters, or in mineral or sea
                    waters, heated or at the ordinary temperature; (4) the action of gases exhaling
                    from the earth; (5) changes referable to volcanic action.</p>
                <p>Ordinary waters hold in solution, as is well known, more or less of mineral
                    matter. When water containing carbonic acid is passed through a large number of
                    ordinarily occurring minerals, it gives evidence of the presence of an alkali,
                    or lime, or magnesia; and some of these minerals give the tests even with the
                    first drops. Pure water gives with many of them a similar result, but more
                    slowly. Limestone in forty-eight hours yields soluble ingredients to the extent
                    of 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 4 to 1 per cent, of the whole mass. The
                    lime, magnesia, and alkalies appear in the condition of carbonates; and the iron
                    passes from the state of carbonate to that of peroxide during evaporation. The
                    silicates of magnesia, lime, and manganese are especially ready in yielding to
                    this action. Silica, however, is more soluble in ordinary than in carbonated
                    water.</p>
                <p>These facts illustrate two important points :—(1) that ordinary waters lying upon
                    and filtering through the earth’s crust are constantly active in dissolving and
                    decomposing minerals and rocks, and that even species reputed indestructible are
                    thus acted upon; and (2) that the waters are thus furnishing themselves with
                    agents capable of effecting other chemical changes. These waters penetrate all
                    rocks, as well as percolate through soils. Hence the action is a universal one,
                    everywhere going on; and the results are universal. Bones, shells, corals, and
                    animal remains generally are also sources of carbonate of lime, phosphates, and
                    fluorides; and plants may contribute also potash and soda, and sometimes
                    silica.</p>
                <p>Carbonic acid is a constant ingredient of the atmosphere, and is dissolved by the
                    rains as they descend; hence this active decomposing agent is present in all
                    ordinary waters; but it is also a result of different mineral changes. Sulphate
                    of iron along with vegetable matters gives oxygen to the carbon of the vegetable
                    matter, and thus produces carbonic acid and pyrites or sulphuret of iron; and
                    the large quantities of pyrites in coal-beds show on how grand a scale this
                    process has taken place. Sulphate of zinc in a similar manner produces carbonic
                    acid and blende or sulphuret of zinc. Bischof observes that the carbonic acid
                    which has thus been eliminated must have been sufficient in quantity to make an
                    atmosphere of carbonic acid equal in height to our present atmosphere. Again,
                    decomposition of sulphurets produces sulphuretted hydrogen; this by the
                    oxidating action of the atmosphere forms sulphuric acid, and the sulphuric acid
                    acting on limestone produces gypsum, and liberates carbonic acid. Sulphurous
                    acid is also generated in the neighbourhood of volcanoes, and rapidly becomes
                    sulphuric acid, with the same result. Moreover, silica in waters, if aided by
                    heat, will decompose limestone and liberate carbonic acid. Hence it is that this
                    gas is exceedingly common in exhalations from mineral springs; indeed it occurs
                    more or less in all waters.</p>
                <p>The dissolving and decomposing action of carbonated waters is therefore general.
                    The sea also partakes of this character, and, in virtue of the numerous salts
                    which it holds dissolved, is a powerful agent in carrying on the changes to
                    which the process leads. Such changes and the various pseudomorphs to which they
                    give rise have to be regarded as types and evidences of vast metamorphic
                    transformations,—processes either of decay or of reformation which have modified
                    widespread rock-masses,’and which are at the present time altering the structure
                    of the crust of the earth. It is through a study of pseudomorphs, and of the
                    processes which have gone to form them, that mineralogy is to become the germ
                    from which alone the petrological department of geology can have its true
                    development, and become a living instead of a merely speculative science.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Physical Properties of Minerals.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Characters Depending on Light.</hi></p>
                <p>There are few more interesting departments of science than the relations of
                    mineral bodies to light, and the modifications which it undergoes either when
                    passing through them or when reflected from their surface. In this place,
                    however, we only notice these phenomena so far as they point out distinctions in
                    the internal constitution of minerals, or furnish characters for distinguishing
                    one species from another.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lustre.—</hi> Though the varieties of lustre admit of no
                    precise or mathematical determination, they are of considerable value in
                    mineralogy. One highly important distinction founded on them is that between
                    minerals of metallic and non-metallic aspect or character. Transparency and
                    opacity nearly coincide with this division,—the metallic minerals being almost
                    constantly opaque, the non-metallic more or less transparent. Minerals which are
                    perfectly opaque, and show the peculiar brilliancy and opacity of surface of
                    polished metals, are named metallic; those which possess these properties in an
                    inferior degree are semi-metallic; and those without these properties are
                    non-metallic.</p>
                <p>Lustre has reference to either the intensity or the quality of the reflected
                    light, considered as distinct from colour. Several degrees in intensity have
                    been named :—(1) splendent, when a mineral reflects light so perfectly as to be
                    visible at a great distance, and lively and well-defined images are formed in
                    its faces, as galena, specular iron, or cassiterite; (2) shining, when the
                    reflected light is weak, and only forms indistinct and cloudy images, as heavy
                    spar or calcite; (3) glistening, when the reflected light is so feeble as not to
                    be observable at a greater distance than arm’s length, and no longer forms an
                    image, as talc; (4) glimmering, when the mineral held near the eye in full clear
                    daylight presents only a number of small shining points, as red haematite and
                    granular limestone. When, as in chalk or kaolin, the lustre is so feeble as to
                    be indiscernible, the mineral is said to be dull.</p>
                <p>In regard to the kind or quality of the lustre, the following varieties are
                    distinguished :—(1) the metallic, seen in much perfection in native metals and
                    their compounds with sulphur, and imperfectly in glance coal; (2) adamantine,
                    found in beautiful perfection in the diamond, and in some varieties of blende
                    and cerussite; a modification is metallic adamantine, as seen in wolfram and
                    black cerussite; (3) vitreous or glassy, seen in rock crystal, or common glass,
                    or, inclining to adamantine, in flint glass; sub-vitreous is seen in broken
                    calcite; (4) resinous, when the body appears as if smeared with oil, as in
                    pitchstone, blende, and garnet; (5) waxy, like beeswax, as seen in wax-opal and
                    ozocerite; (6) pearly, like mother-of-pearl, seen in gyrolite, talc, heulandite;
                    (7) silky, the glimmering lustre seen on fine fibrous aggregates like amianthus,
                    tremolite, chrysotile, krokidolite.</p>
                <p>These degrees and kinds of lustre are generally exhibited differently by unlike
                    faces of the same crystal, but always similarly by like faces. The lateral faces
                    of a right square prism may thus differ in lustre from that of a terminal face.
                    Thus the lustre of the lateral faces of apophyllite is vitreous, while that of
                    the terminal, at right angles thereto, is pearly; chrysotile is silky when split
                    along the fibres, dull when at right angles to them.</p>
                <p>The surface of a cleavage plane, in foliated minerals, generally differs in
                    lustre from the sides; and here again in some cases the latter are vitreous,
                    while the former is pearly, as in heulandite.</p>
                <p>As shown by Haidinger, only the vitreous, adamantine, and metallic lustres belong
                    to faces perfectly smooth and pure. In the first, the index of refraction of the
                    mineral is 1 ‘3 to 1 *8; in the second, Γ9 to 2 ’ 5; in the third, above 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5. The pearly lustre is a result of reflexion from
                    numberless lamellae, or cleavage planes, within a translucent mineral; and in
                    hydrated minerals, as in the zeolites, it is the result of incipient
                    change,—namely, a loss of water which ensues upon exposure to the
                    atmosphere.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Colour.—</hi> This is a property which is of very inferior
                    value. Minerals are so seldom, if ever, absolutely pure that very minute
                    quantities of an intensely coloured impurity may impart colour to a substance
                    inherently colourless, or overpower a feebler colour which may be its own.</p>
                <p>Some few minerals have colour so strong, or have a constitution so little
                    susceptible of intermixture, that they retain almost unimpaired the colour
                    special to them. Such a substance is pyrite; its brass-yellow colour maybe
                    heightened to gold-yellow by intermixture with copper sulphide, or it may be
                    slightly bleached by arsenic; but the nature of its composition does not admit
                    of the intrusion of ordinary colouring ingredients. The yellow of native gold,
                    again, may be paled by impoverishment with the white of silver, down to the dull
                    tint of electrum; but no foreign colouring matter can intrude itself into a
                    metallic mass. Such substances as these,—native metals, sulphides, and
                    oxides,—have colours essential to them, dependent on their constitution, and to
                    a great extent characteristic of the species.</p>
                <p>A second class of minerals are colourless of themselves, and thus very subject to
                    the influence of minute quantities of foreign tinctorial impurity. These are
                    absolutely transparent and devoid of colour when in crystals, but white and
                    opaque when reduced to powder; as ice and snow, calcite and chalk, rock-crystal
                    and sand. But such substances are generally coloured; “muddied” it would be
                    called in the first case, though it is equally so with the others. Such false
                    colour may be imparted in several ways. It may be (1) from their holding
                    dissolved some colouring matter; (2) from mechanical mixture of colouring
                    substances such as metallic oxides, or minute crystals (“endomorphs”) of another
                    mineral; or <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n390/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0390-0373"/> (3) from chemical replacement,—the substitution
                    of a smaller or larger quantity of a coloured isomorphous ingredient.</p>
                <p>As illustration of the first, silica, colourless in rock-crystal, has been found
                    of almost every tint, due frequently to volatile hydrocarbons which are
                    dissipated by heat. Fluorite also, found of almost every shade of every colour,
                    may possibly be to a certain extent referred here.</p>
                <p>Quartz, felspar, and calcite are often coloured accidentally by imbedded layers
                    of foreign “inclusions,” or by “spangling endomorphs.” These are mechanically
                    mixed, so far as regards their presence in a structure of different and
                    non-assimilable chemical composition, but crystallographically arranged. They
                    either mark the lines of interrupted or intermittent growth; or, in the case of
                    endomorphs, the axial positions of the minute intruding foreign crystals lie in
                    one plane, or in the same sets of planes.</p>
                <p>As an instance of colours introduced through definite chemical replacement,
                    calcite may be cited. Carbonate of lime is colourless; if a portion of this be
                    replaced by carbonate of magnesia there is a certain amount of pearly opacity;
                    if by carbonate of manganese, of a pink tinge; if by carbonate of iron, of
                    yellow, which may be increased through oxygen absorption and “weathering” to an
                    ochre tint, and ultimately to a dark brown.</p>
                <p>Sulphuret of zinc, chemically white, and mineralogically transparent, may,
                    through metallic substitution, be found of almost all tints of yellow, orange,
                    brown, and black. Again, hornblende, augite, and garnet,—silicates, which in
                    their purest states of tremolite, malacolite, and water garnet are
                    colourless,—acquire green, brown, red, and black tints from the assimilation of
                    other metallic silicates.</p>
                <p>Hence it would appear that a very advanced practical knowledge of the subject is
                    necessary to enable us to avail ourselves of the information which is to be
                    derived from this external feature.</p>
                <p>The accidentally coloured minerals sometimes present two or more colours or
                    tints, even in a single crystal,—very remarkable examples occurring in
                    fluor-spar, apatite, sapphire, amethyst, tourmaline, and cyanite. This is still
                    more common in compound minerals, on which the colours are variously arranged in
                    points, streaks, clouds, veins, stripes, bands, or in brecciated and ruin-like
                    forms. Some minerals again change their colour from exposure to light, the air,
                    or damp. Then either the surface alone is affected or “tarnished,” and appears
                    covered as with a thin film, producing in some minerals, as silver and arsenic,
                    only one colour; in others, as chalcopyrite, haematite, bismuth, stibine, and
                    anthracite, various or iridescent hues, when they are said to have a pavonine
                    lustre. Or occasionally the change pervades the whole mineral, the colour either
                    becoming paler, or disappearing, as in chrysoprase and rose-quartz, or becoming
                    darker, as in brown spar, siderite, and rhodonite. In a few minerals a complete
                    change of colour takes place, as in heterosite, and in the chlorophaeite of the
                    Western Isles of Scotland, which, on exposure for a few’ hours, passes from a
                    transparent yellow-green to black. These mutations are generally connected with
                    some chemical or physical change. The tarnished colours sometimes only appear on
                    certain faces of a crystal belonging to a peculiar form. Thus a crystal of
                    copper pyrites (like fig. 89) has one face P' free from tarnish; the faces <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> and c, close to P <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi>, dark
                    blue; the remainder of c, first violet, and then, close to P, gold-yellow'.</p>
                <p>Some crystalline minerals exhibit in certain directions a very lively play or
                    change of colours from reflected light. It is well seen in many various hues on
                    the cleavage-planes of labradorite, and seems produced by a multitude of very
                    thin quadrangular pores, interposed in the mineral, like minute parallel
                    laminae. On the cleavage-plane &gt; of hypersthene it appears copper-red, and is
                    occasioned by similar pores, or by numerous small brown or black laminae of some
                    foreign substance interposed in a parallel position between the planes of the
                    hypersthene. The chatoyant or changing colours of the sun-stone arise from
                    scales of haematite similarly interposed, and that of avanturine from scales of
                    mica. The play of colour in the noble opal seems to be produced very nearly in
                    the same manner as that in the labradorite. A similar opalescence is seen in
                    certain minerals when cut in particular forms. In the sapphire, cut
                    hemispherically over the chief axis, it appears like a star with six rays; in
                    garnet it shows four rays; in certain varieties of chrysoberyl and of adularia
                    it has a bluish tint; and it is also very remarkable in the cat’s-eye variety of
                    quartz. Iridescence often arises from very fine fissures, producing semicircular
                    arches of prismatic tints, which, like the colours of thin plates in general,
                    are referred to the interference of light.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Streak.—</hi> This name is applied to the appearance and the
                    colour of the line or furrow produced in minerals by drawing the edge of a
                    hard-tempered knife or file along their surface, or to the stain obtained by
                    rubbing a soft mineral on such a substance as paper or porcelain. Taken along
                    with the hardness, which may to a certain extent be determined by the same
                    operation, it is one of the most valuable tests which we possess.</p>
                <p>The furrow mav be lustrous or it may be dull. Powder or splinters may lie along
                    its course, or a still adherent ridge may have been merely rolled over. The
                    furrow and the powder may each be possessed of colour, though such may not be
                    distinguishable in the mineral, or may have a colour quite different from that
                    of the mineral. Three illustrations of the usefulness of this test may suffice.
                    Argentiferous gold, chalcopyrite, and pyrite, differing immensely in value, may
                    readily be mistaken for each other. The knife, when drawn along the surface of
                    the first, sticks in it, ruts up an adhering ridge, and leaves a shining streak
                    of the same colour as the specimen. When drawn along the second it ruts up a
                    trench covered with a dusty powder, which when rubbed on paper or in the hand is
                    greenish yellow. When drawn along the third it has no effect, as pyrite is
                    harder than the knife. Psilomelane, haematite, and limonite all occur in black,
                    glossy, stalactitic forms, and have all been termed “black haematite.” There is
                    here also great difference in the value. The knife makes little impression on
                    psilomelane, but leaves a blue lustrous line; it makes a blood-red line in
                    haematite, and a rich ochre-yellow in limonite. Graphite and molybdenite both
                    crystallize in hexagonal plates, both occur in the same rocks, both have a gι ’
                    ey-black colour and a brilliant metallic lustre, both stain the hands or paper;
                    the streak of the first—best seen on paper—is black, tending to blue; that of
                    the last is greenish. Rough porcelain is the best material for determining the
                    streak of soft minerals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diaphaneity.—</hi> Minerals, and even different specimens of
                    the same species, vary much in this quality. Some transmit so much light that
                    small objects can be clearly seen, or letters read, when placed behind them;
                    such are named transparent. They are semitransparent when the object is seen
                    only dimly, as through a cloud, and translucent when the light that passes
                    through is so broken that the form of the object can be no longer discerned;
                    some minerals are only thus translucent on the thinnest edges. Others transmit
                    no light, and are named opaque.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Refraction.—</hi> It has already been mentioned that most
                    crystals—all, in fact, except those of the cubical system— exhibit the phenomena
                    of double refraction. For a general explanation of these phenomena the reader is
                    referred to <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xv. p. 609 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.</hi></p>
                <p>The direction in which there is no double refraction is named the optic axis of
                    the crystal,—sometimes, less happily, the axis of double refraction. Now in
                    certain minerals it is found that there is only one direction with this
                    property, whereas in other’s there are two such directions; and they have in
                    consequence been divided into uniaxal and binaxal. To the former belong all
                    crystals of the tetragonal and hexagonal systems, to the latter all those of the
                    other three systems. In the former the optic axis coincides with or is parallel
                    to the crystallographic chief axis. In some uniaxal crystals the index of
                    refraction for the extraordinary ray is greater than for the ordinary ray; and
                    in others it is smaller. According as it is greater or less they are said to
                    have positive (attractive) or negative (repulsive) double refraction.</p>
                <p>Quartz is an example of the former, the index of refraction, according to Malus,
                    being for 0 = 1’5484, for E=1’5582; calc-spar of the latter, the index of 0
                    being =1’6543, that of E 1’4833. The index of E is in both cases taken at its
                    maximum.</p>
                <p>It should be observed that the optic axes are not single lines, but directions
                    parallel to a line, passing through every part of the crystal. It is also
                    important to remark that this property divides crystals into three precise
                    groups :—the cubic, with single refraction; the tetragonal and hexagonal, with
                    double refraction, and uniaxal; those of the other three systems, also double,
                    but binaxal. These properties are therefore of the greatest use in determining

                <p><hi rend="italic">Polarization.—</hi> Intimately connected with this property is
                    that of the polarization of light, which affords an easier means of determining
                    mineralogical characteristics than the direct study of double refraction. For
                    the elements of this subject see <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xv. p.

                <p>While a consideration of the optic axes enabled us merely to arrange the systems
                    of crystallization in three groups, the phenomena of polarization not only bear
                    out a further subdivision of the whole into the above six systems, but disclose,
                    in many cases, phenomena markedly special to individual species. The optical
                    consideration of these phenomena enables us to fix three directions at <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n391/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0391-0374"/> right angles to one another—called the axes of
                    optical elasticity—such that the effect of the crystal on the luminous
                    vibrations of the elastic ether is a maximum in one of these directions, a
                    minimum in a second, and a maximum-minimum in the third. The length of these
                    axes is chosen in terms of this action. In certain cases the direction of the
                    axes of optical elasticity is different for light of different colours.</p>
                <p>The position of these axes in relation to the crystallographic axes, and the
                    ratios of their lengths, enable us to class all crystals as follows:—</p>
                <p>1. Crystals of the cubic system. Here the three axes of elasticity are all equal.
                    The refraction is simple.</p>
                <p>2. Crystals of the tetragonal and of the rhombohedral systems. Two of the axes of
                    optical elasticity are equal in these systems; the third is greater or less
                    according as the crystals are negative or positive. The two equal axes lie in a
                    plane perpendicular to the principal crystallographic axes; the third axis
                    coincides with the principal axis.</p>
                <p>3. Crystals of the right prismatic system. The direction of the three axes of
                    optical elasticity coincides with the crystallographic axes, taken parallel to
                    the diagonals of the base of the rhombohedron, and to the vertical edge of the
                    prism (the primitive parallelepiped of Levy).</p>
                <p>4. Crystals of the oblique prismatic system. Only one of the axes of optical
                    elasticity coincides necessarily with the crystallographical horizontal axis, or
                    the diagonally horizontal axis of the rhombic base, the direction of the two
                    others not having any evident relation, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> with
                    the inclined or diagonally inclined axis of the base, and with the vertical axis
                    (or vertical edge of the primitive parallelepiped).</p>
                <p>5. Crystals of the anorthic system. The three axes of optical elasticity have no
                    relation that can be assigned <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> to the
                    crystallographic axes, whatever position may be assigned to these in relation to
                    the primitive solid.</p>
                <p>In crystals belonging to the last three systems the three axes of elasticity are
                    unequal.</p>
                <p>The axes of elasticity are in general such that a ray passing through the crystal
                    in the direction of any one of them is divided into two, which follow that
                    direction with different velocities depending on the lengths of the other two
                    axes. To any other direction there will in general also correspond two different
                    velocities; but their ratio will now depend in a more complex manner on all
                    three axes. In two directions (and only in two, if the axes are all unequal) the
                    ratio becomes unity, or the ray is not divided. These directions are the optic
                    axes.</p>
                <p>The displacement of the axes of elasticity for light of different colours,
                    already mentioned, takes place for two axes in crystals of the oblique prismatic
                    system and for all three axes in the anorthic <hi rend="italic">{i,e.,</hi>
                    doubly oblique) system. In the other systems it does not occur.</p>
                <p>In order to follow the distinctive features of the different systems farther, it
                    is necessary to consider the colour phenomena which they display, when examined
                    in a beam of polarized light. Various instruments have been devised for this
                    purpose, as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the polarizing apparatus of
                    Norrenberg, fitted with a condensing lens below and above the crystal slice, or
                    with a low-power (3-inch) eye-piece. The polariscope of Hoffman of Paris is more
                    efficient, but the apparatus of Descloizeaux (fig. 240), who has made this mode
                    of investigation a special study, has the widest scope of usefulness. In this
                    apparatus a blackened mirror is employed for polarizing the light, taking the
                    place of a tourmaline plate, a Nicol’s prism, or a bundle of thin glass. The
                    mirror is inferior to the other two in completeness of polarizing power, and in
                    not admitting of rotation; while it shares this defect with the last. It is,
                    however, superior to all in extent of field, while it does not, like the first,
                    affect white light. A Nicol’s prism is used for examining or analysing the light
                    which passes.</p>
                <p>The description of the many beautiful phenomena that may be observed witn
                    polarizing apparatus when applied to sections of crvstak belongs to the subject
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics (Physical),</hi> to which heading also we must
                    refer for the phenomena of circular polarization.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Double Refraction and Polarization of Composite Crystals.—</hi>
                    In all the crystallized bodies whose action upon light we have been considering,
                    the phenomena are identical in all parallel directions, the smallest fragment
                    having the same property as the largest, from whatever part of the crystal it is
                    taken. In the mineral world, however (and among the products of artificial
                    crystallization), there occur crystals which are composed of several individual
                    crystals whose axes are not parallel. These crystals sometimes occur in such
                    regular symmetrical forms that mineralogists have long regarded them as simple
                    forms; and it is probable that they would have still been so viewed if they had
                    not been exposed to the scrutiny of polarized light.</p>
                <p>A composite structure has been observed in the case of Brazilian topaz, sulphate
                    of potash, and apophyllite. Bipyramidal sulphate of potash, which Count Bournon
                    supposed to be a simple crystal, was found to be a tesselated crystal, composed
                    of three pairs of crystals of the prismatic sulphate of potash combined so that
                    each pair had their principal axes parallel. When exposed to polarized light,
                    each pair gave the system of binaxal rings, and when held at a distance from the
                    eye had the tesselated appearance shown in fig. 241, each opposite pair of the
                    triangles having the same tint.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable of this class of minerals is the tesselated apophyllite. The
                    examination of this body by polarized light is due to Brewster. F or his results
                    the reader is referred to his paper in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh

                <p>Figs. 242, 243 are representations of the figure produced in polarized light by
                    an internal slice of the barrel or cylindrical apophyllite from Kudlisaet, in
                    Disco Island. The figures are from different specimens. The shaded part of them
                    has only one axis of double refraction, while the four sectors have two axes.
                    The mechanical structure of the cleavage planes resembles the optical figure
                    even after the planes are ground.</p>
                <p>The minerals stilbite, heulandite, chabasite, and many others, are similarly

                <p><hi rend="italic">Crystals with Planes of Double Refraction.—</hi> Analcime, a
                    mineral ranked among the cubical crystals, was found by Brewster to be singular
                    in its action upon light, and to exhibit the extraordinary property .of many
                    planes of double refraction, or planes to which the double-refracting structure
                    was related in the same manner as it is to one or two axes in other minerals. It
                    crystallizes most commonly in the form of the icositetrahedron. If we suppose a
                    complete crystal of it to be exposed to polarized light, it will give the
                    remarkable figure shown in fig. 244, where the dark shaded lines represent
                    planes in which there is neither double refraction nor polarization,—the double
                    refraction and the tints commencing at these planes, and reaching their maximum
                    in the centre of the space enclosed by three of the dark lines. When light is
                    transmitted through any pair of the four planes which are adjacent to any of the
                    three axes of the solid, it is doubly refracted, the least refracted image being
                    the extraordinary one, and consequently the double refraction negative in
                    relation to the axes to which the doubly-refracted ray is perpendicular. If we
                    suppose the crystal to have the form of a <pb break="no"

                    in fig. 245, a plane passing through the two diagonals of each face of the
                    cube.</p>
                <p>The tints vary as the square of the distance from the nearest plane of double
                    refraction.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pleochroism.—</hi> Closely connected with double refraction is
                    that property of transparent minerals named pleochroism (of many colours), in
                    consequence of which they exhibit distinct colours when viewed by transmitted
                    light in different directions. Crystals of the cubic system do not show this
                    property, whilst in those of the other systems it appears in more or less
                    perfection,—in tetragonal and hexagonal minerals as dichroism (two colours), in
                    the rhombic and clinic systems as trichroism (three colours). In most cases
                    these changes of colour are not very decided, and appear rather as different
                    tints or shades than as distinct colours. The most remarkable of dichromatic
                    minerals are the magnesian mica from Vesuvius, the tourmaline, and ripidolite;
                    of trichromatic, iolite, andalusite from Brazil, diaspore from Schemnitz, and
                    axinite.</p>
                <p>In a specimen of yellow Iceland spar the extraordinary image is of an
                    orange-yellow colour, while the ordinary image is yellowish white. Along the
                    axis of double refraction the colour of the two pencils is exactly the same, and
                    the difference of colour increases with the inclination of the refracted ray to
                    the axis. This is the invariable law of the phenomena in uniaxal crystals. Sir
                    John Herschel found several tourmalines to have a blood-red colour along the
                    axis, and at right angles to it to be yellow-green. There can be little doubt
                    that this property will be found in every crystal of sufficient refraction. Even
                    if the crystal is colourless, a slight inequality in the intensity of the two
                    images may be observed; and when it is distinctly coloured the difference of
                    intensity is very easily seen, even when the two colours are not of a different
                    kind.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of dichroism are best seen in crystals with two axes of double
                    refraction, and are well exemplified in iolite, a mineral which crystallizes in
                    six-or twelve-sided prisms. These prisms are of a deep blue colour when seen
                    along the axis, and of a yellowish brown colour when viewed in a direction
                    perpendicular to it.</p>
                <p>If <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> (fig. 246) is a section of the prism of iolite in
                    a plane parallel to the axis of the prism, the transmitted light will be blue
                    through the faces <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">de,</hi> and
                    yellowish brown through <hi rend="italic">ad, be,</hi> and in every direction
                    perpendicular to the axis of the prism. If we grind down the angles <hi

                    prism, then, if the plane <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> passes through the optic
                    axes, we shall observe, by transmitting polarized light through the crystal in
                    the directions <hi rend="italic">ac, bd,</hi> and subsequently analysing it, a
                    system of rings round each of these axes. The system will exhibit the individual
                    rings very plainly if the crystal is thin; but if it is thick, we shall observe,
                    when the plane <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> is perpendicular to the plane of
                    primitive polarization, some branches of blue and white light diverging in the
                    form of a cross from the centre of the system of rings, or the poles of no
                    polarization, as shown at <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi>
                    (fig. 247), where the shaded branches represent the blue ones. The summits of
                    the blue masses are tipped with purple, and are separated by whitish light in
                    some specimens and yellowish light in others. The white light becomes more blue
                    from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> to o, where it is
                    quite blue, and more yellow from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >p'</hi> to c and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> where it is completely yellow. When
                    the plane <hi rend="italic">abed</hi> is in the plane of primitive polarization,
                    the poles <hi rend="italic">p, p'</hi> are marked by spots of white light, but
                    everywhere else the light is a deep blue.</p>
                <p>In the plane <hi rend="italic">cadb</hi> (fig. 247) the mineral, when we look
                    through it by common light, exhibits no other colour but yellow, mixed with a
                    small quantity of blue, polarized in an opposite plane. The ordinary image at
                    <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is yellowish brown, and
                    the extraordinary image faint blue, the former receiving some blue rays and the
                    latter some yellow ones from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> where the
                    difference of colour is still well-marked. The yellow image becomes fainter from

                    >p',</hi> till it changes into blue, and the faint blue image is strengthened by
                    other blue rays, till the intensity of the two blue images is nearly equal. As
                    the incident ray advances from <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p',</hi> the faint
                    blue image becomes more intense, and the yellow one, receiving an accession of
                    blue rays, becomes of a bluish white colour. The ordinary image is whitish from
                    <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >o,</hi> and the extraordinary is deep blue; but the whiteness gradually
                    diminishes towards <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> when they are both almost equally
                    blue.</p>
                <p>The principal axis of double refraction in iolite is negative. The most refracted
                    image is purplish blue, and the least refracted one yellowish brown.</p>
                <p>Brewster found that the dichroism of several crystals is changed by heat, and
                    that in some cases this property may be communicated to them. Babinet found that
                    all negative crystals, such as calcareous spar, corundum (including ruby and
                    sapphire), tourmaline, and emerald, absorb in a greater degree the ordinary ray,
                    with the exception of beryl, apatite, and some apophyllites; while positive
                    crystals, such as zircon, smoky quartz, sulphate of lime, and common
                    apophyllite, absorb in a greater degree the extraordinary ray. Babinet found
                    also that certain crystals, such as red tourmaline and ruby, transmit rays of
                    their peculiar colour without being polarized,—in which cases the black cross of
                    their system of rings is coloured, and this unpolarized light exists both in the
                    ordinary and extraordinary ray.</p>
                <p>Haidιnger devised an instrument for showing and for testing the pleochroism of

                    metallic case, which has a convex lens <hi rend="italic">I</hi> at one end and a
                    square hole <hi rend="italic">o</hi> about the fifteenth of an inch in width at
                    the other. The lens is of a focal distance which shows an object held about half
                    an inch from the square hole.</p>
                <p>On looking through the lens and prisms two images of the square hole are seen
                    just touching each other. The light of the one image is polarized in the plane
                    which intersects the short diagonal of the prism; that of the other is polarized
                    in the plane of the longer diagonal. When a pleochroic crystal or fragment is
                    held at focal distance and examined by transmitted light, then, on the turning
                    of the instrument bringing the polarization of its planes into coincidence with
                    those of the crystal, the two images of the square opening will show the colours
                    of the oppositely polarized pencils of which the light transmitted by the
                    crystal is composed; this constitutes its pleochroism. The dichroism is then
                    seen by looking through the crystal in one direction only, and the contrast of
                    the two colours is made more obvious.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Phosphorescence.—</hi> This is the property possessed by
                    particular minerals of emitting light in certain circumstances, without
                    combustion or ignition.</p>
                <p>Thus some minerals appear luminous when taken into the dark, after being for a
                    time exposed to the sun’s rays or even to the ordinary daylight. Many diamonds,
                    and also calcined barytes, exhibit this property in a remarkable degree; less so
                    aragonite, calc-spar, and chalk. Many minerals, including the greater part of
                    those thus rendered phosphorescent by the influence of the sun, also become so
                    through heat. Thus some topazes, diamonds, and varieties of fluor-spar become
                    luminous by the heat of the hand; other varieties of fluor-spar, and
                    phosphorite, require a temperature near that of boiling water; whilst calc-spar
                    and many silicates are only phosphorescent at from 400° to 700° Fahr.</p>
                <p>Electricity produces phosphorescence in some minerals, as in green fluor-spar and
                    calcined barytes. In others it is excited when they are struck, rubbed, split,
                    or broken; as in many varieties of zinc-blende and dolomite when scratched with
                    a quill, pieces of quartz when rubbed on each other, and plates of mica or
                    needles of pectolite when suddenly separated.</p>
                <p>The light emitted by phosphorescent minerals is of various tints. The variety of
                    fluor called chlorophane emits, as its name expresses, a green light. The same
                    particle may emit varying tints, as in the fluor from Aberdeenshire, which, as
                    the heat falls, or the energy of the phosphorescence wanes, emits tints which
                    pass from violet, through blue, green, and yellow, to dull purplish red. The
                    yellow blende from the same place is vividly phosphorescent when heated. Fluor
                    generally phosphoresces with a tint of its own colour.</p>
                <p>Too high a heat destroys the phosphorescence, which may, however, be restored by
                    either exposure to sun’s light or <hi rend="italic">w</hi> electricity.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n393/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0393-0376"/>
                <p>The mineral phosphoresces vividly when the discharge passes through it; it
                    generally phosphoresces with a different colour after it has been thus
                    recharged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Fluorescence,</hi> is the property whereby rays of light of a
                    refrangibility higher than those ordinarily seen by the human eye are rendered
                    visible. The substance when placed in the violet end of the spectrum, and
                    carried beyond it into the invisible rays, becomes luminous, through “degrading”
                    the rays of extreme refrangibility. This property is well marked in those
                    varieties of fluorite which are pale green by transmitted light, and deep purple
                    by reflected light. Ozocerite and some petroleums also exhibit the property.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Electric, Magnetic, and Thermic Properties.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Electricity.—</hi> Friction, pressure, and heat may all excite
                    electricity in minerals. To observe this property delicate electroscopes are
                    required, formed of a light needle terminating at both ends in small balls, and
                    suspended horizontally on a steel pivot by an agate cup. Such an instrument, can
                    be electrified negatively by touching it with a stick of sealing-wax excited by
                    rubbing, or positively by merely bringing the wax so near as to attract the
                    needle. When the instrument is in this state, the mineral, if also rendered
                    electric by heat or friction, will attract or repel the needle according as it
                    has acquired electricity of an opposite or of a similar kind; but if the mineral
                    is not electric it will attract the needle in both conditions alike.</p>
                <p>Most precious stones become electric from friction, and are either positive or
                    negative according as their surface is smooth or rough. All gems become positive
                    when polished; the diamond even when unpolished is positive. Pressure between
                    the fingers will excite distinct positive electricity in pieces of transparent
                    double-refracting calc-spar. Topaz, aragonite, fluor-spar, carbonate of lead,
                    quartz, and other minerals show this property, but in a much smaller degree.
                    Some bodies remain excited much longer than others, topaz for a very long time.
                    Heat or change of temperature excites electricity in many crystals; as in
                    tourmaline, calamine, topaz, calcspar, beryl, barytes, fluor-spar, diamond,
                    garnet, and others; these are hence said to be thermo-or pyro-electric. Some
                    acquire polar pyro-electricity, or the two electricities appear in opposite
                    parts of the crystal, which are named its electric poles. Each pole is
                    alternately positive and negative, the one when the mineral is heating, the
                    other when it is cooling. HankeΓs investigations of these phenomena are
                    specially noteworthy.</p>
                <p>As already noticed, many polar electric minerals are also remarkable for their
                    hemimorphic crystal forms. Tourmaline, calamine, and boracite are among the
                    species thus affected. The polarity continues so long as the temperature is
                    increasing, and becomes reversed when it commences to decline; and when the heat
                    is stationary it disappears.</p>
                <p>Kose and Reiss name one of the poles the analogue electric pole, and the other
                    the antilogue electric pole. The former becomes positive while the crystal is
                    heating, and negative while cooling; the latter negative while heating, and
                    positive while cooling. Becquerel found that in tourmaline at 30° C. electrical
                    polarity was sensible; it continued unchanged to 150°, as long as the
                    temperature continued to rise; if the temperature remained stationary an
                    instant, the polarity disappeared, but shortly manifested itself reversed, when
                    the temperature commenced to decline. If but one end of the crystal was heated
                    the crystal was unpolarized, and when two sides were unequally heated each
                    acquired an electrical state independent of the other. In tourmaline the
                    extremities of the prism are dissimilarly modified, and that end which presents
                    the greater number of planes is the antilogue pole; or, if the number of planes
                    is the same, the secondary rhombohedrons of the antilogue pole have (one or more
                    of them) longer vertical axes than those of the analogue pole. Fig. 249
                    (tourmaline) is the antilogue pole (negative under increasing heat), and fig.
                    250 the analogue pole. The pyramid of the analogue end is more flattened by its
                    facets than that of the antilogue end; thus e <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">d⅛</hi> of the antilogue end are more acuminating than e <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cP</hi> of the analogue end.
                    The same is the case with the other two crystals (figs. 251, 252).</p>
                <p>Pyro-electricity has been observed in the following substances: — tourmaline,
                    topaz, axinite, boracite, scolezite, prehnite, electric calamine, sphene,
                    rhodizite, heavy spar, rock-crystal.</p>
                <p>Pyro-electricity is of two kinds,—either terminally polar or centrally polar. In
                    the former the extremities are opposite poles. In the latter two sides of a
                    prism are of the same name, and the opposite pole to each is intermediate
                    between the two.</p>
                <p>The examples of the first kind are tourmaline, calamine, and scolezite, which are
                    uniaxal; axinite, binaxal; boracite and rhodizite, with four axes. Calamine,
                    like tourmaline, has the sharper extremity the antilogue end, and the more
                    flattened the analogue. Compound crystals from Altenberg have both ends
                    analogue, and the portion which lies between the twins antilogue electric; the
                    pyro-electric axis corresponds with the vertical axis of the prism, as in
                    tourmaline. Boracite, which crystallizes in cubic forms, with the opposite solid
                    angles differently modified, has four pyro-electric axes, corresponding to the
                    four octahedral axes. In fig. 253 of this species, the plane which has its
                    angles modified by <hi rend="italic">V</hi> is the antilogue pole, and that with
                    the unmodified angles the analogue pole; and, generally, the antilogue pole has
                    either more numerous or larger facets. Rhodizite resembles boracite in its
                    pyro-electricity.</p>
                <p>The species in which pyro-electricity of the second kind has been observed are
                    prehnite and topaz. If fig. 254 represent a tabular crystal of prehnite, the
                    poles will be situated as marked, the analogue being central, and the antilogue
                    at either extremity of the shorter diagonal of the rhombic prism. Topaz has in a
                    similar manner a central analogue pole, and an antilogue at either extremity of
                    the shorter diagonal. In some instances there is a separate Set of similar poles
                    near one or the other angle, as in fig. 255; this must be due to the crystals
                    being of a composite nature.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnetism.—</hi> This property is very characteristic of the
                    few minerals in which it occurs,—chiefly ores of iron or nickel. Some magnetic
                    iron ores possess polar magnetism, or are natural magnets; while the common
                    varieties of magnetite, meteoric iron, magnetic pyrites, precious garnet, and
                    other minerals, are simply magnetic. Most minerals are only attracted by the
                    magnet, but do not themselves attract iron.</p>
                <p>Minerals, as other substances, have also been divided into magnetic and
                    diamagnetic. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Magnetism.</hi></p>
                <p>The ordinary mode of testing whether a mineral is magnetic or not is to bring it
                    near a pole of a delicately suspended magnetic <pb break="no"

                    vibrate. Another mode is to apply a strong magnet to the mineral in powder.
                    These are sufficient for the mineralogist. Delesse has experimented extensively
                    upon the magnetic force of minerals, and has determined the relative amount for
                    numerous species. Calling this force for Styrian steel 100, the following are
                    some of his results: —</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Crystallomagnetic Action.—</hi> The magnetic polarity thus far
                    alluded to belongs to the mass, and has no relation to crystalline form. There
                    is also a kind of polarity directly related to the crystalline or optic axes of
                    minerals. A crystal of cyanite, suspended horizontally, points to the north, by
                    the magnetic power of the earth only, and is a true compass needle, from which
                    even the declination may be obtained; and the line of direction is the line of
                    the optic axes. Other crystals, which are called negative, take a transverse or
                    equatorial position. The latter are diamagnetic crystals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Conductivity for Heat.—</hi> Senarmont found that the
                    conducting power of colloids and of crystals of the cubic system is equal in all
                    directions, but that it varies in different directions in crystals belonging to
                    all the other systems, exhibiting characters analogous to those deduced from
                    their double refraction, conformable with the optic axes of the crystal, and
                    referable, as in the latter case, to axes of elasticity, or unequal compression
                    of the molecules.</p>
                <p>The fundamental fact is easily shown by taking two slices of rock-crystal, one
                    cut transverse to the axis and one parallel to it. Through the centre of each
                    plate a small hole is drilled for the reception of a bent wire, which by
                    insertion into the hole sustains the plate. The other end of the wire is to be
                    heated, and the rate of the conduction of the heat is rendered visible by the
                    amount of a thin coating of beeswax, with which the plate has been previously
                    coated, which is melted round the central hole. It will be seen that in the
                    transverse slice the wax is melted in a circular form, while in the longitudinal
                    slice the form is elliptical (fig. 256). The conduction is equal in all
                    directions, as regards the transverse axes of the hexagonal {&gt;rism, but more
                    rapid in one direction in the ougitudinal slice, and that direction is the line
                    of its optic axis. In the case of quartz the two diameters of the ellipse are as
                    1000 to 1312.</p>
                <p>If the regular disposition of the molecules of amorphous bodies be interfered
                    with by unequal tension or compression, the regularity of their power of
                    conducting heat is destroyed, and they also show elliptical forms of melted wax;
                    and the shorter axis of the ellipse is in the line of Pressure or undue packing
                    of the molecules.</p>
                <p>he heat thus does not travel so fast in this direction,—partly because it is
                    spent in the heating up of the greater number of molecules. Hence we might
                    conclude that along the main axis of quartz a smaller number of molecules are
                    packed in an equal space than along the transverse. The following are the more
                    important of Senarmont’s results.</p>
                <p>1. Crystals of the tetragonal and rhombohedral systems have one axis of
                    conductivity which is either greater or smaller than the others, and this axis
                    coincides with the main crystallographic axis. The isothermal surfaces are
                    ellipses which lie in the line of this axis, and these ellipses may be either
                    elongated or flattened in the direction of this line.</p>
                <p>2. In crystals of the right prismatic system the isothermal surfaces have three
                    unequal axes, which coincide with crystallographic axes drawn parallel to the
                    edges of the rectangular prism.</p>
                <p>3. In crystals of the oblique rhombic system the isothermal surfaces have three
                    unequal axes, one of which coincides with the horizontal diagonal of the base,
                    while the other two have directions which are not referable to any law.</p>
                <p>4. In crystals of the anorthic system the isothermal surfaces have three unequal
                    axes, all with indeterminable positions.</p>
                <p>In crystals of a single axis there appears to exist no constant relation between
                    the axis of optic elasticity, whether maximum or minimum, and the axis of the
                    greatest or of the least calorific conductibility. Thus, of the minerals
                    examined by Senarmont, quartz ( + ), calcite ( - ), cassiterite ( + ), rutile (
                    + ), and calomel ( + ) have all their greatest axis of conductibility parallel
                    to the principal axis; idocrase, beryl, tourmaline, and corundum, all optically
                    negative, have on the contrary their smallest axis of conductibility parallel to
                    the axis.</p>
                <p>In crystals belonging to the oblique rhombic system there is rarely coincidence
                    between the thermic axes and the axes of optic elasticity. In gypsum and in
                    felspar these lie apart to a marked extent.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Dilatation by Heat.—</hi> In crystals of those systems in which
                    the molecules are arranged unequally as regards their axes, the amount of their
                    dilatation when heated is unequal in the direction of their axes. Our knowledge
                    of this subject is chiefly due to Mitscherlich.</p>
                <p>In crystals of cubic symmetry the expansion is equal in all directions. The
                    dimetric systems—the pyramidal and hexagonal— are brought together as regards
                    this quality, inasmuch as the axes of volumetric change are in these the same;
                    for, while these in the pyramidal correspond with the crystallographic axes, in
                    the hexagonal the three axes are the vertical, one lateral axis, and an axis
                    lying intermediate to the other two and at right angles to the first lateral
                    axis. The expansion along the principal axis may be either greater or less than
                    along the others; and in some minerals there is even contraction along one
                    axis.</p>
                <p>In the right prismatic system the axes of dilatation correspond to those of form.
                    In the oblique prismatic one axis corresponds with the orthodiagonal, but the
                    others make angles not only with the other crystallographic axes but, strange to
                    say, with the axes both of thermic conductivity and of optic elasticity. We are
                    as yet ignorant of the properties of anorthic crystals in this respect.</p>
                <p>As a consequence of this unequal expansion along different axes, the angles of
                    crystals, other than those of the cubic system, are altered under the influence
                    of heat. The alteration is extreme in the case of calcite, where, through
                    elongation along the vertical axis, with some concomitant contraction of the
                    transverse, the angle of the rhombohedric faces is, when the crystal is heated
                    from 32° to 212° F., diminished from 105° 5'to 104° 56' 23",— the form thus
                    approaching that of a cube, as the temperature is raised.</p>
                <p>Dolomite, in the same range of temperature, diminishes 4' 46". In some
                    rhombohedrons, as of calc-spar, the vertical axis is lengthened (and the lateral
                    shortened), while in others, like quartz, the reverse is true. The variation is
                    such, either way, that the double refraction is diminished with the increase of
                    heat; for calc-spar possesses negative double refraction, and quartz positive.
                    According to Fresnel the same is true of gypsum. The dilatation for calc-spar,
                    according to experiment, is 0*001961.</p>
                <p>Kopp has shown that in the carbonates of lime, magnesia, iron, manganese, and
                    zinc, which are nearly the same in the angle of their crystals, the vertical
                    axis is shorter the greater the atomic volume And since heat diminishes the
                    density, and therefore necessarily increases the volume, the axis <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> should be lengthened by an increase of temperature, as is
                    actually the case. He has determined by calculation that the change of angle
                    from 32° to 212° should be 7' 37".</p>
                <p>Although in the greater number of cases the variations are so small as to be
                    scarcely measurable, yet they may be sufficient for establishing a difference
                    between substances which have identical geometric form while belonging to
                    different systems of crystallization. The angle of a rhombohedron might at a
                    certain temperature be 90°, and so coincide with a cube; but that angle would in
                    a rhombohedron change whenever the temperature altered, while the angle of a
                    true monometric cube is constant at all temperatures. The increase in volume and
                    diminution in density which generally result from heating are always accompanied
                    by a change in optical properties. In trimetric crystals, where the principal
                    indices alter unequally, the change affects the amount of divergence of the
                    optic axes. The amount of alteration in gypsum, when the divergence is
                    diminished, is extreme. At the ordinary temperature the angle of the divergence
                    of thé optic axes which lie in the plane of symmetry is about 90° for red light;
                    when heated to 177° it is diminished to 0°, and for the moment the crystal
                    appears to be uniaxal. When more highly heated, the axes again diverge, but in a
                    plane at right angles to the original one, and in cooling these changes take
                    place in reverse order. In barytes and celestine again, the alteration in the
                    angle of the optic axes is a divergence when heated.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters depending on Cohesion.</hi></p>
                <p>These characters are of five kinds:—(1) hardness,.(2) tenacity, (3) elasticity,
                    (4) cleavage, (5) fracture. All may be considered as related to the power of
                    resisting attempts to separate one part from another.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Hardness.—</hi> A harder body is distinguished from a
                    softer, either by attempting to scratch the one with the other, or by trying
                    each with a file. Each of these methods is used by the mineralogist in
                    determining the hardness of the species, though the latter is in most cases to
                    be preferred. Both methods should be employed when practicable.</p>
                <p>Certain varieties of some minerals give a low hardness under the file, owing
                    either to impurities or imperfect aggregation of the particles, while they
                    scratch another mineral upon which a file would have no effect, showing that the
                    particles of the first are hard, though loosely aggregated. Chiastolite, spinel,
                    and sapphire are common examples of this. When the mineral is too hard to be
                    impressed by a file, the peculiarity of the grating sound will suffice for the
                    practised ear.</p>
                <p>Mohs introduced a scale of hardness, consisting of ten minerals, which gradually
                    increase in hardness from 1 to 10. The intervals between 2 and 3 and 5 and 6 are
                    larger than the others. Breithaupt has therefore introduced another degree of
                    hardness between each of the above, and thus his scale consists of twelve
                    minerals.</p>

                    4⅜, written in decimals 4 ’ 25, 4 ’ 5. Several successive trials should be made
                    to obtain certain results.</p>
                <p>The use of the file is acquired with very little experience; usually a single
                    trial is sufficient. Care must be taken to apply the file to edges of equal
                    obtuseness. That part also of the specimen should be selected which has not been
                    altered by exposure, and has the highest degree of transparency and compactness
                    of structure. The pressure for determination should be rather heavy, and the
                    file should be passed three or four times over the specimen.</p>
                <p>Where the scale of hardness is wanting, or a first rough determination is sought,
                    the following experiments may serve :—</p>
                <p>Every mineral that is scratched by the finger-nail has H. = 2 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 5 or less. Minerals that scratch copper have H. = 3
                    or more. Polished white iron has H. = 4 5. Window-glass has H. =5toδ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> 5. Steel point or file has H. = 6 to 7; hence every
                    mineral that will cut or scratch with a good penknife has H. less than 6. Flint
                    has H. =7, and only about a dozen minerals, including the precious stones or
                    gems, are harder.</p>
                <p>Many specimens present different degrees of hardness on dissimilar faces; as an
                    example of which we mention cyanite and mica. This is confined to the
                    inequilateral primary forms, and like the similar difference of colour, lustre,
                    &amp;c., finds a ready explanation in the theory of their formation; unlike
                    faces are the result of the action of a polar force acting along unlike
                    axes.</p>
                <p>This difference in faces parallel to unlike axes may be perceived in nearly all
                    cases, when the methods of trial are sufficiently delicate. Huygens observed
                    long ago that the cleavage face of a crystal of calc-spar differed in hardness
                    from the other faces; and even in a mononιetric crystal it has been found that
                    the faces of the cube and octahedron are not exactly alike in this respect.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Tenacity.—</hi> Solid minerals are said to be brittle,
                    sectile, malleable, flexible, or elastic :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Brittle,</hi> when parts of a mineral separate in powder or
                    grains on attempting to cut it; as baryte, calc-spar.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Sectile,</hi> when pieces may be cut off with a knife
                    without falling to powder, but still the mineral pulverizes under a hammer; as
                    brucite, gypsum.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Malleable,</hi> when slices may be cut off, and these slices
                    flatten out under a hammer; as native gold, native copper.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Flexible,</hi> when the mineral will bend and remain bent
                    after the bending force is removed; as gypsum, graphite, talc.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Elastic,</hi> when after being bent it will spring back to
                    its original position; as mica,</p>
                <p>A liquid is said to be <hi rend="italic">viscous</hi> when, on pouring it, the
                    drops lengthen and appear ropy; as petroleum.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Elasticity.—</hi> Investigations on this property have not
                    to any extent been entered upon. The unequal elasticity of unlike faces of
                    crystals has been shown by Savart in his acoustic investigations, and he was
                    able to distinguish the rhombohedral from the other faces in the pyramid of
                    quartz crystals; he also showed that the figures formed upon vibrating plates of
                    crystals were directly connected with their optic axes. Milne, by measuring the
                    amount of recoil of a sphere of calcite when struck at different points by
                    another of rock-crystal, found that the elasticity, as thus measured, was
                    greatest along the line of the optic axis, and least in directions at right
                    angles to it. He also found that points which lay intermediate between the main
                    and the transverse axes were most indented by the blows. This goes to show that,
                    although there may be fewest molecules arranged along the lines of the
                    transverse axes, yet cohesion operates with greater intensity along these than
                    in intermediate directions.</p>
                <p>When the tenacity of a mineral is overcome by an overwhelming amount of traction,
                    or its elasticity by a sudden shock, its parts are separated, either in flat and
                    continuous surfaces, or in surfaces which are irregular in the extreme. The
                    first of these modes is termed cleavage, the second fracture. In those
                    substances in which cleavage exists it is found that the planes or directions
                    along which it takes place lie in certain strictly definite positions to one
                    another and to the axes of the crystal. They show not the smallest tendency to a
                    transition or gradual passage into the other directions of greater
                    coherence.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Cleavage.—</hi> The number of these parallel cleavageplanes
                    is altogether indefinite, so that the only limit that can be assigned to the
                    divisibility of some minerals, as gypsum and mica, arises from the coarseness of
                    our instruments. These minima of coherence, or cleavage-planes, are always
                    parallel to some face of the crystal; and similar equal minima occur parallel to
                    every other face of the same form. Hence they are always equal in number to the
                    faces of the form, and the figures produced by cleavage agree in every point
                    with true crystals, except that they are artificial. They are thus most simply
                    and conveniently described by the same terms and signs as the faces of
                    crystals.</p>
                <p>Some minerals cleave in several directions parallel to the faces of different
                    forms, but the cleavage is generally more easily obtained and more perfect in
                    one direction than in the others. This complex cleavage is well seen in
                    calc-spar and fluor-spar, and very remarkably in zinc blende, where it takes
                    place in no less than six directions. As in each of these the division may be
                    indefinitely continued, it is clear that no lamellar structure in any proper
                    sense can be assigned to the mineral. All that can be affirmed is that
                    contiguous atoms have less coherence along a direction normal to these planes
                    than in other directions. When cleavage takes place in three directions, it of
                    course produces a perfect crystal form, from which the system of crystallization
                    and angular dimensions of the species may be determined; it is thus often of
                    very great importance.</p>
                <p>The common cleavage in the different systems is as follows, those of most

                <p>In some minerals, as mica and gypsum, the cleavage is readily procured; these may
                    be held in the hand and divided by a knife. Others only cleave with more or less
                    difficulty; these must be placed on a firm support resting on lead, folded
                    paper, or cloth, and a sharp blow struck on a chisel applied in a proper
                    direction. This may often be ascertained by examining the specimen in a strong
                    light. Sometimes it is necessary to subject them to extreme compression in a
                    vice. Some of the hardest substances have not only a perfect but a facile
                    cleavage,—as euclase, topaz, and diamond; many of the softest species have none.
                    The planes produced also vary much in their degree of perfection, being highly
                    perfect in some, as mica and calc-spar, and imperfect in others, as garnet and
                    quartz. In a very few crystalline minerals cleavage-planes can hardly be said to
                    exist. Cleavage must be carefully distinguished from the planes of union in twin
                    crystals, and the division-planes of laminar minerals.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Fracture.—</hi> This is the irregular manner in which
                    substances may be broken. Even minerals possessed of cleavage may be fractured
                    in other directions; but in amorphous bodies fracture alone occurs. The
                    following varieties of fracture occur, and are highly characteristic:—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Conchoidal,</hi> almost typical of amorphous bodies, but
                    occas-sionally seen in crystals,—rounded cavities, more or less deep. The name
                    is taken from the resemblance to the successive lines of interrupted growth in a
                    bivalve shell. Seen in flint, obsidian, asphalt. In calcite the direction of
                    this fracture is intermediate to the planes of the mineral’s cleavage.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Even,</hi> when the surface of fracture is smooth and free
                    from inequalities.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Rough,</hi> when the surface of fracture is rugged, with
                    numerous small elevations and depressions.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Splintery,</hi> when covered with small wedge-shaped
                    splinters.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Hackly,</hi> when the elevations are sharp, slightly bent,
                    or jagged, as broken iron.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Earthy,</hi> when it shows only fine dust.</p>

                    >Influence of Chemical Composition on the External Characters of Minerals.—</hi>
                    That the characters of a compound must to a certain extent depend on those of
                    its component elements seems, as a general proposition, to admit of no doubt.
                    Hence it might be supposed possible from a knowledge of the composition of a
                    mineral to draw conclusions in reference to its form and its other properties;
                    but practically this has not yet been effected.</p>
                <p>The distinction between the mineralizing and mineralizable or the forming and
                    formed elements lies at the foundation of all such inquiries. Certain elements
                    in a compound apparently exert more than an equal share of influence in
                    determining its physical properties. Thus the more important non-metallic
                    elements, as oxygen, sulphur, chlorine, fluorine, are remarkable for the
                    influence they exert on the character of the compound. The sulphurets, for
                    example, have more similarity among themselves than the various compounds of one
                    and the same metal with the non-metallic bodies. Still more generally it would
                    appear that the electro-negative element in the compound is the most
                    influential, or exerts the greatest degree of active forming power. After the
                    non-metallic elements the brittle, easily fusible metals rank next in power;
                    then the ductile ignoble metals; then the noble metals; then the brittle,
                    difficultly fusible; and, last of all, the metals of the earths and
                    alkalies.</p>
                <p>Generally each chemical substance crystallizes only in one form or series of
                    forms. Some substances, however, show dimorphism, or crystallize in two forms,
                    and thus may compose two or more minerals. Thus sulphur, which in nature usually
                    crystallizes in the right prismatic system, when melted forms oblique prismatic
                    crystals. Carbon in one form is the diamond, in another graphite; carbonate of
                    lime appears as calc-spar and as aragonite; the bisulphuret of iron as pyrite
                    and as marcasite. An example of trimorphism occurs in titanic acid, forming the
                    three distinct species anatase, rutile, and brookite. It is remarkable that of
                    dimorphic minerals one form is almost always right prismatic; thus:—</p>

                <p>Even the temperature at which a substance crystallizes influences its forms, and
                    so far its composition, as seen in aragonite, Glauber salt, natron, and
                    borax.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Isomorphism.—</hi> Still more important is the doctrine of
                    isomorphism, designating the fact that two or more simple or compound substances
                    crystallize in one and the same form, or often in forms which, though not
                    identical, yet approximate very closely. This similarity of form is generally
                    combined with a similarity in other physical and in chemical properties. Among
                    minerals that crystallize in the tesseral system, isomorphism is of course
                    common and perfect, there being no diversity in the dimensions of the primary
                    form; but for this very reason it is generally of less interest. It is of more
                    importance among crystals of the other systems, the various series of which are
                    separated from each other by differences in the proportions of the primary form.
                    In these perfect identity is seldom observed, but only very great
                    similarity.</p>
                <p>The more important isomorphic substances are either simple substances, as (1)
                    fluorine and chlorine; (2) sulphur and selenium; (3) arsenic, antimony; (4)
                    cobalt, iron, nickel; (5) copper, silver, mercury, gold (?); or combinations
                    with oxygen, as (6) lime, magnesia, and the protoxides of iron, manganese, zinc;
                    (7) sesquioxides, as of iron, manganese, chromium, and alumina; (8) phosphoric
                    acid, vanadic acid, arsenic acid; (9) sulphuric, selenic, chromic acids; or
                    combinations with sulphur, as (10) sulphuret of iron and of zinc; (11) sulphuret
                    of antimony and of arsenic; (12) sulphuret of lead, of copper, and of silver.
                    These substances are named vicarious from the singular property that in chemical
                    compounds they can mutually replace each other in definite proportions, and very
                    often without producing any important change in the form or other physical
                    properties. But there are numerous instances among the silicates where the
                    mutual replacement of thβ&gt;isomorphic <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n397/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0397-0380"/> bodies, especially when the oxides of the heavy
                    metals come in the room of the earths and alkalies, exerts a most essential
                    influence on the external aspect of the species, particularly in regard to
                    colour, specific gravity, and transparency. The varieties of hornblende, augite,
                    garnet, epidote, and many other minerals are remarkable proofs of this
                    influence. This intermixture of isomorphic elements confers many valuable
                    properties on minerals, and to it this department of nature owes much of its
                    variety and beauty. Without the occasional presence of the colouring substances,
                    especially the oxides of iron and manganese, the non-metallic combinations would
                    have exhibited a very monotonous aspect. It is also remarkable that in some
                    silicates the substitution of a certain portion of the metallic oxides for the
                    earthy bases seems to be almost a regular occurrence; whilst in others, as the
                    felspars and zeolites, this rarely happens. This fact is also of great economic
                    interest, as drawing attention to important elements often combined with others
                    of less value. Thus iron oxide and chrome oxide, sulphuret of copper and
                    sulphuret of silver, nickel and cobalt, may be looked for in connexion. The
                    general chemical formulae for such compounds is formed by writing R ( = radical
                    or basis) for the whole isomorphic elements; and in special instances their
                    signs are placed one below the other, connected by a bracket, or, as is more
                    convenient, are enclosed in brackets one after the other separated by a comma.
                    Thus the general sign for the garnet is R <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> Si <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + R Si, which, when fully expressed, becomes (Ca <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Fe <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Mg <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 3</hi>, Mn <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>) Si <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> + (⅛1, ⅛⅛, θr)Sij and this mineral forms many varieties
                    as the one or other element preponderates.</p>
                <p>Of the forms special to similar groups of atoms the more notable are—the cubic
                    system, special to metals proper, and binary compounds as protoxides and haloid
                    salts; the tetragonal to binoxides; the rhombohedral to carbonates; the
                    hexagonal to sesquioxides and phosphates and their isomorphs; the prismatic to
                    sulphates and their isomorphs.</p>
                <p>The isomorphism of minerals goes as a whole to show that form depends on the
                    number of molecules present, and is comparatively little influenced by the
                    nature of the molecules themselves.</p>

                <p>The arrangement adopted in the following description of mineral species is
                    chemical. Simple substances are considered first, in the order of their
                    quantivalence, then binary compounds, and lastly those of more complex
                    structure. Our limits permit of the briefest notice of the less important, in
                    order that more space may be available for the delineation of the characteristic
                    and transition forms of such as go to constitute the more important rock
                    masses.</p>

                    com., combination.</p>
                <p>In the chemical formulae, barred letters express two equivalents, and the dots
                    over the symbols indicate the combination with them of as many equivalents of
                    oxygen as there are dots.</p>
                <p>In the symbolic notation the several faces of crystals are separated by
                    semicolons, and the constituent members of combinations by commas. The lettering
                    on the faces of the figures is for the most part that adopted by Miller. In the
                    enumeration of crystal forms, that which is typical of the mineral is placed
                    first.</p>

                    the vicinity of places where diamonds have been found. Minute crystals have been
                    found in xanthophyllite, and in talc slate and serpentine, in the
                    Schischim-skian hills, near Zlatoust (Russia). They have also been obtained in
                    Brazil imbedded in a conglomerate composed of much-worn pebbles of quartz,
                    chalcedony, and gold, cemented by limonite or ferruginous clay. In South Africa
                    they are imbedded in a steatitic clay. Diamonds were formerly obtained in India,
                    at Panna, Raol-conda, and Golconda. So few are now obtained here that the mines
                    are let for £1 a year. From these mines were obtained not only the Kohinoor,
                    which was possibly the same as the great diamond mentioned by Tavernier as
                    having been seen by him in the possession of the Great Mogul, which weighed 280
                    carats, but the Regent, of 136 carats (which, not only from its size, but from
                    the perfection of its form, is very much the finest diamond known), the Nizam,
                    an uncut diamond of 340 carats, and the Carlow, rosecut, 193 carats. More lately
                    diamonds were found in great quantity in the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro in
                    Brazil; they occur in two different deposits: the one called “gurgulho” consists
                    of broken quartz covered by a bed of sand; the other, “cascalho,” consists of
                    rolled quartz pebbles united by ferruginous clay; both rest on talcose clays,
                    which are the debris from talcose rocks. The first deposit affords the finest
                    diamonds, and both contain gold, platinum, magnetite, and rutile. A dodecahedral
                    diamond of 257 carats was lately found at Bogagem in this district; this was
                    reduced by cutting to an oblong brilliant of 125 carats, and is the second most
                    valuable diamond,—the Kohinoor, now reduced to an imperfectly circular brilliant
                    of 102 carats, occupying the third place. The two coloured diamonds most worthy
                    of note are a green diamond in the Dresden collection weighing 31 carats, which
                    is a little deeper in tint than a beryl, and a blue diamond in the Hope
                    collection, of 44 carats, as highly coloured as a sapphire, which it is by some
                    considered to be. Diamonds have lately been found in very large quantities, and
                    some of great size, north of the Cape of Good Hope; these for the most part are
                    of yellow colour and of very inferior value. While a Brazilian cut brilliant of
                    one carat is worth from £20 to £25, the value of the finest brilliants from the
                    Cape is only from £3 to £4, and that of the yellow diamonds is from £2 to £2,
                    10s. Apart from its employment as an ornamental stone, the diamond has an
                    intrinsic value from its being utilized for cutting glass and for grinding and
                    polishing other gems. Of late years its usefulness has had a new application, it
                    being employed for the drilling of rocks in tunnelling operations and in the
                    boring of artesian wells. A singular observation has resulted from these last
                    methods of utilizing it, namely, that the hardness of the African diamonds, as
                    tested by the amount of their endurance, is markedly inferior to that of the
                    Brazilian and Indian. So much is this recognized that, while the bort, or minute
                    crystals, of the latter command aprice of 15s. per carat, the African can be got
                    for about 5s. The cleavage of certain of the African diamonds is so eminent that
                    even the heat of the hand causes some of them to fall in pieces. Such diamonds,
                    generally octahedra, may be recognized by a peculiar watery lustre; they are
                    called plate diamonds. The above facts give some ground for the supposition that
                    there may be a slight difference in their composition, possibly that both may
                    contain small, but different, quantities of hydrogen. The circumstances under
                    which diamonds have been formed are altogether unknown. The fact of their being
                    changed into a kind of coke at a very high temperature is an argument against
                    their having been produced through the operation of heat, and it has long been
                    known that an excess of carbon dissolved by molten cast iron crystallizes on
                    cooling in the form of graphite; yet the only attempts to form diamonds
                    deserving of being mentioned as having been attended with any measure of success
                    are those in which sugar charcoal was dissolved in molten silver at the
                    temperature only or melting steel. There were thus obtained a few minute black
                    and also colourless octahedral and cubo-octahedral crystals with curved faces,
                    mingled with a much larger amount of graphitoidal carbon.</p>

                    schists of different ages. The globules of mercury are usually found in rents in
                    cinnabar, or accompanying calomel, at most of the localities for these minerals.
                    Found at Idria in Carniolaand Almaden in Spain. At Idria it is obtained by
                    washing a soft clay slate. In Transylvania and Galicia springs issuing from the
                    Carpathian sandstone bear along globules of mercury. At the Pioneer mine in
                    California some of the quartz geodes contain several pounds of mercury. At
                    Cividale in Lombardy it is found in an Eocene marl. ,. It has also been observed
                    occasionally in drift, and has even been stated to have been found in a peat

                    platinum, mercury, copper, antimony, and bismuth. The auriferous from Norway
                    contains silver 72, gold 28; from quartz reefs in Sutherland, silver 7Γ4, gold
                    28’6. The cupriferous from Courcy near Caen contains 10 per cent, of copper. The
                    antimonial from Bohemia contains 1 per cent, of antimony. The mercurial from
                    Kongsberg in Norway has ’ 4 of mercury, found chiefly in veins in gneiss, clay
                    slate, and limestone. Localities: Alva and elsewhere in Scotland, Ballycorus in
                    Ireland, and Cornwall in England; at Freiberg, Andreasberg, and Kongsberg; along
                    with native copper at Lake Superior; in Mexico, in Peru, and in the United
                    States. The finest crystallized silver occurs at Lake Superior, and at
                    Kongsberg. At the last locality the crystals are an inch in diameter, and are
                    disposed on large filiform brushes. Silver occurs in large masses; three of 436,
                    560, 812 lb have been recorded from Kongsberg. A block which smelted 44,000 lb
                    was for some years used as a table by Duke Albert on his annual visits of
                    inspection to the Schneeberg mine in Saxony. A Mexican specimen was found of 400
                    lb; the mines of Huantaya in Peru have yielded masses of 444 and 960 lb. Britain
                    produces annually about 760,000 oz. of silver, chiefly, however, from lead ores.
                    The value of annual produce for the whole world from all sources is from 8 to 10
                    millions of pounds sterling.</p>

                <p>C.c.: gold, with silver from ’ 72 to 26 per cent.; sometimes iron and copper
                    under 1 per cent. Found in beds and veins generally of quartz in metamorphic
                    rocks of a schistose nature, rarely in diorite and porphyry, and very rarely in
                    granite. Its general associate is limonite, formed from decomposition of pyrite;
                    sometimes also haematite and magnetite. Occurs also in microscopic grains in
                    quartz, from which it is extracted by crushing and amalgamation. The geologic
                    range is from the Azoic to the Tertiary and Cretaceous, as in California; but
                    even in these more recent rocks the original source must have been at least
                    Palaeozoic. Of localities which yield gold the following may be noticed :—the
                    Leadhills in Scotland, Wicklow in Ireland, Dolgelly in North Wales, Cornwall in
                    England; Transylvania, Hungary, and Piedmont; the Urals, Ekaterinburg, and
                    India; Kordofan, the coast opposite Madagascar, and the Gold Coast (the fame of
                    which has been recently revived); Minas Geraes in Brazil, Bolivia, North
                    Carolina, and <pb break="no"

                    Queensland in Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand.</p>
                <p>Some of the largest single masses of gold found in recent times are the
                    following:—one of 22 oz. in Transylvania, of 28 lb in North Carolina, of 20 lb
                    in California, one of 96 lb troy near Miask in the Urals, and one of 184 lb 8
                    oz., which yielded £8376, 10s. 6d., at Ballarat, Australia.</p>
                <p>The annual produce of gold from Australia is about 5 millions of pounds sterling,
                    of the United States about 15 millions, and the whole earth about 23
                    millions.</p>
                <p>The following sub-species may be noticed :—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Electrum.</hi> This name for the alloys of gold and silver
                    was applied by Pliny, whenever the proportion of the latter metal was one-fifth.
                    An alloy of 2 gold and 1 silver contains 21 per cent, of silver; this is found
                    in Sutherland. One of 1 to 1 contains 86 per cent, of silver, this last being
                    the most usual proportion. It occurs in Transylvania, in the Altai, and in
                    Colombia. Its colour is brass-yellow to yellowish white. G. = 12'5 to 15'5.</p>

                    than 86 '5 per cent. The remainder consists of iron, iridium, rhodium,
                    palladium, osmium, gold, copper, and a mechanical mixture of iridosmine. The
                    iron exists in quantities varying from 4 '3 per cent, to double that amount.

                    an oscillatory manner, producing striae on the face of the prism (figs. 303,
                    304, 305); also α&gt;P, P, ⅛(2P2), the last face appearing as a rhomb replacing
                    the alternate angles between the two other forms (figs. 307,308). They are
                    prismatic, or pyramidal, or rhombohedral, when P is divided into R and -R; the

                    (Puy-de-Dôme), the Drachenfels, and Hungary. Many opals, treated with solution
                    of potash, leave crystals, as those from Zimapan, Kaschau, Silesia, and the
                    cacholong from Iceland. Where such crystals are abundant, the opal becomes
                    opaque or snow-white. Jenzεch regards these as still another variety of

                <p>The felspars are very important constituents of the earth’s crust, occurring in
                    nearly all the igneous rocks, and in many of the stratified crystalline schists.
                    In true strata they are found chiefly as fragments or decomposed, and in the
                    latter state form a large part of wet soils and clays. By the older
                    mineralogists and in popular language many species are conjoined under the
                    common name of <hi rend="italic">felspar</hi> which are now considered as
                    distinct, each of them having not only its peculiar physical and chemical
                    characters, but also geognostic position and associated groups of minerals. Thus
                    orthoclase, and the other more siliceous felspars with potash, abound in granite
                    and the plutonic rocks; the less siliceous, with soda and lime, characterize the
                    volcanic rocks,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> labradorite the basaltic group,
                    glassy felspar the trachytic. Orthoclase is associated with quartz, hornblende,
                    and mica; glassy felspar either with hornblende and a black mica or with augite;
                    labradorite with augite, very rarely with quartz or hornblende.</p>
                <p>The felspars are best known from similar minerals by their hardness (they scarce
                    scratch with a good knife), difficult fusibility, and unequal cleavages. The
                    following marks may aid 'the student in distinguishing the more common species.
                    In orthoclase the basal cleavage plane forms a right angle with the
                    clinodiagonal cleavage planes <hi rend="italic">Μ</hi> on both hands; in the
                    triclinic or plagioclase felspars the angles are unequal. Orthoclase, albite,
                    andesine, and oligoclase are insoluble in acids; labradorite and anorthite are
                    more or less soluble. In granite, when decomposing, orthoclase often becomes
                    reddish or dark-red; oligoclase dull green, and at length white.</p>
                <p>Waiterhausen considers that the felspars are mixtures of three true species,
                    forming a series with the oxygen of the silica, alumina, and RO in the
                    proportions <hi rend="italic">x</hi>: 3 :1,— <hi rend="italic">x</hi> ranging

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0436-0419"/> and most mineralogists now take a similar view,
                    regarding orthoclase, albite, and anorthite alone as true species, of which the
                    others are mixtures. Those consisting essentially of potash and soda only are
                    mechanical mixtures of orthoclase and albite, the distinct lamellae being
                    visible by the microscope; those again that contain essentially lime and soda
                    together are, sometimes at least, chemical, being isomorphous compounds of
                    albite and anorthite in various proportions, and with corresponding transitions
                    in crystallographic and physical properties. Notwithstanding this, these
                    intermediates must be regarded as independent mineral species, inasmuch as they
                    are severally typical of certain rocks, and have characteristic forms differing
                    from each other in angular inclination.</p>

                    Scotland, and Ireland, in Belgium and France, in Germany and southern Russia.
                    British America and the United States possess immense fields, especially in the
                    valley of the Mississippi. Also found in China, Japan, Hindustan, Australia,
                    Borneo, and several of the Indian islands.</p>

                <p>Distinctly vegetable in origin,—the external form, and very often the internal
                    woody structure, being preserved. The texture is compact, woody, or earthy.
                    Fracture conchoidal, woody, or uneven; soft and often friable. G. ≈0'5 to 1'5.
                    Lustre sometimes resinous, mostly glimmering or dull. Brown, black, or rarely
                    grey. Burns easily with an unpleasant odour; colours solution of potash deep
                    brown. C.c.: 47 to 73 carbon, 2'5 to 7'5 hydrogen, 8 to 33 oxygen (with
                    nitrogen), and 1 to 15 ashes. <hi rend="italic">Jet</hi> is pitch-black, with
                    conchoidal fracture and resinous lustre. Brown coal occurs at Bovey-Tracy in
                    Devonshire; also in Germany, Hungary, France, Italy, and Greece. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Surturbrand</hi> of Iceland seems a variety. Used as fuel, but
                    much inferior to common coal. The Oolitic coals of Yorkshire, Antrim, Brora,
                    Mull, and Skye are intermediate varieties.</p>
