                <p>The sexes are distinct individuals; the reproduction is oviparous; the larva is
                    almost always hexapod, though the later stages have eight legs; that answering
                    to the pupa of insects is active, and is called the nymph. The breathing in the
                    first-named eleven families is tracheal, the position of the stigmata varying
                    greatly; in the last-named six families it is by the general body surface. No
                    heart or circulation of the blood is known to exist; the alimentary canal is
                    usually somewhat on the insect type, but with caecal prolongations to the
                    stomach, the reproductive organs often more on the crustacean type. There is
                    generally a single very large nerve-ganglion above the oesophagus, sending
                    uerve-branches to the various parts. The legs have ordinarily five to <pb

                    terminated by claws or suckers, or both, sometimes by bristles. The mandibles
                    are generally large, oftenest chelate (like a lobster’s claw), sometimes
                    style-like piercing organs, and of other forms. The maxillae vary much: they may
                    be piercing or crushing organs, or may coalesce to form a maxillary lip; there
                    is usually one pair of maxillary palpi, no others. Sometimes there is a lingua,
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Gamasidx</hi> a galea. Antennae are not found.</p>
                <p>Mites are distributed all over the known world. They have been found in
                    Franz-Josef’s Land and Spitzbergen and in the hottest tropical regions, as well
                    as the temperate zones. Often very similar species come from all parts. They are
                    numerous in amber of the Tertiary epoch.</p>
                <p>The best-known species are probably those which injure man or his works, viz.,
                    the itch mite, the cheese mite, the so-called harvest-bug, and the red spider.
                    The dog-tick is also well known.</p>

                    fig. 3) is a minute, almost circular, flattened, colourless creature, with skin
                    covered with wavy wrinkles, and a number of triangular points arising from that
                    of the back; legs short, the two front pairs and the fourth pair in the male
                    terminated by suckers on long stalks, the two hind pairs in the female and third
                    pair in the male having long bristles instead. It is parasitic on human beings:
                    the males and young remain chiefly on the surface of the skin, but are difficult
                    to find; the female burrows under the scarf-skin, causing the intense itching of
                    scabies by the action of her chelate mandibles as she cats her way. A small
                    watery pustule is raised near where the acarus has entered the skin, and others
                    arise; the creature is not found in the pustule, but at the further end of a
                    short tunnel which may be half an inch long. The eggs are laid in the tunnel
                    after the acarus has passed; they hatch and multiply rapidly. The disease can be
                    certainly cured; the usual mode is to rub the whole body with sulphur ointment,
                    which is best done after a warm bath, allow it to remain on all night, and wash
                    off in the morning. This treatment should be repeated once or twice at intervals
                    of a day or two. Other applications of sulphur, as sulphurous acid, sulphur
                    vapour baths, <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> tc.,are efficacious. All clothes
                    which have touched the skin must be disinfected by heat. The disease is highly
                    contagious. Most mammals have their peculiar varieties of itch mite.</p>
                <p>The cheese mite <hi rend="italic">(Tyroglyphus siro)</hi> is an elliptical,
                    fatbodied, colourless acarus with smooth skin and very long hairs. It breeds in
                    thousands in old cheese, flour, grain, &lt;fcc., and does much damage. There are
                    numerous allied species; some belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Glyciphagus</hi> are elegantly ornamented with plumes or leaf-like hairs.</p>
                <p>The red-spider <hi rend="italic">{Tetranychus telarius)</hi> attacks the leaves
                    of plants or trees, and is a great pest in green-houses. It spins a slight web
                    on the surface of the leaves, and lives in companies on the web; it is of a
                    rusty red or brown.</p>
                <p>The harvest bugs, thought by some writers to be a species, and by them called <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptus</hi><hi rend="italic">autumnalis,</hi> are simply the
                    larvae of several species of <hi rend="italic">Tronιbidium.</hi> They are
                    predatory, but will attach themselves temporarily to the human skin, and produce
                    the violent itching felt on the lower parts of the legs after walking through
                    dry grass in autumn. On inspection with a glass the creature may be seen as a
                    minute scarlet point. A drop of benzine will probably get rid of the
                    intruder.</p>
                <p>The dog tick, like the harvest-bug, is not really parasitic on mammals, though it
                    attaches itself temporarily; its ordinary food may probably be vegetable. <hi
