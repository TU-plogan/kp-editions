                <p><label type="entry">MOREAU, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hégésippe</hi></label>, a minor
                    lyric poet of disputed but considerable talent, was born at Paris on the 9th
                    April 1810, and died in the hospital of La Charité on the 10th December 1838. In
                    his early youth his parents, who were very ill-off, migrated to Provins, where
                    the mother went into service and the father took the post of usher in a public
                    school. Both died in the same refuge for the destitute which afterwards received
                    their son. Hégésippe was fairly educated and was apprenticed to a printer, but
                    he preferred the work (in France usually paid most miserably) of “maître
                    d’études” in a school. He went to Paris before 1830, and appears to have
                    practised both his occupations there, though for the most part he either adopted
                    by choice or was driven by ill-fortune to adopt the singular life of alternate
                    hardship and cheap dissipation which is dignified in France by the name of
                    Bohemianism. In Moreau’s case there is no doubt that the hardships exceeded the
                    dissipation. He was habitually houseless, and is said to have exposed himself to
                    the dangers of a cholera hospital in the great epidemic of 1832 simply to obtain
                    shelter and food. Then he revisited Provins and published a kind of satirical
                    serial called <hi rend="italic">Diogène.</hi> Some years of this life entirely
                    ruined his health, and it was only just before his death that he succeeded in
                    getting his collected poems published, selling the copyright for &lt;£4 sterling
                    and eighty copies of the book. It was received not unfavourably, but, as has
                    happened in other cases, the author’s death, which happened soon in the
                    circumstances mentioned, was required to excite an interest which was
                    proportionately excessive. Moreau’s work, like that of many other young poets,
                    has a strong note of imitation, his model being especially Béranger; and his
                    character, both moral and literary, is not improved by obvious affectation in
                    political, religious, and social matters. But some of his poems, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">La Voιdzie</hi> and the charming <hi rend="italic">La
                    Fermière,</hi> have great sweetness, and he had a faculty of writing both in
                    prose and poetry which seems to show that with better fortune, or, to speak
                    honestly, with more intelligence and more perseverance he might easily have
                    saved himself from the miserable destitution which was his lot.</p>
