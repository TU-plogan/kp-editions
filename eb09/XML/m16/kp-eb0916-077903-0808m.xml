                    eastern side of the Adriatic, and is bounded by Dalmatia, Herzegovina, Bosnia,
                    and Albania. Previous to 1878 it had an area variously estimated at 1669 square
                    miles (Kaptsevitch), 1711 (Kiepert), and, including the Kutchi territory, 1796
                    (Behm). The enlargement to about 5272 square miles proposed by the San Stefano
                    treaty (1878) would probably have swamped the Montenegrin nationality, and the
                    Berlin congress brought the total area only up to 3680 miles, or almost exactly
                    half the size of Wales.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Since 1870 several rectifications of frontier and exchanges of territory
                    have been arranged between Montenegro and Turkey, but these have left the area
                    practically undisturbed. All the figures are approximate estimates, as the only
                    geodetic survey of the country, carried out by Russian officers, is still (1883)
                    in progress. The old frontier line had the great disadvantage to the
                    Montenegrins of leaving the fortress of Niksitch in the north-west, and that of
                    Spuzh in the south-east in the hands of the Turks, who thus commanded the valley
                    of the Zeta, and strategically almost cut the country in two, the distance from
                    the frontier near Niksitch to the frontier near Spuzh being only some 15 miles.
                    The present frontier includes not only these strongholds, but also those of
                    Podgoritza, Zhabliak (Jablac), and Lesendra, a great part of Lake Scutari, and
                    the coast district with Antivari and Dulcigno. To get access to the sea had long
                    been the ambition of Montenegro, which in her early days had possessed not only
                    Dulcigno but Durazzo, and had surrendered them to purchase from Venice
                    assistance in her struggle against the Turks. The Berlin congress gave her the
                    coast from Cape Maria to Cape Kruci or Krutch, but Spizza, the harbour to the
                    north, was retained by Austria, and Dulcigno, to the south, by Turkey. In the
                    beginning of 1880, by the Corti compromise, the Kutchi territory and the plain
                    of Podgoritza were accepted by Montenegro in lieu of Plava and Gussinye,
                    assigned to her by the congress; but the exchange was deferred, and the terms
                    ultimately modified by the congress so as to include Dulcigno in Montenegrin
                    territory. The occupation of the district (November 1880) was only effected
                    after a naval demonstration on the part of the great powers.</p></note></p>

                    but on closer examination it appears that there are two distinct groups, an
                    eastern and a western, divided by the Zeta-Moratcha valley. The loftiest summit
                    is Dormitor, 8146 feet high, in the new territory near the north frontier, next
                    come Kom Kutchi (8031), Kom Vassoyevitzki (7946), and Dormitor Schlime
                    (7936).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    congress towards the south-east been retained it would have run along the still
                    higher Prokletia range. Many of the mountain-tops remain white with snow for the
                    greater part of the year, and from some of the dark ravines the snow never
                    disappears. The south-western portion of the country consists of limestone, the
                    northeastern mainly of Palaeozoic sandstones and schists with underlying
                    trap.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Dr Tietze, whose
                    full report was to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Jahrb.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >der Reichsanstalt</hi> for 1883, informed the writer that the existence of the
                    following formations in Montenegro has been clearly ascertained :—(1) Palaeozoic
                    schists, (2) Wirfen strata of Lower Trias, (3) Trap of the Palaeozoic and Wirfen
                    strata, (4) Triassic limestone, (5) Jurassic limestone, (6) Cretaceous
                    limestone, (7) Flysch, in part certainly Eocene, and (8) Neogenic or younger
                    Tertiary formations. The existence of nummulitic limestone is still
                    doubtful.</p></note> In their general aspect the two regions are strikingly
                    distinct. The former seems, as it were, one enormous mass of hard crystalline
                    rock, bare and calcined, with its strata dipping to the south-west at an angle
                    often of 70 degrees. Its whole surface has been split by atmospheric agencies
                    into huge prismatic blocks, and the cracks have been gradually worn into
                    fissures several fathoms deep. In some places the process has resulted in
                    clusters of immense sharp-pointed crags, the sides of which are furrowed by
                    rain-channels, while in others there are countless funnels running down into the
                    rock for 200 feet and more. In like manner the interior of the mass is hollowed
                    out into immense galleries and caves, and during the rainy season subterranean
                    landslips frequently produce local earthquakes, extending over an area of 10 or
                    12 miles. The sandstone region, on the other hand, presents lofty but rounded
                    forms, clothed for the most part with virgin forest or rich alpine pasture,
                    broken here and there by dolomitic peaks.</p>
                <p>The watershed between the Adriatic and the Black Sea crosses the country from
                    west to east in a very irregular line, the southern districts being drained by
                    the Zeta-Moratcha river system, which finds its way to the Adriatic by Lake
                    Scutari and the Boyanna, while the streams of the northern districts form the
                    head-waters of the Drina, which reaches the Danube by way of the Save. The Zeta,
                    rising in Lake Slano, is remarkable for its subterranean passage beneath a
                    mountain range 1000 feet high. At a place called Ponor the water plunges into a
                    deep chasm, seeming almost to lose itself in foam, but at a distance, of several
                    miles it reappears on the other side of the mountains. Its whole course to its
                    junction with the Moratcha is about 30 miles. Rising in the Yavorye Planina, the
                    Moratcha sweeps through the mountain gorges as a foaming torrent till it reaches
                    the plain of Podgoritza; then, for a space, it almost disappears among the
                    pebbles and other alluvial deposits, nor does it again show a current of any
                    considerable volume till it approaches Lake Scutari. In the neighbourhood of
                    Duklea<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Duklea is the
                    name still borne by the ruins of the Roman Doclea, often, but wrongly, called
                    Dioclea from its association with the family of Diocletian.</p></note> and
                    Leskopolye it flows through a precipitous ravine from 50 to 100 feet high. In
                    the dry season it is navigable to Zhabliak. The whole course is about 60 miles.
                    Of the left-hand tributaries of the Moratcha the Sem or Tsievna deserves to be
                    mentioned for the magnificent canon through which it flows between Most Tamarui
                    and Dinosha. On the one side rise the mountains of the Kutchi territory, on the
                    other the immense flanks of the Prokletia range,—the walls of the gorge varying
                    from 2000 to 4000 feet of vertical height. Lower down the stream the rocky banks
                    approach so close that it is possible to leap across without trouble. The Ryeka
                    issues full-formed from an immense cave southeast of Cettinye (Tsettinye) and
                    falls into Lake Scutari. The three tributaries of the Drina which belong in part
                    to Montenegro are the Piva, the Tara, and the Lim, respectively 55, 95, and 140
                    miles in length. The Tara forms the northern boundary of the principality for
                    more than 50 miles, but the Lim leaves the country altogether after the first 30
                    miles of its course. Great alterations have taken place on Lake Scutari in
                    recent times. The river Drin, which previous to 1830 entered the Adriatic to the
                    south of Alesia near S. Giovanni di Medua, subsequently changed its course so as
                    to join the Boyanna just below its exit from the lake; one of the chief results
                    has been to raise the level of the lake, and so to flood the lower valleys of
                    the tributary streams. When the International Frontier Commission was at Scutari
                    in April 1879, the water stood 8 feet deep in some of the principal streets, and
                    the inundation of city and suburbs lasted that year eight months. A few small
                    lakes are scattered among the mountains, and it is evident that their number was
                    formerly much greater. The plain or hollow of Cettinye was doubtless filled with
                    water at no very distant (geological) date, and even now, when the sudden rains
                    cannot escape fast enough by the ordinary subterranean outlet, the royal village
                    suffers from a flood.</p>
                <p>If the new territory be left out of view, there is but little farming land in
                    Montenegro; the peasant is glad to enclose and protect the veriest patches of
                    fertile soil retained by the hollows in the mountain sides, and one may see
                    “flourishing little crops not a yard square.” “The largest landed proprietor is
                    the holder of 60 acres” (Denton, <hi rend="italic">Montenegro,</hi> p. 143); the
                    other freehold estates vary from 2 to 20 acres, and it is usually not to the
                    individual but to the house or family that the ownership belongs. Woods and
                    pastures are the common property of the clan (pZeτne). The people live in small
                    stone-built cottages, grouped for the most part in little villages, and their
                    whole life is <pb break="no"

                    national virtue, and in time of war the women and children of the Turks have
                    often found their safest asylum among their hereditary foes. The main stock of
                    the people is of Servian descent; and, though the purity of both blood and
                    language has been to some extent affected by foreign elements, mostly Albanian
                    and Turkish, the national unity has not been impaired. The curious Gipsy colony,
                    which, though speaking Servian, never intermarries with the Montenegrins, is
                    numerically of little importance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Church, only some 7000 being Roman Catholics, and 3000 Mohammedans. According to
                    Kaptsevitch, the population was 10,700 in 1838, 120,000 in 1849, 124,000 in
                    1852, and 170,000 in 1877, but in 1879 it was found that, inclusive of the new
                    territory, the number could not exceed 150,000; since then about 15,000 have
                    been added with Dulcigno. The official returns for 1882 (not based on a census,
                    however) give 236,000 as the total, of whom some 23,000 live in the so-called
                    towns.</p>

                    wolves, and especially foxes, over a much wider area. A few chamois roam on the
                    loftiest summits, the roebuck is not infrequent in the backwoods, the wild boar
                    may be met with in the same district, and the hare is abundant wherever the
                    ground is covered with herbage. There are one or two species of snakes in the
                    country, including the poisonous Illyrian viper. Esculent frogs, tree frogs, the
                    common tortoise, and various kinds of lizards are all common. The list of birds
                    observed by Baron Kaulbars includes golden eagles and vultures, 12 species of
                    falcons, several species of owls, nightingales, larks, buntings, hoopoes,
                    partridges, herons, pelicans, ducks (10 species), goatsuckers, &amp;c. The
                    abundance of fish in Lake Scutari and the lower course of the Ryeka is
                    extraordinary, the shoals of bleak (scor-antza, <hi rend="italic"

                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> The flora of Montenegro is comparatively scanty.
                    In the forest districts the beech is the prevailing tree up to a height of 5000
                    or 5500 feet, and then its place is taken by the pine. The chestnut forms little
                    groves in the country between the sea and Lake Scutari, but never ascends more
                    than 1000 feet, and the olive also is mainly confined to the neighbourhood of
                    the Adriatic. Pomegranate bushes grow wild, and in many parts of the south cover
                    the foot of the hills with dense thickets, the rich blossoms of which are one of
                    the special charms of the spring landscape. Wheat, rye, barley, maize,
                    capsicums, and a little tobacco are grown in the north, and in the south, vines,
                    figs, peaches, apples, cherries, citrons, oranges, &amp;c. The potato,
                    introduced in 1786, is cultivated considerably beyond the local demand; the
                    planting of mulberry trees and the rearing of silk-worms is of growing
                    economical importance.</p>

                    about 2000 inhabitants, is the capital of the country. Podgoritza (about 6000 or
                    7000 in 1879, since reduced to 4000) is the principal trading town; it lies at
                    the foot of the mountains (as its name imports), at the junction of the
                    Ruibnitza with the Moratcha, and in Turkish hands was one of the strongest of
                    their fortresses towards Montenegro. Dulcigno (see vol. vii. p. 520) has 3000
                    inhabitants (before the transfer 5000 to 7000). Niksitch, a fortified place on a
                    slight eminence in the midst of a plain, is about the same size. Antivari (see
                    vol. ii. p. 138), so called from its position opposite Bari in Italy, suffered
                    greatly in the war 1879-80, and lost half of its 5000 inhabitants. Danilovgrad,
                    with 2000, lies on the north side of the Zeta valley; in the vicinity is
                    Orialuka, the prince’s palace with its mulberry nurseries, and the monasteries
                    of Zhdrebanik (burnt by the Turks in 1877, but since rebuilt), while Tcheliya,
                    Moratcha (the most ancient in the principality), and Ostrog (visited annually by
                    about 10,000 pilgrims) are not far off. Spuzh (Spouge), a little lower on the
                    same side of the stream, is a fortified post with about 1000 inhabitants.
                    Nyegush or Nyegosh (1200), about three hours distant from Cettinye on the road
                    to Cattaro, is the native seat of the reigning family, which originally came
                    thither from Nyegush in Herzegovina. Zhabliak (1200) was once the “capital,” and
                    has been a fortified post since the time of the Venetian power. Ryeka (1500), on
                    the river of that name, is next to Podgoritza in commercial importance; the
                    prince has two residences in the town. Grahovo (2000) is famous for the great
                    battles of 1851 and 1876.</p>
                <p>Montenegro is an absolute hereditary monarchy, vested according to the principle
                    of primogeniture in the family of Petrovitch Nyegush. The prince bears the title
                    “Prince of Montenegro and the Berda (mountains) ”—Montenegro here meaning the
                    old Montenegrin nahias (provinces) of Katunska, Tzrmitza, Ryetchka, and
                    Lyeshanska, and Berda the territory added in the 18th century, or the provinces
                    Byelopavlitchska, Piperska, Moratchska, Vasoye-vitchska, and Kutska. A
                    responsible ministry was introduced in 1877, and there are now separate
                    departments of justice, foreign affairs, war, and finance and education. The
                    highest administrative body is the council of state, instituted in 1879, and
                    consisting of eight members appointed by the prince. Justice in ordinary cases
                    is rendered in primitive fashion. Formal codes were drawn up by Peter I. (1798)
                    and by Danilo (1855), but the real statute book is national custom. A great
                    court, consisting of the minister of justice, and five members named by the
                    prince, is held in the capital, and there are inferior courts in each of the
                    captaincies (86 in 1879). While formerly the very president of the senate, Mirko
                    Petrovitch (o⅛. 1865), whose songs are the delight of his countrymen, could
                    neither read nor write, primary education has been widely diffused during the
                    reign of Prince Nicholas (Nikita). In 1851 there was only one school, but before
                    the recent war they had increased to 58, nearly every clan having one for girls
                    as well as for boys. The female Montenegrin Institute (founded and supported by
                    the empress of Russia) attracts pupils from beyond the frontier. It was from the
                    printing-presses of Cettinye and Ryeka that the first books in the Slavonic
                    languages were issued between 1483 and 1493, under the patronage especially of
                    Ivan Beg and George (IV.) Crnoyevitch, “waywodes of the Zeta,” but this promise
                    of literary productiveness was soon cut off by wars with the Turks. Peter
                    Petrovitch Nyegush (1813-1851), who was called to rule in 1830, is recognized as
                    perhaps the greatest of all Servian poets,—his <hi rend="italic">Gorski
                    Viyenac,</hi> or ‘‘Mountain Wreath,” giving dramatic expression to the “very
                    soul of the Serbian people.” Though the press which he established in 1834 was
                    destroyed in the war of 1852-53, another was soon obtained, and under Prince
                    Nicholas, himself a poet, his memory has proved a potent stimulus to
                    intellectual culture. The first Montenegrin newspaper, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gmogorac,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">Gias Cmogorca,</hi> began to appear in
                    1870; the first book-shop was opened in 1879.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The Montenegrins, however, have had more to do with the sword than with the pen.
                    “Every man, dressed in the picturesque costume of his tribe, carries his pistol
                    and yataghan in his girdle.” Nominally the age of military service is between
                    sixteen and sixty-five, but when war breaks out schoolboy and superannuated
                    veteran are equally eager for the fray. When Prince Nicholas tried to prevent an
                    old man of eighty from joining his forces, the insulted warrior drew his pistol
                    and shot himself. War with the Turks, indeed, is the essence of Montenegrin
                    history. On the death of the Servian king Stephen Dushan, Prince Balsha became
                    independent lord of the province of the Zeta; and when the Servian power was
                    shattered by the Turks in the battle of Kossovo (1389) his territory formed the
                    asylum of all those who determined to make another stand for freedom. In 1485
                    Ivan Crnoyevitch, finding Zhabliak untenable, fixed his “capital” at Cettinye.
                    In 1516 his son George, who had succeeded him, left his country to its fate; but
                    the people chose their bishop as their chief. Prince-bishops or vladykas,
                    elected by the people, continued to lead them with success against the common
                    foe of Christendom till 1697, when the authority was handed over to Petrovitch
                    Nyegush, with the right of appointing his successors, subject to national
                    approval. At length, in 1851, Danilo, nephew and nominee of the previous vladyka
                    Peter II., prevailed on the ‘ ‘ skuptchina” to declare Montenegro a secular
                    state with the hereditary government of a prince. His nephew Nicholas succeeded
                    to the throne in 1860, and at the close of the war 1876-78 Montenegro was
                    declared a sovereign principality. For an account of the defeats and victories
                    (the latter by far the more numerous) which have marked the national struggle
                    for existence during its four centuries, the reader is referreαto Denton’s <hi
