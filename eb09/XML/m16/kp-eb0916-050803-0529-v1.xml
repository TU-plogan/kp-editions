                    the mass, of the Latin Church. This name <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Missale
                    Gothicum, Francorum, Gallicanum Vetus) began to supersede the older word <hi

                    about the middle of the 8th century. At that period the books so designated
                    contained merely the fixed canon of the mass or consecration prayer (actionem,

                    festival, or feria, of the ecclesiastical year; for a due celebration of the
                    Eucharist they required accordingly to be supplemented by other books, such as
                    the <hi rend="italic">Antiphonarium,</hi> afterwards called the <hi

                    the council of Trent, which among its other tasks undertook the preparation of a
                    correct and uniform liturgy, and entrusted the work to a committee of its
                    members. This committee had not completed its labours when the council rose, but
                    the pope was instructed to receive its report when ready and to act upon it. The
                    “reformed missal” accordingly was promulgated by Pius V. on July 14, 1570, and
                    its universal use enjoined on all branches of the Catholic Church, the only
                    exceptions allowed being in the case of churches having local and independent
                    liturgies which had been kept in unbroken use for at least two centuries.<note

                            consequently continued to be used by English Catholics until towards the
                            end of the 17th century, when it was superseded by the Roman through
                            Jesuit influence. The Gallican liturgy held its ground until much more
                            recently, but has now succumbed under the Ultramontanism of the
                            bishops.</p></note> It has subsequently undergone slight revisions under
                    Clement VIII. (1604) and Urban VIII. (1634); and various new masses, both
                    obligatory and permissive, universal and local, have been added by the competent
                    authority. Although the Roman is very much larger in bulk than any other
                    liturgy, it need hardly be explained that the communion office to which it
                    relates is not in itself inordinately long. By much the greater part of it is
                    contained in the “ordinary” and “canon” of the mass, usually placed about the
                    middle of the missal, and occupies, though in large type, only a few pages in
                    any printed copy. The work owes its bulk and complexity to two circumstances. On
                    the one hand, in the celebration of the sacrifice of the mass practically
                    nothing is left to the impulse or discretion of the officiating priest;
                    everything—what he is to say, the tone and gestures with which he is to say it,
                    the cut and colour of the robe he is to wear—is carefully prescribed either in
                    the general rubrics prefixed to the text, or in the running rubrics which
                    accompany it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In all the
                            older liturgies the comparative absence of rubrics is conspicuous and
                            sometimes perplexing. It is very noticeable in the Roman <hi
                                rend="italic">Sacramentaries,</hi> but the want is to some extent
                            supplied by the very detailed directions for a high pontifical mass in
                            the various texts of the <hi rend="italic">Ordo Romanus</hi> mentioned
                            below. That there was no absolutely fixed set of rubrics in use in
                            France during the 8th century is shown by the fact that each priest was
                            required to write out an account of his own practice (“libellum
                            ordinis”) and present it for approbation to the bishop in Lent (see
                            Baluze, <hi rend="italic">Cap. Reg. Franc.,</hi> i. 824, quoted in

                    flexibility. Partly by conscious effort, no doubt, but partly also by happy
                    accident, a well-marked distinctive character has been given in one or all of
                    the above-mentioned respects to the office for each ecclesiastical season, for
                    each fast or festival of the year, almost for each day of the week; and
                    provision has also been made of a suitable communion service for many of the
                    special and extraordinary occasions both of public and of private life. This
                    richness of variety is seen not only in the collects but also in the lessons and
                    antiphonal parts of the service, passages of Scripture in the selection and
                    collocation of which an exquisite delicacy of religious and aesthetic instinct
                    has been for the most part strikingly shown.</p>
                <p>The different parts of the Roman communion office are not all of the same

                    a bishop be [the celebrant], though only on Sundays and festivals; but a priest
                    is by no means to say it, except only at Eastertide. When there is a litany

                    length precisely as they still occur in the Roman missal.</p>
                <p>In every liturgy of all the five groups a passage similar to this occurs,
                    beginning with <hi rend="italic">Sursum</hi><hi rend="italic">Corda,</hi>
                    followed by a <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> and the recitation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sanctus</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> Angelic Hymn. The
                    “canon” or consecration prayer, which in all of them comes immediately after,
                    invariably contains our Lord’s words of institution, and (except in the
                    Nestorian liturgy) concludes with the Lord’s Prayer and “embolism.” But within
                    this framework there are certain differences of arrangement, furnishing marks by
                    which the various groups of liturgies can be classified (see vol. xiv. p. 709
                        <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> Thus it is distinctive of the liturgy of
                    Jerusalem that the “great intercession” for the quick and the dead follows the
                    words of institution and an Epiklesis <hi rend="italic">(lπiκλησus τoυ
                        πveυμaτoς</hi><hi rend="italic">αγίου)</hi> OΓ petition for the descent of
                    the Holy Spirit upon the gifts; in the Alexandrian the “great intercession” has
                    its place in the <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi>; in the East Syrian it comes
                    between the words of restitution and the Epiklesis; in the Ephesine it comes
                    before the <hi rend="italic">Preface;</hi> while in the Roman it is divided into
                    two, the commemoration of the living being before, and that of the dead after,
                    the words of institution. Other distinctive features of the Roman liturgy are
                    (1) the position of the “Pax” after the consecration, and not as in all the
                    other liturgies at a very early stage of the service, before the <hi
                        rend="italic">Preface</hi> even; and (2) the absence of the Epiklesis common
                    to all the others.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                            was one of the points discussed at the council of Florence, and Cardinal
                            Bessarion for a time succeeded in persuading the Greeks to give up the
                            Epiklesis.</p></note></p>
                <p>The words of its “canonical prayer” are of unknown antiquity; they are found in
                    the extant manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Sacramentarium</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Gelasianum,</hi> and were already old and of forgotten
                    authorship in the time of Gregory the Great, who, in a letter to John, bishop of
                    Syracuse <hi rend="italic">{Registr. Epist.,</hi> vii. 64), speaks of it as “the
                    prayer composed by a ‘scholastic’” (precem quam scholasticus composuerat). The
                    same letter is interesting as containing Gregory’s defence, on the ground of
                    ancient use, of certain parts of the Roman ritual to which the bishop of
                    Syracuse had taken exception as merely borrowed from Constantinople. Thus we
                    learn that, while at Constantinople the <hi rend="italic">Kyrie</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Eleison</hi> was said by all simultaneously, it was the Roman
                    custom for the clergy to repeat the words first and for the people to respond,
                        <hi rend="italic">Christe</hi><hi rend="italic">Eleison</hi> being also
                    repeated an equal number of times. Again, the Lord’s Prayer was said immediately
                    after the consecration aloud by all the people among the Greeks, but at Rome by
                    the priest alone.</p>
                <p>The somewhat meagre and imperfect liturgical details furnished by the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sacramentarium Gregorianum</hi> are supplemented in a very
                    full and interesting manner by the successive texts of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ordo Romanus,</hi> the first of which dates from about the year 730. The
                    ritual they enjoin is that for a pontifical high mass in Rome itself; but the
                    differences to be observed by a priest “quando in statione facit missas” are
                    comparatively slight. Subjoined is a précis of <hi rend="italic">0rdo</hi><hi

                <p>It is first of all explained, that Rome has seven ecclesiastical regions, each
                    with its proper deacons, subdeacons, and acolytes. Each region has its own day
                    of the week for high ecclesiastical functions, which are celebrated by each in
                    rotation. [This accounts for the Statio ad S. Mariam Majorem, ad S. Crucem in
                    Jerusalem, ad S. Petrum, &amp;c., prefixed to most of the masses in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Gregorian Sacramentary</hi>, and still retained in the
                    “Proprium de Tempore” of the Roman missal.] The regulations for the assembling
                    and marshalling of the procession by which the pontiff is met and then escorted
                    to the appointed station are minutely given, as well as for the adjustment of
                    his vestments “ut bene sedeant,” when the sacristy has been reached. He does not
                    leave the sacristy until the <hi rend="italic">Introit</hi> has been begun by
                    the choir in the church. Before the <hi rend="italic">Gloria</hi> he takes his
                    stand at the altar, and after the <hi rend="italic">Kyrie</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    which is taken up by the choir. During the singing he faces eastward; at its
                    close he turns round for a moment to say “Pax vobis,” and forthwith proceeds to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    At the words “per quem haec omnia” the archdeacon lifts the cup with the
                    oblates, ana at ' ‘ Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum” he gives the peace to the
                    clergy in their order, and to the laity. The pontiff then breaks off a particle
                    from the consecrated bread and lays it upon the altar; the rest he places on the
                    paten held by the deacon. It is then distributed while <hi rend="italic">Agnus
                        Dei</hi> is sung. The pontiff in communicating puts the particle into the
                    cup, saying, “Fiat commixtio et consecratio corporis et sanguinis Domini nostri
                    Jesu Christi accipientibus nobis in vitam aeternam.” Those present communicate
                    in their order under this species also.</p>

                <p>As the pontiff descends into the senatorium to give the communion, the schola

                        <hi rend="italic">Psalmus.</hi> Some explanation of each of these terms is
                    necessary. (1) The word <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(αντίφωναν,</hi> Old English <hi rend="italic">Antefn,</hi> English <hi
                        rend="italic">Anthem)</hi> in its ecclesiastical use has reference to the
                    very ancient practice of relieving the voices of the singers by dividing the
                    work between alternate choirs. In one of its most usual meanings it has the
                    special signification of a sentence (usually scriptural) constantly sung by one
                    choir between the verses of a psalm or hymn sung by another. According to the
                    Roman liturgiologists it was Pope Celestine who enjoined that the Psalms of
                    David should be sung (in rotation, one presumes) antiphonally before mass; in
                    process of time the antiphon came to be sung at the beginning and end only, and
                    the psalm itself was reduced to a single verse. In the days of Gregory the Great
                    the introit appears to have been sung precisely as at present,—that is to say,
                    after the antiphon (proper and <hi rend="italic">par excellence),</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">Psalmus</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Gloria,</hi> then the
                    antiphon again. (2) The <hi rend="italic">Responsorium,</hi> like the Greek
                    antiphon, derives its name from the responsive manner of singing. As introduced
                    between the epistle and gospel it was probably at first a comparatively long
                    passage, usually an entire psalm or canticle, originally given out by the cantor
                    from the steps from which the epistle had been read (hence the later name <hi
                        rend="italic">Graduale),</hi> the response being taken up by the whole
                    choir. (3) The <hi rend="italic">Offertorium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Communio</hi> correspond to the “hymn from the book of Psalms” mentioned by
                    early authorities (see, for example, Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Retr.,</hi>
                    ii. 11; <hi rend="italic">Ap. Const.,</hi> viii. 13) as sung before the oblation
                    and also while that which had been offered was being distributed to the people.
                    A very intimate connexion between these four parts of the choral service can
                    generally be observed; thus, taking the first Sunday in the ecclesiastical year,
                    we find both in the <hi rend="italic">Antiph&lt;mary</hi> and in the modern <hi
                        rend="italic">Missal</hi> that the antiphon is Ps. XXV. 1-3, the psalmus Ps.
                    xxv. 4, the responsorium (graduale) and versus Ps. xxv. 3 and xxv. 4, the
                    offertorium and versus Ps. xxv. 1-3 and Ps. xxv. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> The
                    communio is Ps. lxxxv. 12, one of the verses of the responsorium being Ps.
                    lxxxv. 7. In the selection of the introits there are also traces of a certain
                    rotation of the psalms in the Psalter having been observed.</p>

                    may be celebrated, prescribing the hours of celebration, the kind and colour of
                    vestments to be used, and the ritual to be followed (ritus celebrandi missam),
                    and giving directions as to what is to be done in case of various defects or
                    imperfections which may arise. The <hi rend="italic">Praeparatio</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Missam,</hi> which comes next, is a
                    short manual of devotion containing psalms, hymns, and prayers to be used as
                    opportunity may occur before and after celebration. Next comes the proper of the
                    season <hi rend="italic">(Proprium Missarum</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        Tempore),</hi> occupying more than half of the entire volume. It contains
                    the proper introit, collect (one or more), epistle, gradual (tract or sequence),
                    gospel, offertory, secreta (one or more), communion, and post-communion for
                    every Sunday of the year, and also for the festivals and ferias connected with
                    the ecclesiastical seasons, as well as the offices peculiar to the ember days,
                    Holy Week, Easter, and Whitsuntide. Between the office for Holy Saturday and

                    followed by the proper of the saints <hi rend="italic">(Proprium</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Sanctorum),</hi> containing what is special to each saint’s
                    day in the order of the calendar, and by the <hi rend="italic">Commune
                        Sanctorum,</hi> containing such offices as the common of one martyr and
                    bishop, the common of one martyr not a bishop, the common of many martyrs in
                    paschal time, the common of many martyrs out of paschal time, and the like. A
                    variety of masses to be used at the feast of the dedication of a church, of
                    masses for the dead, and of votive masses (as for the sick, for persons
                    journeying, for bridegroom and bride) follow, and also certain benedictions.
                    Most missals have an appendix also containing certain local masses of saints to
                    be celebrated “ex induito apostolico.”</p>
                <p>Masses fall into two great subdivisions :—(1) ordinary or regular (secundum
                    ordinem officii), celebrated according to the regular rotation of fast and
                    feast, vigil and feria, in the calendar; (2) extraordinary or occasional (extra
                    ordinem officii), being either “votive” or “for the dead,” and from the nature
                    of the case having no definite time prescribed for them. Festival masses are
                    either double, half-double, or simple, an ordinary Sunday mass being a
                    half-double. The difference depends on the number of collects and secretae; on a
                    double only one of each is offered, on a halfdouble there are two or three, and
                    on a simple there may be as many as five, or even seven, of each. Any mass may
                    be either high (missa solennis) or low (missa privata). The distinction depends
                    upon the number of officiating clergy, certain differences of practice as to
                    what is pronounced aloud and what inaudibly, the use or absence of incense,
                    certain gestures, and the like. Solitary masses are forbidden; there must be at
                    least an acolyte to give the responses. The vestments prescribed for the priest
                    are the amice, alb, cingulum or girdle, maniple, stole, and chasuble (planeta);
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Costume,</hi> vol. vi. p. 462. There are certain
                    distinctions of course for a bishop or abbot. The colour of the vestments and of
                    the drapery of the altar varies according to the day, being either white, red,
                    green, violet, or black. This last custom does not go much further back than
                    Innocent III., who explains the symbolism intended.</p>
                <p>Subjoined is an account of the manner of celebrating high mass according to the
                    rite at present in force.</p>
                <p>1. The priest who is to celebrate, having previously confessed (if necessary) and
                    having finished matins and lauds, is to seek leisure for private prayer
                    (fasting) and to use as he has opportunity the ‘ ‘ prayers before mass” already
                    referred to. How the robing in the sacristy is next to be gone about is minutely
                    prescribed, and prayers are given to be used as each article is put on. The
                    sacramental elements having previously been placed on the altar or on a credence
                    table, the celebrant enters the church and takes his stand before the lowest
                    step of the altar, having the deacon on his right and the subdeacon on his left.
                    After invoking the Trinity (In nomine Patris, &amp;c. ) he repeats alternately
                    with those who are with him the psalm “Judica me, Deus,” which is preceded in
                    the usual way by an antiphon (Introibo ad altare Dei), and followed also by the
                    Gloria and Antiphon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>This antiphon is not to be confounded with the Antiphona ad
                            Introitum further on. This use of the 43d Psalm goes as far back at
                            least as the end of the 11th century, being mentioned by Micrologus
                            (1080). It is omitted in masses for the dead and during Holy

                    who in turn respond with the prayer for divine forgiveness, “Misereatur.” The
                    priest then gives the absolution (“Indulgentiam ”), and after the versicles and
                    responses beginning “Deus, tu conversus” he audibly says, “Oremus,” and
                    ascending to the altar silently offers two short prayers, one asking for
                    forgiveness and liberty of access through Christ, and another indulgence for
                    himself “through the merits of thy saints whose relics are here.” Receiving the
                    thurible from the deacon he incenses the altar, and is thereafter himself
                    incensed by the deacon. He then reads the Introit, which is also sung by the
                    choir; the “Kyrie Eleison” is then said, after which the words “Gloria in

                <p>2. Kissing the altar, and turning to the people with the formula “Dominus
                    vobiscum,” the celebrant proceeds with the collect or collects proper to the
                    season or day, which are read secretly. The epistle for the day is then read by
                    the subdeacon, and is followed by the gradual, tract, alleluia, or sequence,
                    according to the time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                            a special bearing on the festival of the day. See, for example, the
                            sequence, “Lauda Sion Salvatorem,” on Corpus Christi day.</p></note>
                    This finished, the deacon places the book of the gospels on the altar, and the
                    celebrant blesses the incense. The deacon kneels before the altar and offers the
                    prayer “Munda cor meum,” afterwards takes the book from the altar, and kneeling
                    before the celebrant asks his blessing, which he receives with the words
                    “Dominus sit in corde tuo.” Having kissed the hand of the priest, he goes
                    accompanied by acolytes with incense and lighted candles to the pulpit, and with
                    a “Dominus vobiscum” and minutely prescribed crossings and incensings gives out
                    and reads the gospel for the day, at the close of which “Laus tibi, Christe” is
                    said, and the book is brought to the celebrant and kissed with the words ‘ ‘ Per
                    evangelica dicta deleantur nostra delicta.” The celebrant then standing at the
                    middle of the altar sings the words “Credo in unum Deum,” and the rest of the
                    Nicene creed is sung by the choir.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>3. With “Dominus vobiscum” and “Oremus” the celebrant proceeds to read the
                    Offertory, which is also sung by the choir. This finished he receives the paten
                    with the host from the deacon, and after offering the host with the prayer
                    beginning ‘ ’ Suscipe, Sancte Pater” places it upon the corporal. The deacon
                    then ministers wine and the subdeacon water, and before the celebrant mixes the
                    water with the wine he blesses it in the prayer “Deus qui humanae.” He then
                    takes the chalice, and having offered it ( ‘ ‘ Offerimus tibi, Domine ”) places
                    it upon the corporal and covers it with the pall. Slightly bowing over the
                    altar, he then offers the prayer “In spiritu humilitatis,” and, lifting up his
                    eyes and stretching out his hands, proceeds with “Veni sanctificator.” After
                    blessing the incense (“Per intercessionem beati Michaelis archangeli ”) he takes
                    the thurible from the deacon and incenses the bread and wine and altar, and is
                    afterwards himself incensed as well as the others in their order. Next going to
                    the epistle side of the altar he washes his fingers as he recites the verses of
                    the 26th Psalm beginning “Lavabo.” Returning and bowing before the middle of the
                    altar, with joined hands he says, “Suscipe, sancta Trinitas,” then turning
                    himself towards the people he raises his voice a little and says, “Orate,
                    fratres” (“that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father
                    Almighty”), the response to which is “Suscipiat Dominus sacrificium de manibus
                    tuis," &amp;c. He then recites the secret prayer or prayers, and at the end
                    says, with an audible voice, “Per omnia saecula saeculorum” (A ’. “Amen”).</p>
                <p>4. Again saluting with a “Dominus vobiscum,” he lifts up his hands and goes on to
                    the “Sursum Corda” and the rest of the Preface. A different intonation is given
                    for each of the prefaces.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    At the Sanctus the handbell is rung. If there is a choir the Sanctus is sung
                    while the celebrant goes on with the Canon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The approved usage appears to be in that case that it is
                            sung as far as “Hosanna in Excelsis” before the elevation, and
                            “Benedictus qui venit” is reserved till afterwards. In France it was a
                            very common custom, made general*for a time at the request of Louis
                            XII., to sing “0 salutaris hostia " at the elevation.</p></note> After
                    the words of consecration of the wafer, which are said “secretly, distinctly,
                    and attentively,” the celebrant kneels and adores the host, rising elevates it,
                    and replacing it on the corporal again adores it (the bell meanwhile being
                        rung).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The history
                            of the practice of elevating the host is somewhat obscure. It seems to
                            have arisen out of the custom of holding up the oblations, as mentioned
                            in the <hi rend="italic">Ordo Romanus</hi> (see above). The elevation of
                            the host, as at present practised, was first enjoined by Pope Honorius
                            III. The use of the handbell at the elevation is still later, and was
                            first made general by Gregory XI.</p></note> The same rite is observed
                    when the chalice is consecrated. Immediately before the Lord’s Prayer, at the
                    words “per ipsum et cum ipso et in ipso,” the sign of the cross is made three
                    times over the chalice with the host, and towards the close of the “embolism”
                    the fraction of the host takes place. After the words “Pax Domini sit semper
                    vobiscum” the emission of the particle into the cup takes place with the words
                    “Haec commixtio et consecratio,” &amp;c. The celebrant then says the Agnus Dei
                    three times.</p>
                <p>5. While the choir sings the Agnus Dei and the Communion, the celebrant proceeds,
                    still “secrete,” with the remainder of the office, which though printed as part
                    of the canon is more conveniently called the Communion and Post-communion. After
                    the prayer for the peace and unity of the church (“Domine Jesu Christe, qui
                    dixisti ”) he salutes the deacon with the kiss of peace, saying, “Pax tecum”;
                    the subdeacon is saluted in like manner, and then conveys the “pax” to the rest
                    of the clergy who may be assisting. The celebrant then communicates under both
                    species with suitable prayers and actions, and afterwards administers the
                    sacrament to the other communicants if there be any. Then while the wine is
                    poured into the cup for the first ablution he says, “Quod ore sumpsimus”; having
                    taken it he says, “Corpus tuum, Domine.” After the second ablution he goes to
                    the book and reads the Communion. Then turning to the people with “Dominus
                    vobiscum” he reads the Postcommunion (one or more); turning once more to the
                    congregation he uses the old dismissal formula “Dominus vobiscum” (A. Et cum
                    spiritutuo), and “Ite, missa est” [or “Benedicamus Domino,” in those masses from
                    which “Gloria in Excelsis” has been omitted] (Ä. Deo Gratias). Bowing down
                    before the altar he offers the prayer “Placeat tibi, sancta Trinitas,” then
                    turning round he makes the sign of the cross over the congregation with the
                    words of the benediction (“Benedicat”).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The benediction is omitted in masses for the
