                <p><label type="entry">MOHAIR</label> is the woolly hair of a variety of the common
                    or domestic goat inhabiting the regions of Asiatic Turkey, of which Angora is
                    the centre, whence the animal is known as the Angora Goat (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Goat,</hi> vol. x. p. 708). Goat’s hair has been known and used
                    as a textile material in the East from the most remote periods; but neither the
                    Angora goat nor its wool was known in Western Europe till, in 1655, the animal
                    was described by the naturalist Tournefort. That textures of mohair were in use
                    in England early in the 18th century is obvious from Pope’s allusion :—</p>
                <p>‘ ‘ And, when she sees her friend in deep despair, Observes how much a chintz
                    exceeds mohair.”</p>
                <p>Owing, however, to the jealous restrictions of the Turkish power, it was not till
                    1820 that mohair became a regular article of import into the United Kingdom. In
                    that year a few bales came into the market; but so little was the material
                    appreciated that it only realized 10d. per lb. In 1870 average mohair fleece was
                    selling at five times that price. From the small beginning of 1820 the imports
                    gradually waxed, and the trade received a very considerable impetus through the
                    introduction in 1836, by Titus Salt, of the analogous fibre alpaca. The
                    increasing demand for and value of mohair early stimulated endeavours to
                    acclimatize the Angora goat in other regions; but all European attempts have
                    failed, owing to humid and ungenial climates. In 1849 a flock was taken by Dr J.
                    P. Davis to the United States of America, and since that time many fresh drafts
                    have been obtained and distributed to Virginia and various Southern States, and
                    to California and Oregon in the west. In these high and dry regions the goats
                    thrive; and the flocks in the Western States now number many thousands. The
                    Angora goat has also been introduced into the Cape of Good Hope with much
                    success. The first importation of mohair from the Cape, made in 1862, amounted
                    to 1036 lb; and now about one-tenth of the total British supply is received from
                    that source. Mohair has also been received in England from goats reared
                    successfully in Fiji, where they were first introduced in 1874, and there are
                    also thriving flocks in Australia.</p>
                <p>The trade in mohair between Asia Minor and western Europe is controlled in
                    Constantinople. There upwards of twenty varieties of fleeces are distinguished
                    according to the localities of their production, the richest and most lustrous
                    qualities being produced in hilly and forest regions, while the fleeces from the
                    open plains are comparatively kempy, coarse, and cottony. From the Lake Van
                    district on the eastern borders of Asiatic Turkey a distinct and inferior
                    variety of wool is obtained. It is known in commerce as Van mohair, and
                    consists, to the extent of about 70 per cent., of white wool slightly streaked
                    with black, with 30 per cent, of coloured red and black wool. At Konieh in the
                    south, also, an inferior mohair known as Pelotons is produced, 80 per cent, of
                    which is black and red, and the remainder white. The average weight of an Angora
                    goat fleece is from 5 to 6 lb. The finest quality of wool is obtained from the
                    first clip, which is made in the second year of the animal. She-goats yield the
                    best wool, after which come wethers, while the rams give the coarsest fleeces.
                    Angora mohair is a brilliant white lustrous fibre, elastic and wiry in
                    character, and devoid of felting properties. It attains the length of four or
                    five inches, but the long fibre is mixed with an undergrowth of shorter wool,
                    which in the spinning process is combed out as “noils” for separate use. It is a
                    material of enormous durability, and, owing to its remarkable elasticity, it is
                    especially fitted for working into long piled fabrics, such as plush and
                    imitation furs, or for use in braids and bindings, and in boot and other laces.
                    It is largely used for making Utrecht velvet or furniture plush for the
                    upholstering of railway carriages, &amp;c., a trade centred at Amiens In the
                    making of imitation sealskins, and imitation beaver, otter, chinchilla, and
                    other furs, and for carriage rugs generally, mohair is extensively employed.
                    Many dress fabrics of mixed mohair and alpaca, cotton, or silk are also
                    manufactured; but with changes in fashion such materials are constantly changing
                    in style, composition, and name. Mohair is also used for making certain
                    qualities of lace, and an imitation of ostrich feathers for use as trimming has
                    been made from the fibre. The imports of mohair into the United Kingdom during
                    1882 amounted to 16,859,771 lb, valued at £1,433,584, a quantity largely in
                    excess of the imports of any previous year.</p>
