                    supplied the want of more refined entertainments.” This conception of the
                    “minstrel” has been generally accepted in England ever since Percy published his
                    <hi rend="italic">Reliques</hi><hi rend="italic">of Ancient Poetry,</hi> which
                    he gave to the world as the products of the genius of these anonymous popular
                    poets and harpers. The name has been fixed in the language by the usage of
                    romantic poets and novelists; Scott’s “last minstrel” and Moore’s “minstrel boy”
                    were minstrels in Percy’s sense of the word. The imagination was fascinated by
                    this romantic figure, and the laborious and soured antiquary Ritson argued in
                    vain that nobody before Bishop Percy had ever applied the word minstrel to such
                    an order of men, that no such order of men ever did exist in mediaeval England,
                    and that the historical English “minstrels,” so-called, were a much less gifted
                    and respectable class, being really instrumental musicians, either retainers or
                    strollers.</p>
                <p>The dispute between Ritson and Percy was partly a dispute about a word, and
                    partly a dispute about historical facts; and there can be little doubt that
                    Ritson was substantially right in both respects. The romantic bishop transferred
                    to the mediaeval English minstrel the social status and brilliant gifts of the
                    Anglo-Saxon <hi rend="italic">gleoman</hi> or <hi rend="italic">scop,</hi> and
                    the French <hi rend="italic">troubadour</hi> in the flourishing period of
                    Provençal poetry. That the gleemen sang to the harpversesof their own composing,
                    that some of them travelled from court to court as honoured guests, while others
                    were important attached court officials, and all received costly presents, is a
                    well attested historical fact. The household bard at Heorot in the poem of <hi
                    rend="italic">Beowulf,</hi> a man who bore many things in mind and found
                    skilfully linked words to express them, was one of King Hrothgar’s thanes; the
                    gleeman of the <hi rend="italic">Traveller's Song</hi> had visited all the
                    tribal chiefs of Europe, and received many precious gifts, rings and bracelets
                    of gold. The incidents in these poems may not be historic, but they furnish
                    indubitable testimony to the social position of the gleeman in those days; a
                    successful gleeman was as much honoured as a modern poet-laureate, and as richly
                    rewarded as a fashionable <hi rend="italic">prima</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >donna.</hi> Further, the strolling gleeman of a humbler class seems to have
                    been respected as a non-combatant; this much we may infer from the stories about
                    Alfred and Anlaff having penetrated an enemy’s camp in the disguise of gleemen,
                    whether these stories are true or not, for otherwise they would not have been
                    invented. The position of poets and singers in Provence from the 11th to the
                    13th century is still clearer. The classification of them by King Alphonso of
                    Castile in 1273, by which time honourable designations were getting mixed» may
                    help to determine the exact position of the English “minstrel.” There was first
                    the lowest class, the <hi rend="italic">bufos,</hi> who strolled among the
                    common people, singing ribald songs, playing on instruments, showing feats of
                    skill and strength, exhibiting learned dogs and goats, and so forth; then the
                    <hi rend="italic">joglars</hi> or <hi rend="italic">joculatores,</hi> who
                    played, sang, recited, conjured, men of versatile powers of entertainment, who
                    performed at the houses of the nobility, and were liberally remunerated; then
                    the <hi rend="italic">trobadors,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inventores,</hi>
                    whose distinction it was to compose verses, whether or not they had sufficient
                    executive faculty to sing or recite them.</p>
                <p>If we compare these distinctions with Percy’s definition of the minstrel, we see
                    that his minstrel would have corresponded with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >joglar,</hi> who also wrote his own songs and recitations. Now in the palmy
                    days of Provençal song there were many professional joglars, such as Arnaut
                    Daniel or Perdigo, who stood high among the most brilliant troubadours, and
                    visited on terms of social equality with nobles and princes. But long before
                    English became the court language the fashion had disappeared, and a new
                    division of functions had been developed. In Chaucer’s time the poet of society
                    no longer sang his verses to harp or fiddle, or amused his patrons with feats of
                    legerdemain; the king’s <hi rend="italic">gestour</hi> (teller of <hi
                    rend="italic">gestes}</hi> discharged the professional duty of amusing with
                    witty stories; and the social position of the <hi rend="italic">joglar</hi> had
                    very much sunk. Ritson was perfectly right in saying that no English poet of any
                    social position was a professional reciter to the harp of verses of his own
                    composing. The Provençal joglar, travelling from court to court, combined our
                    modern functions of poet, society journalist, entertainer, and musician. But
                    about the time when the word “minstrel” came to be applied to him the English
                    joglar was rapidly sinking or had already sunk to the social position of the
                    modern strolling mountebank, travelling showman, or music-hall singer. And the
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n501/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0501-0480"/> word minstrel had had a separate history before
                    it became synonymous (as in the <hi rend="italic">Catholicon Anglicum</hi> of
                    1483) with <hi rend="italic">gesticulator, histrio, joculator,</hi> and other
                    names for strolling entertainers. Derived from the Low Latin <hi rend="italic"
                    >ministralis,</hi> it was originally applied to those retainers whose business
                    it was to play upon musical instruments for the entertainment of their lords. In
                    Chaucer’s <hi rend="italic">Squire’s Tale,</hi> the “minstralles” play before
                    King Cambuscan as he dines in state “biforn him at the bord deliciously,” and
                    the “loude minstralcye” precedes him when he rises and withdraws to the
                    ornamented chamber,</p>
                <p>Ther as they sownen diuerse instrumentz, That it is lyk an heuen for to here.</p>
                <p>But even in Chaucer’s time there were less respectable musicians than those of
                    the king’s household—strolling musicians, players on trumpets, clarions,
                    taborets, lutes, rebecks, fiddles, and other instruments. These also were known
                    by the generic name of minstrels, whether because many of them had learnt their
                    art in noble households before they took to a vagabond life, or because the more
                    respectable of them affected to be in the service or under the patronage of
                    powerful nobles, as later on companies of strolling players figured as the
                    “servants” of distinguished patrons. All the allusions to minstrels in
                    literature from Langland’s time to Spenser’s point to them as strolling
                    musicians. Some of them may have sung to the harp verses of their own composing,
                    and some of them may have composed some of the ballads that now charm us with
                    their fresh and simple art; but the profession of the “minstrel,” properly
                    so-called, was much less romantic than Bishop Percy painted it. It was not
                    merely “the bigots of the iron time” that “called their harmless art a crime ”;
                    in a repressive Act passed by Henry IV. they appear with “westours, rymours, et
                    autres vacabondes” among the turbulent elements of the community.</p>
                <p>In a passage in Malory’s <hi rend="italic">Morte Darthur,</hi> the word minstrel
                    is applied to a personage who comes much nearer the ideal of the Provençal <hi
                    rend="italic">joglar.</hi> When Sir Dinadan wished to infuriate King Mark, he
                    composed a satirical song, and gave it to Elyot a harper to sing through the
                    country, Tristram guaranteeing him against the consequences. When King Mark took
                    him to task for this, the harper’s answer was, “Wit you well I am a minstrel,
                    and I must do as I am commanded of these lords that I bear the arms of.” And
                    because he was a minstrel King Mark allowed him to go unharmed. The service done
                    by Elyot the harper in the old romance is a good illustration of the political
                    function of the itinerant mediaeval <hi rend="italic">joculator·,</hi> but even
                    he did not sing verses of his own composing, and he was not a “minstrel” in the
                    sense in which the word was used by romantic poets after the publication of
                    Percy’s <hi rend="italic">Reliques.</hi> (w. Μ.)</p>
