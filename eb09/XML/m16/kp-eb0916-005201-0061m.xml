                    by the Messenians themselves. The site was chosen in conformity with a vision
                    which appeared to Epaminondas, and the walls were raised to the sound of flutes
                    playing the airs of Sacadas and Pronomus. The citadel was erected on the summit
                    of Mount Ithome, and the city on its southern slope and in the adjoining valley.
                    City and citadel were enclosed by a wall 47 stadia in length. Near the centre of
                    the city was the agora, with a famous spring called Arsinoe, and various temples
                    and statues, among the latter an iron statue of Epaminondas. The Hierothysion
                    contained many statues of gods and heroes, among them a bronze statue of
                    Epaminondas. In the gymnasium were statues of Hermes, Hercules, and Theseus by
                    Egyptian artists. In the stadium was a bronze statue of the great hero
                    Aristomenes, who had a sepulchral monument elsewhere in the city. On the summit
                    of the citadel was a famous spring called Clepsydra, and near it a temple of
                    Zeus Ithomatas, with a statue by the famous Argive artist Ageladas, executed
                    originally for the Messenian Helots who settled in Naupactus (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Messenia).</hi> It was in honour of this statue that the
                    festival of the Ithomsea was performed.</p>
                <p>The situation of Messene is one of the finest and most romantic in the world. The
                    view of Mount Ithome, with its level summit and its ancient and mediaeval ruins,
                    as one issues from the Langadha Pass in the Taygetus mountains, is beautiful
                    beyond description. And the view from the summit of the mountain itself, which
                    rises, steep and rugged, to the height of 2631 feet, and is crowned by the ruins
                    of fortifications of Cyclopean workmanship, is enchanting, hardly equalled by
                    any other in Greece. Near the middle of the ruins of the lower city stands a
                    wretched village named Mavrommati (Black Eye), so called from the Turkish name
                    of the spring Arsinoe, which still flows as plentifully as in the old days.
                    These ruins are the most imposing in Greece, and furnish the finest existing
                    specimen of Hellenic military architecture. Almost the entire circuit of the
                    ancient walls can be traced, and in some places they are standing to their full
                    height. They are built of large hewn stones laid in beautifully regular layers
                    without mortar, and are surmounted by towers, of which there seem to have been
                    originally over thirty. Seven of these are still in a good state of
                    preservation, and bear testimony to the thoroughness of the great enterprise
                    undertaken by Epaminondas. Two gates can still be distinguished, one on the
                    slope of Mount Ithome, the other (the northern or Megalopolis gate) on the north
                    side. The latter is a dipylon or double gate, opening into a circular enclosure
                    62 feet in diameter. The walls of this enclosure are built with extreme care,
                    and the soffit stone of the inner portal, which has been partly moved from its
                    place, reminds one of the lintel of the so-called treasury of Atreus at Mycenae.
                    Itis 18 ft. 8 in. × 4 ft. 2 in. × 2 ft. 10 in. Within the town several ancient
                    sites can still be distinguished—the stadium, the theatre, and several
                    temples.</p>
