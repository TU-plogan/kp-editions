                    province of Milan, at the branching of the railway for Lecco and Como, lies on
                    the Lambro, a tributary of the Po, mainly on the right bank, in a healthy and
                    attractive situation. Of the mediaeval fortifications little remains save the
                    Porta d’Agrate. The cathedral of St John Baptist is the principal object of
                    interest: Theodelinda’s basilica was enlarged at the close of the 13th century
                    by throwing the atrium into the main building, and the present marble façade was
                    erected about the middle of the 14th by Matteo da Campione. On the left-hand
                    side of the front rises an incongruous brick-built tower, 278 feet high, erected
                    by Peregrini. Within the church are the iron crown of Lombardy (removed by
                    Austria in 1859, and since restored) and the relics of Theodelinda, comprising
                    her crown, fan and comb of gold, and the golden hen and seven chickens,
                    representing Lombardy and her seven provinces. Next to the cathedral in artistic
                    importance come the church of Santa Maria in Istrada, and the broletto or old
                    palace of the commune, usually styled the Arengario: the former (founded in
                    1357) has a rich Bramantesque façade, reckoned one of the best pieces of
                    terra-cotta work in Lombardy, and the latter is raised on a system of pointed
                    arches, and has a tall square tower terminating in machicolations surrounding a
                    sharp central cone. San Michele was the scene of the coronation of Conrad III.
                    in 1128, and San Gerardo (formerly Sant’ Ambrogio) is named after the patron
                    saint of Monza, Gerardo de’ Tintori, who founded the first k&gt;cal hospital in
                    1174. The royal palace of Monza (1777), with its extensive gardens and parks,
                    lies not far from the town on the banks of the Lambro. Cotton goods and felt
                    hats are the staple products of Monza industry; then dyeing, organbuilding, and
                    a publishing trade. The population of the city was 15,450 in 1871, and that of
                    the commune increased from 24,661 in 1861 to 28,012 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Local antiquaries claim for Monza (Modicia or Modaetia) the rank of a Roman
                    colony, but it cannot have been a place of consequence till it attracted the
                    discerning eye of Theodoric; and, though it was a favourite residence with his
                    immediate successors, its first important associations are with Theodelinda (see
                    vol. xiv. p. 815). During the period of the republics Monza was sometimes
                    independent, sometimes subject to Milan. The Visconti, who ultimately became
                    masters of the city, built a castle in 1325 on the site now occupied by the
                    Palazzo Durini. In the course of its history Monza has stood thirty-two sieges,
                    and been repeatedly plundered, notably by the forces of Charles V. The countship
                    (1499- 1796) was purchased in 1546 by the wealthy banker Durini, and remained in
                    his family till the Revolution.</p>
