                    these hymns there can generally be no doubt that it refers to the king then on
                    the throne, or, in hymns of more general and timeless character, to the Davidic
                    king as such (without personal reference to one king);<note anchored="true"

                    kingship, its religious importance as the expression and organ of Jehovah’s
                    sovereignty, is prominent. When the Psalter became a liturgical book the
                    historical kingship had gone by, and the idea alone remained, no longer as the
                    interpretation of a present political fact, but as part of Israel’s religious
                    inheritance. It was impossible, however, to think that a true idea had become
                    obsolete merely because it found no expression on earth for the time being;
                    Israel looked again for an anointed king to whom the words of the sacred hymns
                    should apply with a force never realized in the imperfect kingship of the past.
                    Thus the psalms, especially such psalms as the second, were necessarily viewed
                    as prophetic; and meantime, in accordance with the common Hebrew representation
                    of ideal things as existing in heaven, the true king remains hidden with God.
                    The steps by which this result was reached must, however, be considered in
                    detail.</p>
                <p>The hope of the advent of an ideal king was only one feature of that larger hope
                    of the salvation of Israel from all evils, the realization of perfect
                    reconciliation with Jehovah, and the felicity of the righteous in Him, in a new
                    order of things free from the assaults of hostile nations and the troubling of
                    the wicked within the Hebrew community, which was constantly held forth by all
                    the prophets, from the time when the great seers of the 8th century <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> first proclaimed that the true conception of
                    Jehovah’s relation to His people was altogether different from what was
                    realized, or even aimed at, by the recognized civil and religious leaders of the
                    two Hebrew kingdoms, and that it could become a practical reality only through a
                    great deliverance following a sifting judgment of the most terrible kind. The
                    idea of a judgment so severe as to render possible an entire breach with the
                    guilty past, and of a subsequent complete realization of Jehovah’s kingship in a
                    regenerate nation, is common to all the prophets, but is expressed in a great
                    variety of forms and images, conditioned by the present situation and needs of
                    Israel at the time when each prophet spoke. As a rule the prophets directly
                    connect the final restoration with the removal of the sins of their own age, and
                    with the accomplishment of such a work of judgment as lies within their own
                    horizon; to Isaiah the last troubles are those of Assyrian invasion, to Jeremiah
                    the restoration follows on the exile to Babylon; Daniel connects the future
                    glory with the overthrow of the Greek monarchy. The details of the prophetic
                    pictures show a corresponding variation; but all agree in giving the central
                    place to the realization of a real effective kingship of Jehovah; in fact the
                    conception of the religious subject <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0063-0054"/> as th e nation of Israel, with a national
                    organization under Jehovah as king, is common to the whole Old Testament, and
                    forms the bond that connects prophecy proper with the so-called Messianic psalms
                    and similar passages which theologians call typical, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> with such passages as speak of the religious relations of the Hebrew
                    commonwealth, the religious meaning of national institutions, and so necessarily
                    contain ideal elements reaching beyond the empirical present. All such passages
                    are frequently called Messianic; but the term is more properly reserved as the
                    specific designation of one particular branch of the Hebrew hope of salvation,
                    which, becoming prominent in post-canonical Judaism, used the name of the
                    Messiah as a technical term (which it never is in the Old Testament), and
                    exercised a great influence on New Testament thought, —the term “the Christ” (ό
                    <hi rend="italic">χριστός)</hi> being itself nothing more than the translation
                    of “the Messiah.”</p>
                <p>In the period of the Hebrew monarchy the thought that Jehovah is the divine king
                    of Israel was associated with the conception that the human king reigns by right
                    only if he reigns by commission or “unction” from Him. Such was the theory of
                    the kingship in Ephraim as well as in Judah (Deut, xxxiii.; 2 Kings ix. 6), till
                    in the decadence of the northern state Amos (ix. 11) foretold the redintegration
                    of the Davidic kingdom, and Hosea (iii. 5; viii. 4) expressly associated a
                    similar prediction with the condemnation of the kingship of Ephraim as
                    illegitimate. So the great Judaean prophets of the 8th century connect the
                    salvation of Israel with the rise of a Davidic king, full of Jehovah’s Spirit,
                    in whom all the energies of Jehovah’s transcendental kingship are as it were
                    incarnate (Isa. ix. 6 <hi rend="italic">sq.;</hi> xi. 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.;</hi> Micah v.). This conception, however, is not one of the constant
                    elements of prophecy; indeed the later prophecies of Isaiah take a different
                    shape, looking for the decisive interposition of Jehovah in the crisis of
                    history without the instrumentality of a kingly deliverer. Jeremiah again speaks
                    of the future David or righteous sprout of David’s stem (xxiii. 5 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.;</hi> xxx. 9); and Ezekiel uses similar language (xxxiv.,
                    xxxvii.); but that such passages do not necessarily mean more than that the
                    Davidic dynasty shall be continued in the time of restoration under a series of
                    worthy princes seems clear from the way in which Ezekiel speaks of the prince in
                    chaps, xlv., xlvi. As yet we have no fixed doctrine of a personal Messiah, but
                    only material from which such a doctrine might by and by be drawn. The religious
                    view of the kingship is still essentially the same as in 2 Sam. vii., where the
                    endless duration of the Davidic dynasty is set forth as part of Jehovah’s plan
                    of grace to His nation.</p>
                <p>There are other parts of the Old Testament—notably 1 Sam. viii., xii.—in which
                    the very existence of a human kingship is represented as a departure from the
                    ideal of a perfect theocracy. And so, in and after the exile, when the monarchy
                    had come to an end, we find pictures of the latter days in which its restoration
                    has no place. Such is the great prophecy of Isa. xl.-lxvi., in which Cyrus is
                    the anointed of Jehovah, and the grace promised to David is transferred to ideal
                    Israel (“the servant of Jehovah ”) as a whole (Isa. lv. 3). So too there is no
                    allusion to a human kingship in Joel or in Malachi; the old forms of the Hebrew
                    state were broken, and religious hopes expressed themselves in other
                    shapes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The hopes which
                    Haggai and Zechariah connect with the name of Zerubbabel, a descendant of David,
                    hardly form an exception to this statement.</p></note> In the book of Daniel it
                    is collective Israel that appears under the symbol of a “son of man,” and
                    receives the kingdom (vii. 13, 18, 22, 27).</p>
                <p>Meantime, however, the decay and ultimate silence of the living prophetic word
                    concurred with the prolonged political servitude of the nation to produce a most
                    important change in the type of the Hebrew religion. The prophets had never
                    sought to add to the religious unity of their teaching unity in the pictorial
                    form in which from time to time they depicted the final judgment and future
                    glory. For this there was a religious reason. To them the kingship of Jehovah
                    was not a mere ideal, but an actual reality. Its full manifestation indeed, to
                    the eye of sense and to the unbelieving world, lay in the future; but true faith
                    found a present stay in the sovereignty of Jehovah, daily exhibited in
                    providence and interpreted to each generation by the voice of the prophets. And,
                    while Jehovah’s kingship was a living and present fact, it refused to be
                    formulated in fixed invariable shape. But when the prophets ceased and their
                    place was taken by the scribes, the interpreters of the written word, when at
                    the same time the yoke of foreign oppressors rested continually on the land,
                    Israel no longer felt itself a living nation, and Jehovah’s kingship, which
                    presupposed a living nation, found not even the most inadequate expression in
                    daily political life. Jehovah was still the lawgiver of Israel, but His law was
                    written in a book, and He was not present to administer it. He was still the
                    hope of Israel, but the hope was all dissevered from the present; it too was to
                    be read in books, and these were interpreted of a future which was no longer, as
                    it had been to the prophets, the ideal development of forces already at work in
                    Israel, but wholly new and supernatural. The present was a blank, in which
                    religious duty was summed up in patient obedience to the law and penitent
                    submission to the Divine chastisements; the living realities of divine grace
                    were but memories of the past, or visions of “the world to come.” The scribes,
                    who in this period took the place of the prophets as the leaders of religious
                    thought, were mainly busied with the law; but no religion can subsist on mere
                    law; and the systematization of the prophetic hopes, and of those more ideal
                    parts of the other sacred literature which, because ideal and dissevered from
                    the present, were now set on one line with the prophecies, went on side by side
                    with the systematization of the law, by means of a harmonistic exegesis, which
                    sought to gather up every prophetic image in one grand panorama of the issues of
                    Israel’s and the world’s history. The beginnings of this process can probably be
                    traced within the canon itself, in the book of Joel and the last chapters of
                    Zechariah;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Joel,</hi> vol. xiii. p. 706, and Stade’s articles
                    “Deuterozacharja,” <hi rend="italic">Z.f. ATliche</hi> B¾s., 1881-82. Compare
                    Dan. ix. 2 for the use of the older prophecies in the solution of new problems
                    of faith.</p></note> and, if this be so, we see from Zech. ix. that the picture
                    of the ideal king early claimed a place in such constructions. The full
                    development of the method belongs, however, to the post-canonical literature,
                    and was naturally much less regular and rapid than the growth of the legal
                    traditions of the scribes. The attempt to form a schematic eschatology left so
                    much room for the play of individual fancy that its results could not quickly
                    take fixed dogmatic shape; and it did not appeal to all minds alike or equally
                    at all times. It was in crises of national anguish that men turned most eagerly
                    to the prophecies, and sought to construe their teachings as a promise of speedy
                    deliverance in such elaborate schemes of the incoming of the future glory as
                    fill the <hi rend="smallcaps">Apocalyptic Literature</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.υ.).</hi> But these books, however influential, had no public authority, and
                    when the yoke of oppression was lightened but a little their enthusiasm lost
                    much of its contagious power. It is not therefore safe to measure the general
                    growth of eschatological doctrine by the apocalyptic books, of which Daniel
                    alone attained a canonical position. In the Apocrypha eschatology has a very
                    small place; but there is enough to show that the hope of Israel was never
                    forgotten, and that the imagery of the prophets had <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n64/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0064-0055"/> moulded that hope into certain fixed forms which
                    were taken with a literalness not contemplated by the prophets themselves. It
                    was, however, only very gradually that the figure and name of the Messiah
                    acquired the prominence which they have in later Jewish doctrine of the last
                    things and in the official exegesis of the Targums. In the very developed
                    eschatology of Daniel they are, as we have seen, altogether wanting, and in the
                    Apocrypha, both before and after the Maccabee revival, the everlasting throne of
                    David’s house is a mere historical reminiscence (Sirach xlvii. 11; 1 Mac. ii.
                    57). So long as the wars of independence worthily occupied the energies of the
                    Palestinian Jews, and the Hasmonaean sovereignty promised a measure of
                    independence and felicity under the law, in which the people were ready to
                    acquiesce, at least, till the rise of a new prophet (1 Mac. xiv. 41), the hope
                    that connected itself with the house of David was not likely to rise to fresh
                    life, especially as a considerable proportion of the not very numerous passages
                    of Scripture which speak of the ideal king might with a little straining be
                    applied to the rising star of the new dynasty (comp, the language of 1 Mac. xiv.
                    4-15). It is only in Alexandria, where the Jews were still subject to the yoke
                    of the Gentile, that at this time (c. 140 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> we
                    find the oldest Sibylline verses (iii. 652 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi>
                    proclaiming the approach of the righteous king whom God shall raise up from the
                    East (Isa. xli. 2) to establish peace on earth and inaugurate the sovereignty of
                    the prophets in a regenerate world. The name Messiah is still lacking, and the
                    central point of the prophecy is not the reign of the deliverer but the
                    subjection of all nations to the law and the temple.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="smallcaps">Israel</hi> (vol. xiii. p. 423 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> It
                    was a struggle for mastery between a secularized hierarchy on the one hand, to
                    whom the theocracy was only a name, and whose whole interests were those of
                    their own selfish politics, and on the other hand a party to which God and the
                    law were all in all, and whose influence depended on the maintenance of the
                    doctrine that the exact fulfilling of the law according to the precepts of the
                    scribes was the absorbing vocation of Israel. This doctrine had grown up in the
                    political nullity of Judaea under Persian and Grecian rule, and no government
                    that possessed or aimed at political independence could possibly show constant
                    deference to the punctilios of the schoolmen. The Pharisees themselves could not
                    but see that their principles were politically impotent; the most scrupulous
                    observance of the Sabbath, for example—and this was the culminating point of
                    legality —could not thrust back the arms of the heathen. Thus the party of the
                    scribes, when they came into conflict with an active political power, which at
                    the same time claimed to represent the theocratic interests of Israel, were
                    compelled to lay fresh stress on the doctrine that the true deliverance of
                    Israel must come from God and not from man. We have seen indeed that the
                    legalism which accepted</p>
                <p>Jehovah as legislator, while admitting that his executive sovereignty as judge
                    and captain of Israel was for the time dormant, would from the first have been a
                    self-destructive position without the complementary hope of a future vindication
                    of divine justice and mercy, when the God of Israel should return to reign over
                    his people for ever. Before the Maccabee revival the spirit of nationality was
                    so dead that this hope lay in the background; the ethical and devotional aspects
                    of religion under the law held the first place, and the monotony of political
                    servi <hi rend="superscript"> +</hi> ude gave little occasion for the
                    observation that a true national life requires a personal leader as well as a
                    written law. But now the Jews were a nation once more, and national ideas came
                    to the front. In the Hasmonaean sovereignty these ideas took a political form,
                    and the result was the secularization of the kingdom of God for the sake of a
                    harsh and rapacious aristocracy. The nation threw itself on the side of the
                    Pharisees; but it did so in no mere spirit of punctilious legalism, but with the
                    ardour of a national enthusiasm deceived in its dearest hopes, and turning for
                    help from the delusive kingship of the Hasmonaeans to the true kingship of
                    Jehovah, and to His vicegerent the king of David’s house. It is in this
                    connexion that the doctrine and name of the Messiah appear in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalter of Solomon.</hi> The eternal kingship of the house of
                    David, so long forgotten, is seized on as the proof that the Hasmonaeans have no
                    divine right.</p>
                <p>‘ ’ Thou, Lord, art our king for ever and ever. . . . Thou didst choose David as
                    king over Israel, and swarest unto him concerning his seed for ever that his
                    kingship should never fail before Thee. And for our sins sinners (the
                    Hasmonaeans) have risen up over us, taking with force the kingdom which Thou
                    didst not promise to them, profaning the throne of David in their pride. But
                    Thou, 0 Lord, will cast them down and root out their seed from the land, when a
                    man not of our race (Pompey) rises up against them. . . . Behold, 0 Lord, and
                    raise up their king the Son of David at the time that Thou hast appointed, to
                    reign over Israel Thy servant; and gird him with strength to crush unjust
                    rulers; to cleanse Jerusalem from the heathen that tread it under foot, to cast
                    out sinners from Thy inheritance; to break the pride of sinners and all their
                    strength as potter’s vessels with a rod of iron (Ps. ii. 9); to destroy the
                    lawless nations with the word of his mouth (Isa. xi. 4); to gather a holy nation
                    and lead them in righteousness. . . . He shall divide them by tribes in the
                    land, and no stranger and foreigner shall dwell with them; he shall judge the
                    nations in wisdom and righteousness. The heathen nations shall serve under his
                    yoke; he shall glorify the Lord before all the earth, and cleanse Jerusalem in
                    holiness as in the beginning. From the ends of the earth all nations shall come
                    to see his glory and bring the weary sons of Zion as gifts (Isa. lx. 3 <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.);</hi> to see the glory of the Lord with which God hath
                    crowned him, for he is over them a righteous king taught of God. In his days
                    there shall be no unrighteousness in their midst; for they are all holy, and
                    their king the anointed of the Lord (χp&lt;στδs <hi rend="italic">κlpιos,</hi>
                    mistranslation of ∏l∏' Π'B ’ 0). He shall not trust on horses and riders and
                    bowmen, nor heap up gold and silver for war, nor put his confidence in a
                    multitude for the day of war. ‘The Lord is king,’ that is his hope. . . . He is
                    pure from sin to rule a great people, to rebuke governors and destroy sinners by
                    his mighty word. In all his days he is free from offence against his God, for He
                    hath made him strong by the Holy Spirit. . . . His hone is in the Lord; who can
                    do aught against him? Strong in deeds and mighty in the fear of the Lord, he
                    feedeth the flock of the Lord in truth and righteousness, and suffereth not one
                    of them to stumble in the pasture. . . . So it beseemeth the king of Israel whom
                    God hath chosen to lead the house of Israel. . . . God hasten His mercy on
                    Israel to deliver them from the uncleanness of profane foes. The Lord is our
                    king for ever and ever. ”— <hi rend="italic">Psalt. Sol.</hi> xvii.</p>
                <p>This conception is traced in lines too firm to be those of a first essay; it had
                    doubtless grown upas an integral part of the religious protest against the
                    Hasmonaeans. And while the polemical motive is obvious, and the argument from
                    prophecy against the legitimacy of a non-Davidic dynasty is quite in the manner
                    of the scribes, the spirit of theocratic fervour which inspires the picture of
                    the Messiah is broader and deeper than their narrow legalism. In a word, the
                    Jewish doctrine of the Messiah marks the fusion of Pharisaism with the national
                    religious feeling of the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0065-0056"/> Maccabee revival. It is this national feeling
                    that, claiming a leader against the Romans as well as deliverance from the
                    Sadducee aristocracy, again sets the idea of the kingship rather than that of
                    resurrection and individual retribution in the central place which it had lost
                    since the captivity. Henceforward the doctrine of the Messiah is at once the
                    centre of popular hope and the object of theological culture. The New Testament
                    is the best evidence of its influence on the masses (see especially Matt, xxi.
                    9); and the exegesis of the Targums, which in its beginnings doubtless reaches
                    back before the time of Christ, shows how it was fostered by the Rabbins and
                    preached in the synagogues.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The Targumic passages that speak of the Messiah are registered by Buxtorf,
                    <hi rend="italic">Lex. Chald.,</hi> s.v.</p></note> Its diffusion far beyond
                    Palestine, and in circles least accessible to such ideas, is proved by the fact
                    that Philo himself <hi rend="italic">(De Praem. et Poen.,</hi> §16) gives a
                    Messianic interpretation of Num. xxiv. 27 (LXX.). It must not indeed be supposed
                    that the doctrine was as yet the undisputed part of Hebrew faith which it became
                    when the fall of the state and the antithesis to Christianity threw all J ewish
                    thought into the lines of the Pharisees. It has, for example, no place in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Assumptio Mosis</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Jubilees.</hi> But, as the fatal struggle with Rome became more and more
                    imminent, the eschatological hopes which increasingly absorbed the Hebrew mind
                    all group themselves round the person of the Messiah. In the later parts of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Book of Enoch</hi> (the “symbols” of chaps, xlv. <hi
                    rend="italic">sq.)</hi> the judgment day of the Messiah (identified with
                    Daniel’s “Son of Man ”) stands in the forefront of the eschatological picture.
                    Josephus <hi rend="italic">(B. J.</hi> vi. 5, § 4) testifies that the belief in
                    the immediate appearance of the Messianic king gave the chief impulse to the war
                    that ended in the destruction of the Jewish state; after the fall of the temple
                    the last apocalypses <hi rend="italic">(Baruch,</hi> 4 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ezra)</hi> still loudly proclaim the near victory of the God-sent king; and Bar
                    Cochebas, the leader of the revolt against Hadrian, was actually greeted as the
                    Messiah by Rabbi Akiba (comp. Luke xxi. 8). These hopes were again quenched in
                    blood; the political idea of the Messiah, the restorer of the Jewish state,
                    still finds utterance in the daily prayer of every Jew (the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sh</hi><hi rend="italic                     superscript"> ,</hi><hi

                    theology; but its historical significance was buried in the ruins of
                    Jerusalem.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>False
                    Messiahs have continued from time to time to appear among the Jews. Such was
                    Serenus of Syria <hi rend="italic">{circa</hi> 720 A.D.). Soon after, Messianic
                    hopes were active at the time of the fall of the 0may-yads, and led to a serious
                    rising under Abu 'Isa of Ispahan, who called himself forerunner of the Messiah.
                    The false Messiah David Alrui (Alroy) appeared among the warlike Jews in
                    Azerbijan in the middle of the 12th century. The Messianic claims of Abraham
                    Abu-lafia of Saragossa (born 1240) had a cabalistic basis, and the same studies
                    encouraged the wildest hopes at a later time. Thus Abarbanel calculated the
                    coming of the Messiah for 1503 A.D.; the year 1500 was in many places observed
                    as a preparatory season of penance; and throughout the 16th century the Jews
                    were much stirred and more than one false Messiah appeared. For the false
                    Messiah Sabbathai, see vol. xiii. p. 681.</p></note></p>
                <p>But the proof written in fire and blood on the fair face of Palestine that the
                    true kingdom of God could not be realized in the forms of an earthly state, and
                    under the limitations of national particularism, was not the final refutation of
                    the hope of the Old Testament. Amidst the last convulsions of political Judaism
                    a new and spiritual conception of the kingdom of God, of salvation, and of the
                    Saviour of God’s anointing, had shaped itself through the preaching, the death,
                    and the resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. As applied to Jesus the name of
                    Messiah lost all its political and national significance, for His victory over
                    the world, whereby He approved himself the true captain of salvation, was
                    consummated, not amidst the flash of earthly swords or the lurid glare of the
                    lightnings of Elias, but in the atoning death through which He entered into the
                    heavenly glory. Between the Messiah of the Jews and the Son of Man who came not
                    to be ministered to but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many,
                    there was on the surface little resemblance; and from their standpoint the
                    Pharisees reasoned not amiss that the marks of the Messiah were conspicuously
                    absent from this Christ. But when we look at the deeper side of the Messianic
                    conception in the <hi rend="italic">Psalter of Solomon,</hi> at the heartfelt
                    longing for a leader in the way of righteousness and acceptance with God which
                    underlies the aspirations after political deliverance, we see that it was in no
                    mere spirit of accommodation to prevailing language that Jesus did not disdain
                    the name in which all the hopes of the Old Testament were gathered up. The
                    kingdom of God is the centre of all spiritual faith, and the perception that
                    that kingdom can never be realized without a personal centre, a representative
                    of God with man and man with God, was the thought, reaching far beyond the
                    narrow range of Pharisaic legalism, which was the last lesson of the
                    vicissitudes of the Old Testament dispensation, the spiritual truth that lay
                    beneath that last movement of Judaism which concentrated the hope of Israel in
                    the person of the anointed of Jehovah.</p>
                <p>It would carry us too far to consider in this place the details of the Jewish
                    conception of the Messiah and the Messianic times as they appear in the later
                    apocalypses or in Rabbinical theology. See for the former the excellent summary
                    of Schürer, <hi rend="italic">NTliche</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitgeschichte,</hi>
                    §§ 28, 29 (Leipsic, 1874), and for the latter, besides the older books
                    catalogued by Schürer (of which Schoettgen, <hi rend="italic">Horae,</hi> 1742,

                    Drummond, <hi rend="italic">The Jewish Messiah</hi> (London. 1877), and Kuenen,
                    <hi rend="italic">Religion of Israel,</hi> chap. xii. For the Messianic hopes of
                    the Pharisees and the <hi rend="italic">Psalter of Solomon</hi> see especially
                    Wellhausen, <hi rend="italic">Pharisäer und Sadducäer</hi> (Greifswald, 1874).
                    In its ultimate form the Messianic hope of the Jews is the centre of the whole
                    eschatology, embracing the doctrine of the last troubles of Israel (called by
                    the Rabbins the “birth pangs of the Messiah”), the appearing of the anointed
                    king, the annihilation of the hostile enemy, the return of the dispersed of
                    Israel, the glory and worldsovereignty of the elect, the new world, the
                    resurrection of the dead, and the last judgment. But even the final form of
                    Jewish theology shows much vacillation as to these details, especially as
                    regards their sequence and mutual relation, thus betraying the inadequacy of the
                    harmonistic method by which they were derived from the Old Testament and the
                    stormy excitement in which the Messianic idea was developed. It is, for example,
                    an open question among the Rabbins whether the days of the Messiah belong to the
                    old or to the new world (∏J∏ θSiy∏ or K2Π <hi rend="smallcaps">dS⅛Π),</hi>
                    whether the resurrection embraces all men or only the righteous, whether it
                    precedes or follows the Messianic age. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Millennium.</hi></p>
                <p>We must also pass over the very important questions that arise as to the gradual
                    extrication of the New Testament idea of the Christ from the elements of Jewish
                    political doctrine which had so strong a hold of many of the first disciples—the
                    relation, for example, of the New Testament Apocalypse to contemporary Jewish
                    thought. A word, however, is necessary as to the Rabbinical doctrine of the
                    Messiah who suffers and dies for Israel, the Messiah son of Joseph or son of
                    Ephraim, who in Jewish theology is distinguished from and subordinate to the
                    victorious son of David. The developed form of this idea is almost certainly a
                    product of the polemic with Christianity, in which the Rabbins were hard pressed
                    by arguments from passages (especially Isa. liii. ) which their own exegesis
                    admitted to be Messianic, though it did not accept the Christian inferences as
                    to the atoning death of the Messianic king. That the Jews in the time of Christ
                    believed in a suffering and atoning Messiah is, to say the least, unproved and
                    highly improbable. See, besides the books above cited, De Wette, <hi
                    rend="italic">Opuscula·,</hi> Wünsche, <hi rend="italic">Die Leiden</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Messias,</hi> 1870. The opposite argument of King, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Yalkut on Zechariah</hi> (Cambridge, 1882), App. A, does not
                    really prove more than that the doctrine of the Messiah Ben Joseph found points
                    of attachment in older thought. ( W. R. S. )</p>
