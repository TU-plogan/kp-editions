                    America lying between the Alleghany Mountains on the east and the Rocky
                    Mountains on the west, and has an area (1,244,000 square miles) considerably
                    larger than all central Europe. The central artery through which the drainage of
                    this region passes is called the Mississippi river for about 1300 miles above
                    its mouth. The name is then usurped by a tributary, while the main stream
                    becomes known as the Missouri. From its remote sources in the Rocky Mountains to
                    the Gulf of Mexico the total length of the river is about 4200 miles. The other
                    principal tributaries are the Ohio, the Arkansas, and the Red River, but the
                    Yazoo and the St Francis often make dangerous contributions in seasons of
                    flood.</p>
                <p>The tables given below exhibit the hydraulic features of the Mississippi and its
                    principal tributaries.</p>
                <p>Below the influx of the Ohio the Mississippi traverses alluvial bottom lands
                    liable to overflow in flood seasons. The soil is of inexhaustible fertility,
                    producing large crops of corn in the northern portion, cotton in the middle
                    district, and sugar, rice, and orange groves near the mouth. These bottom lands,
                    averaging about 40 miles in width, extend from north to south for a distance of
                    500 miles, having a general southern slope of 8 inches to the mile. The river
                    winds through them in a devious course for 1100 miles, occasionally on the east
                    side washing bluffs from 100 to 300 feet in height, but usually confined by
                    banks of its own creation, which, as with all sediment-bearing rivers of like
                    character, are highest near the stream itself. The general lateral slope towards
                    the foot hills is about 6 inches <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0540-0519"/> in 5000 feet, but the normal fall in the first
                    mile is about 7 feet. Thus apparently following a low ridge through the bottom
                    lands, the tawny sea sweeps onward with great velocity, eroding its banks in the
                    bends and rebuilding them on the points, now forming islands by its deposits,
                    and now removing them as the direction of the flow is modified by the
                    never-ending changes in progress. Chief among such changes is the formation of
                    cut-ofls. Two eroding bends gradually approach each other until the water forces
                    a passage across the narrow neck. As the channel distance between these bends
                    may be many miles, a cascade perhaps 5 or 6 feet in height is formed, and the
                    torrent rushes through with a roar audible for miles. The banks dissolve like
                    sugar. In a single day the course of the river is changed, and steamboats pass
                    where a few hours before the plough had been at work. The checking of the
                    current at the upper and lower mouths of the abandoned channel soon obstructs
                    them by deposit, and forms in a few years one of the characteristic crescent
                    lakes which are so marked a feature on the maps.</p>
                <p>The total area of the bottom lands is about 32,000 square miles, of which only a
                    narrow strip along the immediate banks of the main river and of its principal
                    bayous and tributaries has even yet been brought under cultivation. A proper
                    system of protection against overflow would throw open 2,500,000 acres of rich
                    sugar land, 7,000,000 acres of the best cotton land in the world, and 1,000,000
                    acres of corn land of unsurpassed fertility.</p>
                <p>The work of embankment began in 1717, when the engineer De la Tour erected a dyke
                    or levee 1 mile long to protect the infant city of New Orleans from overflow.
                    Progress at first was slow. In 1770 the settlements extended only 30 miles above
                    and 20 miles below New Orleans; but by 1828 the levees, although quite
                    insufficient in dimensions, had become continuous nearly to the mouth of Red
                    River. In 1850 a great impulse was given to systematic embankment by the U.S.
                    Government, which gave over to the several States all unsold swamp and
                    overflowed lands within their limits to provide a fund for reclaiming the
                    districts liable to inundation. The action</p>

                <p>resulting from this caused alarm in Louisiana, for the great bottom lands above
                    were believed to act as reservoirs to receive the highest flood wave; and it was
                    imagined that if they were closed by levees the lower country would be
                    overwhelmed whenever the river in flood rose above its natural banks. The aid of
                    the Government was invoked, and Congress immediately ordered the necessary
                    investigations and surveys. This work was placed in charge of Captain (now
                    General) Humphreys, and an elaborate report covering the results of ten years of
                    investigation was published just after the outbreak of the civil war in 1861.
                    The second of the tables given above, and indeed most of the physical facts
                    respecting the river, are quoted from this standard authority.</p>
                <p>To understand the figures of the table it should be noted that at the mouth of
                    Red River, 316 miles above the passes, the water surface at the lowest stage is
                    only 5²⁄₁₀ feet above the level of the Gulf, where the mean tidal oscillation is
                    about l²⁄₁₀- feet. The river channel in this section is therefore a freshwater
                    lake, nearly without islands, 2600 feet wide and 100 feet deep along the deepest
                    line. At the flood stage the surface rises 50 feet at the mouth of Red River,
                    but of course retains its level at the Gulf, thus giving the head necessary to
                    force forward the increased volume of discharge. Above the mouth of Red River
                    the case is essentially different. The width increases and the depth decreases;
                    islands become numerous; the oscillation between high and low water varies but
                    little from 50 feet until the mouth of the Ohio is reached—a distance of about
                    800 miles. Hence the general slope in long distances is here nearly the same at
                    all stages, and the discharge is regulated by the varying resistances of cross
                    section, and by local changes in slope due to the passage of flood waves
                    contributed by the different tributaries. The effect of these different physical
                    conditions appears in the comparative volumes which pass through the channel. At
                    New Orleans the maximum discharge hardly reaches 1,200,000 cubic feet per
                    second, and a rising river at high stages carries only about 100,000 cubic feet
                    per second more than when falling at the same absolute level; while just below
                    the mouth of the Ohio the maximum flood volume reaches 1,400,000 cubic feet per
                    second, and at some stages a rising river may carry one-third more water than
                    when falling at the same absolute level.</p>
                <p>The percentage of sedimentary matter carried in suspension by the water varies
                    greatly at different times, but is certainly not dependent upon the stage above
                    low water. It is chiefly determined by the tributary whence the water proceeds,
                    but is also influenced by the caving of the banks, which is always excessive
                    when the river is rapidly falling after the spring flood. In long periods the
                    sedimentary matter is to the water by weight nearly as 1 to 1500, and by bulk as
                    1 to 2900. The amount held in suspension and annually contributed to the Gulf
                    constitutes a prism 1 mile square and 263 feet high. In addition to this amount
                    a large volume, estimated at 1 mile square and 27 feet high annually, is pushed
                    by the current along the bottom and thus transported to the Gulf.</p>
                <p>The mean annual succession of stages for long periods is quite uniform, but so
                    many exceptions are noted that no definite prediction can safely be made for any
                    particular epoch. The river is usually lowest in October. It rises rapidly until
                    checked by the freezing of the northern tributaries. It begins to rise again in
                    February, and attains its highest point about the 1st of April. After falling a
                    few feet it again rises until, early in June, it attains nearly the same level
                    as before. After this it rapidly recedes to low-water mark. As a rule the river
                    is above mid-stage from January to August inclusive, and below that level for
                    the remainder of the year.</p>
                <p>It has been established by measurement and observation that the great bottom
                    lands above Red River before the construction of their levees did not serve as
                    reservoirs to diminish the maximum wave which passed through Louisiana in great
                    flood seasons. They had already become filled by local rains and by water
                    escaping into them from the Mississippi through numerous bayous, so that at the
                    date of highest water the discharge into the river near their southern borders
                    was fully equal to the volume which the wave had lost in passing along their
                    fronts.</p>
                <p>In fine, the investigations between 1850 and 1860 established that no diversion
                    of tributaries was possible; that no reservoirs artificially constructed could
                    keep back the spring freshets which caused the floods; that the making of
                    cutoffs, which had sometimes been advocated as a measure of relief, so far from
                    being beneficial, was in the highest degree injurious; that, while outlets
                    within proper limits were theoretically advantageous, they were impracticable
                    from the lack of suitable sites; and, finally, that levees properly constructed
                    and judiciously placed would afford protection to the entire alluvial
                    region.</p>
                <p>During the civil war (1861-65) the artificial embankments were neglected; but
                    after its close large sums were expended by the States directly interested in
                    repairing them. The work was done without concert upon defective plans, and a
                    great flood early in 1874 inundated the country, causing terrible suffering and
                    loss. Congress, then in session, passed an Act creating a commission of five
                    engineers to determine and report on the best system for the permanent
                    reclamation of the entire alluvial region. Their report, rendered in 1875,
                    endorsed the conclusions of that of 1861, and advocated a general levee system
                    on each bank. This system comprised—(1) a main embankment raised to specified
                    heights sufficient to restrain the floods; and (2), where reasonable security
                    against caving required considerable areas near the river to be thrown out,
                    exterior levees of such a height as to exclude ordinary high waters but to allow
                    free passage to great floods, which as a rule only occur at intervals of five or
                    six years. The back country would thus be securely protected, and a safe refuge
                    would be provided for the inhabitants and domestic animals living upon the
                    portion subject to occasional overflow. An engineering organization was proposed
                    for constructing and maintaining these levees, and a detailed topographical
                    survey was recommended to determine their precise location. Congress promptly
                    approved and ordered the survey; but strong opposition on constitutional grounds
                    was raised to the construction of the levees by the Government.</p>
                <p>In the meantime complaints began to be heard respecting the low-water navigation
                    of the river below the mouth of the Ohio. Forty-three places above the mouth of
                    Red River afforded depths of less than 10 feet, and thirteen places depths less
                    than 5 feet, the aggregate length of such places being about 150 miles. A board
                    of five army engineers, appointed in 1878 to consider a plan of relief, reported
                    that 10 feet could probably be secured by narrowing ,the wide places to about
                    3500 feet with hurdle work, brush ropes, or brush dykes designed to cause a
                    deposit of sediment, and by protecting caving banks, when necessary, by such
                    light and cheap mattresses as experience should show to be best suited to the
                    work. Experiments in these methods were soon begun upon the river above Cairo,
                    and have since proved of decided benefit.</p>
                <p>In June 1879 Congress created a commission of seven members to mature plans to
                    correct, permanently determine, and deepen the channel, to protect the banks of
                    the river, to improve and give safety to navigation, to prevent destructive
                    floods, and to promote and facilitate commerce. Up to 1882 appropriations
                    amounting to £1,285,000 were made to execute the plans of this commission, but
                    with provisos that none of the funds were to be expended in repairing or
                    building levees for the protection of land against overflow, although such
                    levees might be constructed if necessary to deepen the channel and improve
                    navigation. Acting under this authority, the commission have allotted
                    considerable sums to repair existing breaks in the levees; but their chief
                    dependence is upon contracting the channel at low water by promoting lateral
                    deposits, and upon protecting the high-water banks against caving by mats of
                    brush, wire, &amp;c., ballasted where necessary with stone,—substantially the
                    plans proposed by the army board of 1878.</p>
                <p>The bars at the efflux of the passes at the mouth of the Mississippi have long
                    been recognized as serious impediments to commerce. The river naturally
                    discharges through three principal branches, the south-west pass, the south
                    pass, and the north-east pass, the latter through two channels, the most
                    northern of which is called Pass à 1’Outre. The ruling depth on the several bars
                    varies with the discharge over them, which in turn is controlled by the
                    successive advances of the passes. In the natural condition the greatest <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n544/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0544-0521"/> depth does not exceed Γ2 or 13 feet. The first
                    appropriation by Congress to secure increased depth was made in 1837, and was
                    expended in an elaborate survey and in a system of dredging by buckets, but the
                    plan of a ship canal was also discussed. At the next appropriation, made in
                    1852, a board of officers, appointed by the war department, recommended trying
                    in succession—(1) stirring up the bottom by suitable machinery, (2) dredging by
                    buckets, (3) constructing parallel jetties 5 miles long at the south-west pass,
                    to be extended as found necessary, (4) closing lateral outlets, and (5)
                    constructing a ship canal. A depth of 18 feet was secured by the first plan, and
                    was maintained until the available funds were exhausted. Under the next
                    appropriation (1856) an abortive attempt was made to apply the plan of jetties
                    to the south-west pass. This failed from defects in execution by the
                    contractors, but a depth of 18 feet was finally secured by dredging and
                    scraping. The report of 1861 discussed the subject of bar formation at length.
                    Although it approved the plan of jetties and closure of outlets as correct in
                    theory, the stirring up of the bottom by scrapers during the flood stages of the
                    river (six months annually) was recommended by it as the most economicaland
                    least objectionable. After the war this recommendation was carried into effect
                    for several years with improved machinery, giving at a moderate annual cost a
                    depth at times reaching 20 feet at extreme low water, but experience indicated
                    that not much more than 18 feet could be steadily maintained. This depth,
                    entirely satisfactory at first, soon became insufficient to meet the growing
                    demands of commerce, and in 1873 Major Howell, the engineer in charge, revived
                    the project of a ship canal. The subject was discussed carefully by a board of
                    army engineers, the majority approving a ship canal. In 1874 Congress
                    constituted a special board which, after visiting Europe and examining similar
                    works of improvement there, reported in favour of constructing jetties at the
                    south pass, substantially upon the plan used by Mr Caland at the mouth of the
                    Meuse; and in March 1875 Captain J. B. Eads and associates were authorized by
                    Congress to open by contract a broad and deep channel through the south pass
                    upon the general plan proposed by this board. This contract called for “the
                    maintenance of a channel of 30 feet in depth and 350 feet in width for twenty
                    years” by “the construction of thoroughly substantial and permanent works by
                    which said channel may be maintained for all time after their completion.” The
                    jetties were to be not less than 700 feet apart. The sum of £1,080,000 was tobe
                    pai&lt;ζfor obtaining this channel, and£412,000 for maintaining it for twenty
                    years. In addition, the contractors were authorized to use any materials on the
                    public lands suitable for and needed in the work. The south pass was 12 <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ⅛ miles long. It had an average width of 730 feet and a
                    minimum interior channel depth of 29 feet. The distance from the 30-foot curve
                    inside the pass across the bar to the 30-foot curve outside was 11,900 feet. The
                    minimum depth at average flood tide on the bar was about 8 feet. The discharge
                    at the mouth was about 57,000 cubic feet of water per second, transporting
                    annually about 22 million cubic yards of sediment in suspension to the Gulf. A
                    small island and shoal existed at the head of the pass, the channel there having
                    a minimum depth of 17 feet. The work was begun on June 2, 1875, and has been so
                    far successful that during the year ending June 30, 1882, a channel was
                    maintained having a least depth of 30 feet between the jetties and extending
                    through the bar. Its least width was 20 feet, the average being 105 feet. The
                    26-foot channel had a least width of 200 feet, except for a few days. In the
                    pass itself the 26-foot channel had a least width of 50 feet. A very powerful
                    dredge-boat was at work between and beyond the jetties 87 days, of which 51 were
                    devoted to the channel in the Gulf. A deepening of 6 feet has occurred in Pass à
                    ΓOutre near its head since 1875. Up to the present time the work has proved of
                    great benefit to the commerce of New Orleans.</p>
