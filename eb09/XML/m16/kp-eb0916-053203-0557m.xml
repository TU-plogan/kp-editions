                    than that the strength of his memory was famous. Cicero, who attaches
                    considerable importance to the art, but more to the principle of order as the
                    best help to memory, speaks of Carneades (or perhaps Charmades) of Athens and
                    Metrodorus of Scepsis as distinguished examples of the use of well-ordered
                    images to aid the memory. The latter is said by Pliny to have carried the art so
                    far <hi rend="italic">ut nihil non</hi><hi rend="italic">iisdem</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">verbis</hi><hi rend="italic">redderet auditum.</hi> The Romans
                    valued such helps as giving facility in public speaking. The method used is
                    described by the author of <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi><hi rend="italic">ad
                    Heren.,</hi> iii. 16- 24; see also Quintilian <hi rend="italic">(Inst. Or.,</hi>
                    x. 1, 2), whose account is, however, somewhat incomplete and obscure. In his
                    time the art had almost ceased to be practised. The Greek and Roman system of
                    mnemonics was founded on the use of mental places and signs or pictures. The
                    thing to be remembered was localized in the imagination, and associated with a
                    symbol which concretely represented what it was desired to retain in the memory,
                    special care being taken that the symbols should be as vivid, pleasing, and
                    impressive as possible. The most usual method was to choose a large house, of
                    which the apartments, walls, windows, statues, furniture, &lt;fcc., were
                    severally associated with certain names, phrases, events, or ideas, by means of
                    symbolic pictures; and to recall these it was only necessary to search over the
                    apartments of the house, till the particular place was discovered where they had
                    been deposited by the imagination. As the things to be remembered increased, new
                    houses could be built, each set apart to a certain class of ideas or events, and
                    these houses were again constructed into a mnemonic town. In accordance with
                    this system, if it were desired to fix an historic date in the memory, it was
                    localized in an imaginary town divided into a certain number of districts, each
                    with ten houses, each house with ten rooms, and each room with a hundred
                    quadrates or memory-places, partly on the floor, partly on the four walls,
                    partly on the roof. Thus, if it were desired to fix in the memory the date of
                    the invention of printing (1436), an imaginary book, or some other symbol of
                    printing, would be placed in the thirty-sixth quadrate or memory-place of the
                    fourth room of the first house of the historic district of the town. The success
                    of the method depended largely on the power of the imagination to give the
                    different houses, rooms, Arc., characteristic varieties of aspect, and we may
                    suppose that it was the effort to frame suitable images and places, giving an
                    adventitious interest to dry details, that constituted the real advantage of the
                    system. Except that the rules of mnemonics are referred to by Martianus Capella,
                    nothing further is known regarding the practice of the art until the 13th
                    century, when the system of the Romans was revived and a good many treatises
                    were published on the subject. Among the voluminous writings of Roger Bacon is a
                    tractate <hi rend="italic">De Arte Memorativa,</hi> which exists in MS. at
                    Oxford. Raymond Lully devoted special attention to mnemonics in connexion with
                    his <hi rend="italic">ars</hi><hi rend="italic">generalis.</hi> The first
                    important modification of the method of the Romans was that invented by Conrad
                    Celtes, a German poet, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Epitoma</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">utramque Ciceronis rhetoricam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cum arte memorativa nova</hi> (1492), instead of places made use
                    of the letters of the alphabet. About the end of the 15th century Petrus de
                    Ravenna awakened such astonishment in Italy by his mnemonic feats that he was
                    believed by many to be a necromancer. His <hi rend="italic">Phoenix
                    Artis</hi><hi rend="italic">Mémorisé,</hi> published at Venice in 1491 in four
                    volumes, went through as many as nine editions, the seventh appearing at Cologne
                    in 1608. An impression equally great was produced about the end of the 16th
                    century by Lambert Schenkel, who taught mnemonics in France, Italy, and Germany,
                    and, although he was denounced as a sorcerer by the university of Louvain,
                    published in 1593 his tractate <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Memoria</hi> at Douai with the sanction of that celebrated theological faculty.
                    The most complete account of his system is given in two works by his pupil
                    Martin Sommer, published at Venice in 1619. Giordano Bruno, in connexion <pb

                <p>About the middle of the 17th century Winckelmann made known what he called the
                    “most fertile secret” in mnemonics, namely the use of letters with figures so as
                    to express numbers by words; and the philosopher Leibnitz adopted an alphabet
                    very similar to that of Winckelmann in connexion with his scheme for a form of
                    writing common to all languages. Winckelmann’s method was modified and
                    supplemented in regard to many details by Richard Grey, who published a <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoria</hi><hi rend="italic">Technica</hi> in 1730. The principal
                    part of Grey’s method is briefly this: “To remember anything in history,
                    chronology, geography, &amp;c., a word is formed, the beginning whereof being
                    the first syllable or syllables of the thing sought, does, by frequent
                    repetition, of course draw’ after it the latter part, which is so contrived as
                    to give the answer. Thus, in history, the Deluge happened in the year before
                    Christ two thousand three hundred forty-eight; this is signified by the word
                    Deleted, Del standing for Deluge and <hi rend="italic">etok</hi> for 2348.” To
                    assist in retaining the mnemonical words in the memory they were formed into
                    memorial lines. The vowel or consonant which Grey connected with a particular
                    figure was chosen arbitrarily; but in 1806 Feinaigle, a monk from Salem near
                    Constance, began in Paris to expound a system of mnemonics, one feature of which
                    was to represent the numerical figures by letters chosen on account of some
                    similarity to the figure to be represented or some accidental connexion with it.
                    This alphabet was supplemented by a complicated system of localities and signs,
                    with the aim of expressing, by a more vivid and impressive symbol, ideas which
                    for want of this are apt to pass from the memory, and of establishing between
                    ideas of the same group an intimate relation, so that the mention of the one
                    would suggest the other. Feinaigle, who published a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notice</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mnémoniqiie</hi> at Paris in 1806, came to England in 1811, and in the
                    following year published <hi rend="italic">The New Art of Memory.</hi> A
                    simplified form of Feinaigle’s method was published in 1823 by Aimé Paris, and
                    the use of symbolic pictures was revived in connexion with the latter by a Pole,
                    Jazwinsky, of whose system an account was published by J. Bern, under the title
                    <hi rend="italic">Expos^</hi><hi rend="italic">Général</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">Méthode Mnémonique</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Polonaise,</hi><hi rend="italic">perfectionnée à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Paris,</hi> Paris, 1839. Various other modifications of the systems of
                    Feinaigle and Aimé Paris were advocated by subsequent mnemonists, among them
                    being the Phrenotyping or Brain-Printing method of Beniowsky, the
                    Phreno-Mnemo-techny of Gouraud, and the Mnemotechnik of Carl Otto, a Dane. The
                    more complicated mnemonic systems have fallen almost into complete disuse; but
                    methods founded chiefly on the laws of association have been taught with some
                    success in Germany by, among others, Kothe, who is the author of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Mnemonik,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Katechismus der
                    Gedächtnisskunst,</hi> both of which have gone through several editions; and in
                    England by Dr. Edward Pick, whose <hi rend="italic">Memory and the Rational
                    Means of Improving it</hi> has also obtained a wide circulation. In certain
                    cases mnemonical devices may be found of considerable service; but all systems
                    which have aimed at completeness have been found rather to puzzle than aid the
                    memory. The fullest history of mnemonics is that given by J. C. F. von Aretin in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Systematische Anleitung zur Theorie und Praxis der
                    Mnemonik,</hi> 1810.</p>
