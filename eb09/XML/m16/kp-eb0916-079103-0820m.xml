                    distinguished families in France, is derived from Montmorency, now in the
                    department of Seine-et-Oise, in the immediate neighbourhood of Enghien and St
                    Denis, and about 9 miles to the north-north-west of Paris. The family, since its
                    first appearance in history in the person of <hi rend="smallcaps">Bouchard</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Burchard</hi> I., sire de Montmorency in the 10th
                    century, has furnished six constables and twelve marshals of France, several
                    admirals and cardinals, numerous grand officers of the crown and grand masters
                    of various knightly orders, and was declared by Henry IV. to be, after that of
                    the Bourbons, the first house in Europe. <hi rend="smallcaps">Matthieu</hi> I.,
                    sire de Montmorency, received in 1138 the post of constable, and died in 1160.
                    His first wife was Aline, the natural daughter of Henry I. of England; his
                    second, Adelaide or Alice of Savoy, -widow of Louis VI. and mother of Louis VII.
                    According to Duchesne, he shared the regency of France with Suger, during the
                    absence of the latter king on the second crusade. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Matthieu</hi> II. had an important share in the victory of Bouvines (1214), and
                    was made grand constable in 1218. During the reign of Louis VIII. (1223-1226) he
                    distinguished himself chiefly in the south of France (Niort, Rochelle,
                    Bordeaux). On the accession of Louis IX. he w*as one of the chief supports of
                    the queenregent Blanche of Castile, and was successful in reducing all the
                    vassals to obedience. He died in 1230. His younger son, Guy, in right of his
                    mother, became head of the house of Montmorency-Laval. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anne</hi> de Montmorency (1493-1567), so named, it is said, after his godmother
                    Anne of Brittany, was the first to attain the ducal title. He was born at
                    Chantilly in 1493, and was brought up with the dauphin, afterwards Francis I.,
                    whom he followed into Italy in 1515, distinguishing himself especially at
                    Marignano. In 1516 he became governor of Novara; in 1520 he was present at the
                    Field of Cloth of Gold, and afterwards had charge of important negotiations in
                    England. Successful in the defence of Mézières (1521), and as commander of the
                    Swiss troops in the Italian campaign of the same year, he was made marshal of
                    France in 1522, accompanied Francis into Italy in 1524, and was taken prisoner
                    at Pavia in 1525. Released soon afterwards, he was one of the negotiators of the
                    treaty of Madrid, and in 1530 reconducted the king’s sons into France. On the
                    renewal of the war by Charles V.’s invasion of France in 1536, Montmorency
                    compelled the emperor to raise the siege of Marseilles; he afterwards
                    accompanied the king of France into Picardy, and on the termination of the
                    Netherlands campaign marched to the relief of Turin. In 1538, on the
                    ratification of the ten years’ truce, he was rewarded with the office of
                    constable, but in 1541 he fell into disgrace, and did not return to public life
                    until the accession of Henry II. in 1547. In 1548 he repressed the insurrections
                    in the south-west, particularly at Bordeaux, with great severity, and in 154ΟΙ
                    550 conducted the war in the Boulonnais, negotiating the treaty for the
                    surrender of Boulogne on 24 th March 1550. In 1551 his barony was erected into a
                    duchy. Soon afterwards his armies found employment in the north-east in
                    connexion with the seizure of Metz, Toul, and Verdun by the French king. His
                    attempt to relieve St Quentin issued in his defeat and captivity (10th August
                    1557), and he did not regain his liberty until the peace of Cateau-Cambrésis in
                    1559. Supplanted in the interval by the Guises, he was treated with coldness by
                    the new king, Francis II., and compelled to give up his mastership of the royal
                    household<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n821/mode/1up"

                    of indemnity. On the accession of Charles IX. in 1560 he resumed his offices and
                    dignities, and, uniting with his former enemies, the Guises, played an important
                    part in the Huguenot Avar of 1562. Though the arms of his party were victorious
                    at Dreux, he himself fell into the hands of the enemy, and was not liberated
                    until the treaty of Amboise (19th March 1563). In 1567 he again triumphed at St
                    Denis, but received the death-blow of which he died soon afterwards at Paris.
                    His eldest son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Françoise</hi> de Montmorency (1530-1579),
                    was married to Diana, natural daughter of Henry II.; another son, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Henri</hi> I. de Montmorency (1534-1614), was constable of
                    France from 1593. <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi> II. (1595-1632), son of duke
                    Henry I., succeeded to the title in 1614, having previously been raised by Louis
                    XIII. to the office of grand admiral. In 1625 he defeated the French Protestant
                    fleet under Soubise, and seized the islands of Rhé and Oleron, but the jealousy
                    of Richelieu deprived him of the means of following up these advantages. In
                    1628-1629 he was allowed to command against the duke of Rohan in Languedoc; in
                    1630 he defeated the Piedmontese, and captured Prince Doria, at Avigliana, and
                    took Saluces. In the same year he was created marshal. In 1632 he joined the
                    party of Gaston, duke of Orleans, and placed himself at the head of the rebel
                    army, which was defeated by Marshal Schomberg at Castelnaudary (1st September
                    1632); severely wounded, he fell into the enemy’s hands, and, abandoned by
                    Gaston, was executed as a traitor at Toulouse on 30th October. The title passed
                    to his sister <hi rend="smallcaps">Charlotte-Marguerite,</hi> princess of
                    Condé.</p>
