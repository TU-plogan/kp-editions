                <p><label type="entry">MIAUTSE</label>. The Miautse or Meaou-tsze of southern China
                    are one of the aboriginal tribes of the country. At one time they occupied a
                    considerable portion of the rich and fertile lands which now form the central
                    province of the empire, but as the Chinese advanced southwards they were driven,
                    like the Ainos in Japan and the Welsh in Britain, into the more inaccessible
                    districts until they were compelled to seek refuge from the invaders in the
                    mountain ranges, in the provinces of Yunnan, Kwei-chow, Kwang-se, and
                    Kwang-tung, where they are found at the present day. This line of mountains
                    extends for about 400 miles, and, being in many parts high, steep, and rugged,
                    it forms a convenient shelter for them. As early as the reign of king Seuen
                    (about 800 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> we read of an expedition having been
                    sent to drive them out of Hoo-nan, and since that time they have been
                    periodically attacked either to punish them for misdeeds or to make them yield
                    up vineyards coveted by Chinese Ahabs. The last important campaign against them
                    was undertaken by the emperor K’een-lung, who, having completely subjugated the
                    Eleuths, was desirous of bringing under his yoke these mountain tribesmen. But
                    the same success which had attended his arms in the north did not follow them to
                    the south. The first expedition was utterly defeated, and the general in command
                    paid the penalty of discomfiture with his head. The leader of a second
                    expedition, having learned wisdom by the fate of his predecessor, purchased the
                    submission of the Miautse by a large bribe. As soon as the unsuspecting savages
                    had been thus lulled into security a third army was set in motion against them.
                    This time, being unprepared, they suffered a crushing defeat, and were compelled
                    to purchase peace by swearing allegiance to their conquerors. But, though the
                    Chinese thus gained sovereignty over them, they have since deemed it wise to
                    content themselves with but the shadow of authority. No real jurisdiction is
                    ever exercised over these hardy mountaineers. They are allowed to govern
                    themselves on their own patriarchal system. The old men of each tribe manage the
                    affairs of their juniors, and command an obedience which would be utterly
                    refused to the mandate of any mandarin. In figure the Miautse, <pb break="no"

                    complexioned than the Chinese, their faces also are rounder and their features
                    sharper. In disposition, too, they are very unlike their civilized neighbours.
                    They are brave, passionate, suspicious, revengeful, and indifferent to cold and
                    hunger; they are free and easy in their manners, and are as noisily joyous as
                    the Chinese are grave and sedate.</p>
                <p>They are divided into between forty and fifty clans, each of which is
                    distinguished by a name which is generally derived either from some physical
                    characteristic, or from some custom, or from the habitat of the clan, as, for
                    example, “The Black Miau,” “the narrow-headed Miau,” so named from their manner
                    of dressing their hair, “the six-valley Miau,” &amp;c. Among these clans there
                    exist wide differences of culture, some being in no way removed from savages,
                    while others who have been brought under the influence of Chinese civilization
                    show themselves apt and ready learners. Very few of them, so far as is known,
                    possess any written records. The Yaou-jin, or Goblin clan, are said to have
                    books, which, though they are now unable to read, they still regard with
                    reverent awe. “The barbarous characters” used in these books are, according to a
                    Chinese writer, “like knotted worms, and are utterly unintelligible.” The Ko-los
                    also are said to be a lettered clan, but for the most part the Miautse content
                    themselves with conveying information and preserving records by means of notched
                    sticks. Their language as well as their ethnic characteristics prove them to be
                    closely related to the Siamese, Anamese, Cambodians, and the inhabitants of
                    Hainan; in fact they form part of the race which is spread over the whole of
                    south-eastern Indo-China. Their social customs are as widely different as their
                    appearance is from those of the Chinese. The widest latitude is given to the
                    youth of both sexes in the choice of their husbands and wives. As among the hill
                    tribes of Chittagong, the selection is commonly made on the mountainside, where
                    on moonlight nights in the “leaping month” the young men and maidens meet to
                    sing or to play at ball, or to dance round the “devil’s staff” <hi rend="italic"
                        >(</hi><hi rend="italic">Anglice,</hi> Maypole), and to choose their
                    partners for life. Amongsome clans the “couvade” is an established custom. Their
                    funeral rites vary according to the districts, those living within reach of the
                    influence of the Chinese having adopted their customs, while those more remote
                    still hang their dead in baskets from trees, or lay them in the ground and
                    disinter them yearly to wash their bones. In dress they are fond of bright
                    colours, and commonly wear loose but short jackets, sometimes with and sometimes
                    without trousers. The men wear turbans wound round their hair, which is raised
                    above the head in the shape of a spiral shell, and the women either don a kind
                    of cap, or dress their hair in the shape of a ram’s horn. For many years the
                    relations of the Miautse with the Chinese Government have been generally of a
                    peaceable nature, and in the <hi rend="italic">Peking Gazette</hi> of April 1881
                    there was published a new system of government by which it is hoped that the
                    incorporation of the mountaineers into the empire may become more real and
                    complete.</p>
