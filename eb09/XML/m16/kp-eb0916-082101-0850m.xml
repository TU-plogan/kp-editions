                    (1727-1819), economist and miscellaneous writer, was born at Lyons on the 7th of
                    March 1727. He was long regarded as almost the last survivor of the Philosophe
                    school; and in this character he figures in many memoirs,—for instance in Madame
                    de Remusat’s. He was educated by the Jesuits in his native town, then at a
                    seminary in Paris, and finally at the Sorbonne; and he took holy orders, but his
                    designation of abbé was the chief thing clerical about him. He early joined the
                    Philosophe party, and was a frequenter of most of their <hi rend="italic"

                    in political economy, Galiani), but having the credit of a ready and biting pen.
                    Voltaire called him “I.’Abbé Mord-les.” His work was chiefly occasional, and the
                    most notable parts of it were a smart pamphlet in answer to Palissot’s
                    scurrilous play <hi rend="italic">Les Philosophes</hi> (which procured him a
                    short sojourn in the Bastille for an alleged libel on Palissot’s patroness, the
                    princesse de Robeck), and a reply to Galiani’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commerce</hi><hi rend="italic">des Blés</hi> (1770). Later, he made himself
                    useful in quasi-diplomatic communications with English statesmen, and was
                    pensioned, being, moreover, elected a member of the Academy in 1785. The
                    outbreak of the Revolution (soon after which he was engaged in a controversy
                    with Chamfort on the question of the advantages and deserts of the Academy) did
                    not, as it did with many of his friends, drive him from the country or put his
                    life in danger, but it put him in considerable straits of fortune. He maintained
                    a kind of moderate liberal tone, and the return of something like order under
                    the Consulate and the Empire restored him to prosperity and pensions. A year
                    before his death, at the great age of ninety-two, on the 12th of January 1819 at
                    Paris, he brought out a series of <hi rend="italic">Melanges,</hi> composed
                    chiefly of selections from his former publications; and after his death appeared
                    his memoirs, which are of value for the Philosophe period. Morellet, though not
                    a man of extraordinary ability or of specially amiable or estimable character,
                    was in both respects a fair specimen of the man of letters of all work of the
                    time. He was, in fact, a journalist with a special turn for economical
                    subjects.</p>
