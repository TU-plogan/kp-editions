                    position of the forelimbs, the head appears to rest between the shoulders; the
                    muzzle is long and obtusely pointed, terminated by the nostrils, which are close
                    together in front; the minute eye is almost hidden by the fur; the ear is
                    without a conch, opening on a level with the surrounding integument; the
                    forelimbs are rather short and very muscular, terminating in broad, naked,
                    shovel-shaped feet, the palms normally directed outwards, each with five
                    subequal digits armed with strong flattened claws; the hind-feet, on the
                    contrary, are long and narrow, and the toes are provided with slender claws. The
                    body is densely covered with soft, erect, velvety fur,—the hairs uniform in
                    length and thickness, except on the muzzle and short tail, the former having
                    some straight vibrissae on its sides, whilst the latter is clothed with longer
                    and coarser hairs. The fur is generally black, with a more or less greyish
                    tinge, or brownish-black, but various paler shades up to pure white have been
                    observed.</p>
                <p>The food of the mole consists chiefly of the common earth-worm, in pursuit of
                    which it forms its well-known underground excavations. Its habits, so difficult
                    to observe, were many years ago most patiently studied and described by Μ. Henri
                    le Court. Like many other mammals the mole has a lair or fortress to which it
                    may retire for security. This is constructed with much ingenuity. It consists of
                    a central nest formed under a hillock which is placed in some protected
                    situation, as under a bank, or between the roots of trees. The nest, which is
                    lined with dried grass or leaves, communicates with the main-run by four
                    passages, one of which only joins it directly, leading downwards for a short
                    distance and then ascending again; the other three are directed upwards and
                    communicate at regular intervals with a circular gallery constructed in the
                    upper part of the hillock, which in turn communicates by five passages leading
                    downwards and outwards with another much larger gallery placed lower down on a
                    level with the central nest, from which passages proceed outwards in different
                    directions, one only communicating directly with the main-run, while the others,
                    curving round, soon join, or end in culs-de-sac. The main-run is somewhat wider
                    than the animal’s body, its walls are smooth, and formed of closely compressed
                    earth, its depth varying according to the nature of the soil, but ordinarily
                    from four to six inches. Along this tunnel the animal passes backwards and
                    forwards several times daily, and here traps are laid by mole-catchers for its
                    capture. From the main-run numerous passages are formed on each side, along
                    which the animal hunts its prey, throwing out the soil in the form of molehills.
                    The mole is the most voracious of mammals, and, if deprived of food, is said to
                    succumb in from ten to twelve hours. Almost any kind of flesh is eagerly
                    devoured by captive moles, which have been seen by various observers, as if
                    maddened by hunger, to attack animals nearly as large as themselves, such as
                    birds, lizards, frogs, and even snakes; toads, however, they will not touch, and
                    no form of vegetable food attracts their notice. If two moles be confined
                    together without food, the weaker is invariably devoured by the stronger. They
                    take readily to the water— in this respect, as well as in external form,
                    resembling their representatives on the North American continent. Bruce, writing
                    in 1793, remarks that he saw a mole paddling towards a small island in the Loch
                    of Clunie, 180 yards from land, on which he noticed molehills.</p>
                <p>The sexes come together about the second week in March, and the young—generally
                    from four to six in number—which are brought forth in about six weeks, quickly
                    attain their full size.</p>
                <p>The mole exhibits in its whole organization the most perfect adaptation to its
                    peculiar mode of life. In the structure of the skeleton very striking departures
                    from the typical mammalian forms are noticeable.</p>
                <p>The first sternal bone is so much produced anteriorly as to extend forward as far
                    as a vertical line let down from the second cervical vertebra, carrying with it
                    the very short almost quadrate clavicles, which are articulated with its
                    anterior extremity and distally with the humeri, being also connected
                    ligamentously with the scapulae. The forelimbs are thus brought opposite the
                    sides of the neck, and from this position a threefold advantage is derived:—in
                    the first place, as this is the narrowest part of the body, they add but little
                    to the general width, which, if increased, would lessen the power of movement in
                    a confined space; secondly, this Îiosition allows of a onger forelimb than would
                    otherwise be possible, and so increases its lever power; and, thirdly, although
                    the entire limb is relatively very short, its anterior position enables the
                    animal, when burrowing, to thrust the claws so far forward as to be in a line
                    with the end of the muzzle, the importance of which is evident.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It is most interesting to
                    observe now, in tne goιαen moιes <hi rend="italic">(Chrysochloridae)</hi> of
                    South Africa, the necessary modifications of the corresponding parts of the body
                    and limbs fitting them for fossorial action and underground progression have
                    been brought about in a totally different manner. In them the manubrium sterni
                    is not anteriorly elongated, neither are the clavicles shortened; but this is
                    made up for by a deep hollowing out of the antero-lateral walls of the thorax,
                    the ribs in these parts and the sternum being convex inwards, the long clavicles
                    have their distal extremities pushed forward, and the concavities on the sides
                    and inferior surface of the thorax lodge the thick muscular arms.</p></note>
                    Posteriorly, we find the hind limbs similarly removed out of the way by
                    approximation of the hip-joints to the centre line of the body. This is effected
                    by inward curvature of the innominate bones at the acetabula to such an extent
                    that they almost meet in the centre, while the pubic bones are widely separated
                    behind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Jacobs’s <hi

                    mistake lie has been followed by most comparative anatomists; and hence the mole
                    is generally believed to present the unique peculiarity that the outlets of the
                    urinary, generative, and digestive organs do not pass through the arch of the
                    pelvis.</p></note> The shortness of the <pb corresp="pbn9610"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0637-0610"/> forelimb is due to the humerus, which, like the
                    clavicle, is so much reduced in length as to present the appearance of a
                    flattened X-shaped bone, with prominent ridges and deep depressions for the
                    attachments and origins of the powerful muscles connected with it. Its proximal
                    extremity presents two rounded prominences: the smaller, the true head of the
                    bone, articulates as usual with the scapulae; the larger, which is really the
                    external tuberosity rounded off, forms a separate synovial joint with the end of
                    the clavicle. This double articulation gives to a naturally loose joint the
                    rigidity necessary to support the great lateral pressure sustained by the
                    forelimb in excavating. The forearm bones are normal, but those of the forefeet
                    are much flattened and laterally expanded. The great width of the forefoot is
                    also partly due to the presence of a peculiar falciform bone, lying on the inner
                    side of the palm and articulating by its proximal extremity with the wrist. Into
                    the radial side and under surface of this bone is inserted a tendon derived from
                    that of the palmaris longus muscle, which, acting upon it as an abductor,
                    separates it from the side of the palm, and so increases the width of the
                    latter, at the same time rendering the palmar integument tense.</p>
                <p>The muscles acting on these remarkably modified limbs are all homologous with
                    those of the cursorial insectivora, differing only in their relative
                    development. The tendon of the biceps traverses a long osseous tunnel, formed by
                    the great expansion of the margin of the bicipital groove for the insertion of
                    the large pectoralis major muscle; the anterior division of the latter muscle is
                    unconnected with the sternum, extending across as a muscular band between the
                    humeri, and co-ordinating the motions of the forelimbs. The teres major and
                    latissimus dprsi muscles are of immense size, probably relatively larger than in
                    any other mammal, and are inserted together into the prominent ridge below the
                    pectoral attachment; they are the principal agents in the excavating action of
                    the limb. The cervical muscles connecting the slender scapulae, and through them
                    the forelimbs, with the centre line of the neck and with the occiput are large,
                    and the ligamentum nuchae between them is ossified (as in all true moles); the
                    latter condition appears to be due to the prolongation forwards of the sternum
                    (described above), preventing all flexion of the head downwards; and,
                    accordingly, the normal office of the ligament being lost, it ossifies, and so
                    affords a more fixed point for the origins of the superficial cervical
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>The skull is long, with slender zygomatic arches; the nasal bones are strong and
                    early become united, and in front of them the nostrils are continued forwards in
                    tubes formed of thick cartilage, the septum between which becomes partially or
                    wholly ossified beneath. There are 7 cervical, 13 dorsal, 6 lumbar, 6 sacral,
                    and 10-12 caudal vertebrae; of the dorsal and lumbar there may be one vertebra
                    more or less. The sacral vertebrae are united by their greatly expanded and
                    laterally compressed spinous processes, and all the others, with the exception
                    of the cervical, are very closely and solidly articulated together, so as to
                    support the powerful propulsive and fossorial actions of the Jimbs. Dentition:
                    i. ∣, c. ⅛, prm. ∣, m. f, × 2 — 44 teeth. The upper incisors are simple
                    chisel-edged teeth; the canine is long and two-rooted; then follow three
                    subequal conical premolars, and a fourth, much larger, and like a canine; these
                    are succeeded by three molars with ΛV-shaped cusps. In the lower jaw the three
                    incisors on each side are slightly smaller, and slant more forwards; close
                    behind them is a tooth which, though quite like them, must, from its position in
                    fi ont of the upper canines when the jaws are closed, be considered as the
                    canine; behind it, but separated by an interval, is a large double-rooted
                    conical tooth, the first premolar; the three following premolars are like the
                    corresponding teeth above, but smaller, and are succeeded, as above, by three
                    molars.</p>
                <p>The geographical distribution of the common mole may be said to exceed that of
                    all the other known species of the genus to which it belongs taken together. It
                    extends from England to Japan, and from the Dovre-Fjeld Mountains in Scandinavia
                    and the Middle Dwina region in Russia to southern Europe and the southern slopes
                    of the Himalayas, where it occurs at an elevation of 10,000 feet. In Great
                    Britain it is found as far north as Caithness, but in Ireland and in the Western
                    Isles of Scotland (except Mull) it is altogether unknown. (G. E. D.)</p>
