                    monarchy it owed its existence to the necessity of maintaining during the 15th,
                    16th, and 17th centuries a strong line of defence against the invasions of the
                    Turks, and may be said to have had its origin with the establishment of the
                    captaincy of Zengg by Matthias Corvinus and the introduction of Uskoks
                    (fugitives from Turkey) into the Warasdin district by the emperor Ferdinand I.
                    By the' close of the 17th century there were three frontier “generalates
                    ”—Carlstadt, Warasdin, and Petrinia (the last also called the Banal). After the
                    defeat of the Turkish power by Prince Eugene it was proposed to abolish the
                    military constitution of the frontier, but the change was successfully resisted
                    by the inhabitants of the district; on the other hand, a new Slavonian frontier
                    district was established in 1702, and Maria Theresa extended the organization to
                    the march-lands of Transylvania (the Szekler frontier in 1764, the Wallachian in
                    1766).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>By 1848 the

                    No. 16 (Orlath), the Wallachian No. 17 (Naszod). Twelve towns, known as
                    “military communities,” had communal constitutions not unlike those of the free
                    towns of Hungary—Carlopago, Zengg, Petrinia, Kos-tainicza, Belovar, Ivani2,
                    Brood, Peterwardein, Carlowitz, Semlin, Pancsova, and
                    Weisskirchen.</p></note></p>
                <p>As a reward for the service it rendered the Government in the suppression of the
                    Hungarian insurrection in 1848, the Military Frontier was erected in 1849 into a
                    crown-land, with a total area of 15,182 square miles, and a population of
                    1,220,503. In 1851 the Transylvanian portion (1177 square miles) was
                    incorporated with the rest of Transylvania; and in 1871 effect was given to the
                    imperial decree of 1869 by which the districts of the Warasdin regiments (St
                    George and the Cross) and the towns of Zengg, Belovar, Ivaniδ, &amp;c., were
                    “provincialized” or incorporated with the Croatian-Slavonian crown-land. In 1872
                    the Banat regiments followed suit; and in 1873 the old military organization was
                    abolished in all the rest of the frontier. Not till 1881, however, were the
                    Croatian-Slavonian march-lands completely merged in the kingdoms to which they
                    naturally belonged.</p>
                <p>The social aspect of the military frontier regime is interesting. A communal
                    system of land tenure natural to the old Slavonians was artificially kept in
                    existence. The mark or plot of ground assigned to the original family of
                    settlers remained the property of the family as such, and could not be portioned
                    out among the several members. In this way the house-community, all under the
                    rule of the same house-father and house-mother (who were not necessarily man and
                    wife, nor the oldest members of the community), and all living within the same
                    palisade, sometimes came to number two or three hundred persons. The “family”
                    dined in a common hall, and after dinner discussed and settled matters affecting
                    the common weal. Every man possessing real property in the country, and capable
                    of bearing arms, was liable to military service from his twentieth year. The
                    house-communities are now beginning to avail themselves of the permissive
                    partition laws, and strangers are free to come and acquire property in land.
                    Watchtowers with wooden clappers and the beacons which flashed the alarm along
                    the whole frontier in a few hours are still features in the landscape.</p>
