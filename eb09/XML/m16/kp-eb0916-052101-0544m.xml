                <p><label type="entry">MISSISSIPPI</label>, one of the Southern States of the
                    American Union, derives its name from the river which for more than 500 miles
                    forms its western boundary between the 35th and 31st parallels of north
                    latitude, separating it from Arkansas and Louisiana. The boundary with the
                    latter State is continued along the 31st parallel, for 110 miles, to the Pearl
                    river, and then down the Pearl to its mouth. The Gulf of Mexico, eastward from
                    the mouth of Pearl river, completes the southern boundary. On the north the 35th
                    parallel, from the Mississippi river to the Tennessee, separates the State from
                    Tennessee, and the boundary then follows the latter river to the mouth of Bear
                    Creek, in 34° 53' N. lat. and 88° 15' W. long. The eastern boundary of the
                    State, separating it from Alabama, follows a line drawn from the mouth of Bear
                    Creek about seven degrees west of south to what was “the north-western corner of
                    Washington county on the Tombigbee,” and thence due south to the Gulf of Mexico.
                    Ship, Horn, Cat, and Petit Bois Islands, and those nearer the shore, form a part
                    of Mississippi. The extreme length of the State, north and south, is 330 miles,
                    and its maximum breadth is 188 miles. Under the United States surveys, begun in
                    1803, the State has been divided into townships and sections, except such parts
                    as were at the first owned by individuals. The area of the State is given in the
                    census reports for 1880 as 46,340 square miles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Topography.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> There are no mountains
                    in Mississippi, but a considerable difference of level exists between the
                    continuously low, flat, alluvial region lying along and between the Mississippi
                    and Yazoo rivers, called “the Bottom,” and nearly all the remainder of the
                    State, which is classed as upland. The latter part, comprising five-sixths of
                    the whole, is an undulating plateau whose general elevation above the water of
                    the Gulf of Mexico increases to 150 feet within a few miles of the coast, and
                    varies elsewhere from 150 to 500 or 600 feet. Some exceptional ridges are
                    probably 800 feet high. The streams of this region flow in valleys varying in
                    width from a few hundred yards to several miles. The fall of each river is not
                    great, and is quite uniform. Usually a considerable part of the valley of each
                    larger stream is several feet above its present high water mark, and forms the
                    “hommock,” or “second bottom” lands. On some of the rivers the lowest part of
                    the valley, subject to overflow, is several miles in width, and bears a
                    resemblance to the Mississippi Bottom.</p>
                <p>Ridges or plateaus everywhere in the upland region divide the contiguous basins
                    of creeks and rivers, descending more or less abruptly to their valleys. In the
                    north-eastern part of the State, almost level prairies cover large areas
                    overlying a Cretaceous formation called Rotten Limestone.</p>
                <p>A line of abrupt bluffs, extending southward from the north-west corner of the
                    State, divides the upland region from the Bottom, where the general surface lies
                    below the high-water level of the Mississippi river. A few low ridges, running
                    north and south, and embracing about 200,000 acres, are barely above high water.
                    The cultivated lands in the Bottom lie on these, and on the borders of the
                    rivers and the numerous lakes and bayous, where the surface is slightly
                    elevated. Low swamps or marshes, in which flourish large cypress trees (<hi
                    rend="italic">Taxodium,</hi><hi rend="italic">distichum),</hi> lie between the
                    streams, and frequently receive the surface drainage from their banks. Large
                    forest trees and dense cane-brakes <hi rend="italic">(A rundinaria
                    gigantea)</hi> occupy the drier ground. The Mississippi river is prevented from
                    flooding the Bottom during high water by a system of levees or embankments built
                    by a fund derived partly from taxation on the land and partly from the proceeds
                    of the sale of public lands in the State classed as “swamp lands,” which were
                    given over for this purpose by Congress. The only compensation for the injury
                    done when breaks in the levees (“crevasses”) occur is the deposit of alluvial
                    matter left by the overflow, which adds to the productiveness of the already
                    wonderfully fertile soil. The present levee system usually protects about
                    one-fourth of the 4,000,000 acres in the Bottom. Many crescent-shaped lakes
                    (“cut-offs ”) occur in the Bottom. Similar phenomena present themselves in the
                    channels of the other rivers having wide bottoms.</p>
                <p>The volume of water in the streams varies greatly during the year, and is usually
                    largest between the months of January and April. During high water all the
                    larger streams are navigable by steamboats. These ply upon the Mississippi,
                    Tennessee, and Yazoo rivers throughout the whole year. The rivers flowing into
                    the Gulf are much obstructed by sand-bars, and are chiefly used for floating
                    logs to the saw-mills on the coast.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n545/mode/1up"

                <p>The best and only deep harbour on the coast is the well-protected roadstead
                    inside of Ship Island. It has a depth of 27 feet, a firm clay bottom, and is
                    readily accessible to lighters from the shallower harbours along the coast.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate.—</hi> Near the waters of the Gulf of Mexico the
                    climate is much milder than in the northern parts of the State. On the southern
                    borders the temperature rarely falls to 32° Fahr., or exceeds 95°, the annual
                    mean being about 68°. The orange, lemon, almond, banana, and olive can be grown
                    without protection. In the latitude of Vicksburg the temperature ranges from 98°
                    to 20°, very rarely lower; the annual mean is 65°. The range in the northern
                    part of the State is from 98° to 15°, or rarely 10°, and the annual mean is 61°.
                    The first and last hoar-frosts occur, in the central parts of the State, usually
                    in the latter parts of October and March. The ground is seldom frozen to the
                    depth of 3 inches, and only for a few days at a time. The rainfall on the coast
                    is 60 to 65 inches per annum, and at the northern boundary 50 inches. While
                    about two-thirds of this precipitation occurs in winter and spring, a month
                    seldom passes without several inches,of rainfall.</p>
                <p>Land and sea breezes in the south, and variable winds elsewhere, make the heat of
                    summer tolerable. In healthfulness Mississippi compares favourably with other
                    States. The average death-rate of thirteen States, variously situated, as given
                    in the census of 1880, is 1 ’ 38 per cent.; that of Mississippi is 1Ί9 per cent.
                    Where the surface is flat and poorly drained malarial fevers are prevalent
                    during the warm season. Yellow fever has become epidemic after importation, but
                    strict quarantine has been successful in preventing it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> In accordance with an Act of the legislature
                    passed in 1850, an agricultural and geological survey of the State was begun,
                    which continued, with interruptions, until 1871. Two reports have been
                    published, one in 1854 and another in 1860.</p>
                <p>The geological structure of the State is comparatively simple, and closely
                    related to that of the adjacent States. The older formations are nearly all
                    overlaid by deposits of the Quaternary period, which will be described last. In
                    the extreme northeastern portion are found the oldest rocks in the State,—an
                    extension of the Subcarboniferous formation which underlies the Warrior
                    coal-fields of Alabama. The strata here show some traces of the upheaval which
                    formed the Appalachian mountain chain, whose south-west termination is found in
                    Alabama. When this chain formed the Atlantic mountain-border of the continent,
                    excepting this north-east comer, Mississippi had not emerged from the waters of
                    the ancient Gulf of Mexico. As the shore-line of the Gulf slowly receded
                    southward and westward, the sediment at its bottom gradually came to the
                    surface, and constituted the Cretaceous and Tertiary formations of this and
                    adjacent States. Wherever stratification is observed in these formations in
                    Mississippi, it shows a dip west and south of 20 or 30 feet to the mile. The
                    Cretaceous region includes, with the exception of the Subcarboniferous, all that
                    part of the State eastward of a line cutting the Tennessee boundary in 89° 3' W.
                    long., and drawn southward and eastward through the towns of Ripley, Pontotoc,
                    and Starkville, crossing into Alabama in latitude 32° 45'. Four groups of
                    Cretaceous strata have been determined in Mississippi, defined by lines having
                    the same general direction as the one just described. The oldest, bordering the
                    Subcarboniferous, is the Eutaw or Coffee group, characterized by bluish-black or
                    reddish laminated clays, and yellow or grey sands, containing lignite and fossil
                    resin. Westward and southward to the city of Columbus is the Tombigbee sand
                    group, consisting chiefly of fine-grained micaceous sands of a greenish tint,
                    with many marine fossils. Next in order, westward and southward, is the Rotten
                    Limestone group, made up of a material of great uniformity,—a soft chalky rock,
                    white or pale blue, composed chiefly of tenacious clay, and white carbonate of
                    lime in minute crystals. Borings show the total thickness of this group to be
                    about 1000 feet. Fossils are abundant, but species are few. The latest
                    Cretaceous is the Ripley group, lying west of the northern part of the
                    last-named group, and characterized by hard crystalline white limestones, and
                    darkcoloured, micaceous, glauconitic marls, whose marine fossils are admirably
                    preserved. One hundred and eighty species have been described. The total
                    thickness of the Cretaceous is about 2000 feet. Deposits of the Tertiary period
                    form the basis of more than half the State, extending from the border of the
                    Cretaceous westward nearly or quite to the Yazoo and Mississippi Bottom, and
                    southward to within a few miles of the Gulf coast. Seven groups of the Tertiary
                    strata have been distinguished. Beginning nearest the Cretaceous, the Flatwoods
                    group is characterized by grey or white clays, and a soil which responds poorly
                    to tillage. The Lagrange group, lying to the west of the last, is marked by grey
                    clays and sands, fossil plants, and beds of lignite or brown coal, sometimes 8
                    feet in thickness. The Buhrstone group, lying southwestward from the last, is
                    characterized by beds of white siliceous clays, and of silicified shells, and
                    sandy strata containing glauconite in valuable quantities. The Claiborne group
                    lies south of the last, and is slightly developed in Mississippi, but
                    well-marked in</p>
                <p>Alabama. The Jackson group, south-west of the last two, is made up chiefly of
                    soft yellowish limestones or marls, containing much clay, and sandy strata with
                    glauconite. Zeuglodon bones and other marine fossils are abundant. The Vicksburg
                    group lies next in order south-westward, and is characterized by crystalline
                    limestones and blue and white marls. Marine fossils are very abundant. More than
                    one hundred and thirty species have been determined. The Grand Gulf group,
                    showing a few fossil plants and no marine fossils, extends southward from the
                    last to within a few miles of the coast.</p>
                <p>The oldest formation of the Quaternary period is the “orange sand” or “stratified
                    drift,” which immediately overlies all the Cretaceous groups except the prairies
                    of the Rotten Limestone, and all the Tertiary except the Flatwoods and Vicksburg
                    groups and parts of the Jackson. Its depth varies from a few feet to over 200
                    feet, and it forms the body of most of the hills in the State. Its materials are
                    pebbles, clays, and sands of various colours from white to deep red, tinged with
                    peroxide of iron, which sometimes cements the pebbles and sands into compact
                    rocks. The shapes of these ferruginous sandstones are very fantastic,—tubes,
                    hollow spheres, plates, &amp;c., being common. The name stratified drift is used
                    by the geologist of Alabama to indicate its connexion with the northern drift.
                    The fossils are few, and in some cases probably derived from the underlying
                    formations. Well-worn pebbles of amorphous quartz, agate, chalcedony, jasper,
                    &amp;c., are found in the stratified drift along the western side of the
                    Tertiary region of the State, and from Columbus northward. “While this formation
                    is not well understood, it seems tolerably well established that the melting of
                    the great glaciers of the north furnished the water which brought with it
                    fragments of the rocks over which it passed, and flowed into the Gulf with a
                    current which was most rapid where the pebbles were dropped, but overspread the
                    remainder of the State with a gentler flow, leaving sands and clays” (E. A.
                    Smith). The second Quaternary formation is the Port Hudson, occurring within 20
                    miles of the Gulf coast, and probably outcropping occasionally in the
                    Mississippi Bottom. Clays, gravel, and sands, containing cypress stumps,
                    drift-wood, and mastodon bones, are characteristic. The loess or bluff formation
                    lies along the bluffs bordering the Bottom, nearly continuously through the
                    State. Its fine-grained, unstratified silt contains the remains of many
                    terrestrial animals, including fifteen mammals.</p>

                <p>The surface and subsoil of nearly all the upland region of Mississippi, the
                    southern part being the exception, is composed of yellow loam or brick-clay
                    containing no fossils, and showing no stratification. The soil of the Rotten
                    Limestone region is similar in its general make up, but is black, and contains
                    more lime and clay. Both are regarded as an independent aqueous deposit,
                    posterior to the stratified drift and bluff formations, and anterior to the
                    alluvium of the present epoch. The “second bottoms,” probably, are later than
                    the yellow loam, and belong to the “terrace epoch.” The latest formation,
                    alluvium, is strongly marked, and covers a large area in the Yazoo and
                    Mississippi Bottom, and along other streams.</p>

                    feet, and is common in the southern river bottoms. The rattlesnake, moccasin,
                    and copperhead, venomous serpents, are occasionally found. About half of the
                    sixty-three species of fish abounding in the fresh and salt waters of the State
                    are valuable for food. The edible oysters and crustaceans of the coast are
                    remarkably fine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Flora.—</hi> Originally nearly the entire State was covered
                    with a growth of forest trees of large size, mostly deciduous. The undergrowth
                    was kept down by annual burnings by the natives, and the ground became carpeted
                    with grasses and herbs. Over 120 species of forest trees are found; many
                    valuable ones are abundant, and their timber constitutes a large item in the
                    resources of the State. Of the 15 species of oak the most valuable are the
                    live-oak <hi rend="italic">(Q.</hi><hi rend="italic">virens),</hi> found near
                    the coast, and the white-oak <hi rend="italic">(Q. alba),</hi> widely

                    <hi rend="italic">(P. australis)</hi> forms the principal forest growth south of
                    lat. 32° 15'. It attains a diameter of 2 or 3 feet, has a tall and shapely
                    trunk, and its timber is unsurpassed in the variety of its uses. The census
                    reports estimate the merchantable timber of this species now standing in the
                    State at 18,200,000,000 feet, board measure. The amount cut in 1880 was
                    108,000,000 feet. The short-leaved pine <hi rend="italic">(P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mitis),</hi> almost as valuable, is found in various parts, the
                    quantity now standing being estimated at 6,775,000,000 feet. The total value of
                    the pine timber of the State is about $250,000,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi> is the leading industry in Mississippi. Over
                    300,000 of the population are directly engaged in the cultivation of 4,895,000
                    acres of land. The character of the soil is varied, and all is productive,
                    except that in the Flatwoods region and in the district covered with long-leaved
                    pine, where only the valleys are fertile. At least half the State is
                    exceptionally fertile. Not more than one-fourth of the arable land has been
                    brought into cultivation, and two millions of acres of the best lands in the
                    State, lying in the Bottom, might be made arable by proper drainage.</p>
                <p>Cotton is the chief agricultural product; in 1880 Mississippi ranked first among
                    the States in the amount raised. The crop of 1879-80 amounted to 955,808 bales,
                    worth $43,000,000. There were produced also of cotton seed 28,000,000 bushels,
                    worth $3,000,000; of Indian corn, 21,340,800 bushels; of oats, 1,959,620
                    bushels; of wheat, 218,890 bushels; of rice, 1,718,950 lb. Small quantities of
                    rye, barley, molasses, and tobacco, and abundant crops of potatoes, yams, pease,
                    and all garden vegetables, are annually produced.</p>
                <p>Fruits of various kinds flourish in many parts of the State, and, with early
                    vegetables, are largely shipped to the northern markets in spring and early
                    summer. The value of the cotton crop is about three times as great as that of
                    all the other products of the soil, which are sometimes insufficient for home
                    consumption. Economically this specialization of agriculture is to be regretted;
                    but successful efforts are being made to diversify it by growing other crops to
                    which the soil and climate are equally well suited.</p>

                    nearly all the farms and other real property. The total property valuation in
                    the State decreased from $607,324,911 in 1860 to $209,197,345 in 1870, on
                    account of the losses in war and the liberation of the slaves. There has been,
                    however, a rapid increase in the last decade. The towns in the State have small

                    meets biennially, is composed of forty senators, serving four years, and one
                    hundred and twenty representatives, serving two years. These are apportioned to
                    the seventy-four counties according to population, and elected by the people.
                    The judiciary officers, consisting of three justices of the supreme court,
                    twelve circuit judges, and twelve chancellors, are appointed by the governor

                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Mississippi was first visited by Europeans in
                    1540, when the adventurous expedition of De Soto reached its northern parts.
                    After the disastrous termination of this expedition no other Europeans visited
                    this region until 1673, when Joliet and Père Marquette descended the Mississippi
                    to lat. 33°. In 1682 La Salle and Tonty descended to the mouth of the river, and
                    claimed the whole region drained by it for the king of France, giving it the
                    name Louisiana. In 1699 the first colonists reached the coast of Mississippi,
                    sent from France under Iberville. Settlements were made on Ship Island and Cat
                    Island, and upon the mainland on the eastern side of Biloxi Bay, at Bay St
                    Louis, and at Mobile. The colony did not prosper, and in 1712 Anthony Crozat
                    obtained by charter from the king all the commercial privileges of the lower
                    Mississippi valley. Under his management the colony languished, andin 1717 the
                    king accepted the surrender of his charter, and granted another with more
                    extended privileges to the “Western Company,” or “Mississippi Scheme,” with John
                    Law as director-general, and Bienville as governor of the colony. Under this
                    management the rich alluvial lands on the Mississippi river began to be
                    occupied; tobacco, rice, and indigo were cultivated, and African slaves were
                    introduced. Settlements were made near the present city of Natchez in 1720. Two
                    years later, Law’s company becoming bankrupt, much embarrassment in the colony
                    followed, and troubles also began with the natives. On November 28, 1729, the
                    Natchez Indians surprised and murdered about 200 of the white male residents,
                    and made captives of about 500 women and children and negroes. A war followed,
                    resulting in the destruction of the Natchez tribe. The representatives of the
                    “Western Company” returned their franchises to the king in 1732, the number of
                    colonists and slaves being then about 7000. After two unsuccessful campaigns
                    against the Chickasaw Indians in the northern part of what is now Mississippi,
                    Bienville was superseded by the Marquis de Vaudreuil in 1740.</p>
                <p>By the treaty of Paris, in 1763, France ceded all her possessions east of the
                    Mississippi river to England, excepting the island of New Orleans, ceded to
                    Spain. The British province of West <pb break="no"

                    Mississippi river along the Gulf coasts, with its northern limitat the 31st
                    parallel of north latitude. Soon afterwards the northern boundary was fixed at a
                    line drawn eastward from the point where the Yazoo river unites with the
                    Mississippi.</p>
                <p>Under British rule the Natchez country, which had been deserted since the
                    massacre of 1729, and the southern part of the present State of Mississippi,
                    rapidly filled with settlers, many of them emigrants from the Atlantic colonies.
                    Cotton, indigo, and sugar were cultivated, and negro slaves continued to be
                    freely introduced. During the revolutionary war of the Atlantic colonies, West
                    Florida, being far removed, remained undisturbed until 1779. Spain and England
                    being then at war, Galvez, the governor of New Orleans, aided by sympathizers
                    with the revolutionary colonists, took possession of the whole of West Florida
                    for the king of Spain. At the peace of 1783 England acknowledged the 31st
                    parallel as the southern boundary of the United States, and ceded West Florida
                    to Spain. The district between the 31st parallel and the parallel through the
                    mouth of the Yazoo was therefore claimed by the United States and by Spain, the
                    latter being in possession. After tedious negotiations the latter power
                    relinquished the district in March 1798, and Congress at once formed it into
                    “the Mississippi Territory,” which extended from the Mississippi river eastward
                    between the two above-mentioned parallels of latitude to the Chattahoochee
                    river.</p>
                <p>The State of Georgia claimed as a part of its domain all of the district east of
                    the Mississippi river, and between the 31st and 35th parallels. In 1802 it
                    ceded, its claims to the Federal Government for certain considerations, and in
                    1804 Congress extended the limits of the Mississippi Territory northward to the
                    35th parallel. Nearly all of the Territory was then owned by the native Indians.
                    The Choctaws occupied the southern part, and the Chickasaws the northern part of
                    what is now the State of Mississippi. In 1812 the United States troops occupied
                    Spanish West Florida, and the district east of Pearl river and south of lat. 31°
                    was added to the Mississippi Territory. The Territory was divided by the present
                    line between Alabama and Mississippi, and the State of Mississippi admitted into
                    the Union in 1817. In 1830-32 the native tribes exchanged their lands for others
                    west of the Mississippi river and were nearly all removed, and a rapid influx of
                    settlers followed. In January 1861 the State seceded from the Federal Union,
                    and, joining the Southern Confederacy, furnished a large number of troops during
                    the civil war. It was the field of many important campaigns, and suffered great
                    losses. Exhausted by the conflict, and harassed by processes of political
                    reconstruction, the State was in a deplorable condition for several years. But
                    within the last decade an era of prosperity commenced, marked by a large
                    increase in population and great activity in agricultural and other
                    pursuits.</p>
