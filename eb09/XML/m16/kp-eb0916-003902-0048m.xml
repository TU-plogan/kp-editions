                    popular mythology of England and Scotland, are a class of beings more or less
                    completely akin to man, who have their dwelling in the sea, but are capable of
                    living on land and of entering into social relations with men and women.<note

                    >mermaid</hi> is compounded of the A. -S. <hi rend="italic">mere,</hi> a lake,
                    and <hi rend="italic">moegd,</hi> a maid; but, though <hi rend="italic">mere
                    wif</hi> occurs in Beowulf, <hi rend="italic">mere-maid</hi> does not appear
                    till the Middle English period (Chaucer, <hi rend="italic">Romaunt of the
                    Rose,</hi> &amp;c. ). In Cornwall the fishermen say <hi rend="italic"
                    >merry-maids</hi> and <hi rend="italic">merrymen.</hi> The connexion with the
                    sea rather than with inland waters appears to be of later origin. “The Mermaid
                    of Martin Meer” (Roby’s <hi rend="italic">Traditions of Lancashire,</hi> vol.
                    ii.) is an example of the older force of the word; and such “meer-women” are
                    known to the country-folk in various parts of England <hi rend="italic"
                    >{e.g.,</hi> at Newport in Shropshire, where the town is some day to be drowned
                    by the woman’s agency).</p></note> They are easily identified, at least in some
                    of their most important aspects, with the Old German Meriminni or Meerfrau, the
                    Icelandic Hafgufa, Margygr, and Marmennill (mod. Marbendill), the Danish Hafmand
                    or Maremind, the Irish Merrow or Merruach, the Marie-Morgan of Brittany and the
                    Morforwyn of Wales;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See
                    Rhys, “Welsh Fairy Tales,” in <hi rend="italic">Y</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cymmrodor,</hi> 1881, 1882.</p></note> and they have various points of
                    resemblance to the vodyany or water-sprite and the rusalka or stream-fairy of
                    Russian mythology. The typical mermaid (who is much more frequently described
                    than the merman) has the head and body of a woman, usually of exceeding
                    loveliness, but below the waist is fashioned like a fish with scales and fins.
                    Her hair is long and beautiful, and she is often represented, like the Russian
                    rusalka, as combing it with one hand while in the other she holds a
                    looking-glass. At other times, like the rusalka, she is seen engaged in the more
                    prosaic occupation of washing or beating clothes; but this, as, for example, in
                    Hugh Miller’s terrible Loch Slin legend, is a sign of some impending calamity.
                    For a time at least a mermaid may become to all appearance an ordinary human
                    being; and from a very striking Irish legend (“The Overflowing of Lough Neagh
                    and Liban the Mermaid,” in Joyce’s <hi rend="italic">Old Celtic Romances')</hi>
                    it is evident that a human being may also for a time be transformed into a
                    mermaid.</p>
                <p>The mermaid legends, both English and other, may be grouped as follows. A. <hi
                    rend="italic">Λ mermaid or mermaids either voluntarily or under compulsion
                    reveal things that are about to happen.</hi> Thus the two mermaids (merewip)
                    Hadeburc and Sigelint, in the <hi rend="italic">Nibelungenlied,</hi> disclose
                    his future course to the hero Hagen, who, having got possession of their
                    garments, which they had left on the shore, compels them to pay ransom in this
                    way. According to Resenius, a mermaid appeared to a peasant of Samsöe, foretold
                    the birth of a prince, and moralized on the evils of intemperance<pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n49/mode/1up"

                    andens</hi><hi rend="italic">Krönike,</hi> Copenhagen, 1680, p. 302). B. <hi
                    rend="italic">A Mermaid imparts supernatural powers to a human being.</hi> Thus
                    in the beautiful story of “The Old Man of Cury” (in Hunt’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Popular Romances of the West of England,</hi> 1871) the old man, instead of
                    silver and gold, obtains the power of doing good to his neighbours by breaking
                    the spells of witchcraft, chasing away diseases, and discovering thieves. John
                    Reid, the Cromarty shipmaster, was more selfish,—his “wishes three” being that
                    neither he nor any of his friends should perish by the sea, that he should be
                    uninterruptedly successful in everything he undertook, and that the lady who
                    scorned his love should scorn it no more. C. <hi rend="italic">A mermaid has
                    some one under her protection, and for wrong done to her ward exacts a terrible
                    penalty.</hi> One of the best and most detailed examples of this class is the
                    story of the “Mermaid’s Vengeance” in Mr Hunt’s book already quoted. D. <hi
                    rend="italic">A mermaid falls in love with a human being, lives with him as his
                    lawful wife for a time, and then, some compact being unwittingly or
                    intentionally broken by him, departs to her true home in the sea.</hi> Here, if
                    its mermaid form be accepted, the typical legend is undoubtedly that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Melusina,</hi> which, being made the subject of a full-fledged
                    romance by Jean d’Arras, became one of the most popular folk-books of Europe,
                    appearing in Spanish, German, Dutch, and Bohemian versions. Melusina, whose name
                    may be a far-off echo of the Mylitta (Venus) of the Phoenicians, was married to
                    Raymond of Lusignan, and was long afterwards proudly recognized as one of their
                    ancestors by the Luxembourg, Rohan, and Sassenaye families, and even by the
                    emperor Henry VII. Her story will be found in Baring Gould’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Myths of the Middle Ages.</hi> E. <hi rend="italic">A mermaid falls in love
                    with a man, and entices him to go and live with her below the sea; or a merman
                    wins the affection or captures the person of an earthbom maiden.</hi> This form
                    of legend is very common, and has naturally been a favourite with poets.
                    Macphail of Colonsay successfully rejects the allurements of the mermaid of
                    Corrievrekin, and comes back after long years of trial to the maid of
                    Colonsay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Leyden’s
                    “The Mermaid,” in Sir Walter Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Border
                    Minstrelsy.</hi></p></note> The Danish ballads are especially full of the theme;
                    as “Agnete and the Merman,” an antecedent of Matthew Arnold’s “Forsaken Merman”;
                    the “Deceitful Merman, or Marstig’s Daughter”; and the finely detailed story of
                    Rosmer Hafmand (No. 49 in Grimm).</p>
                <p>In relation to man the mermaid is usually of evil issue if not of evil intent.
                    She has generally to be bribed or compelled to utter her prophecy or bestow her
                    gifts, and whether as wife or paramour she brings disaster in her train. In
                    itself her sea-life is often represented as one of endless delights, but at
                    other times a mournful mystery and sadness broods over it. The fish-tail, which
                    in popular fancy forms the characteristic feature of the mermaid, is really of
                    secondary importance; for the true Teutonic mermaid—probably a remnant of the
                    great cult of the Vanir—had no fish-tail;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    symbolic appendage occurs in such remote mythological regions as to give no clue
                    to historical connexion. The Tritons, and, in the later representations, the
                    Sirens of classical antiquity, the Phoenician Dagon, and the Chaldaean Oannes
                    are all well-known examples; the Ottawas and other American Indians have their
                    man-fish and woman-fish (Jones, <hi rend="italic">Traditions of the North
                    American Indians,</hi> 1830); and the Chinese tell stories not unlike our own
                    about the sea-women of their southern seas (Dennis, <hi rend="italic">Folklore
                    of China,</hi> 1875).</p>
                <p>Quasi-historical instances of the appearance or capture of mermaids are common

                    signboards and coats of arms, to show how thoroughly the myth had taken hold of
                    the popular imagination.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>See the paper in <hi rend="italic">Jour. Brit. Arch. Ass.,</hi> xxxviii.,
                    1882, by H. S. Cuming, who points out that mermaids or mermen occur in the arms
                    of Earls Caledon, Howth, and Sandwich, Viscounts Boyne and Hood, Lord Lyttleton,
                    and Scott of Abbotsford, as well as in those of the Ellis, Byron, Phené,
                    Skeffington, and other families. The English heralds represent the creatures
                    with a single tail, the French and German heralds frequently with a double
                    one.</p></note> A mermaid captured at Bangor, on the shore of Belfast Lough, in
                    the 6th century, was not only baptized, but admitted into some of the old
                    calendars as a saint under the name of Murgen <hi rend="italic">(Notes and
                    Queries,</hi> Oct. 21, 1882); and Stowe <hi rend="italic">(Annales,</hi> under
                    date 1187) relates how a.man-fish was kept for six months and more in the castle
                    of Orforde in Suffolk. As showing how legendary material may gather round a
                    simple fact, the oft-told story of the sea-woman of Edam is particularly
                    interesting. The oldest authority, Joh. Gerbrandus a Leydis, a Carmelite monk
                    <hi rend="italic">(ob.</hi> 1504), tells <hi rend="italic">(Annales,</hi>
                    &amp;c., Frankfort, 1620) how in 1403 a wild woman came through a breach in the
                    dike into Purmerlake, and, being found by some Edam milkmaids, was ultimately
                    taken to Haarlem and lived there many years. Nobody could understand her, but
                    she learned to spin, and was wont to adore the cross. Ocka Scharlensis <hi
                    rend="italic">(Chronijk van Friesland,</hi> Leeuw., 1597) reasons that she was
                    not a fish because she could spin, and she was not a woman because she could
                    live in the sea; and thus in due course she got fairly established as a genuine
                    mermaid. Vosmaer, who has carefully investigated the matter, enumerates forty
                    writers who have repeated the story, and shows that the older ones speak only of
                    à woman (see “Beschr. van de zoogen. Meermin der stad Haarlem,” in <hi
                    rend="italic">Verh. van de Holl. Maatsch. van</hi><hi rend="italic">K.
                    en</hi><hi rend="italic">Wet.,</hi> part 23, No. 1786). As for the stuffed
                    mermaids which have figured from the days of Bartholomew Fair downwards, it is
                    enough to mention that exhibited in the Turf Coffee-house, London, in 1822, and
                    carefully drawn by Cruikshank (compare Chambers, <hi rend="italic">Book of
                    Days').</hi></p>
