                <p><label type="entry">MILL, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1773-1836),
                    historian and political and mental philosopher, was born 6th April 1773, in the
                    little village called Northwater Bridge (Bridge of North Esk), in the parish of
                    Logie-Pert, in the county of Forfar. His father, James Mill, was a shoemaker;
                    his mother, Isabel Fenton, belonged to a race of respectable farmers. The father
                    was industrious, good-natured, and pious, but not known as specially
                    intelligent. The mother was of a proud disposition, and resolved to educate
                    James, her eldest son, for a superior destiny. He began his education at the
                    parish school, and went on to the Montrose Academy, where he remained till the
                    unusual age of seventeen and a half, when he went to the college of Edinburgh
                    (1790). According to the usage of the time and neighbourhood, he ought to have
                    been sent about thirteen or fourteen to Marischal College, Aberdeen. His
                    remaining so long at the Montrose Academy, and his going to Edinburgh for his
                    university course, must be connected with his being taken up by Sir John and
                    Lady Jane Stuart of Fettercairn, who engaged him to be tutor to their only
                    daughter, known for having inspired the affection of Sir Walter Scott, and for
                    being the mother of Principal James David Forbes. Sir John and Lady Jane Stuart
                    contracted a warm attachment for Mill, which lasted throughout their lives. At
                    Edinburgh University Mill was distinguished as a Greek scholar. But he received
                    his greatest impulse from Dugald Stewart, for whom he always expressed unbounded
                    admiration. In October 1798 he was licensed as a preacher, but seems to have
                    preached very seldom. His years from 1790 to 1802, besides being occupied with
                    incessant studies extending into history and moral and political philosophy,
                    were devoted to various tutorships.</p>
                <p>Failing to find a career to his mind in Scotland, in 1802 he went to London in
                    company with Sir John Stuart, then member of parliament for Kincardineshire. He
                    soon obtained literary occupation, to which he applied himself with untiring
                    energy. His first important venture was to start a periodical on a new plan,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">The Literary Journal,</hi> which began to appear in
                    January 1803, and continued under his editorship till the end of 1806. It was
                    the most comprehensive in its aims of any periodical hitherto in existence,
                    being a summary view of all the leading departments of human knowledge. Thomas
                    Thomson, the chemist, took charge of science; and many other men of ability
                    co-operated. Mill himself wrote largely in biography, history, political
                    philosophy, political economy, and also in theology, on which his views at the
                    time were broad without being sceptical. The publisher of the journal was
                    Baldwin, who was also the proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">St James’s
                        Chronicle,</hi> a Conservative paper appearing three times a week. For two
                    or three years, from 1805 onwards, Mill was editor, but at last gave it up,
                    partly on conscientious grounds, although in conducting it he never lent himself
                    to the expression of any illiberal views, but often made it the vehicle of the
                    opposite.</p>
                <p>In 1804 he wrote a pamphlet on the <hi rend="italic">Corn Trade,</hi> advocating
                    the impolicy of a bounty on the exportation of grain. This was the beginning of
                    his career as a political economist. In 1805 he published a translation of
                    Villers’s work on the <hi rend="italic">Reformation,</hi> an unsparing exposure
                    of the vices of the papal system. He added notes and quotations by way of
                    confirmation of the author’s views. On this subject also he continued to hold
                    strong opinions all through life, and often recurred to it in his articles in
                    the reviews. In 1805 he married Harriet Burrow, whose mother, a widow, kept an
                    establishment for lunatics in Hoxton. He then took a house in Rodney Street,
                    Pentonville, where his eldest son, John Stuart, was born in 1806. It was about
                    the end of 1806 that he entered upon the composition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >History of India,</hi> which he expected to finish in three or four years.
                    He was actually engaged upon it for twelve, giving, however, a considerable
                    portion of his time to other writing for the support of his family. The strain
                    upon his energies for those years was enormous.</p>
                <p>He became acquainted with Jeremy Bentham in 1808, and was for many years
                    Bentham’s chief companion and ally. In 1810 Bentham, to have Mill nearer him,
                    gave him Milton’s house, which adjoined his own, and was his property. After a
                    few months’ trial Mill had to give up this house on account of his wife’s
                    health, and went to live in Newington Green; but in 1814 Bentham leased the
                    house No. 1 Queen’s Square, now 40 Queen Anne’s Gate, close to his own garden,
                    and gave it to Mill at a reduced rent; here he remained till 1831. The intimacy
                    with Bentham was rendered still closer. For four years, from 1814 to 1817,
                    Bentham was at Ford Abbey, near Chard, in Somersetshire, and there Mill and his
                    family were domesticated with him nine or ten months each year,—in which
                    retirement it is probable that Mill was able to accelerate the completion of his
                    history.</p>
                <p>In the twelve years between 1806 and 1818 he wrote a&gt; great many articles for
                    various periodicals. Among these were the <hi rend="italic">Anti-Jacobin
                        Review,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">British Review,</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">Eclectic Review;</hi> but there is no means of tracing his
                    contributions. In 1808 he began to write for the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh
                        Review,</hi> and contributed steadily till 1813, most of his articles being
                    known. In the <hi rend="italic">Annual Review</hi> for 1808 two articles of his
                    are traced—a “Review of Fox’s History,” and an article on “Bentham’s Law
                    Reforms,” probably his first published notice of Bentham. The first known
                    article in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> was on “Money and Exchange”
                    (October 1808). In 1809 (January and July) he wrote at great length on Spanish
                    America and General Miranda, with whom he was on terms of intimate friendship.
                    In the July number he also wrote on China. In 1810 (April) he made a severe
                    attack on the East India Company. He also wrote on the liberty of the press and
                    on the Church of England in connexion with the Lancasterian schools. He was an
                    active member of the committee for promoting education on Lancaster’s plan. In
                    1811 a periodical named the <hi rend="italic">Philanthropist</hi> was started by
                    William Allen, and published in quarterly numbers till 1817. Mill co-operated
                    with Allen both in the writing and in the management. He contributed largely to
                    every number,—his principal topics being education, freedom of the press, and
                    prison discipline (under which he expounded Bentham’s “Panopticon ”). He made
                    powerful onslaughts on the church in connexion with the Bell and Lancaster
                    controversy. In 1814 Macvey Napier engaged him to contribute to the supplement
                    to the fifth edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica.</hi>
                    Many of the articles became notable. The list included “Government,”
                    “Jurisprudence,” “Liberty of the Press,” “Prisons and Prison Discipline,”
                    “Colony,” <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n324/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0916-0324-0307"/> “Law of Nations,” “Education,” “Beggar,”
                    “Benefit Societies,” “Banks for Savings.” In “Jurisprudence” and “Prisons” he
                    was largely indebted to Bentham; in most of the others he was either altogether
                    or in great part original. The article on “Government” will occupy a permanent
                    position in English history.</p>
                <p>In 1818 was published the <hi rend="italic">History of India,</hi> which had a
                    great and speedy success. It was the means of changing the author’s future
                    position. The year following he was appointed an official in the India House, in
                    the important department of the examiner of Indian correspondence. He gradually
                    rose in rank till he was appointed, in 1830, head of the office. He introduced
                    his eldest son into the same department in 1823.</p>
                <p>In 1824 Bentham projected the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review,</hi> and Mill
                    was a principal writer for three years. Some of his most vigorous writings are
                    included among those contributions. The first was an elaborate criticism of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> as a whole; it was followed by an
                    onslaught on the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly.</hi> Other articles dealt with
                    English history and with ecclesiastical establishments, which he severely
                    impugned. To a periodical of short duration, <hi rend="italic">The Parliamentary
                        History and Review,</hi> he contributed an elaborate political retrospect of
                    the parliament of 1820-26. In 1829 appeared the <hi rend="italic">Analysis of
                        the Human Mind.</hi> From 1831 to 1833 he was largely occupied in the
                    defence of the East India Company during the controversy attending the renewal
                    of its charter, he being in virtue of his office the spokesman of the court of
                    directors. In 1834 Sir William Molesworth projected the <hi rend="italic">London
                        Review,</hi> and Mill contributed to it during the last two years of his
                    life. His most notable article was one entitled “The Church and its Reform,”
                    which was much too sceptical for the time, and injured the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Review.</hi> His last published book was the <hi rend="italic">Fragment on
                        Mackintosh,</hi> which appeared in 1835. He died on the 23d June 1836.</p>
                <p>A considerable space would be required to do justice to Mill's
                    character—intellectual and moral—as shown both in his writings and in his
                    intensely active and influential career. He was an excellent scholar, in the
                    sense of knowing the Greek and Roman classics. His other accomplishments
                    included general history, the philosophy of politics in the most comprehensive
                    acceptation, logic, ethics, and mental philosophy. The type of his intellect was
                    logical in the highest degree; he was, above all things, clear and precise, an
                    enemy of every form of looseness of reasoning, and a crusher of prevailing
                    fallacies. This is the most notable feature in his writings throughout. His was
                    also an original mind. Except in a few subjects, which had been so well
                    elaborated by Bentham that he was content to be little more than an expounder of
                    Bentham’s views, he gave a fresh turn to whatever topic he took up. At a time
                    when social subjects were subjected almost exclusively to an empirical handling,
                    he insisted on bringing first principles to bear at every point; in this lay
                    both his strength and his weakness.</p>
                <p>His greatest literary monument is the <hi rend="italic">History of India.</hi>
                    The materials for narrating the acquisition by England of its Indian empire were
                    put into shape for the first time; a vast body of political theory was brought
                    to bear on the delineation of the Hindu civilization; and the conduct of the
                    actors in the successive stages of the conquest and administration of India was
                    subjected to a severe criticism. The work itself, and the author’s official
                    connexion with India for the last seventeen years of his life, effected a
                    complete change in the whole system of governing that country.</p>
                <p>Mill played a great part as a politician and political philosopher in English
                    affairs as well. He was,, more than any other man, the founder of what was
                    called philosophical radicalism. His writings on government and his personal
                    influence among the Liberal politicians of his time determined the change of
                    view from the French Revolution theories of the rights of man and the absolute
                    equality of men to the claiming of securities for good government through a
                    great extension of the electoral suffrage. Under this banner it was that the
                    Reform Bill was fought and won.</p>
                <p>His work on <hi rend="italic">Political Economy</hi> was intended as a text-book
                    of the subject, and shows all the author’s precision and lucidity. It followed
                    up the views of Ricardo, with whom Mill was in habitual intimacy. It urged
                    strongly the modern application of the principle of population, and started the
                    doctrine of taxing land for the unearned increment of value.</p>
                <p>By his <hi rend="italic">Analysis of the Mind</hi> and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fragment on Mackintosh</hi> Mill acquired a position in the history of
                    psychology and ethics. Attached to the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi>
                    school, he vindicated its claims with conspicuous ability. He took up the
                    problems of mind very much after the fashion of the Scotch school, as then
                    represented by Reid, Stewart, and Brown, but made a new start, due in part to
                    Hartley’ and still more to his own independent thinking. He carried out the
                    principle of association into the analysis of the complex emotional states, as
                    the affections, the aesthetic emotions, and the moral sentiment, all which he
                    endeavoured to resolve into pleasurable and painful sensations. But the salient
                    merit of the <hi rend="italic">Analysis</hi> is the constant endeavour after
                    precise definition of terms and clear statement of doctrines. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Fragment on Mackintosh</hi> is a severe exposure of the
                    flimsiness and misrepresentations of Mackintosh’s famous dissertation on ethical
                    philosophy. It discusses, in a very thorough way, the foundations of ethics from
                    the author’s point of view of utility.</p>
                <p>Mill’s influence on the young men of his time by his conversation has been
                    especially celebrated. Among those that came under this influence were some of
                    the greatest names in the generation that succeeded him. He had himself a very
                    high ideal of public virtue, which he carried out, at the risk of sacrificing
                    all his chances of worldly advancement, and he impressed this ideal on those
                    that surrounded him,—most of all on his own son, who has since eclipsed his
                    father in fame, if not in genius.</p>
