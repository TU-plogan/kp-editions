                <p><label type="entry">MONTPELLIER</label>, chief town of the department of Hérault,
                    France, is situated at the junction of several railway lines, on a small hill
                    rising above the Lez <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> at its confluence with the
                    Merdanson, about 480 miles south of Paris, and about 7 miles from the
                    Mediterranean, from which it is separated by the lagoons of Pérols and 1’Arnel.
                    As the headquarters of the 16th corps d’armée, as the seat of a bishop, of a
                    university, and of a court of appeal, Montpellier is the principal place of
                    lower Languedoc. The Place du Peyrou, 575 feet in length by 410 in breadth, one
                    of the finest squares in France, occupies the highest part of the town, and
                    terminates in a terrace, commanding a magnificent view of the coasts of the
                    Mediterranean, and of a wide stretch of country reaching to the Cevennes on the
                    north, to the spurs of the Pyrenees on the south-west, and to those of the Alps
                    on the north-east. On the terrace is situated the reservoir of the town, the
                    water being brought from a distance of 5 or 6 miles by an aqueduct of two tiers
                    of arches, about 70 feet in height. In the centre of the square is an equestrian
                    statue of Louis XIV. To the right and left are promenades, on which the chief
                    boulevards converge. The Boulevard Henri IV. to the north leads to the botanical
                    garden, medical college, and cathedral; to the east the Rue Nationale leads to
                    the palace of justice, the préfecture, and the citadel. The cathedral, which
                    until 1536 was the church of a Benedictine monastery, suffered severely during
                    the religious wars, but about thirty years ago it was restored in the style of
                    the 13th century. It has four towers, and is one of the largest churches in
                    southern France, being more than 300 feet in length, 92 in breadth, and 88 in
                    height. The monastery, after being converted into the bishop’s palace, has since
                    1795 being occupied by the famous medical school. The portrait of Rabelais hangs
                    in the gallery of former professors. Connected with the medical school is an
                    anatomical museum and a rich library. Montpellier also possesses a faculty of
                    science, with several fine collections, a faculty of letters, a higher school of
                    pharmacy, an agricultural college, and a sericultural institute. The museum
                    contains more than 600 paintings, in addition to collections of marbles,
                    bronzes, and antiquities. The botanical garden, more than 10 acres in extent, is
                    the oldest in France, having been laid out in 1593. The esplanade, ornamented by
                    fine old trees planted by the due de Roquelaure, formerly governor of Languedoc,
                    leads towards the citadel. The inner city has narrow and tortuous streets, but
                    many good houses. Among the public buildings, the principal are the palace of
                    justice —a modern structure, the façade adorned with statues of the statesman
                    Cambacérès and of Cardinal Fleury—the barracks, several hospitals, the juvenile
                    seminary, and the central prison for females. There are several learned
                    societies, including an academy of science and letters, an antiquarian society,
                    several medical societies, and others for various separate branches of study,
                    including the dialect of Languedoc. The Lez has been deepened and widened so as
                    to connect Montpellier with the Canal du Midi and with the sea at Palavas. The
                    town has a considerable trade in wine and brandy. The principal industrial
                    establishment is a manufactory for wax-tapers, candles, and soap, doing business
                    to the amount of £400,000 per annum. There are also chemical works, cooperages,
                    distilleries, &amp;c. The population in 1881 was 56,005.</p>
                <p>Montpellier first rose into importance after the destruction of Maguelone by
                    Charles Martel in 737. Its prosperity dates from the beginning of the 12th
                    century, when its school of medicine (see vol. xv. p. 807) first began to
                    acquire fame. It had a school of law in 1160, and a university was founded by
                    Pope Nicholas IV. in 1292. St Louis (Louis IX.) granted to the town the right of
                    free trade with the whole of the kingdom, a privilege which greatly increased
                    its prosperity. In 1204 Montpellier became a dependency of the house of Aragon,
                    through marriage, and in 1350 it was sold to Philip of Valois. In the time of
                    Charles VIII. it is said to have had 35,000 hearths. It took the place of the
                    bishopric of Maguelone in 1536. At the time of the Reformation it became one of
                    the most important centres of Protestantism, but was taken by Louis XIII., who
                    erected the citadel commanding the town. Several years afterwards Montpellier
                    was partly depopulated by the plague. Of the old fortifications little now
                    remains save the gate of Peyrou, a triumphal arch of date 1712, opposite the
                    place of the same name.</p>
