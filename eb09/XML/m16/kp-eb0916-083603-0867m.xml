                <p><label type="entry">MOROSINI</label>, the name of a noble Venetian family.
                    According to the best authorities, Cappellari and Barbaro, there would seem to
                    have been two families of that name, distinguishing themselves by the variation
                    of their shield. The one came from Mantua at the time of Attila’s invasion, and
                    bore or, a fess azure. The other came from Illyria in the 7th century; they bore
                    or, a bend azure. However that may be, nothing authentic is known of the
                    Morosini till we find them settled as one family in Venice during the 8th
                    century. The Morosini belong to the Case Vecchie, or twenty-four families of
                    Venetian nobility who were descended from the tribunes of the confederate
                    islands before Venice became united in one centre at Rialto. The 10th century
                    was a period of danger for the family. They became involved in a blood feud with
                    another noble house, the Caloprini, who were Ghibelline in politics, and relied
                    upon the emperor Otto for support. The Morosini, however, proved the stronger,
                    thanks to their popularity; and the year 991 saw them victorious through the
                    deposition of the doge Memo, who had favoured their enemies. The Morosini
                    engaged in commerce with the East, and in the 14th century two brothers of the
                    family, Alban and Marco, founded a house at Aleppo with branches in Damascus,
                    Beynit, and elsewhere in Syria. The wealth and importance of the family may be
                    gathered from the fact that in 1379 no less than fifty-nine Morosini subscribed
                    towards the fund for carrying on the war of Chioggia. The house of Morosini gave
                    four doges to Venice, and numbered among its honours two royal marriages, two
                    cardinals, twenty-four procurators of St Mark, besides numerous generals of the
                    republic. The Morosini continued to flourish till the opening of the last
                    century, when the family began to decline; it is now represented by one
                    surviving member.</p>
                <p>Among the more distinguished members of the house must be mentioned Giovanni, who
                    in 982 founded the monastic establishment on S. Giorgio Maggiore after the order
                    of St Benedict; Domenico, doge 1148-1156—in the third year of his reign Pola and
                    Istria, which had rebelled, were reconquered; Marino, doge 1249-1252, during
                    whose reign the Inquisition, in a modified form and under the surveillance of
                    Venetian officers, was introduced into Venice for the first time. In this same
                    century (1290) Tommasina Morosini, the sister of Albertino il Grande, married
                    Stephen, prince of Hungary. Their son Andrew succeeded to the throne, and was
                    directed in his government by his uncle Albertino, on whom he conferred the
                    dukedom of Slavonia and the county of Morlacchia. A cousin of Tommasina,
                    Costanza, married Ladislaus, king of Servia. In 1382 Michele Morosini was
                    elected doge. He had acquired a large fortune and a reputation for astuteness by
                    buying Venetian property while the Genoese were still in Chioggia; and much was
                    expected of him in the restoration of his country’s finance when that war came
                    to an end. But he died the year of his election. Andrea Morosini the historian
                    was born in 1558. He studied at Padua, and on coming of age embarked on public
                    life. He passed through the various offices of state, till in 1618 he was a
                    candidate for the dogeship, but failed to secure it, and died the same year. On
                    the death of the official historian Paolo Paruta, in 1598, Andrea was
                    commissioned by the Council of Ten to continue his work, and received authority
                    to consult the state papers down to 1594. He wrote his history in Latin. It
                    covers from 1521 to 1615, and was first published in Venice, 1623.</p>

                <p>The most distinguished member of the house of Morosini was Francesco, the
                    captain-general of the republic against the Turks and conqueror of the Morea. He
                    was born in 1618. In 1666 he was in command during an unfortunate campaign in
                    Candia. In 1687 he conquered Patras, and so opened the Morea to the Venetian
                    arms. In the following year he was elected doge. After his return to Venice the
                    republic suffered severely in Candia, and though now an old man Francesco took
                    the field again in 1693, but died the next year at Nauplia, seventy-six years of
                    age. A more detailed account of his exploits will be found in the article <hi
