                    cast. By rail it is 31 miles E.S.E. of Parma, 24 W.N.W. of Bologna, and 37 S. of
                    Mantua. The observatory stands 135 feet above the level of the sea, in 44° 38'
                    52" N. lat. and 10° 55' 42" E. long. Dismantled since 1816, and now largely
                    converted into promenades, the fortifications still give the city an irregular
                    pentagonal contour, modified at the north-west corner by the addition of a
                    citadel also pentagonal. Within this circuit there are various open areas— the
                    spacious Piazza d’Armi in front of the citadel, the public gardens in the
                    north-east of the city, the Piazza Grande in front of the cathedral, and the
                    Piazza Beale to the south of the palace. The Aemilian Way crosses obliquely
                    right through the heart of the city, from the Bologna Gate in the east to that
                    of Sant’ Agostino in the west. Commenced by the countess Matilda in 1099, after
                    the designs of Lanfranc, and consecrated in 1184, the cathedral (St Geminian’s)
                    is a low but handsome building, with a lofty crypt, three eastern apses, and a
                    façade still preserving some curious sculptures of the 12th and 15th centuries.
                    The bell-tower, named La öhirlandina from the bronze garland surrounding the
                    weathercock, is lined with white marble, and is 315 feet high; in the basement
                    maybe seen the wooden bucket captured by the Modenese from the Bolognese in the
                    affray at Zappolino (1325), and rendered famous by Tassoni’s <hi rend="italic"

                    terra-cottas by the local artist Begarelli, and S. Agostino (now S. Michele)
                    contains the tomb of Sigonius and the tombstone of Muratori. The old ducal
                    palace, begun by Duke Francis I. in 1635 from the designs of Avanzini, and
                    finished by Francis Ferdinand V., is an extensive marble building, and now
                    contains the library <hi rend="italic">{Bib.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    best pictures in the ducal collection were sold in the 18th century, and found
                    their way to Dresden. The valuable <hi rend="italic">Museo Lapidario</hi> in a
                    building near Porta Sant’ Agostino is well known to the classical antiquary
                    through Cavedoni’s <hi rend="italic">Dichiarazione degli antichi marmi
                    Modenesi</hi> (1828), and the supplements in the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    of the Academy, vol. ix., &lt;fcc. The university of Modena, originally founded
                    in 1683 by Francis II., is mainly a medical and legal school, but has also a
                    faculty of physical and mathematical science. It has about twenty-five
                    professors, and from 200 to 250 students; a library of 20,000 volumes, an
                    observatory, botanical gardens, an ethnographical museum, &lt;kc. The old
                    academy of tlιe <hi rend="italic">Dissonanti,</hi> dating from 1684, was
                    restored by Francis in 1814, and now forms the flourishing Royal Academy of
                    Science and Art <hi rend="italic">{Memoirs</hi> since 1833); and there are
                    besides in the city an Italian Society of Science founded by Anton Mario Lorgna,
                    an academy of fine arts, a military college (1859), an important agricultural
                    college, and a lyceum and gymnasium, both named after Muratori. In industrial
                    enterprise the Modenese show but little activity, silk and linen goods and
                    iron-wares being almost the only products of any note. Commerce is stimulated by
                    a good position in the railway system, and by a canal which opens a water-way by
                    the Panaro and the Po to the Adriatic. The population of the city was 32,248 in
                    1861, and 30,854 in 1871; that of the commune 55,512 in 1861, and 58,058 in

                    to the Mediterranean, and was bounded N. by Lombardy and the Papal States, E. by
                    the Papal States and Tuscany, S. by Tuscany, Sardinia, and the Mediterranean,
                    and W. by Sardinia and the duchy of Parma. Its greatest length, from
                    Porto-Vecchio, on its northern frontier towards Mantua, to the outlet of the
                    Parmignola torrent, on the Sardinian frontier, was 84 J miles; and its greatest
                    width, from the pass of Calama, on the Papal and Tuscan frontier, to the right
                    bank of the Enza, on the frontier of Parma, λvas 37 nules. The area was 2371
                    square miles, of which three-fifths were mountainous. In 1855 the population was
                    C06,159. The duchy had six provinces—Modena, Reggio, Guastalla, Frignano,
                    Garfagnana, Massa-Carrara.</p>
                <p>Modena is the ancient Mutina, which was annexed by the Romans along with the rest
                    of the territory of the Boii. In 183 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Mutina
                    became the seat of a Roman colony. During the civil wars Marcus Brutus held out
                    within its walls against Pompeius in 78 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and in
                    44 B,c. the place was defended by D. Brutus against Μ. Antony. 'Die 4th century
                    found Mutina in a state of decay; the ravages of Attila and the troubles of the
                    Lombard period left it a ruined city in a wasted land. In the 8th century its
                    exiles founded, at a distance of 4 miles to the north-west, a new city, Città
                    Geminiana (still represented by the village of Cittanova); but about the close
                    of the 9th century Modena was restored and refortified by its bishop, Laedoinus.
                    When it began to build its cathedral (1099 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> the
                    city was part of the possessions of the countess Matilda of Tuscany; but when,
                    in 1184, the edifice was consecrated by Lucius III., it was a free community. In
                    the wars between Frederick II. and Gregory IX. it sided with the emperor, though
                    ultimately the papal party was strong enough to introduce confusion into its
                    policy. In 1288 Obizzo d’Este was recognized as lord of the city; after the
                    death of his successor, Azzo VIII. (1308), it resumed its communal independence;
                    but by 1336 the Este family was again in power. Constituted a duchy in 1452 in
                    favour of Borso d’Este, and enlarged and strengthened by Hercules II., it became
                    the ducal residence on the incorporation of Ferrara with the States of the
                    Church (1598). Francis I. (1629-1658) erected the citadel and commenced the
                    palace, which was largely embellished by Francis II. Rinaldo <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ob.</hi> 1737) was twice driven from his city by French invasion. To Francis
                    III. (1698-1780) the city was indebted for many of its public buildings.
                    Hercules III. (1727-1803) saw his states transformed by the French into the
                    Cispadine Republic, and, having refused the principality of Breisgau and
                    Ortenau, offered him in compensation by the treaty of Campo Formio, died an
                    exile at Treviso. His only daughter, Maria Beatrice, married Ferdinand of
                    Austria (son of Maria Theresa), and in 1814 their eldest son, Ferdinand,
                    received back the <hi rend="italic">Stati</hi><hi rend="italic">Estensi.</hi>
                    His rule was subservient to Austria, reactionary, and despotic. On the outbreak
                    of the French Revolution of 1830,Francis IV.seemed for a time disposed to
                    encourage the corresponding movement in Modena; but no sooner had the Austrian
                    army put an end to the insurrection in Central Italy than he returned to his
                    previous policy. Francis Ferdinand V., who succeeded in 1846, followed in the
                    main his father’s example. Obliged to leave the city in 1848, he was restored by
                    the Austrians in 1849; ten years later, on 20th August 1859, the representatives
                    of the Modenese, under the direction of Carlo Farini, declared their territory
                    part of the kingdom of Italy, and their decision was confirmed by the plebiscite
                    of 1860.</p>
