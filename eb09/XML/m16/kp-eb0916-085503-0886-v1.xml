                <p><label type="entry">MOSCOW</label>, a government of Central Russia, bounded by
                    Tver on the N.W., Vladimir and Ryazan on the E., Tula and Kaluga on the S., and
                    Smolensk on the W., and having an area of 12,858 square miles. The surface is
                    undulating, with broad depressions occupied by the rivers, and varies in
                    elevation from 500 to 850 feet. Moscow is situated in the centre of the
                    so-called Moscow coal-basin, which extends into the neighbouring governments,
                    and consists of limestones of the Upper and Lower Carboniferous, the latter
                    containing beds of inferior coal, while the former contains several good
                    quarries of marble. The Carboniferous formation is covered with Jurassic clays,
                    sandstones, and sands, which yield a good china-clay at Gjeli, copperas, a
                    sandstone much employed for building, and a white sand used for the manufacture
                    of glass. The whole is thickly covered with boulder-clay and alluvial sands.</p>
                <p>The government is watered by the Volga, which skirts it for a few miles on its
                    northern boundary, by the navigable Sestra, which brings it in communication
                    with the canals leading to St Petersburg, by the Oka, and by the Moskva. This
                    last takes its origin in Smolensk, and, after a course of 280 miles right across
                    Moscow, reaches the Oka at Kolomna; it is navigable from the town of Moscow. The
                    Oka and Moskva from a remote period have been important channels of trade, and
                    continue to be so notwithstanding the development of railways. The Oka brings
                    the government into water communication with the Volga, whose tributaries cover
                    nearly the whole of middle and eastern Russia, and are separated by short land
                    distances from the Northern Dwina and the Don. Large quantities of grain,
                    metals, glass ware, skins, and other commodities are shipped up and down the
                    Moskva, whilst the Myach-kovo stone quarries situated on its banks supply the
                    capital with building stone. There are several marshes, mostly in the north, <pb

                    notwithstanding the immense consumption of wood in manufactures and for use in
                    the capital, extensive forests are still found. Very large supplies of timber
                    are also imported by rail or river, especially from the adjoining north-eastern
                    provinces. The soil is somewhat unproductive, the average crops ranging from 3⅜
                    to 4∣ returns; agriculture is carried on everywhere, but only two districts
                    (Ruza and Volsko-lamsk) export corn, all the others being more or less dependent
                    on extraneous supplies. The agricultural holdings of the peasants are very
                    small, and their condition on the whole unsatisfactory.<note anchored="true"

                            instituted by the Moscow provincial assembly, 10 per cent, of the
                            agricultural population (about 20,000 households) have no land at all;
                            15 per cent., while holding land, are bankrupt; and 13 per cent, are

                    importance in several districts, and kitchengardening is an important source of
                    wealth in Vereya, Dmitroff, and Zvenigorod. Cattle are not extensively reared,
                    but the horse-breeding industry is somewhat important.</p>
                <p>The population, 1,581,700 in 1864, numbered 1,913,700 in 1873, one-third being
                    urban. They are nearly all Great-Russians, and belong to the Greek Church, or
                    are nonconformists. Many are employed in factories, the number of which in 1879
                    was 1546, occupying 162,700 hands, and having an annual production of about
                    £20,000,000 sterling. These figures show the manufacturing activity of Moscow to
                    be greater than that of any other Russian government, while the value produced
                    is upwards of one-fifth of the total for all Russia in Europe, including Poland.
                    Cotton, woollen, and silk goods are the chief products. The sanitary condition
                    of the factories is very bad; the number of children below fifteen years
                    employed is as high as 16 per cent., the hours of daily work are often 13 to 16,
                    and the mortality is very great. The total income obtained by the population of
                    the government from their manufacturing industry is estimated at £485,600. The
                    chief income of the people is derived, however, from a variety of petty
                    industries, carried on in their villages by the peasants, who continue at the
                    same time to cultivate the soil. Taxation during the last twenty years has been
                    increasing rapidly, and in some parts of the government has reached an average
                    of 12 roubles per house. The chief centres of trade are Moscow, Kolomna,
                    Serpukhoff, Bogorodsk, Serghievsk, and Pavlovsk. There are 125 fairs. Transport
                    is much facilitated by railways, and by good highroads radiating from the
                    capital. Moscow is divided into thirteen districts, the chief towns with their
                    respective populations being—Moscow (670,000), Bogorodsk (6600), Bronnitsy
                    (3500), Ruza (4000), Kolomna (18,800), Serpukhoff (16,800), Podolsk (11,000),
                    Zvenigorod (7800), Mojaisk (4200),Volokolamsk (3000), Klin (6700), Dmitroff
                    (7600), and Vereya (5500). In addition to these administrative centres may be
                    mentioned Voskresensk (6000), Serghievski Posad (27,500), in the neighbourhood
                    of the monastery of Troitsa, a rich commercial and industrial town, and
                    Pavlovski Posad (4500). Many of the villages are far more important from their
                    industries and trade than the district towns.</p>
