                    near Nemours, on March 9, 1749. Μ. de Loménie has shown that the family of
                    Biquet or Riqueti came originally from the little town of Digne, that they won
                    wealth and municipal honours as merchants at Marseilles, and that in 1570 Jean
                    Riqueti bought the chateau and estate of Mirabeau, which had up to that time
                    belonged to the great Provençal family of Barras, and took the title of esquire
                    a few years later. In 1685 Honoré Riqueti obtained the title of Marquis de
                    Mirabeau, and his son Jean Antoine brought honour to it. He served with
                    distinction through all the later campaigns of the reign of Louis XIV., and
                    especially distinguished himself in 1705 at the battle of Cassano, where he was
                    so severely wounded in the neck that he had ever after to wear a silver stock;
                    yet he never rose above the rank of colonel, owing to his eccentric habit of
                    speaking unpleasant truths to his superiors. On retiring from the service he
                    married Françoise de Castellane, a remarkable woman, who long survived him, and
                    he left at his death, in 1737, three sons —Victor, Marquis de Mirabeau (see next
                    article), Jean Antoine, Bailli de Mirabeau, and Comte Louis Alexandre de
                    Mirabeau. The great Mirabeau was the elder surviving son of the marquis. When
                    but three years old he had a virulent attack of confluent small-pox which left
                    his face for ever disfigured, and contributed not a little to nourish his
                    father’s dislike to him. His early education was conducted by Lachabeaussière,
                    father of the better known man of letters, after which, being like his father
                    and grandfather destined for the army, then the only profession open to young
                    men of family, he was entered at a pension militaire at Paris, kept by an Abbé
                    Choquart. Of this school, which had Lagrange for its professor of mathematics,
                    we have an amusing account in the life of Gilbert Elliot, first earl of Minto,
                    who with his brother Hugh, afterwards British minister at Berlin, there made the
                    acquaintance of Mirabeau, an acquaintance which soon ripened into friendship,
                    and to which Mirabeau in later life owed his introduction into good English
                    society. On leaving this school in 1767 he received a commission in the cavalry
                    regiment of the Marquis de Lambert, which his grandfather had commanded years
                    before. He at once began love making, and in spite of his ugliness succeeded in
                    winning the heart of the lady to whom his colonel was attached, which led to
                    such scandal that his father obtained a lettre de cachet, and the young
                    scapegrace was imprisoned in the isle of Rhé. The love affairs of Mirabeau form
                    quite a history by themselves, and a well-known history, owing to the celebrity
                    of the letters to Sophie; and the behaviour of the marquis in perpetually
                    imprisoning his son is equally well known, and as widely blamed. Yet it may be
                    asserted that until the more durable and more reputable connexion with Madame de
                    Nehra these love episodes were the most disgraceful blemishes in a life
                    otherwise of a far higher moral character than has been commonly supposed. As to
                    the marquis, his use of lettres de cachet is perfectly defensible on the theory
                    of the existence of lettres de cachet at all. They were meant to be used (see
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Lettres</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">de Cachet)</hi> by heads
                    of families for the correction of their families, and Mirabeau, if any son,
                    surely deserved such correction. Further, they did have the effect of sobering
                    the culprit, and the more creditable part of his life did not begin till he left
                    Vincennes. Mirabeau, it may be remarked at once, was not a statesman of the
                    Alcibiades type, and he did not develop his great qualities of mind and
                    character until his youthful excesses were over. These will be passed over as
                    rapidly as possible, for it was not till 1781 that the qualities which made him
                    great began to appear.</p>
                <p>On being released frqm his first imprisonment, the young count, who had always
                    intended to continue his military career, obtained leave to accompany as a
                    volunteer the French expedition which was to effect the reduction of Corsica.
                    The conquest was one of sheer numerical strength, for the whole population was
                    on the side of Paoli, and Mirabeau, perceiving the value of public opinion, is
                    said to have written a treatise on the oppression the Genoese had formerly
                    exercised over the island, which the Government was ready to publish had not the
                    Marquis de Mirabeau thought fit to destroy it because of its divergence from his
                    own philosophical and economical views. For his services in Corsica Mirabeau was
                    made a captain of dragoons, though not in any particular regiment, and on his
                    return his father endeavoured to make use of the literary ability he had shown
                    for the advancement of his own economical theories. He tried to keep on good
                    terms with his father, though he could not advocate all his ideas, and even went
                    so far in 1772 as to marry a rich heiress, a daughter of the Marquis de
                    Marignane, whose alliance his father had procured for him. He did not live
                    happily with her, and in 1774 was ordered into semi-exile in the country, at his
                    father’s request, where he wrote his earliest extant work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Essai sur le Despotisme.</hi> His violent disposition now led him to quarrel
                    with a country gentleman who had insulted his sister, and his semi-exile was
                    changed by lettre de cachet into imprisonment in the Chateau d’lf. In 1775 he
                    was removed to the castle of Joux, to which, however, he was not very closely
                    confined, having full leave to visit in the town of Pontarlier. Here he met
                    Marie Thérèse de Monnier, his Sophie as he called her, a married woman, for whom
                    he conceived a violent passion. Of his behaviour nothing too strong can be said:
                    he was introduced into the house as a friend, and betrayed his trust by inducing
                    Madame de Monnier to fall in love with him, and all his excuses about
                    overwhelming passion only make his conduct more despicable. The affair ended by
                    his escaping to Switzerland, where Sophie joined him; they then went to Holland,
                    where he lived by hack-work for the booksellers; meanwhile Mirabeau had been
                    condemned to death at Pontarlier for <hi rend="italic">rapt</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">vol,</hi> of which he was certainly not
                    guilty, as Sophie had followed him of her own accord, and in May 1777 he was
                    seized by the French police, and imprisoned by a lettre de cachet in the castle
                    of Vincennes. There he remained three years and a half, and with his release
                    ends the first and most disgraceful period of his life. During his imprisonment
                    he seems to have learnt to control his passions from their very exhaustion, for
                    the early part of his confinement is marked by the indecent letters to Sophie
                    (first published in 1793), and the obscene <hi rend="italic">Erotica
                    Biblion</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ma Conversion,</hi> while to the later months
                    belongs his first political work of any value, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de Cachet.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Essai sur
                    le Despotisme</hi> was an ordinary but at times eloquent declamation, showing in
                    its illustrations a wide miscellaneous knowledge of history, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">de Cachet</hi> exhibits a more
                    accurate knowledge of French constitutional history skilfully applied to an
                    attempt to show that an existing actual grievance was not only philosophically
                    unjust but constitutionally illegal. It shows, though still in rather a diffuse
                    and declamatory form, that application of wide historical knowledge, keen
                    philosophical perception, and genuine eloquence to a practical purpose which was
                    the great characteristic of Mirabeau, both as a political thinker and as a
                    statesman.</p>
                <p>With his release from Vincennes begins the second period of Mirabeau’s life. He
                    found that his Sophie was an idealized version of a rather common and
                    ill-educated woman, and she speedily consoled herself with the affection of a
                    young officer, after whose death she committed suicide. Mirabeau first set to
                    work to get the sentence of death still hanging over him reversed, and by his
                    eloquence not only succeeded but got Μ. de Monnier condemned in the costs of <pb

                    went to Aix, where he claimed the court’s order that his wife should return to
                    him. She naturally objected, but his eloquence would have won his case, even
                    against Portalis, the leader of the Aix bar, had he not in his excitement
                    accused his wife of infidelity, on which the court pronounced a decree of
                    separation. He then with his usual impetuosity intervened in the suit pending
                    between his father and mother before the parlement of Paris, and so violently
                    attacked the ruling powers that he had to leave France and again go to Holland,
                    and try to live by literary work. About this time began his connexion with
                    Madame de Nehra, which sweetened the ensuing years of toil and brought out the
                    better points of his character. She was the daughter of Zwier van Haren, a Dutch
                    statesman and political writer, and was a woman of a far higher type than
                    Sophie, more educated, more refined, and more capable of appreciating Mirabeau’s
                    good points and helping him to control his passions. With her the lion became a
                    lamb, and his life was strengthened by the love of his <hi rend="italic">petite
                    horde,</hi> Madame de Nehra, her baby son, afterwards Lucas de Montigny, and his
                    little dog Chico. After a period of work in Holland he betook himself to
                    England, where his treatise on <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de Cachet</hi> had been much admired, and where he was soon admitted into the
                    best Whig literary and political society of London, through his old schoolfellow
                    Gilbert Elliot, who had now inherited his father’s baronetcy and estates, and
                    become a leading Whig member of parliament. Sir Gilbert introduced him freely,
                    but of all his English friends none seem to have been so intimate with him as
                    Lord Lansdowne, and Mr (afterwards Sir Samuel) Romilly. The latter became
                    particularly attached to him, and really understood his character; and it is
                    strange that his remarks upon Mirabeau in the fragment of autobiography which he
                    left, and Mirabeau’s letters to him, should have been neglected by French
                    writers. Romilly was introduced to Mirabeau by D’lvernois, and readily undertook
                    to translate the <hi rend="italic">Considerations on the Order of</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cincinnatus.</hi> Romilly writes thus of him in his autobiography
                    :—</p>
                <p>“The count was difficult enough to please; he was sufficiently impressed with the
                    beauties of the original. He went over every part of the translation with me,
                    observed on every passage in which justice was not done to the thought or the
                    force of the expression lost, and made many useful criticisms. During this
                    occupation we had occasion to see one another often, and became very intimate;
                    and, as he had read much, had seen a great deal of the world, was acquainted
                    with all the most distinguished persons who at that time adorned either the
                    royal court or the republic of letters in France, had a great knowledge of
                    French and Italian literature, and possessed very good taste, his conversation
                    was extremely interesting and not a little instructive. I had such frequent
                    opportunities of seeing him at this time, and afterwards at a much more
                    important period of his life, that I think his character was well known to me. I
                    doubt whether it has been so well known to the world, and I am convinced that
                    great injustice has been done him. This, indeed, is not surprising, when one
                    considers that, from the first moment of his entering upon the career of an
                    author, he had been altogether indifferent how numerous or how powerful might be
                    the enemies he should provoke. His vanity was certainly excessive; but I have no
                    doubt that, in his public conduct as well as in his writings, he was desirous of
                    doing good, that his ambition was of the noblest kind, and that he proposed to
                    himself the noblest ends. He was, however, like many of his countrymen, who were
                    active in the calamitous Revolution which afterwards took place, not
                    sufficiently scrupulous about the means by which those ends were to be
                    accomplished. He indeed to some degree professed this; and more than once I have
                    heard him say that there were occasions upon which ‘ la petite morale était
                    ennemie de la grande. ’ It is not surprising that with such maxims as these in
                    his mouth, unguarded in his expressions, and careless of his reputation, he
                    should have afforded room for the circulation of many stories to his
                    disadvantage. Violent, impetuous, conscious of the superiority of his talents,
                    and the declared enemy and denouncer of every species of tyranny and oppression,
                    he could not fail to shock the prejudices, to oppose the interests, to excite
                    the jealousy, and to wound the pride of many descriptions of persons. A mode of
                    refuting his works, open to the basest and vilest of mankind, was to represent
                    him as a monster of vice and profligacy. A scandal once set on foot is
                    strengthened and propagated by many, who have no malice against the object of
                    it. They delight to talk of what is extraordinary; and what more extraordinary
                    than a person so admirable for his talents and so contemptible for his conduct,
                    professing in his writings principles so excellent and in all the offices of
                    public and private life putting in practice those which are so detestable? I
                    indeed possessed demonstrative evidence of the falsehood of some of the
                    anecdotes which by men of high character were related to his prejudice.”— <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Sir S. Romilly,</hi> vol. i. p. 58.</p>
                <p>This luminous judgment, the best that is extant on the character of Mirabeau,
                    deserved to be quoted at length; it must be noted that it was written by a man
                    of acknowledged purity of life, who admired Mirabeau in early life, not when he
                    was a statesman, but when he was only a struggling literary man. This close
                    association with Romilly, and his friends Baynes, Trail, and Wilson, does credit
                    to Mirabeau, and must have helped that moral revolution against his passions
                    which was passing within him. He was a warm friend, and first made Romilly
                    acquainted with Lord Lansdowne, and tried to get him a seat in parliament. Lord
                    Lansdowne was himself an extraordinary man, and the first of the new Whigs might
                    well feel sympathy with the statesman of the French Revolution. The <hi

                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Cincinnatus</hi> which Romilly translated
                    was the only important work Mirabeau wrote in the year 1785, and it is a good
                    specimen of his method. He had read a pamphlet published in America attacking
                    the proposed order, which was to form a bond of association between the officers
                    who had fought in the American War of Independence against England; the
                    arguments struck him as true and valuable, so he rearranged them in his own
                    fashion, and rewrote them in his own oratorical style. He soon found such work
                    not sufficiently remunerative to keep his “petite horde” in comfort, and then
                    turned his thoughts to employment from the French foreign office either in
                    writing or in diplomacy. He first sent Madame de Nehra to Paris to make his
                    peace with the authorities, in which she was completely successful, and then
                    returned himself, hoping to get employment through an old literary collaborateur
                    of his, Durival, who was at this time director of the finances of the department
                    of foreign affairs. One of the functions of this official was to subsidize
                    political pamphleteers, and Mirabeau had hoped to be so employed, but he ruined
                    his chances by a series of financial works. On his return to Paris he had bècome
                    acquainted with Clavières, a Genevese exile, who was minister of finance during
                    the Revolution, and who now introduced him to a banker named Panchaud. From them
                    he heard plenty of abuse of stock-jobbing, and seizing their ideas he began to
                    regard stock-jobbing, or agiotage, as the source of all evil, and to attack in
                    his usual vehement style the Banque de St Charles and the Compagnie des Eaux.
                    This was at least disinterested on his part, for, while his supporters were
                    poor, the bankers he attacked were rich, and would gladly have bought his
                    silence; but Mirabeau, though ever ready to take money for what he wrote, never
                    sold his opinions, or wrote what he did not really believe. The very eloquence
                    of his style rests upon the enthusiastic conviction that he himself was right,
                    and those who differed from him were stupidly and wilfully wrong. This last
                    pamphlet brought him into a controversy with Beaumarchais, who certainly did not
                    get the best of it, but it lost him any chance of literary employment from
                    Government. However, his ability was too great to be neglected by a great
                    minister such as Μ. do Vergennes undoubtedly was, and after a preliminary tour
                    in the early spring of 1786 he was despatched in Juno 1786 on a secret mission
                    to the court of Prussia, from which he returned in January 1787, and of which he
                    gavo a full account in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire Secrète de la Cour de
                    Berlin.</hi></p>

                <p>The months he spent at Berlin were important ones in the history of Prussia, for
                    in them Frederick the Great died. The letters just mentioned show clearly what
                    Mirabeau did and what he saw, and equally clearly how unfit he was to be a
                    diplomatist; for, with all his knowledge of men and his influence over them, he
                    thought (and showed he thought) too much of himself ever to be able to surprise
                    their secret thoughts and intentions. He certainly failed to conciliate the new
                    king Frederick William; and thus ended Mirabeau’s one attempt at diplomacy.
                    During his journey he had made the acquaintance of a Major Mauvillon, whom he
                    found possessed of a great number of facts and statistics with regard to
                    Prussia; these he made use of in a great work on Prussia published in 1788, as
                    Romilly says, to show that he could write more than a fugitive pamphlet. But,
                    though his <hi rend="italic">Monarchie</hi><hi rend="italic">Prussienne</hi>
                    gave him a general reputation for historical learning, he had in this same year
                    lost a chance of political employment. He had offered himself as a candidate for
                    the office of secretary to the Assembly of Notables which the king had just
                    convened, and to bring his name before the public published another financial
                    work, the <hi rend="italic">Dénonciation</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    ΓAgiotage,</hi> dedicated to the king and notables, which abounded in such
                    violent diatribes that he not only lost his election, but was obliged to retire
                    to Tongres; and he further injured his prospects by publishing the reports he
                    had sent in during his secret mission at Berlin. But 1789 was at hand; the
                    states-general was summoned; Mirabeau’s period of probation was over, and he was
                    at last to have that opportunity of showing his great qualities both as
                    statesman and orator on a worthy arena.</p>
                <p>On hearing of the king’s determination to summon the states-general, Mirabeau
                    started for Provence, and offered to assist at the preliminary conference of the
                    noblesse of his district. They rejected him; he appealed to the <hi
                    rend="italic">tiers</hi><hi rend="italic">état,</hi> and was returned both for
                    Aix and for Marseilles. He elected to sit for the former city, and was present
                    at the opening of the states-general on May 4, 1789. From this time the record
                    of Mirabeau’s life forms the best history of the first two years of the
                    Constituent Assembly, for at every important crisis his voice is to be heard,
                    though his advice was not always followed. It is impossible here to detail
                    minutely the history of these two eventful years; it will be rather advisable to
                    try and analyse the manner in which Mirabeau regarded passing events, and then
                    show how his policy justifies our analysis.</p>
                <p>Mirabeau possessed at the same time great logical acuteness and most passionate
                    enthusiasm; he was therefore both a statesman and an orator, and the interest of
                    the last two years of his life lies mainly in the gradual but decided victory of
                    the statesmanlike and practical over the impulsive and oratorical qualities.
                    From the beginning Mirabeau recognized that government exists in order that the
                    bulk of the population may pursue their daily work in peace and quiet, and that
                    for a Government to be successful it must be strong. In this practical view of
                    the need of a strong executive lies one of Mirabeau’s greatest titles to the
                    name of statesman. At the same time he thoroughly comprehended that for a
                    Government to be strong it must be in harmony with the wishes of the majority of
                    the people, and that the political system of Louis XIV. was now falling for lack
                    of this. He had carefully studied the English constitution in England under the
                    guidance of such men as Lord Lansdowne, Sir Gilbert Elliot, and Romilly, and
                    appreciated it with the wise approval of its powers of expansion which
                    characterized the new Whigs, and not with the blind admiration of Burke. He
                    understood the keynotes of the practical success of the English constitution to
                    be the irresponsibility of the king, the solidarity of the ministers, and the
                    selettion of the executive from among the majority of the representatives of the
                    country; and he hoped to establish in France a system similar in principle, but
                    without any slavish imitation of the details of the English constitution.</p>
                <p>In the first stage of the history of the states-general Mirabeau’s part was very
                    great. He was soon recognized as a leader, to the chagrin of Mounier, because he
                    always knew his own mind, and was prompt at emergencies. To him is to be
                    attributed the successful consolidation of the National Assembly, its
                    continuance in spite of De Brezé and the carpenters, and the address to the king
                    for the withdrawal of the troops assembled by De Broglie. When the taking of the
                    Bastille had assured the success of the Revolution, he was the one man who
                    warned the Assembly of the futility of passing fine-sounding decrees and the
                    necessity for acting. He declared that the famous night of August 4 was but an
                    orgy, giving the people an immense theoretical liberty while not assisting them
                    to practical freedom, and overthrowing the old régime before a new one could be
                    constituted. Still more did he show his foresight when he attacked the dilatory
                    behaviour of the Assembly, which led to the catastrophes of the 5th and 6th
                    October. He implored the Assembly to strike while the iron was hot, and at once
                    solve in a practical manner the difficult problems presented by the abolition of
                    feudalism. But the Assembly consisted of men inexperienced in practical
                    politics, who dreamed of drawing up an ideal constitution preluded by a
                    declaration of rights in imitation of the Americans; and for two months the
                    Assembly discussed in what words the declaration should be expressed, while the
                    country was in a state of anarchy, declaring old laws and customs abolished and
                    having no new ones to obey or follow, disowning the old administrative system
                    and having no new one yet instituted, while Paris was starving and turbulent,
                    and the queen and her friends planning a counter-revolution. The result of these
                    two months’ theorizing was the march of the women to Versailles, and the
                    transfer of the king to Paris. Mirabeau now saw clearly that his eloquence would
                    not enable him to guide the Assembly by himself, and that he must therefore try
                    to get some support. He wished to establish a strong ministry, which should be
                    responsible like an English ministry, but to an assembly chosen to represent the
                    people of France better than the English House of Commons then represented
                    England. He first thought of becoming a minister at a very early date, if we may
                    believe a story contained in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of the Duchesse
                    d’Abrantes, to the effect that in May 1789 the queen tried to bribe him, but
                    that he refused to be bribed to silence, and expressed his wish to be a
                    minister. The indignation with which the queen repelled the idea may have been
                    the cause of his thinking of the Due d’Orleans as a possible constitutional
                    king, because his title would of necessity be parliamentary. But the weakness of
                    Orleans was too palpable, and in a famous remark Mirabeau expressed his utter
                    contempt for him. He also attempted to form an alliance with Lafayette, but the
                    general was as vain and as obstinate as Mirabeau himself, and had his own
                    theories about a new French constitution. Mirabeau tried for a time, too, to act
                    with Necker, and obtained the sanction of the Assembly to Necker’s financial
                    scheme, not because it was good, but because, as he said, “no other plan was
                    before them, and something must be done.”</p>
                <p>Hitherto weight has been laid on the practical side of Mirabeau’s political
                    genius; his ideas with regard to the Revolution after the 5th and 6th October
                    must now be examined, and this can be done at length, thanks to the publication
                    of Mirabeau’s correspondence with La Marek, a study of which is indispensable
                    for any correct knowledge of the history of the Revolution between 1789 and
                    1791.</p>

                <p>The Comte de la Marek was a Flemish lord of the house of Aremberg, who had been
                    proprietary colonel of a regiment in the service of France; he was a close
                    friend of the queen, and had been elected a member of the states-general. His
                    acquaintance with Mirabeau, commenced in 1788, ripened during the following year
                    into a friendship, which La Marek hoped to turn to the advantage of the court.
                    After the events of the 5th and 6th of October he consulted Mirabeau as to what
                    measures the king ought to take, and Mirabeau, delighted at the opportunity,
                    drew up an admirable state-paper, which was presented to the king by Monsieur,
                    afterwards Louis XVIII. The whole of this <hi rend="italic">Mémoire</hi> should
                    be read to get an adequate idea of Mirabeau’s genius for politics; here it must
                    be merely summarized.</p>
                <p>The main position is that the king is not free in Paris; he must therefore leave
                    Paris and appeal to France. “Paris n’en veut que l’argent; les provinces
                    demandent des lois.” But where must the king go? “Se retirer à Metz ou sur toute
                    autre frontière serait déclarer la guerre à la nation et abdiquer le trône. Un
                    roi qui est la seule sauvegarde de son peuple ne fuit point devant son peuple;
                    il le prend pour juge de sa conduite et de ses principes.” He must then go
                    towards the interior of France to a provincial capital, best of all to Rouen,
                    and there he must appeal to the people and summon a great convention. It would
                    be ruin to appeal to the noblesse, as the queen advised: “un corps de noblesse
                    n’est point une armée, qui puisse combattre.” When this great convention met,
                    the king must show himself ready to recognize that great changes have taken
                    place, that feudalism and absolutism have for ever disappeared, and that a new
                    relation between king and people has arisen, which must be loyally observed on
                    both sides for the future. “Il est certain, d’ailleurs, qu’il faut une grande
                    révolution pour sauver le royaume, que la nation a des droits, qu’elle est en
                    chemin de les recouvrer tous, et qu’il faut non seulement les rétablir, mais les
                    consolider.” To establish this new constitutional position between king and
                    people would not be difficult, because “l’indivisibilité du monarque et du
                    peuple est dans le coeur de tous les Français; il faut qu’elle existe dans
                    l’action et le pouvoir.”</p>
                <p>Such was Mirabeau’s programme, which he never diverged from, but which was far
                    too statesmanlike to be understood by the poor king, and far too positive as to
                    the altered condition of the monarchy to be palatable to the queen. Mirabeau
                    followed up his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire</hi> by a scheme of a great ministry
                    to contain all men of mark,—Necker as prime minister, “to render him as
                    powerless as he is incapable, and yet preserve his popularity for the king,” the
                    archbishop of Bordeaux, the Duc de Liancourt, the Due de la Rochefoucauld, La
                    Marek, Talleyrand bishop of Autun at the finances, Mirabeau without portfolio,
                    Target mayor of Paris, Lafayette generalissimo to reform the army, Ségur
                    (foreign affairs), Mounier, and Chapelier. This scheme got noised abroad, and
                    was ruined by a decree of the Assembly of November 7, 1789, that no member of
                    the Assembly could become a minister; this decree destroyed any chance of that
                    necessary harmony between the ministry and the majority of the representatives
                    of the nation existing in England, and so at once overthrew Mirabeau’s present
                    hopes and any chance of the permanence of the constitution then being devised.
                    The queen utterly refused to take Mirabeau’s counsel, and La Marek left Paris.
                    However, in April 1790 he was suddenly recalled by the Comte de Mercy-Argenteau,
                    the Austrian ambassador at Paris, and the queen’s most trusted political
                    adviser, and from this time to Mirabeau’s death he became the medium of almost
                    daily communications between the latter and the queen. Mirabeau at first
                    attempted again to make an alliance with Lafayette by a letter in which he says,
                    “Les Barnave, les Duport, les Lameth ne vous fatiguent plus de leur active
                    inaction; on singe longtemps l’adresse, non pas la force.” But it was useless to
                    appeal to Lafayette; he was not a strong man himself, and did not appreciate “la
                    force” in others. From the month of May 1790 to his death in April 1791 Mirabeau
                    remained in close and suspected but not actually proved connexion with the
                    court, and drew up many admirable state-papers for it. In return the court paid
                    his debts; but it ought never to be said that he was bribed, for the gold of the
                    court never made him swerve from his political principles—never, for instance,
                    made him a royalist. He regarded himself as a minister, though an unavowed one,
                    and believed himself worthy of his hire. Undoubtedly his character would have
                    been more admirable if he had acted without court assistance, but it must be
                    remembered that his services deserved some reward, and that by remaining at
                    Paris as a politician he had been unable to realize his paternal inheritance.
                    Before his influence on foreign policy is discussed, his behaviour on several
                    important points must be noticed. On the great question of the veto he took a
                    practical view, and seeing that the royal power was already sufficiently
                    weakened, declared for the king’s absolute veto, and against the compromise of
                    the suspensive veto. He knew from his English experiences that such a veto would
                    be hardly ever used unless the king felt the people were on his side, in which
                    case it would be a useful check on the representatives of the people, and also
                    that if it was used unjustifiably the power of the purse possessed by the
                    representatives and the very constitutional organization of the people would, as
                    in England in 1688, bring about a bloodless revolution, and a change in the
                    person entrusted with the royal dignity. He saw also that much of the
                    inefficiency of the Assembly arose from the inexperience of the members, and
                    their incurable verbosity; so, to establish some system of rules, he got his
                    friend Romilly to draw up a detailed account of the rules and customs of the
                    English House of Commons, which he translated into French, but which the
                    Assembly, puffed up by a belief in its own merits, refused to use. On the great
                    subject of peace and war he supported the king’s authority, and with some
                    success. What was the good of an executive which had no power? Let it be
                    responsible to the representatives of the nation by all means; but if the
                    representatives absorbed all executive power by perpetual interference, there
                    would be six hundred kings of France instead of one, which would hardly be a
                    change for the better. Again Mirabeau almost alone of the Assembly understood
                    the position of the army under a limited monarchy. Contrary to the theorists, he
                    held that the soldier ceased to be a citizen when he became a soldier; he must
                    submit to be deprived of his liberty to think and act, and must recognize that a
                    soldier’s first duty is obedience. With such sentiments, it is no wonder that he
                    approved of Bouillé’s vigorous conduct at Nancy, which was the more to his
                    credit as Bouille was the one hope of the court influences opposed to him.
                    Lastly, in matters of finance he showed his wisdom: he attacked Necker’s “caisse
                    d’escompte,” which was to have the whole control of the taxes, as absorbing the
                    Assembly’s power of the purse; and he heartily approved of the system of
                    assignats, but with the important reservation that they should not be issued to
                    the extent of more than one-half the value of the lands to be sold. This
                    restriction was not observed, and it was solely the enormous over-issue of
                    assignats that caused their great depreciation in value.</p>
                <p>Of Mirabeau’s attitude with regard to foreign affairs it is necessary to speak in
                    more detail. He held it to be just that the French people should conduct their
                    Revolution as they would, and that no foreign nation had any right to interfere
                    with them, so long as they kept themselves strictly to their own affairs. But he
                    knew also that neighbouring nations looked with unquiet eyes on the progress of
                    affairs in France, that they feared the influence of the Revolution on their own
                    peoples, and that foreign monarchs were being prayed by the French émigrés to
                    interfere on behalf of the French monarchy. To prevent this interference, or
                    rather to give no pretext for it, was his guiding thought as <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n518/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0518-0497"/> to foreign policy. He had been elected a member
                    of the comité diplomatique of the Assembly in July 1790, and became its reporter
                    at once, and in this capacity he was able to prevent the Assembly from doing
                    much harm in regard to foreign affairs. He had long known Montmorin, the foreign
                    secretary, and, as matters became more strained from the complications with the
                    princes and counts of the empire, he entered into daily communication with the
                    minister, advised him on every point, and, while dictating his policy, defended
                    it in the Assembly. Thus in this particular instance of the foreign office, for
                    the few months before Mirabeau’s death, a harmony was established between the
                    minister and the Assembly through Mirabeau, which checked for a time the
                    threatened approach of foreign intervention, and maintained the honour of France
                    abroad. Mirabeau’s exertions in this respect are not his smallest title to the
                    name of statesman; and how great a work he did is best proved by the confusion
                    which ensued in this department of affairs upon his death.</p>
                <p>For indeed in the beginning of 1791 his death was very near; and he knew it to be
                    so. The wild excesses of his youth and their terrible punishment had weakened
                    his strong constitution, and his parliamentary labours completed the work. So
                    surely did he feel its approach that some time before the end he sent all his
                    papers over to his old English friend and schoolfellow Sir Gilbert Elliot, who
                    kept them under seal until claimed by Mirabeau’s executors. In March his illness
                    was evidently gaining on him, to his great grief, because he knew how much
                    depended on his Efe, and felt that he alone could yet save France from the
                    distrust of her monarch and the present reforms, and from the foreign
                    interference, which would assuredly bring about catastrophes unparalleled in the
                    history of the world. On his life hung the future course of the Revolution.
                    Every care that science could afford was given by his friend and physician, the
                    famous chemist Cabanis, to whose brochure on his last illness and death the
                    reader may refer. The people, whose faith in him revived in spite of all
                    suspicions, when they heard that he was on his death-bed, kept the street in
                    which he lay quiet; but medical care, the loving solicitude of friends, and the
                    respect of all the people could not save his life. His vanity appears in its
                    most gigantic proportions in his last utterances during his illness; but many of
                    them have something grand in their sound, as his last reported expression, when
                    he looked upon the sun—“If he is not God, he is at least His cousin-german.”
                    When he could speak no more he wrote with a feeble hand the one word “dormir,”
                    and on April 2, 1791, he died.</p>
                <p>With Mirabeau died, it has been said, the last hope of the monarchy; but, with
                    Marie Antoinette supreme at court, canit be said that there could ever have been
                    any real hope for the monarchy? Had she been but less like her imperious mother,
                    Louis would have made a constitutional monarch, but her will was as strong as
                    Mirabeau’s own, and the Bourbon monarchy had to meet its fate. The subsequent
                    events of the Revolution justified Mirabeau’s prognostications in his first
                    mémoire of October 15, 1789. The royal family fled towards the German frontier,
                    and from that moment there sunk deep into the hearts of the people not only of
                    Paris, but of the provinces, a conviction that the king and queen were traitors
                    to France, which led inevitably to their execution. The noblesse and the foreign
                    aid on which the queen relied proved but a source of weakness. The noblesse,
                    Mirabeau had said, was no army which could fight; and truly the army of the
                    emigres could do nothing against revolutionary France in arms. The intervention
                    of foreign aid only sealed the king’s fate, and forwarded the progress of the
                    Revolution, not in a course of natural development, but to the terrible resource
                    of the Reign of Terror. With regard to the Assembly too, and its constitution,
                    Mirabeau had shown his foresight. The constitution of 1791, excellent as it was
                    on paper, and well adapted to an ideal state, did not deal adequately with the
                    great problems of the time in France, and by its ridiculous weakening of the
                    executive was unsuited to a modern state. Surely if events ever proved a man’s
                    political sagacity, the history of the French Revolution proved Mirabeau’s.</p>
                <p>A few words must be added on Mirabeau’s manner of work and his character.</p>
                <p>No man ever so thoroughly used other men’s work, and yet made it all seem his
                    own. “Je prends mon bien où je le trouve ’’ is as true of him as of Molière. His
                    first literary work, except the bombastic but eloquent <hi rend="italic">Essai
                    sur le Despotisme,</hi> was a translation of Watson’s <hi rend="italic">Philip
                    II.,</hi> accomplished in Holland with the help of Durival; his <hi
                    rend="italic">Considérations sur l'ordre</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cincinnatus</hi> was based on an American pamphlet, and the notes
                    to it were contributed by Target; while his financial writings were all
                    suggested by the Genevese exile Clavières. During the Revolution he received yet
                    more help; men were proud to labour for him, and did not murmur because he
                    absorbed all the credit and fame. Dumont, Clavières, Duroveray, Pellene,
                    Lamourette, and Reybaz were but a few of the most distinguished of his
                    collaborators. Dumont was a Genevese exile, and an old friend of Romilly’s, who
                    willingly prepared for him those famous addresses which Mirabeau used to make
                    the Assembly pass by sudden bursts of eloquent declamation; Clavières and
                    Duroveray helped him in finance, and not only worked out his figures, but even
                    wrote his financial discourses. Pellene was his secretary, and wrote the
                    speeches on the goods of the clergy and the right of making peace, and even the
                    Abbé Lamourette wrote the speeches on the civil constitution of the clergy.
                    Reybaz, whose personality has only been revealed within these last ten years,
                    not only wrote for him his famous speeches on the assignats, the organization of
                    the national guard, &amp;c., which Mirabeau read word for word at the tribune,
                    but even the posthumous speech on succession to estates of intestates, which
                    Talleyrand read in the Assembly as the last work of his dead friend. Yet neither
                    the gold of the court nor another man’s conviction would make Mirabeau say what
                    he did not himself believe, or do what he did not himself think right. He took
                    other men’s labour as his due, and impressed their words, of which he had
                    suggested the underlying ideas, with the stamp of his own individuality; his
                    collaborators themselves did not complain,—they were but too glad to be of help
                    in the great work of controlling and forwarding the French Revolution through
                    its greatest thinker and orator. True is that remark of Goethe’s to Eckermann,
                    after reading Dumont’s <hi rend="italic">Souvenirs:</hi> “At last the wonderful
                    Mirabeau becomes natural to us, while at the same time the hero loses nothing of
                    his greatness. Some French journalists think differently The French look upon
                    Mirabeau as their</p>
                <p>Hercules, and they are perfectly right. But they forget that even the Colossus
                    consists of individual parts, and that the Hercules of antiquity is a collective
                    being—a gigantic personification of deeds done by himself and by others.”</p>
                <p>There was something gigantic about all Mirabeau’s thoughts and deeds. The
                    excesses of his youth were beyond all bounds, and severely were they punished;
                    his vanity was immense, but never spoilt his judgment; his talents were
                    enormous, but could yet make use of those of others. As a statesman his wisdom
                    is indubitable, but by no means universally recognized in his own country.
                    Lovers of the <hi rend="italic">ancien régime</hi> abuse its most formidable and
                    logical opponent; believers in the Constituent Assembly cannot be expected to
                    care for the most redoubtable adversary of their favourite theorists, while
                    admirers of the republic of every description agree in calling him from his
                    connexion with the court the traitor Mirabeau. As an orator more justice has
                    been done him: his eloquence has been likened to that of both Bossuet and
                    Vergniaud, but it had neither the polish of the old 17th-century bishop nor the
                    flashes of genius of the young Girondin. It was rather parliamentary oratory in
                    which he excelled, and his true compeers are rather Burke and Fox than any
                    French speakers. Personally he had that which is the truest mark of nobility of
                    mind, a power of attracting love, and winning faithful friends. “I always loved
                    him,” writes Sir Gilbert Elliot to his brother Hugh; and Romilly, who was not
                    given to lavish praise, says, “I have no doubt that in his public conduct, as in
                    his writings, he was desirous of doing good, that his ambition was of the
                    noblest kind, and that he proposed to himself the noblest ends.” What more
                    favourable judgment could be passed on an ambitious man! What finer epitaph
                    could a statesman desire!</p>
