                    miles north of its southern end, 80 miles north of Chicago, and 1000 miles
                    north-west of New York by rail, in 43° 3 ’ N. lat., 87° 56' W. long. (44 min. W.
                    of Washington). The shore of the lake is 600 feet above the level of the
                    sea.</p>
                <p>The Milwaukee and Menomonee rivers unite in the centre of the business portion of
                    the city, about half a mile from their entrance to Lake Michigan, where they are
                    joined by a third and smaller stream—the Kinnikinnic. A bay 6 miles from cape to
                    cape, and 3 miles broad, stretches in front of the city, which commands a fine
                    water view, the ground rising along the shore 80 feet above the level of the
                    lake, then gradually sloping westward to the Milwaukee river, and again rising
                    on the west and north to a height of 125 feet. The ground also rises to a
                    commanding elevation south of the valley of the Menomonee. Few cities present so
                    many natural attractions of site, as indeed its Indian name indicates (“the
                    beautiful hollow or bay ”); and art has added to nature. In the residence parts
                    of the city there are miles of avenues from 70 to 100 feet wide, lined on both
                    sides with elms and maples, behind which stand handsome houses with spacious
                    lawns, fountains, and evergreens, giving the appearance of a continuous park.
                    The material used for building is largely the cream-coloured brick made in the
                    vicinity, from which Milwaukee is sometimes called the “Cream City.” The
                    climate, tempered by the great lake, is remarkably pleasant and healthy. The
                    mean temperature, as shown by the records of twenty years, is 46° <hi

                    last nine years the average deathrate has been but 20 per 1000, showing it tobe
                    one of the healthiest of American cities. Besides a full complement of the usual
                    religious and charitable institutions, there is adjoining the city the national
                    home for disabled United States volunteer soldiers, consisting of several
                    buildings situated in grounds of 400 acres extent, which serve the purpose of a
                    city park. There are numerous lodges belonging to the freemasons and other
                    guilds; and the Turners’ societies, which embrace a large membership and own
                    some valuable buildings, have done much to create and keep up the practice of
                    athletic exercises among the citizens. Two excellent musical societies are also
                    established here.</p>
                <p>Before the year 1835 Milwaukee was known only as an Indian trading-post occupied
                    by a Frenchman named Solomon Juneau, who is generally spoken of as the founder
                    of the city. The total inhabitants in 1838 numbered only 700; in 1840 there were
                    1712; but in 1846 the population amounted to 9666, in 1850 to 20,061, in 1855 to
                    30,118, in 1860 to 45,246, in 1870 to 71,440, and in 1880 to 115,578 (57,475
                    males, 58,103 females). In 1882 the population was estimated at 130,000,—more
                    than one half of them of foreign parentage, a very large majority being Germans.
                    Notwithstanding the multitude of nationalities represented in the population,
                    there are few cities more orderly and law-abiding, the number of police employed
                    being less than one for every 1500 inhabitants. Another feature worthy of
                    mention is the large proportion of families who own their own houses, and this
                    is true not only as to the mercantile and professional classes, but especially
                    as to the labouring population. Although the grain trade, formerly very large
                    here, has now greatly diminished, the growth and prosperity of the city have not
                    materially suffered, owing to the development of manufacturing industries, for
                    which the low rents, healthy climate, and advantageous location make it well
                    adapted. About a sixth of the population are engaged in the manufacture of
                    clothing, cigars, cooperage, leather, bricks, sashes, doors, and blinds,
                    machinery, and flour (of which one million of barrels are annually made), and in
                    meat-packing. Milwaukee has become famous for its “lager beer,” of which there
                    are one million of barrels annually produced, valued at $8,000,000. The lake
                    commerce is very large. The tonnage entered and cleared in 1880 was 5,322,373
                    tons, being about as large as that of Baltimore, Boston, or Philadelphia. The
                    Wisconsin Central, the Milwaukee and Lake Shore, the Milwaukee and Northern, and
                    the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St Paul Railways have their head offices here, and
                    the last-named, owning 4000 miles of lines, has immense workshops in the
                    Menomonee valley near the city.</p>
                <p>Milwaukee is governed by a mayor and a common council of thirty-nine aidermen.
                    The streets and public buildings are under the charge of the board of public
                    works, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n358/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0358-0341"/> composed of three commissioners and the city
                    engineer, all subject to the common council. A bountiful supply of water is
                    obtained from the lake, and the streets are well supplied with sewers. The value
                    of property as assessed for taxation was $62,000,000 in 1882,—the city debt
                    being $2,500,000, mostly for the water-works, which are city property.</p>
                <p>There is an efficient system of public schools under a superintendent and board
                    of school commissioners, the value of the buildings with their sites being
                    estimated at $700,000. For the higher education there are a high school, a
                    normal school, and three commercial colleges, while the Roman Catholics and
                    Lutherans have several excellent denominational seminaries and colleges. A
                    public library belonging to the city contained 20,000 volumes in 1882. (j.
