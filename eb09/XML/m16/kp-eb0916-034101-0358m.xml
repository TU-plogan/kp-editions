                <p><label type="entry">MIMICRY</label> is the name given in biology to the
                    advantageous resemblance (usually protective) which one species of animal or
                    plant often shows to another. The word was first applied in this metaphorical
                    sense by Mr W. H. Bates, and it has since been accurately defined and limited,
                    in its biological application, by Mr A. R. Wallace. Briefly put, the essence of
                    the phenomenon of mimicry consists in the following relation. A certain species
                    of plant or animal possesses some special means of defence from its enemies,
                    such as a sting, a powerful and disagreeable odour, a nauseous taste, or a hard
                    integument. Some other species inhabiting the same district or a part of it, and
                    not itself provided with the same special means of defence, closely resembles
                    the first species in all external points of form and colour, though often very
                    different in structure and unrelated in the biological order. For example, a
                    South-American family of butterflies, the <hi rend="italic">Hdiconi,dx,</hi> are
                    distinguished by their very varied and beautiful colours, and their slow and
                    weakly flight; they might easily be captured by insectivorous birds, but their
                    remains are never found on the ground amongst the rejected wings of other
                    butterflies which cover the soil in many places. They also possess a strong
                    pungent odour, which clings to the fingers for many days; and this fact led Mr
                    Wallace to suspect that they have a disagreeable taste, and would not therefore
                    be eaten by birds after a single trial. Mr Belt has since experimentally proved
                    the truth of that belief. But among the totally distinct family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pieridae,</hi> most of which are white, there is a genus of small
                    butterflies, known as <hi rend="italic">Leptalis,</hi> edible by birds, some
                    species of which are white like their allies, while the greater number exactly
                    resemble one or other of the <hi rend="italic">Heliconidεe</hi> in the peculiar
                    shape and colouring of their wings. As regards structure, the two families are
                    widely different; yet the resemblance of a species of one family to a species of
                    the other is often so close that Mr Bates and Mr Wallace, experienced
                    entomologists, frequently mistook them for one another at the time of capture,
                    and only discovered their mistake upon nearer examination. Mr Bates observed
                    several species or varieties of <hi rend="italic">Leptalis</hi> in the Amazons
                    valley, each of which more or less exactly copied one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Heliconidae</hi> in its own district. Accordingly, they seem to be mistaken by
                    birds for the uneatable insects they mimic, and so to be benefited by their
                    resemblance. This, which may perhaps be regarded as the most typical instance of
                    true mimicry, is also the first to which the word was applied.</p>
                <p>In considering the phenomena under review, it may be well to give first the chief
                    observed facts, which are quite independent of any particular explanation, and
                    then the theory which has been started to account for them by Mr Bates and Mr
                    Wallace. Before doing so, however, true mimicry should be carefully
                    discriminated from one or two superficially similar modes of resemblance among
                    organic beings, whose real implications are very different.</p>
                <p>It must not be confused with mere accidental or adaptive resemblance, due either
                    to simple chance or to similarity of external conditions. As a case of the first
                    sort, we may adduce the real or fancied resemblance between certain orchids and
                    flies or spiders; as a case of the second sort, we may take certain African <hi
                    rend="italic">Euphorbiaceae,</hi> which, growing in dry deserts, have acquired a
                    very close likeness to the cactuses that cover the equally dry deserts of
                    Mexico; or again the sub-Antarctic gallinaceous bird, <hi rend="italic">Chionis
                    alba,</hi> which, living on the sea-shore, has acquired a coloration like that
                    of the gulls, together with the legs of a wader. These resemblances, however, do
                    not as such subserve any function. The species apparently mimicking and the
                    species apparently mimicked either do not inhabit the same district or do not
                    come into any definite relation with one another. The likeness is either
                    accidental, or else it is due to similar adaptation to similar circumstances. In
                    cases of true mimicry, on the other hand, the mimicking species derives a direct
                    advantage from its likeness to the species mimicked; the resemblance is
                    deceptive; and this is equally true whether we suppose the mimicry to be
                    produced by creative design or by natural selection. On either hypothesis,
                    however it came by its likeness, the mimicking species escapes certain enemies
                    or obtains certain sorts of food by virtue of its resemblance to some other
                    kind.</p>
                <p>It should also be added that the word mimicry, as applied to such cases, is used
                    only in a metaphorical sense. It is not intended to imply any conscious or
                    voluntary imitation by one species of the appearance or habits of another. All
                    that is meant is the fact of an advantageous resemblance, a delusive similarity,
                    which gives the mimicking animal or plant some extra protection or some special
                    means of acquiring food which it would not otherwise have possessed but for its
                    likeness to the creature mimicked.</p>
                <p>Taking animals first, mimicry does not occur very frequently among the higher
                    classes. In the vertebrates it is comparatively rare, and among mammals probably
                    only one good case has yet been adduced. This is that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cladobates,</hi> an insectivorous genus of the Malayan region, many species of
                    which closely resemble squirrels in size, in colour, and in the bushiness and
                    posture of the tail. It has been suggested by Mr Wallace (from whom most of the
                    following examples have been borrowed) that <hi rend="italic">Cladobates</hi>
                    may thus be enabled to approach the insects and small birds which form its prey
                    under the disguise of the harmless fruit-eating squirrel. In this case, as in
                    some others, the resemblance is not protective, but is apparently useful to the
                    animal in the quest for food.</p>
                <p>Among birds, Mr Wallace has pointed out that the general likeness of the cuckoo,
                    a weak and defenceless group, to the hawks and gallinaceous tribe makes some
                    approach to real mimicry. But besides such vague resemblances there are one or
                    two very distinct cases of true mimicry in this class of vertebrates. In
                    Australia and the Moluccas lives a genus of dull-hued honey-suckers, <hi
                    rend="italic">Tropidorhynclιus,</hi> consisting of large, strong, active birds,
                    with powerful claws and sharp beaks. They gather together in noisy flocks, and
                    are very pugnacious, driving away crows and even hawks. In the same countries
                    lives a group of orioles, forming the genus <hi rend="italic">Mimeta;</hi> and
                    these, which are much weaker birds, have not the usual brilliant colouring of
                    their allies the golden orioles, but are usually olive-green or brown. In many
                    cases species of <hi rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> closely resemble the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tropidoτhynclιi</hi> inhabiting the same island. For example, on
                    the island of Bouru are found the <hi rend="italic">Tτopidorhynchus
                    bouruensis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mimeta bouruensis,</hi> the latter of
                    which mimics the former in the particulars thus noted by Mr Wallace :—“The upper
                    and under surfaces of the two birds are exactly of the same tints of dark and
                    light brown. The <hi rend="italic">Tτopidorhynchus</hi> ha⅛ a large <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n359/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0359-0342"/> bare black patch round the eyes; this is copied
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> by a patch of black feathers. The top of
                    the head of the <hi rend="italic">Tropidorhynchus</hi> has a scaly appearance
                    from the narrow scale-formed feathers, which are imitated by the broader
                    feathers of the <hi rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> having a dusky line down each. The
                    <hi rend="italic">Tropidorhynchus</hi> has a pale ruff formed of curious
                    recurved feathers on the nape (which has given the whole genus the name of
                    friar-birds); this is represented in the <hi rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> by a pale
                    band in the same position. Lastly, the bill of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tropidorhynchus</hi> is raised into a protuberant keel at the base, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> has the same character, although it is not a common
                    one in the genus. The result is that on a superficial examination the birds are
                    identical, although they have important structural differences, and cannot be
                    placed near each other in any natural arrangement.” Allied species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Tropidorhynchus</hi> in Ceram and Timor are similarly mimicked by
                    the local <hi rend="italic">Mimeta</hi> of each island. Mr Osbert Salvin has
                    likewise noticed a case of mimicry among the birds of prey near Rio Janeiro. An
                    insect-eating hawk, <hi rend="italic">Harpagus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >diodon,</hi> is closely resembled by a bird-eating haλvk, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Accipiter pileatus.</hi> Here the advantage seems to be that the small birds
                    have learned not to fear the <hi rend="italic">Harpagus,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Accipiter</hi> is able to trade upon the resemblance by catching
                    them unawares, both birds being reddish-brown when seen from beneath. But the
                    <hi rend="italic">Accipiter</hi> has the wider range of the two; and where the
                    insect-eating species is not found it no longer resembles it, but varies in the
                    under wing-coverts to white. Here again the resemblance, though advantageous, is
                    not protective.</p>
                <p>Among reptiles, Mr Wallace has instanced some curious cases where a venomous
                    tropical American genus of snakes, <hi rend="italic">Elaps,</hi> with
                    brightly-banded colours, is closely mimicked by several genera of harmless
                    snakes, having no affinity with it, but inhabiting the same region. Thus the
                    poisonous <hi rend="italic">Elaps</hi><hi rend="italic">fulvus</hi> of Guatemala
                    has black bands on a coral-red ground; the harmless <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pliocerus</hi><hi rend="italic">aequalis</hi> of the same district is coloured
                    and banded precisely like it. The likeness affords the unarmed snakes a great
                    protection, because other animals probably will not touch them, mistaking them
                    for the venomous kinds.</p>
                <p>It is among the invertebrates, however, and especially among insects, that cases
                    of mimicry are most frequent and were first observed. In the order <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera,</hi> besides the classical instance of <hi
                    rend="italic">Leptalis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Heliconidae,</hi> a genus
                    of another family, the <hi rend="italic">Erycinidee,</hi> also mimics the same
                    group. The flocks of one species of <hi rend="italic">Lthomia,</hi> an uneatable
                    butterfly, often have flying with them a few individuals of three other widely
                    different genera, quite indistinguishable from them when on the wing. In the
                    tropics of the Old World, the <hi rend="italic">Danaidae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">A craeidae</hi> possess a similar protective odour, and are
                    equally abundant in individuals; they are closely mimicked by various species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Diadema.</hi> Mr Trimen, in
                    a paper on “Mimetic Analogies among African Butterflies,” gives a list of
                    sixteen species or varieties of <hi rend="italic">Diadema</hi> or its allies,
                    and ten species of <hi rend="italic">Papilio,</hi> each of which mimics a <hi
                    rend="italic">Danais</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Acraea</hi> of the same region in
                    the minutest particulars of form and colour. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Danais</hi><hi rend="italic">tytia</hi> of India has semi-transparent bluish
                    wings, and a border of reddish-brown; this coloration is exactly reproduced in
                    <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">agestor</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Diadema</hi><hi rend="italic">nama,</hi> all three insects
                    frequently coming together in collections from Darjiling. In the Malay
                    Archipelago the common and beautiful <hi rend="italic">Euplaea</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">midamus</hi> is so exactly mimicked by two rare species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Papilio</hi> that Mr Wallace generally mistook the latter at first
                    for the ordinary insect. An immense number of other instances among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> have been quoted from other parts of the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Occasionally species of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> also imitate insects
                    of other orders. Many of them take on the appearance of bees or wasps, which are
                    of course protected by their stings. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Sesiidae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Aegeriidae,</hi> two families of diurnal moths, have
                    species so like hymenopterous insects that they are known by such names as <hi
                    rend="italic">apiformis, vespiforme, ichneumoniforme, sphegiforme,</hi> and so
                    forth. The British <hi rend="italic">sesia bombiliformis</hi> closely resembles
                    the humble bee; the <hi rend="italic">Sphecia craboniformis</hi> is coloured
                    like a hornet, and carries its wings in the same fashion. Some Indian <hi
                    rend="italic">Lepidoptera</hi> have the hind legs broad and densely hairy, so as
                    exactly to imitate the brush-legged bees of the same country. Mi-Belt mentions a
                    Nicaraguan moth, <hi rend="italic">Pionia lycoides,</hi> which closely mimics a
                    distasteful coleopterous genus, <hi rend="italic">Calopteron∙,</hi> and
                    Professor Westwood pointed out that the resemblance to the beetle is still
                    further increased in the moth by raised lines of scales running lengthwise down
                    the thorax.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> or beetles, and other orders,
                    similar disguises are not uncommon. Mr Belt noticed species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hemiptera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> as well as spiders, in
                    Nicaragua, which exactly resemble stinging ants, and thus no doubt escape the
                    attacks of birds. The genus <hi rend="italic">Caloρteron</hi> is mimicked by
                    other beetles, as well as by the moth <hi rend="italic">Pionia.</hi> In the same
                    country, one of the <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Spiniger</hi><hi rend="italic">luteicomis,</hi> has every part coloured like
                    the hornet, <hi rend="italic">Priocnemis,</hi> which it mimics; “in its
                    vibrating coloured wing-cases it departs greatly from the normal character of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Hemiptera,</hi> and assumes that of the hornets.” Mr
                    Wallace mentions the longicorn beetle, <hi rend="italic">Cyclopeplus
                    batesii,</hi> which “differs totally in outward appearance from every one of its
                    allies, having taken upon itself the exact shape and colouring of a globular <hi
                    rend="italic">Corynomalus,</hi> a little stinking beetle, with clubbed
                    antennae.” <hi rend="italic">Erythroplatis corallifer,</hi> another longicorn,
                    almost exactly resembles <hi rend="italic">Cephalodonta spinipes,</hi> one of
                    the common South-American <hi rend="italic">Hispidx,</hi> which possesses a
                    disagreeable secretion; and Mr Bates also found a totally different longicorn,
                    <hi rend="italic">Streptolabis hispoides,</hi> which resembles the same insect
                    with equal minuteness. Some of the large tropical weevils have the elytra so
                    hard that they cannot be pierced by a bird’s beak; and these are mimicked by
                    many other comparatively soft and eatable insects. In southern Brazil, <hi
                    rend="italic">Acanthotritus dorsalis</hi> closely resembles a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Curculio</hi> of the hard genus <hi rend="italic">Heiliρlus;</hi> and Mr Bates
                    found <hi rend="italic">Gymnocerus cratosomoides,</hi> a longicorn, on the same
                    tree with the hard weevil, <hi rend="italic">Cratosomus,</hi> which it mimics.
                    Other beetles resemble bees, wasps, and shielded bugs. Hairy caterpillars are
                    well known to be distasteful to birds, and comparatively free from attack; and
                    Mr Belt found a longicorn, <hi rend="italic">Desmiphora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fasciculata,</hi> covered with long brown and black hairs, and exactly
                    mimicking some of the short, thick, woolly caterpillars common on the bushes
                    around.</p>
                <p>Amongst other orders, one of the most interesting cases is that of certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Diptera</hi> or two-winged flies which mimic wasps and bees.
                    Sometimes this likeness only serves to protect the insect from attack, by
                    inspiring fear of a sting. But there are also a number of parasitic flies whose
                    larvae feed upon the larvae of bees, as in the British genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Volucella;</hi> and these exactly mimic the bees, so that they can enter the
                    nests or hives to deposit their eggs without being detected even by the bees
                    themselves. In every country where such flies occur they resemble the native
                    bees of the district. Similarly, Mr Bates found a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mantis</hi> on the Amazons which exactly mimicked the white ants on which it
                    fed. On the other hand, the defenceless species itself may mimic its persecutor,
                    as in the case of several crickets, <hi rend="italic">Scaphura,</hi> that
                    exactly resemble various sand-wasps, and so escape the depredations of those
                    cricket-killing enemies. Another cricket from the Philippine Islands, <hi
                    rend="italic">Condylodera tricondyloides,</hi> so closely copies a tiger-beetle,
                    <hi rend="italic">Tricondyla,</hi> that even Professor Westwood long retained it
                    among that group in his cabinet, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n360/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0360-0343"/> and only slowly discovered his mistake. The cases
                    here mentioned form but a small part of all those that have hitherto been
                    observed and described in the insect world. They amount altogether to many
                    hundreds.</p>
                <p>Among plants, though included in the above definition for the sake of formal
                    completeness, instances of true mimicry are rare or almost unknown. Perhaps the
                    nearest approach to this phenomenon in the vegetal world is found in the
                    resemblance borne by the dead-nettle, <hi rend="italic">Lamium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">album,</hi> and a few other labiates, to the stinging nettle, <hi
                    rend="italic">Urtica</hi><hi rend="italic">dioica</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >U.</hi><hi rend="italic">urens.</hi> The true nettles are strikingly protected
                    from animal foes by their stinging hairs; and the general appearance of the
                    dead-nettle is sufficiently like them to prevent human beings from plucking it,
                    and therefore probably to deter herbivorous mammals from eating it down. Mr
                    Mansel Weale mentions another labiate, <hi rend="italic">Ajuga ophrydis,</hi> of
                    South Africa, which closely resembles an orchid, and may thus induce insects to
                    fertilize its flowers. Mr Worthington Smith has found three rare British fungi,
                    each accompanying common species which they closely resembled; and one of the
                    common species possesses a bitter and nauseous taste; so that this would seem to
                    be a case of true mimicry. Many diverse instances alleged by Mr A. W. Bennett,
                    Dr Cooke, and others cannot be considered as genuine mimetic resemblances in the
                    sense here laid down. They are mere coincidences or similar adaptations to
                    similar needs; and the word ought to be applied strictly to such likenesses
                    alone as benefit the organism in which they occur by causing it to be mistaken
                    for another possessing some special advantage of its own.</p>
                <p>The theoretical explanation of mimicry on evolutionary principles may best be
                    considered in connexion with the general subject of protective coloration and
                    variation in form, of which it is a very special case. There are two ways in
                    which imitative colouring may benefit a species. It may help the members of the
                    species to escape the notice of enemies, or it may help them to deceive prey. In
                    the first case imitative hues enable the animal or plant to avoid being itself
                    devoured; in the second case they enable it to devour others more easily, and so
                    to secure a larger amount of food than less deceptively coloured compeers. In
                    the former instance we must suppose that such individuals as did not possess the
                    deceptive colouring have been discovered and destroyed by enemies with highly
                    developed sight, while those which possessed it have survived. In the latter
                    instance we must suppose that the individuals which have no protective colouring
                    have failed to secure sufficient prey, through too readily betraying their
                    presence, and that only those which possessed such colouring have become the
                    parents of future generations. It is difficult, however, to separate these two
                    cases, and in many instances the same colouring may aid a species both in
                    escaping its peculiar enemies and in deceiving its peculiar prey. They may
                    therefore most conveniently be considered together.</p>
                <p>Colour is always liable to vary from individual to individual, as we see in the
                    case of domesticated fowls, rabbits, dogs, and other animals, as well as in most
                    cultivated flowers, wherever natural selection cannot act to keep the typical
                    specific hues pure and true. But in a wild state certain conspicuous colours are
                    sure to prove disadvantageous by betraying the individual, and these will sooner
                    or later get weeded out, under certain circumstances, either through the action
                    of enemies or by starvation resulting from the inability to escape the notice of
                    prey. On the other hand, certain other colours are sure to benefit the
                    individual by harmonizing with the tints of the environment and these will be
                    spared by natural selection, so that the individuals possessing them will pair
                    with one another, and will hand down their peculiarities to their descendants.
                    In this way many species will acquire and retain a coloration that harmonizes
                    with their environment as a whole or with some special part of it. The degree to
                    which the protective coloration will be carried, however, must depend upon the
                    sharpness of the senses in those other organisms which it is desirable to
                    deceive. Large dominant herbivorous or frugivorous mammals or birds, with
                    relatively few enemies, would not be benefited by protective coloration, and so
                    they seldom exhibit it. The grasses or fruits on which they feed cannot make any
                    attempt to escape them. But carnivores generally require to deceive their prey,
                    and therefore a large number of them exhibit marked deceptive colouring Still
                    more especially do small defenceless birds or mammals need to escape the notice
                    of the carnivores, and they accordingly very generally possess dull colours,
                    because any variation in the direction of conspicuousness is certain to be
                    promptly cut off. Above all, among insects, which are so largely the prey of
                    birds, of reptiles, and of other animals possessing highly developed vision,
                    protective coloration in one form or other is almost universal, except where a
                    nauseous taste, hairy skin, or hard external coverings afford a different kind
                    of protection. In every case the weeding out of ill-protected forms must depend
                    upon the relative keenness of vision in the various enemies or of the prey, be
                    they mammals, birds, reptiles, insects, or spiders. Hence the existence of
                    protective coloring and of mimicry incidentally affords us valuable hints as to
                    the perceptive faculties of the various classes against which each organism is
                    thus unconsciously guarded.</p>
                <p>Where the general aspect of the environment is most uniform, and where little but
                    a vague impression of colour without individual form can be conveyed, the hues
                    of animals are also usually uniform, to match their surroundings, and no special
                    imitative adaptations of form occur. Thus, among the Arctic snows, a brown or
                    black animal would immediately be perceived, and if defenceless at once
                    devoured, while if a carnivore it would seldom or never approach unperceived
                    near enough to its prey to effect a capture. Hence all such variations are at
                    once repressed, and almost all Arctic animals, like the American polar hare, are
                    pure white. Elsewhere bears are black or brown; in the polar region the native
                    species is nearly indistinguishable from the snow in which it lives. Where the
                    environment undergoes a regular change from season to season the colour of the
                    fauna varies with it. The Arctic fox, the ermine, the alpine hare, the ptarmigan
                    and many other birds, are all more or less brown among the brown hill-sides of
                    autumn, and snow-white among the winter snows. Almost equally general is the
                    sandy colour of deserts, though this, instead of being uniform, is slightly
                    varied from grain to grain; and nearly all the birds, reptiles, and insects of
                    Sahara exactly copy the sandy grey hue of the desert around them. Soles and
                    other flat-fish <hi rend="italic">(Pleuroncctidoe)</hi> closely imitate the
                    colour and speckled appearance of the sand on which they lie. The fishes and
                    crustaceans which inhabit the sargasso weed are coloured the same yellow as the
                    masses of algae to which they cling. Aphides and many small leaf-eating
                    caterpillars are bright green like the neighbouring foliage.</p>
                <p>Where the environment is somewhat more diverse, the resemblance begins to show
                    more specialized features. The lion, a large groundcat of desert or rocky
                    districts, is uniformly brown; but the tiger and other jungle-cats have
                    perpendicular stripes which harmonize with the bamboos and brown grass of their
                    native haunts; while the leopards, jaguars, and other tree-cats have ocellated
                    spots which conceal them among the mingled light and shade of the forests. Large
                    marine animals have the back black, because the water looks dark when seen from
                    above, but their bellies are white, so as to harmonize with the colour of the
                    surface when seen from below. Dr Weismann has shown that most edible unprotected
                    caterpillars imitate the stripes and shades of the leaves among which they feed.
                    Those which live upon grasses are longitudinally striped like the blades, those
                    which live among small leaves are spotted and varied so as to resemble the
                    distribution of light and shade in the bushes, and those which live upon large
                    veined leaves with oblique ribs have oblique lines to harmonize with them. In
                    some cases even the unripe berries are represented on the caterpillar by small
                    reddish spots. A specialized form of this particular protective device is found
                    in the chameleon, the chameleon-shrimp, many flat-fish, and some amphibians, all
                    of which can vary their coloration to suit that of the surface on which they
                    rest. The action is reflex, and ceases if the animal is blinded.</p>
                <p>Where the environment is very varied, as in tropical forests, we find the
                    greatest variety of colouring as well as actual imitation of particular forms;
                    and the protective resemblances become at once closer and more common. Birds,
                    reptiles, spiders, monkeys, and other active predaceous creatures are constantly
                    hunting for insects and similar small prey amongst the fallen sticks or leaves;
                    and among the most powerless classes of insects only those which very closely
                    resemble specific objects in the environment can easily escape them. A gradual
                    passage can be traced from the most general to the most special resemblances
                    under such circumstances. Many forestine birds have a ground-tone of green in
                    their plumage, which occurs nowhere but in the tropics. Some tree-lizards are
                    green like the leaves on which they sit, others are marbled to resemble the bark
                    where they lie in wait for their prey. Arboreal snakes often hang like lianas or
                    other creepers. Insects which cling to the trunks of trees can seldom be
                    distinguished from the bark. A Sumatran butterfly, <hi rend="italic">Kallima
                    paralecta,</hi> always settles on dry bushes among dead leaves, and can then
                    hardly be perceived among the brown foliage, which it imitates even in the
                    apparent blotches and mildew with which its wings are covered. The family of <hi
                    rend="italic">Phasniidae,</hi> including the leaf and stick insects, carries
                    such forms of imitation very far indeed. Most of them are large, soft,
                    defenceless creatures; but some, like <hi rend="italic">Phyllium,</hi> closely
                    resemble green leaves, so as to be almost indistinguishable while feeding; and
                    others exactly imitate short broken twigs of bamboo. Mr Wallace found one such
                    insect, <hi rend="italic">Ccroxylus</hi><hi rend="italic">laceratus,</hi> in
                    Borneo, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n361/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0361-0344"/> apparently overgrown with a creeping moss or
                    jungermannia; and Air Belt discovered a larval form in Nicaragua whose body was
                    prolonged into thin green filaments, precisely like the moss in which 1Ι lurked.
                    In other instances the insect probably uses its disguise rather to deceive its
                    prey than to escape its enemies. Sir Joseph Hooker believes that an Indian <hi
                    rend="italic">Mantis</hi> deludes the little creatures which form its food by
                    its singular likeness to a leaf; while Sir Charles Dilke found one which had its
                    head and fangs moulded into the deceptive appearance of an orchid, so that small
                    flies were actually attracted in search of honey into its very jaws. Outside the
                    class of insects, similar phenomena sometimes occur. Thus, according to Mr
                    Bates, many showy little tropical spiders double themselves up at the base of
                    leaf stalks so as to resemble flower buds, and thus delude the flies on which
                    they prey. Even among the vertebrates Mr Belt mentions a green Nicaraguan lizard
                    looking like the herbage by which it is surrounded, and decked with leaf-like
                    expansions, which hide its predaceous nature from passing beetles or
                    butterflies.</p>
                <p>These last instances are divided from true mimicry by a very narrow line. But
                    they differ in the fact that some vague object only in the general environment
                    is simulated, not a particular protected species, as in genuine mimetic
                    resemblance. If we allow, however, that natural selection can produce the white
                    colour of Arctic animals, and the sandy hue of the sole and the flounder, it is
                    easy enough to extend the same principle to the leaf-insect and the
                    stick-insect, or even to real mimicry, as in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lcptalis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Heliamidae.</hi> Certain <hi
                    rend="italic">Phasmidae</hi> may at first have varied in the direction of green
                    coloration, and these would naturally escape the eyes of birds more readily than
                    their fellows. After the lapse of many generations, all the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasmidae</hi> of that special group would have become green, and the birds
                    which preyed upon them would have learned in many cases to penetrate the
                    disguise; for, as Mr Belt has observed, each fresh deceptive resemblance in the
                    prey is sure to be followed by increased keenness of discrimination in the
                    enemies of the species. At this stage the ordinary green <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasmidae</hi> would often be killed, while only those which happened to
                    approximate rudely in the venation of their wings to leaves would now escape the
                    sharper and more experienced eyes of the birds. Thus step by step the disguise
                    would become more and more perfect, only the best-protected of each generation
                    escaping on the average, while all the worse-protected would be discovered and
                    devoured. Given the usual luxuriance of tropical life, it is not difficult to
                    understandhowfavourable variations mightcontinu-ally occur, until at length we
                    get such perfect deceptions as those of the leaf-insects, the stick-insects, and
                    the moss-grown larvae.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of true mimicry may be explained by a parallel genesis. Suppose, to
                    begin with, a group of large and brilliant butterflies like the South-American
                    <hi rend="italic">Heliconidae,</hi> protected by a nauseous taste and odour, and
                    therefore never eaten by birds. To such insects slow flight and conspicuous hues
                    are a positive protection, because they enable birds readily to discriminate
                    them, and therefore prevent attacks, just as the banded body of the wasp and the
                    hum of the bee prevent us from catching and killing them upon a window pane.
                    Suppose, again, that in the same district there lives a widely different species
                    of edible butterfly presenting some very slight and remote resemblance to the
                    protected species. At first, no doubt, the resemblance will be merely an
                    accidental one of general hue; it may even be so slight as to deceive nobody
                    except upon the most distant and casual glance. Now, suppose these edible
                    butterflies to be devoured in large quantities by birds, then a few of them may
                    happen to gain safety by associating with the flocks of inedible butterflies
                    which the birds refuse. After a time, even if the habit of consorting with the
                    protected species becomes fixed in the race, the birds will begin to recognize
                    the edible insects amongst the flocks, especially such as vary most in the
                    opposite direction from the protected species. On the other hand, they will
                    overlook such as vary most in the same direction as the inedible kind; and thus
                    the least mimetic individuals will be destroyed, while the most mimetic will be
                    left to pair with one another and to produce young, most of whom will present
                    the like peculiarities. From generation to generation the birds will go on
                    picking out every bad copy, and sparing all the best ones, till at last the two
                    species become absolutely indistinguishable upon the wing. But the mimicry will
                    never of course affect any but the most external and noticeable parts of the
                    organism; it will be to the last a mere matter of colour, shape of wing, visible
                    appearance of legs or antennae, and so forth. The underlying structural
                    differences will remain as great as ever, though externally masked by the
                    deceptive resemblance in form and hue.</p>
                <p>In like manner we may explain the genesis of the mimetic resemblance borne by <hi
                    rend="italic">Vol·ucella</hi> to the humble bee. Suppose an undisguised fly to
                    enter the bees’ nest, it would be at once attacked and killed. But if it
                    presented some very slight resemblance to the bee it might manage to lay its
                    eggs undisturbed, and its larvae would then be able to feed quietly upon the
                    larvae of the bee. With each new generation the more flimsy disguises would be
                    more and more readily detected, and only those flies which varied most in the
                    direction of resembling the bees would survive or lay their eggs in peace. On
                    the other hand, those which actually succeeded would possess great advantages
                    over their neighbours, because their larvae would thus obtain a safe and certain
                    supply of food, and be guaranteed the protection of the bees’ nest. In this way
                    the flies would at last, by constant survival of the best-adapted, come exactly
                    to imitate the bees amongst which they lived.</p>
                <p>The theory of the origin of mimetic forms thus briefly sketched out is due to Mr
                    Bates and Air Wallace, and it explains all the facts more fully than any other.
                    It shows us, first, why the mimicking organism always imitates a specially
                    protected species; secondly, why the two always inhabit the same district;
                    thirdly, why the mimicking species is always much rarer than the species
                    mimicked; fourthly, why the phenomenon is confined to a few groups only; and
                    fifthly, why several different mimicking species often imitate the same
                    protected form. It also accounts for the absence of mimicry amongst large or
                    dominant animals, and its comparative commonness amongst small and defenceless
                    kinds. And by affiliating the whole of the phenomena upon the general principles
                    of protective colouring it reduces a seemingly strange and marvellous fact to a
                    particular case of a well-known law.</p>
                <p>Whatever theory be adopted, however, the facts and most of their implications
                    remain the same. For, whether we suppose these imitative resemblances to be due
                    to direct creative design or to survival of favourable variations, it is at
                    least clear that the disguise subserves a function—that it is purposive and not
                    accidental. Hence we may draw from the phenomena of mimicry certain important
                    psychological implications. On the hypothesis of evolution, it is obvious that
                    the mimicry can never go further than the senses of the creatures against whom
                    the disguise is advantageous would naturally carry it; and even on the
                    hypothesis of special design it is not likely that the imitation would be made
                    more accurate than would be necessary for practical purposes of deception. There
                    is much evidence in favour of this view. Mr B. T. Lowne, for example, who has
                    carefully measured the curvature of the facets in the compound eyes of insects,
                    upon which depends the minimum size of apprehensible objects, finds that the
                    mimicry in the case of the flies parasitic upon bees’ nests has proceeded just
                    so far as the structure of the bee’s eye would lead us to expect, and no
                    further. In other words, so far as measurements of angular distance subtended
                    can guide us, such a fly seems to be absolutely indistinguishable by a bee from
                    one of his own species, within the limits of ordinary vision. The pictures cast
                    upon the sensorium by the fly and by a brother bee are simply identical. In many
                    other cases it can be shown that the mimicry seems specially intended to deceive
                    the eyes of a particular class of animals; while there is no case of mimicry
                    where the only enemies or prey consist of plants or eyeless animals. Naturally
                    there can be no mimicry without a creature to deceive; the very conception
                    implies an external nervous system tobe acted upon, and to be acted upon
                    deceptively. Thus mimicry in plants must have reference to the eyes of animals,
                    in animals themselves to the eyes of one another. We may conclude, accordingly,
                    that if a leaf-insect is green with faint violet-brown veins to the wings,
                    exactly like a certain leaf, in order to deceive sundry tropical birds, then
                    those birds are capable of perceiving the forms and colours imitated to that
                    particular degree. So the presence of mimicry in any group may guide us to a
                    rough idea of the perceptive powers of those creatures whom the mimicry serves
                    to deceive. The exact imitation of sand and coloured pebbles in the flat-fish is
                    a fairly safe indication that the predaceous fish by whose selection they have
                    been developed (through the weeding out of ill-protected variations) can pretty
                    accurately distinguish form and colour. The long green pipe fish which cling
                    around green sea-weed have probably acquired their existing hues to deceive the
                    eyes of small sharks; the <hi rend="italic">Phyllopteryx</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >eques,</hi> a hippocampus which looks precisely like a piece of tangled and
                    waving fucus (see figure, vol. xi. p. 852), has doubtless in the same way taken
                    on its delusive likeness to the algae among which it lives. So the cricket which
                    resembles its foe the sand-wasp must have gained its present shape and hue by
                    deceiving its enemy, and therefore it suggests the probability of highly
                    developed vision on the part of the wasps. There seems every reason to believe
                    that in many instances insects, spiders, and even lizards have developed mimetic
                    or other deceptive resemblances in order to delude the eyes of insects; while in
                    other cases the disguise has been unconsciously adopted to deceive fish,
                    amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals. Moreover, we have some grounds for
                    believing that the sense of colour is exceptionally strong in birds and in one
                    or two insect orders; and the mimicry of colour seems to have proceeded to the
                    greatest length amongst animals which are most exposed to the attacks of these
                    classes, or which would find it advantageous to deceive them. It may be added
                    that these same classes have been most effective in producing the bright hues of
                    flowers and fruits, on Air Darwin’s hypothesis, or are at least in any case most
                    intimately correlated with such vegetable structures as fertilizers of blossoms
                    and dispersers of seed. AIimicry is thus to some extent a rough gauge of the
                    perceptive faculties of the species deceived by it.</p>

                <p>The vocal mimicry which occurs among certain birds, such as the mocking-bird,
                    starling, parrot, and bullfinch, must of course be placed in a wholly different
                    category from these biological cases. It is a direct volitional result, and it
                    is mimicry in a literal not in a figurative sense. The faculty seems to be due
                    to the play-instinct alone, and not to subserve any directly useful function.
