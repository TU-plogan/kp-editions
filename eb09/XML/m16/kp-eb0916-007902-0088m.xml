                <p><label type="entry">METAPHYSIC</label></p>
                <p>THE term metaphysic, originally intended to mark the place of a particular
                    treatise in the collection of Aristotle’s works, has, mainly owing to a
                    misunderstanding, survived several other titles,—such as “First Philosophy,”
                    “Ontology,” and “Theology,” which Aristotle himself used or suggested.
                    Neo-Platonic mystics interpreted it as signifying that which is not merely
                    “after” but “beyond” physics, and found in it a fit designation for a science
                    which, as they held, could not be attained except by one who had turned his back
                    upon the natural world. And writers of a different tendency in a later time
                    gladly accepted it as a convenient nickname for theories which they regarded as
                    having no basis in experience, in the same spirit in which the great German
                    minister Stein used the analogous title of “metapolitics” for airy and
                    unpractical schemes of social reform. A brief indication of the contents of
                    Aristotle’s treatise may enable us to give a general definition of the science
                    which was first distinctly constituted by it, and to determine in what sense the
                    subjects which that science has to consider are beyond nature and
                    experience.</p>
                <p>For Aristotle, metaphysic is the science which has to do with Being as such,
                    Being in general, as distinguished from the special sciences jvhich deal with
                    special forms of being. There are certain questions which, in Aristotle’s view,
                    we have a right to ask in regard to everything that presents itself as real. We
                    may ask what is its ideal nature or definition, and what are the conditions of
                    its realization; we may ask by what or whom it was produced, and for what end;
                    we may ask, in other words, for the formal and the material, for the efficient
                    and the final causes of everything that is. These different questions point to
                    different elements in our notion of Being, elements which may be considered in
                    their general relations apart from any particular case of their union. These,
                    therefore, the first philosophy must investigate. But, further, this science of
                    being cannot be entirely separated from the science of knowing, but must
                    determine at least its most general principles. For the science that deals with
                    what is most universal in being is, for that very reason, dealing with the
                    objects which are most nearly akin to the intelligence. These, indeed, are not
                    the objects which are first presented to our minds; we begin with the
                    particular, not the universal, with a <hi rend="italic">πρώτον</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ηplv</hi> which is not <hi rend="italic">πρώτον</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">φυσeL-,</hi> but science reaches its true form only when the order
                    of thought is made one with the order of nature, and the particular is known
                    through the universal. Yet this-conversion or revolution of the intellectual
                    point of view is not to be regarded as an absolute change from error to truth;
                    for Aristotle holds that <hi rend="italic">nihil</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    beginning in sense perception, with the distinction of particular from
                    particular, can rest only when it has apprehended things in their universal
                    forms or definitions. Looking at knowledge <hi rend="italic">formally,</hi> the
                    highest law of thought, the law of contradiction (or, as we might call it, to
                    indicate Aristotle’s meaning more exactly, the law of definition or
                    distinction), is already implied in the first act of perception by which one
                    thing is distinguished from another. Looking at it <hi rend="italic"
                    >materially,</hi> the reason of man is to be conceived as potentially all that
                    is knowable <hi rend="italic">; i.e.,</hi> objects are so related to it that for
                    it to know them in their essential definitions is only to know itself. The aim
                    of science, in this view, is to break through the husk of matter, and to
                    apprehend things in their forms, in which they are one with the mind that knows
                    them. Hence also it follows that in rising to the most universal science, the
                    science of Being in general, the mind is not leaving the region of immediate
                    experience, in which it is at home, for a far-off region of abstractions. Rather
                    it is returning to itself, apprehending that which is most closely related to
                    itself, and which therefore, though it is late in being made the direct object
                    of investigation, is yet presupposed in all that is, and is known.<note

                <p>Metaphysic, then, is the science which deals with the principles which are
                    presupposed in all being and knowing, though they are brought to light only by
                    philosophy. Another trait completes the Aristotelian account of it. It is
                    theology, or the science of God. Now God is <hi rend="italic">voησι&lt;s
                    voησeως,</hi> pure self-consciousness, the absolute thought which is one with
                    its object, and He is therefore the first cause of all existence. For, while the
                    world of nature is a world of motion and change, in which form is realized in
                    matter, this process of the finite can be explained only by referring it back to
                    an unmoved mover, in whom there is no distinction of matter and form, and who
                    is, therefore, in Aristotle’s view, to be conceived as pure form, the purely
                    ideal or theoretic activity of a consciousness whose object is itself. Such a
                    conception, however, while it secures the independence and absoluteness of the
                    unmoved mover, by removing him from all relation to what is other than himself,
                    seems to make his connexion with the world inexplicable. We can on this theory
                    refer the world to God, but not God to the world. Hence Aristotle seems
                    sometimes to say that God is the first mover only as He is the last end after
                    which all creation strives, and this leads him to attribute to nature a desire
                    or will which is directed towards the good as its object or end.</p>
                <p>Aristotle then brings together in his metaphysic three elements which are often
                    separated from each other, and the connexion of which is far from being at once
                    obvious. It is to him the science of the first principles of being. It is also
                    the science of the first principles of knowing. Lastly, it is the science of
                    God, as the beginning and end of all things, the absolute unity of being and
                    thought, in which all the differences of finite thought and existence are either
                    excluded or overcome.</p>
                <p>To some this description of the contents of Aristotle’s treatise, and especially
                    the last part of it, may seem to be a confirmation of all the worst charges
                    brought against metaphysic. For at both extremes this supposed science seems to
                    deal with that which is beyond experience, and which therefore cannot be
                    verified by it. It takes us back to a beginning which is prior to the existence
                    as well as to the consciousness of finite objects in time and space, and on to
                    an end to which no scientific prophecy based upon our consciousness of such
                    objects can reach. In the former aspect of it, it has to do with notions so
                    abstract and general that it seems as if they could not be fixed or tested by
                    reference to any experience, but must necessarily be the playthings of
                    dialectical sophistry. In the latter aspect of it, it entangles us in questions
                    as to the final cause and ultimate meaning of things, questions involving so
                    comprehensive a view of the infinite universe in which we are insignificant
                    parts that it seems as if any attempt to answer them must be for us vain and
                    presumptuous. On both sides, therefore, metaphysic appears to be an attempt to
                    occupy regions which are beyond the habitable space of the intelligible world—to
                    deal with ideas which are either so vague and abstract that they cannot be
                    fastened to any definite meaning, or so complex and far-reaching that they can
                    never by any possibility be verified. For beings like men, fixed within these
                    narrow limits of space and time, the true course, it would seem, is to
                    “cultivate their gardens,” asking neither whence they come nor whither they go,
                    or asking it only within the possible limits of history and scientific prophecy.
                    To go back to the beginning or on to the end is beyond them, even in a temporal,
                    still more in a metaphysical, sense. That which is <hi rend="italic">πpωτov
                    φυσeL</hi> escapes us even more absolutely than the prehistorical and
                    pregeological records of man and his world. That which is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ύστατον φύσει</hi> escapes us even more absolutely than the far-off future type
                    of civilization, which social science vainly endeavours to anticipate. Our state
                    is best pictured by that early Anglican philosopher who compared it to a bird
                    flying through a lighted room “between the night and the night.” The true aim of
                    philosophy is, therefore, it would seem, to direct our thoughts to the careful
                    examination and utilization of the narrow space allotted to us by an inscrutable
                    power, and with scientific self-restraint to refrain from all speculation either
                    on first or on final causes.</p>
                <p>The main questions as to the possibility and the nature of metaphysic, according
                    to Aristotle’s conception of it, may be summed up under two heads. We may ask
                    whether we can in any sense reach that which is beyond experience, and, if so,
                    whether this “beyond” is a first or a last principle, a pre-condition or a final
                    cause of nature and experience, or both. The former question branches out into
                    two, according as we look at metaphysic from the objective or the subjective
                    side, or, to express the matter more accurately, according as we consider it in
                    relation to those natural objects which are <hi rend="italic">merely</hi>
                    objects of knowledge, or in relation to those spiritual objects which are also
                    subjects of knowledge. We shall therefore consider metaphysic, first, in
                    relation to science in general, and, secondly, in relation to the special
                    science of psychology. The latter question also has two aspects; for, while the
                    idea of a first cause or principle points to the connexion between metaphysic
                    and logic, the idea of a last principle or final cause connects metaphysic with
                    theology. We shall therefore consider in the third place the relation of
                    metaphysic to logic, and in the fourth place its relation to religion and the
                    philosophy of religion.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Relation of Metaphysic to Science.—</hi> The beginnings
                    of science and metaphysic are identical, though there is a sense in which it may
                    be admitted that the metaphysical comes before the scientific or positive era.
                    The first efforts of philosophy grasp at once at the prize of absolute
                    knowledge. No sooner did the Greeks become dissatisfied with the pictorial
                    synthesis of mythology by which their thoughts were first lifted above the
                    confusion of particular things, than they asked for one universal principle
                    which should explain all things. The Ionic school sought to find some one
                    phenomenon of nature which might be used as the key to all other phenomena. The
                    Eleatics, seeing the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0090-0081"/> futility of making one finite thing the
                    explanation of all other finite things, tried to find that explanation in the
                    very notion of unity or being itself. We need not underestimate the speculative
                    value of such bold attempts to sum up all the variety of the world in one idea,
                    but it is obvious that they rather give a name to the problem than solve it, or
                    that they put the very consciousness of the problem in place of the solution of
                    it. Science is possible only if we can rise from the particular to the
                    universal, from a subjective view of things as they immediately present
                    themselves to us in perception to an objective determination of them through
                    laws and principles which have no special relation to any particular set of
                    events or to any one individual subject. But this is only one aspect of the
                    matter. To advance from a conception of the world <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ordine</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >individuum</hi> to one <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ordine</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">universum,</hi> and so to
                    discount and eliminate what is merely subjective and accidental in our first
                    consciousness of the world, is the beginning of knowledge. But little is gained
                    unless the universal, which we reach through the negation of the particulars, is
                    more than their mere negation; unless it is a law or principle by means of which
                    we can explain the particulars. Now the defect of early philosophy was that its
                    universal was “the one beyond the many,” not the “one in the many,”—in other
                    words, that it was not a law or principle by which the particulars subsumed
                    under it could be explained, but simply the abstraction of an element common to
                    them. But the process of knowledge is a process that involves both analysis and
                    synthesis, negation and reaffirmation of the particulars with which we start. If
                    we exaggerate the former aspect of it, we enter upon the <hi rend="italic"
                    >via</hi><hi rend="italic">negativa</hi> of the mystics, the way of pure
                    abstraction and negation, which would open the mind to the ideal reality of
                    things simply by shutting it to all the perceptions of sensible phenomena. And,
                    if we follow out this method to its legitimate result, we must treat the highest
                    abstraction, the abstraction of Being, as if it were the sum of all reality, and
                    the Neo-Platonic ecstasy in which all distinction, even the distinction of
                    subject and object, is lost as the only attitude of mind in which truth can be
                    apprehended.</p>
                <p>In the philosophy of the Socratic school we find the first attempt at a <hi
                    rend="italic">systematic</hi> as opposed to an <hi rend="italic">abstract</hi>
                    theory— the first attempt to bring together the one and the many, and so to
                    determine the former that it should throw light upon the latter. Yet even in
                    Plato the tendency to oppose the universal to the particular is stronger than
                    the tendency to relate them to each other, and in some of his dialogues, as, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi> in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phsedo,</hi> we find a near approach to that identification of the process of
                    knowledge with abstraction which is the characteristic of mysticism. Aristotle,
                    therefore, had some ground for taking the Platonic principle that “the real is
                    the universal” in a sense which excludes the reality of the individual. Yet,
                    though he detected Plato’s error in opposing the universal to the particular,
                    and though, at the same time, he did not entirely lose sight of the truth which
                    Plato had exaggerated, that the particular is intelligible only <hi
                    rend="italic">through</hi> the universal, Aristotle was not able to escape the
                    influence of that dualism which had marred the philosophy of his predecessor.
                    Hence the effect of his protest against a philosophy of abstraction was partly
                    neutralized by his separation between the divine Being as pure form and nature
                    as the unity of form and matter, and again by his separation of the pure reason
                    which apprehends the forms of things from the perceptions of sense which deal
                    with forms realized in matter. And after Aristotle’s time the tendency of
                    philosophy was more and more to withdraw from contact with experience. The
                    Neo-Platonic philosophy, and the Christian theology which was so strongly
                    influenced by it, contained, indeed, an idea of the reconciliation of God and
                    nature, and hence of form and matter, which must ultimately be fatal to dualism,
                    and therefore to the method of mere abstraction. But the explicit meaning of the
                    philosophy of the Middle Ages was still dualistic, and the mode in which the
                    Aristotelian formulae were wrought into the substance of Christian doctrine by
                    the scholastics tended more and more to conceal that idea of the unity of
                    opposites which was involved in Christianity. Hence mediaeval realism presented,
                    in its most one-sided form, the doctrine that “the real is the universal,”
                    meaning by the universal nothing more than the abstract. And, as a natural
                    consequence, the modern insurrection of the scientific spirit against
                    scholasticism took its start from an equally bald and one-sided assertion of the
                    opposite principle, that “the real is the individual,” meaning by that the
                    individual of immediate perception. If Platonism had dwelt too exclusively on
                    one aspect of the process of knowledge, viz., that it seeks to rise above the
                    particular, the sensible, the subjective, to the universal, the intelligible,
                    the objective, as if in the latter alone were reality to be found, modern men of
                    science learnt from their first nominalistic teachers to regard the universal as
                    nothing more than an abbreviated expression for the particulars, and science
                    itself as a mere generalization of the facts of sensible perception. But this
                    view of scientific knowledge, as a mere reaffirmation of what is immediately
                    given in sense, is as imperfect as the opposite theory, which reduces it to the
                    mere negation of what is so given. An ideal world utterly and entirely divorced
                    from the phenomenal, and an ideal world which is simply a repetition of the
                    phenomenal, are equally meaningless. The processes of science have both a
                    negative and a positive side; they involve a negation of the particular as it is
                    immediately presented in sense, but only with a view to its being reaffirmed
                    with a new determination through the universal. The fact as it is first
                    presented to us is not the fact as it is; for, though it is from the fact as
                    given that we rise to the knowledge of the law, it is the law that first enables
                    us to understand what the fact really means. Our first consciousness of things
                    is thus, not an immovable foundation upon which science may build, but rather a
                    hypothetical and self-contradictory starting-point of investigation, which
                    becomes changed and transformed as we advance.</p>
                <p>The nominalism of scientific men in modern times is due to two special causes,
                    one of which has already been mentioned. It is partly due to the traditions of a
                    time when mediaeval realism was the great enemy of science. The Baconian protest
                    against the “anticipation of nature” was a relative truth when it was urged
                    against a class of writers who supposed that true theories could be attained
                    without regard to facts; the Baconian assertion of the necessity of attending to
                    <hi rend="italic">ajciomata media</hi> was the necessary correction of the
                    tendencies of mystics, who supposed that philosophy could attain its end by
                    grasping at once at absolute unity, and contented themselves, therefore, with a
                    unity which did nothing to explain the differences. But, when the former was
                    turned into the dogmatic assertion that the mind is, or ought to be, passive in
                    the process of knowledge, as having in itself no principle for the explanation
                    of things, and when the latter was turned into the dogmatic assertion that
                    science can only proceed from part to part and never from the whole to the
                    parts, these relative truths became a source of error. And this error was
                    confirmed and increased by the mistaken views of those who first tried to
                    correct it. For these, admitting that scientific truth is entirely derived from
                    external experience, only ventured to assert the existence of <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori</hi> knowledge alongside of, and in addition to, that which is <hi
                    rend="italic">a posteriori.</hi> In other words, they sought in inner experience
                    a basis for <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0091-0082"/> those beliefs which outward experience seemed
                    unable to support. But this basis was soon found to be treacherous.
                    Introspection, observation of the inner life as opposed to and distinguished
                    from the outer life, could be only an observation of the facts of the individual
                    consciousness as such; and to base religion and morality on such a foundation
                    was to treat God and right as subjective phenomena, which do not necessarily
                    correspond to any objective reality. Nor was this conclusion really evaded by
                    the assertion of the self-evidencing necessity of such ideas and beliefs, or of
                    the principles upon which they are founded. For this necessity, as a subjective
                    phenomenon, might be accounted for otherwise than by the supposition of their
                    objective validity. Such scepticism, further, was favoured by the progress of
                    science, which, as it advanced from physics to biology and sociology, became
                    more and more inconsistent with the idea of an absolute breach between inner and
                    outer experience, and narrowed the sphere which had been hitherto reserved for
                    the former. Man, it was urged, is but a part in a greater whole, not exempted
                    from the law of action and reaction which connects all parts of that whole with
                    each other. His individual life contains only a few links in a chain of
                    causation that goes back to a beginning and onward to an end of which he knows
                    nothing. And, as Spinoza says, <hi rend="italic">vis qua</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >unaquaeque</hi><hi rend="italic">res in existendo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >perseverat a causis externis</hi><hi rend="italic">infinite</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">superatur.</hi> Hence to treat ideas which are only states of the
                    individual consciousness as the explanation of the world, instead of treating
                    them as phenomena to be explained by its relation to that world, seemed to be an
                    absurdity. The particular beliefs and tendencies of the mind were to be
                    regarded, not as ultimate facts in reference to which everything is to be
                    interpreted, but rather as facts which are themselves to be referred to more
                    general causes and laws. It thus appeared that the attempt to divide truth into
                    an <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    part, the latter of which should find its evidence in an inner experience as the
                    former in an outer experience, is an illusive process. If the <hi rend="italic"
                    >a priori</hi> is reduced to the level of the <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori,</hi> it becomes impossible to base on the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> any beliefs that go beyond the range of subjective experience. If
                    the self and the not-self are taken simply as different finite things, which we
                    can observe in turn, their relations must be brought under the general laws of
                    the connexion of finite things with each other; and the phenomena of mind must
                    be treated, like the phenomena of matter, as facts to be accounted for according
                    to these laws.</p>
                <p>But this of itself indicates a way of escape both from the introspective theory
                    and from the empiricism to which it is opposed. For it suggests the
                    question—What is the source of those very laws which guide the procedure of
                    science in accounting for facts, psychological facts among others? When a
                    scientific psychologist of the modern school attempts to show how by habituation
                    of the individual and the race the necessity of thought expressed in the law of
                    causation was produced in the minds of the present generation of men, it is
                    obvious that his whole investigation and argument presuppose the law whose
                    genesis he is accounting for. A glaring instance of such circular reasoning is
                    found in the writings of the most prominent representative of the school in the
                    present day. Mr Spencer begins by laying down as a first postulate of science
                    that necessity of thought must be taken as a criterion of truth. It is by the
                    continual aid of this postulate that he constructs his system of nature, and
                    finally his psychological theory of the development of consciousness in man. Yet
                    the main object of this psychological theory seems to be to account for the very
                    necessities with which the author starts. Obviously such a philosophy contains
                    elements of which the author is imperfectly conscious; for it involves that mind
                    is not only the last product but the first presupposition of nature, or, in
                    other words, that in mind nature returns upon its first principle. But to admit
                    this is at once to lift the conscious being as such above the position which he
                    would hold as merely a finite part of a finite world. It is to assert that
                    nature has an essential relation to a consciousness which is developed in man,
                    and that in the growth of this consciousness we have, not an evolution which is
                    the result of the action of nature as a system of external causes <hi
                    rend="italic">upon him,</hi> but an evolution in which nature is really “coming
                    to itself,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> coming to self-consciousness, <hi
                    rend="italic">in him.</hi></p>
                <p>Now it was Kant who first—though with a certain limitation of aim—brought this
                    idea of the relativity of thought and being to the consciousness of the modern
                    world. In the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason,</hi> thought, indeed,
                    is not set up as an absolute <hi rend="italic">prius,</hi> in relation to which
                    all existence must be conceived, but it is set up as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prius</hi> of experience, and so of all existences which are objects of our
                    knowledge. Experience is for Kant essentially relative to the conscious self; it
                    exists through the necessary subsumption of the forms and matter of sense under
                    the categories, as, on the other hand, the consciousness of self is recognized
                    as essentially dependent on this process. On this view, the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> factors of experience do not
                    really exist apart as two separate portions of knowledge. If they are severed,
                    each loses all its meaning. Perceptions in themselves are void; categories in
                    themselves are empty. We do not look outwards for one kind of truth and inwards
                    for another, nor do we even, by an external process, bring facts given as
                    contingent under principles recognized as necessary; but the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> is the condition under which alone the <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori</hi> exists for us. Even if it is allowed that the facts of inner and
                    outer experience contain a contingent element or matter, given under the
                    conditions of time and space, yet neither time nor space nor the facts of
                    experience conditioned by them exist for us except as elements of an experience
                    which is organized according to the categories.</p>
                <p>This is the essential truth which Kant had to express. It is marred in his
                    statement of it by the persistent influence of the abstract division between
                    contingent matter given from without and necessary principles supplied from
                    within, a division essentially inconsistent with the attempt to show that the
                    contingent matter is necessarily subsumed under these principles, and indeed
                    exists for us only as it is so subsumed. But Kant himself puts into our hands
                    the means of correcting his own inadequacy, when he reduces the inaccessible
                    thing in itself, which he at first speaks of as affecting our sensibility and so
                    giving rise to the contingent matter of experience, to a noumenon <hi
                    rend="italic">(yoovpcvov)</hi> which is projected by reason itself. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Dialectic</hi> exhibits the idea of thought as not only
                    constituting finite experience but also reaching beyond it, though as yet only
                    in a negative way. The mind is, on this view, so far unlimited that it knows its
                    own limits; it is conscious of the defects of its experience, of the contingency
                    of its sensible matter, and the emptiness and finitude of its categories; and by
                    reason of this consciousness it is always seeking in experience an ideal which
                    it is impossible to realize there. Thought measures experience by its own
                    nature, and finds it wanting. It demands a kind of unity or identity in its
                    objects which it is unable to find in the actual objects of experience. It is
                    this demand of reason which lifts man above a mere animal existence, and forces
                    him by aid of the categories to determine the matter of sense as a world of
                    objects; yet, as this finite world of experience can never satisfy the demand
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n92/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0092-0083"/> of reason, the consciousness of it is immediately
                    combined with the consciousness of its limited and phenomenal character. The
                    student of the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</hi> cannot but
                    recognize the strange balance between the real and the phenomenal in which it
                    ends, allowing to man the consciousness of each so far as to enable him to see
                    the defects of the other,—so that by aid of the pure identity of reason he can
                    criticize and condemn the “blindness” or unresolved difference of experience,
                    and by means of the concreteness and complexity of experience he can condemn the
                    “empty” identity of reason.</p>
                <p>In order, however, to understand the full bearing of Kant’s criticism of
                    knowledge, and at the same time to find the meeting-point of the opposite
                    currents of thought which alternately prevail in it, it will be necessary to
                    consider the subject a little more closely. The lesson of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Critique</hi> may be gathered up into two points. In the first place, it is a
                    refutation of the ordinary view of experience as something immediately given for
                    thought and not constituted by it. In the second place, it is a demonstration of
                    the merely phenomenal character of the objects of experience, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the demonstration that the objects of experience, even as determined
                    by science, are not things in themselves. Both these results require to be kept
                    clearly in view if we would understand the movement of thought excited by Kant.
                    On the one hand Kant had to teach that what is ordinarily regarded as real, the
                    world of experience, is transcendently ideal, <hi rend="italic">i.e..</hi> is
                    determined as real by <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> forms of thought. On the
                    other hand he had to teach that the world so determined is empirically and not
                    transcendentally real, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> its reality is merely
                    phenomenal. With the former lesson he met the man of science, and compelled him
                    to renounce his materialistic explanation of the world as a thing which exists
                    in independence of the mind that knows it. The world we know is a world which
                    exists only as it exists <hi rend="italic">for its,</hi> for the thinking
                    subject; hence the thinking subject, the ego, cannot be taken as an object like
                    other objects, an object the phenomena of which are to be explained like other
                    phenomena by their place in the connexion of experience. Having, however, thus
                    repelled scientific materialism by the proof that the reality of experience is
                    ideal, Kant refuses to proceed to the complete identification of reality with
                    ideality, and meets the claims of the metaphysician with the assertion that the
                    reality of experience is merely phenomenal. Hence he rejects any idealism that
                    would involve the negation of things in themselves beyond phenomena, or the
                    identification of the objects of experience with these things. The reality we
                    know is a reality which exists only for us as conscious subjects, but this,
                    though it is the only reality we can know, is not the absolute reality.</p>
                <p>It is, however, to be observed that the nature of this opposition between
                    phenomena and things in themselves seems to change as we advance from the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analytic,</hi> where the existence of such things is presupposed,
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Dialectic,</hi> where the grounds of that
                    presupposition are examined. At first the opposition seems to be between what is
                    present in consciousness and what is absolutely beyond consciousness. The matter
                    of experience is regarded as given externally in the affections of the sensible
                    subject,—affections caused by an unknown thing in itself, of which, however,
                    they can tell us nothing. On the other hand the form of experience, the
                    categories and principles of judgment which turn these affections into objects
                    of knowledge, are not pure expressions of the real nature, the pure identity, of
                    the subject in itself, but only products of the identity of the self in relation
                    to the sensibility and its forms of time and space. Hence, on both sides we must
                    regard experience as merely phenomenal, alike in relation to the noumenal object
                    and in relation to the noumenal subject, which lurk behind the veil and send
                    forth into experience on the one side affections which become objects through
                    their determination by the unity of thought, and on the other side an identity
                    of thought which becomes self-conscious in relation to the objects so determined
                    bv itself.</p>
                <p>Kant, however, having thus answered the question of the possibility of experience
                    by reference to two things in themselves which are out of experience, is obliged
                    to ask himself how the <hi rend="italic">consciousness</hi> of these two things
                    in themselves, and the criticism of experience in relation to them, is possible.
                    And here, obviously, the opposition can no longer be conceived as an opposition
                    between that which is and that which is not in consciousness. For the things in
                    themselves must be present to consciousness in some fashion in order that they
                    may be contrasted with the phenomena. If, therefore, phenomena are now regarded
                    as unreal, it must be because we have an <hi rend="italic">idea of reality</hi>
                    to which the reality of experience does not fully correspond. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analytic</hi> Kant had beenιspeaking as if the real consisted in
                    something which is not present to the conscious subject at all, though we, by
                    analysis of his experience, can refer to it as the cause of that which is so
                    present. Now in the <hi rend="italic">Dialectic</hi> he has to account for the
                    fact that the conscious subject himself is able to transcend his experience, and
                    to contrast the objects of it as phenomenal with things in themselves.</p>
                <p>Now it is obvious that such an opposition is possible only so far as the thought,
                    which constitutes experience, is at the same time conscious of itself in
                    opposition to the experience it constitutes. The reason why experience is
                    condemned as phenomenal is, therefore, not because it is that which exists for
                    thought as opposed to that which does not exist for thought, but because it
                    imperfectly corresponds to the determination of thought in itself. In other
                    words, it is condemned as unreal, not because it is ideal, but because it is <hi
                    rend="italic">imperfectly</hi> ideal. And the absolute reality is represented,
                    not as that which exists without relation to thought, but as that which is
                    identical with the thought for which it is. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dialectic,</hi> therefore, the noumenon is substituted for the thing in itself,
                    and the noumenon is, as Kant tells us, the object as it exists for an intuitive
                    or perceptive understanding, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> an understanding which
                    does not synthetically combine the given matter of sense into objects by means
                    of categories, but whose thought is one with the existence of the objects it
                    knows. It is the idea of such a pure identity of knowing and being, as suggested
                    by thought itself, which leads us to regard our actual empirical knowledge as
                    imperfect, and its objects as not, in an absolute sense, <hi rend="italic"
                    >real</hi> objects. The noumena are not, therefore, the unknown causes by whose
                    action and reaction conscious experience is produced; they represent a unity of
                    thought with itself to which it finds experience inadequate. This higher unity
                    of thought with itself is what Kant calls reason, and he identifies it with the
                    faculty of syllogizing. Further, he finds in the three forms of syllogism a
                    guiding thread which brings him to the recognition of three forms in which the
                    pure unity of reason presents itself to us in opposition to the merely <hi
                    rend="italic">synthetic</hi> unity of experience, a psychological, a
                    cosmological, and a theological form. In each of these cases the empirical
                    process of knowledge is accompanied, guided, and stimulated by an idea which
                    nevertheless it is unable to realize or verify. In psychology we have ever
                    present to us an idea of the identity of the self, which is never realized in
                    our actual self-consciousness, because the self of which we are conscious is
                    manifold in its states and because it stands in relation to an external world.
                    The idea of simple identity is, therefore, something we may set <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n93/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0093-0084"/> before us as the goal of an ideal psychology, to
                    which we may approximate in so far as we can trace unity of faculty through all
                    the differences of mental phenomena, but to which we can never attain owing to
                    the nature of the matter with which we deal. Again, in our scientific attempts
                    to explain our external experience, the unity of reason takes the form of an
                    idea of the world as a completed infinite whole, which contains all the objects
                    known to us and all other possible objects; but this cannot be realized in an
                    experience which is conditioned by space and time, and is, therefore, ever
                    incomplete. The idea of totality is, therefore, an <hi rend="italic">ideal,</hi>
                    which guides and stimulates our scientific progress, without which such a thing
                    as science could not exist, but which at the same time can never be realized by
                    science. Lastly, the unity of reason takes a third form in which identity and
                    totality are combined,— as the idea of a unity in which all differences, even
                    the difference of subject and object, are transcended,—the idea of a unity of
                    all things with each other and with the mind that knows them. This idea also is
                    one which science can neither surrender nor realize. It cannot surrender it
                    without giving up that striving after unity without which science would not
                    exist; and it cannot realize it, for the difference between the world, as it is
                    presented to us in actual experience, and the subjective determination of our
                    thinking consciousness cannot be overcome. We can, indeed, use the idea that the
                    world is an organic whole, determined in relation to an end which consciousness
                    sets for itself, as an <hi rend="italic">heuristic</hi> principle to guide us in
                    following the connexion of things with each other; but, as we cannot by means of
                    any such idea anticipate what the facts of external experience will be, so we
                    cannot prove that for a mind other than ours the unity of things which we
                    represent in this way might not take a quite different aspect. Indeed we have
                    reason to think it would; for, while we always think of a designing mind as
                    using materials which have an existence and nature independent of the purposes
                    to which they are put, the absolute mind must be conceived as creating the
                    materials themselves by the same act whereby they are determined to an end. We
                    must conceive it, in short, as an intuitive understanding for which end and
                    means, objective and subjective, are one, or, in other words, as an intelligence
                    whose consciousness of itself is or contains the existence of all that is object
                    for it.</p>
                <p>This new view of the things in themselves as <hi rend="italic">noumena</hi> or
                    ideals of reason involves a new attitude of thought towards them different from
                    that dogmatic attitude which is provisionally adopted in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analytic.</hi> Accordingly, we now find Kant speaking of them, not as things
                    which exist independently of their being conceived, but as “problematical
                    conceptions” of which we cannot even determine whether they correspond to any
                    objects at all. They are “limitative” notions which have a negative value, in so
                    far as they keep open a vacant space beyond experience, but do not enable us to
                    fill that space with any positive realities. They are like dark lanterns which
                    cast light upon the empirical world, and show what are its boundaries, but leave
                    their own nature in obscurity. All that we can say of the noumenal self or
                    subject is that it corresponds to the unity implied in all knowledge, but
                    whether there is such a self, independent of the process of empirical synthesis
                    and the self-consciousness which accompanies that process, we cannot tell. All
                    that we can say of the noumenal reality of the objective world is that it
                    corresponds to the idea of the objects of experience as a completed whole in
                    themselves apart from the process whereby we know them, but whether there is any
                    such real world independent of the process of experience it is impossible to
                    say. Lastly, all that we can say of God is that He corresponds to the idea of
                    the unity of all things with the mind that knows them,— an ideal which is
                    involved in all knowledge,—but whether the realization of this idea in an
                    intuitive understanding is even possible we have no means of determining,
                    however we may suspect that understanding and sensibility are “branches
                    springing from the same unknown root.” The <hi rend="italic">Criticism, of Pure
                    Reason</hi> ends, therefore, in a kind of seesaw between two forms of
                    consciousness—a thinking consciousness, which transcends experience and sets
                    before us an idea of absolute reality, but which cannot attain to any knowledge
                    or even certitude of any object corresponding to this idea, and an empirical
                    consciousness, which gives us true knowledge of its objects, but whose objects
                    are determined as merely phenomenal and not absolutely real.</p>
                <p>The equipoise thus maintained between the empirical and the intelligible world
                    is, however, in the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Practical Reason,</hi>
                    overbalanced in favour of the latter. What the theoretical reason could not do
                    “in that it was weak through the flesh,” through its dependence on the very
                    empirical consciousness which it sought to transcend, is possible to the
                    practical reason, because it is primarily determined by itself. In our moral
                    consciousness we find ourselves under a law which calls upon us to <hi
                    rend="italic">act</hi> as beings who are absolutely self-determined or free, and
                    which, therefore, assures us that our intelligible self is our real self, and
                    conclusively determines our empirical self in contrast with it as phenomenal.
                    Thus the moral law gives reality to the intelligible world; or, as Kant
                    expresses it, “the idea of an intelligible world is a point of view beyond the
                    phenomenal which the reason sees itself compelled to take up, in order to think
                    of itself as practical.” In other words, the moral law presupposes freedom or
                    determination in the rational being as such, and makes him regard himself, not
                    merely as a link in the chain of conditioned existences in time and space, but
                    as the original source of his own life. The blank space beyond the phenomenal
                    thus begins to be filled up by the idea of a free causality which again
                    postulates a world adequate and conformable to itself. And the man who, as an
                    empiric individuality, is obliged to regard himself merely as an individual
                    being determined by other individual beings and things is authorized as a moral
                    being to treat this apparent necessity as having its reality in freedom, and to
                    look upon himself as the denizen of a spiritual world where nothing is
                    determined for him from without which is not simply the expression of his own
                    self-determination from within. “Thus we have found, what Aristotle could not
                    find, a fixed point on which reason can set its lever, not in any present or
                    future world, but in its own inner idea of freedom,—a point fixed for it by the
                    immovable moral law, as a secure basis from which it can move the human will,
                    even against the opposition of all the powers of nature.”<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kant, i. 638 (Rosenkranz’s
                    edition).</p></note> Starting from this idea of freedom, therefore, Kant
                    proceeds to reconstruct for <hi rend="italic">faith</hi> the unseen world, which
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Critique of Pure Reason</hi> he had denied as an object
                    of <hi rend="italic">knowledge.</hi> Nor is he content to leave the two worlds

                    Practical Reason,</hi> and still more in the <hi rend="italic">Critique of
                    Judgment,</hi> he brings them into relation to each other, and so gives to
                    theoretical reason a kind of authority to use for the explanation of the
                    phenomenal world those ideas which of itself it might be inclined to regard as
                    illusive.</p>
                <p>In all this, however, it is difficult to avoid seeing a partial retractation of
                    Kant’s first view as to the irreconcilable opposition of the phenomenal and the
                    noumenal. For, in the first place, the moral imperative is addressed to a self
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n94/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0094-0085"/> which is at one and the same time regarded in
                    both characters, and which is called upon to subsume under the moral law acts
                    which otherwise derive their character and meaning from the relations of the
                    phenomenal world. That the particular nature of men as phenomenal individuals
                    can be the means of realizing the universal law of reason is implied in all
                    Kant’s statements of the latter, and particularly in his conception of men as
                    constituting together a “kingdom of ends”; for it is difficult to conceive this
                    kingdom otherwise than as an organic unity of society, in which each individual,
                    by reason of his special tendencies and capacities, has a definite office to
                    fulfil in realizing the universal principle that binds all the members of the
                    kingdom to each other. The <hi rend="italic">summum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >bonum</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> again, is said to consist in the
                    union of happiness with goodness, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the empirical
                    conditions of man’s individual life as a sensible subject with the pure
                    self-determination of the intelligible self; and God is postulated as a <hi
                    rend="italic">Deus ex</hi><hi rend="italic">machina</hi> to bind together these
                    two unrelated elements,— a conception which shows the difficulty into which Kant
                    has brought himself by defining them as unrelated. Still more obvious is the
                    effort of Kant to get beyond the dualism of his first view of things in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Critique of Judgment.</hi> For in that work he maintains that the
                    consciousness of the beautiful and the sublime is or involves a harmony of the
                    understanding or the reason with sense; and, what is still more important, he
                    points out that the idea of organic unity, without which we cannot explain the
                    phenomena of life, contains in it a possibility of the reconciliation of freedom
                    and necessity, of the intelligible and the phenomenal. This idea, he argues, we
                    are authorized by our moral consciousness to apply to the whole course of the
                    things in the phenomenal world, and so to regard it as a process to realize the
                    moral ideal. No doubt he again partially retracts this view when he declares
                    that we must treat the idea of final causality as merely a <hi rend="italic"
                    >subjective</hi> principle of judgment, which, even in the case of living
                    beings, is to be regarded only as necessary for us as finite intelligences. But
                    such saving clauses, in which Kant recurs to the dualism with which he started,
                    cannot hide from us how near he has come to the renunciation of it.</p>
                <p>When we regard Kant in this way as asserting from one point of view an absolute
                    limit which from another point of view he permits us to transcend, it becomes
                    obvious that his philosophy is in an unstable equilibrium, which cannot but be
                    disturbed by any one who attempts to develop or even to restate his ideas. Hence
                    we need not wonder that those who take in earnest his denunciations of any
                    attempt to transcend experience generally,—like Professor Huxley,—reject as
                    worthless all Kant’s later work; and that, on the other side, those who take in
                    earnest his ideas of freedom, of organic unity, of an intuitive understanding,
                    and of a <hi rend="italic">summum</hi><hi rend="italic">bonum</hi> in which
                    freedom and necessity meet together, are compelled to break through the
                    arbitrary line which he drew between knowledge and belief. In favour of the
                    former course it is easy in many places to appeal to the letter of Kant. In
                    favour of the latter it need only be pointed out that, in Kant’s view, all
                    experience rests upon, or is in its development guided by, those ideas which yet
                    he will not permit us to treat as sources of knowledge. Hence the principles of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Critique</hi> cannot legitimately be used against
                    metaphysic, except by those who are prepared to admit the ideas of reason, up to
                    the point to which he admits them, as ideas that limit and direct our
                    experience,—while rejecting all use of them to cast light upon that which is
                    beyond experience. In other words, they must maintain the possibility of a
                    purely negative knowledge, of the knowledge of a limit by one who yet cannot go
                    beyond it. They must show how we can have an ideal of knowledge which enables us
                    to criticize experience without enabling us to transform it; they must show how
                    ideas of the supersensible can so far be present to our thought as to make
                    visible the boundaries of the prison of sense in which we are confined, without
                    in any way enabling us to escape from it.</p>
                <p>Is this possible? We may gather up the Kantian antithesis in the assertion that
                    experience is the imperfect realization of an ideal of knowledge, derived from
                    reason, with materials, derived from sense and understanding, the nature of
                    which is such that they can never be brought into correspondence with the ideal.
                    But this ideal, in all its three forms, as we have seen, is simply the idea of a
                    pure unity or identity in which all differences are lost or dissolved—whether
                    they be the differences of the inner or of the outer life, or finally the
                    difference of inner and outer, subjective and objective, from each other. Kant’s
                    view therefore is, in effect, this, that thought carries with it the
                    consciousness of an identity or unity, to which our actual experience in none of
                    its forms fully corresponds. On the other hand, Kant does not hesitate equally
                    to condemn the identity of thought as “empty” and subjective, because it does
                    not contain in itself nor can evolve from itself the complex matter of
                    experience. But this alternate condemnation of experience as unreal from the
                    point of view of the ideas, and of the ideas as unreal from the point of view of
                    experience, seems to show that <hi rend="italic">both</hi> are unreal, as being
                    abstract elements, which have no value save in their relation to each other, and
                    which lose all their meaning when separated from the unity to which they belong.
                    According to this view, ideas and experience, noumena and phenomena, if they are
                    opposed, are also necessarily related to each other. If our empirical
                    consciousness of the world of objects in space and time, as determined by the
                    categories, does not correspond to the unity or identity of thought which is our
                    ideal of knowledge, yet that idea of unity or identity is set up by thought in
                    <hi rend="italic">relation</hi> to experience, and cannot, therefore, be
                    essentially irreconcilable with it. The two terms may be opposed, but their
                    opposition cannot be absolute, seeing that they are in essential relation to
                    each other. It is a great logical error not to discern that a negative relation
                    is still a relation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that it has a positive unity
                    beyond it. This positive unity may not, indeed, be consciously present to us in
                    our immediate apprehension of the relation in question, but it is necessarily
                    implied in it. Now it is just because, in his separation of noumena and
                    phenomena, Kant omits to note their essential relativity that he is forced to
                    regard the former as a set of abstract identities of which nothing can be known,
                    and the latter as the imperfect products of a synthesis which can never be
                    completed or brought to a true unity. Yet the value of his whole treatment of
                    the ideas of reason in relation to our intellectual and moral experience arises
                    from the fact that in practice he does not hold to this abstract separation of
                    the two elements. Ideas absolutely incommensurable with experience could neither
                    stimulate nor guide our empirical synthesis; they could not even be brought into
                    any connexion with it. When, therefore, Kant brings them into this connexion, he
                    necessarily alters their meaning. Hence the pure abstract identity which
                    excludes all difference is changed, in its application, into the idea of an
                    organic unity, of which the highest type is found in self-consciousness, with
                    its transparent difference of the subjective and objective self. It would be
                    absurd and meaningless to say that science seeks to reduce experience to an
                    abstract identity, in which there is no difference, unless for this were tacitly
                    substituted what is really an entirely different proposition, that science seeks
                    to find in the infinitely diversified world of space and time that unity in
                    difference of which self-consciousness has in itself the pattern. It is in
                    reference to the former kind <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n95/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0095-0086"/> of identity—the abstract oneness of formal
                    logic—that Kant proves that it is impossible for experience to be made adequate
                    to ideas. But it is only of the latter kind of identity—the oneness of
                    self-consciousness—that it can be said that it furnishes a guiding principle to
                    scientific investigation or an ideal of knowledge. The same confusion is still
                    more evident in Kant’s account of our moral experience, in dealing with which he
                    directly attempts to get synthetic propositions out of the pure identity of
                    reason, in other words, to draw definite moral laws out of the logical principle
                    of non-contradiction. Whatever success he attains is gained by substituting for
                    the formal principle of <hi rend="italic">self-consistency</hi> the positive
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">consistency •with the self,</hi> and again by
                    conceiving this self as a concrete individual, the member of a society, and so
                    standing in essential relation to other selves. The pure abstraction from all
                    the external results of action and from all motives of desire, which at the
                    beginning of the <hi rend="italic">Metaphysic of Ethics</hi> Kant declares to be
                    essential to morality, is modified and indeed transformed, as we go on, by the
                    admissions that other rational beings are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> external to
                    us in any sense that excludes their good from being an end of our endeavour, and
                    that the desires are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> irrational and immoral except in
                    so far as they are directed to the pleasures of the sensuous individual (which
                    in a conscious being they never entirely are). Both in the speculative and in
                    the practical sphere, therefore, the absolute opposition of the ideal or
                    noumenal to the empirical disappears, as soon as Kant attempts to apply it. For
                    in both the abstract identity of formal logic, which is really the meaning of
                    the noumenon as absolutely opposed to and incommensurable with experience, gives
                    way to the unity of self-consciousness,—a unity which is so far from being <hi
                    rend="italic">absolutely</hi> opposed to the difference of the empirical
                    consciousness that it necessarily implies it. For selfconsciousness presupposes
                    the consciousness of objects; though it is opposed to that consciousness, it is
                    essentially correlated with it, and therefore its opposition cannot be regarded
                    as absolute, or incapable of being transcended.</p>
                <p>These considerations may throw some light on the relation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Analytic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Dialectic</hi> of Kant, and on
                    the nature of the opposition of noumenon and phenomenon as it is presented in
                    the latter. In the deduction of the categories, Kant pointed out the essential
                    relation of the objective world of experience to what he called the
                    “transcendental unity of apperception”; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> he pointed
                    out that the unity of consciousness is implied in all its objects. This unity,
                    he further showed, must be conceived as “capable of self-consciousness ”; but it
                    actually becomes conscious of self only in relation, though also in opposition,
                    to the other objects determined by it. Now it is this consciousness of itself in
                    opposition to other objects which is the source of Kant’s “ideas of reason,” of
                    the dissatisfaction of the mind with its empirical knowledge, even in its
                    scientific form, and of the demand for a higher kind of knowledge to which
                    experience is not adequate. That a standard is set up for experience by which it
                    is condemned is simply a result of the further development of that unity which
                    is implied in experience—a result of the progress of thought from consciousness
                    to self-consciousness, and of the contrast between the former and the latter.
                    The problem with which Kant’s <hi rend="italic">Dialectic</hi> attempts to deal,
                    and which it treats as insoluble, is, therefore, simply the problem of <hi
                    rend="italic">raising consciousness to the form of self-consciousness</hi>; in
                    other words, of attaining to a knowledge of the world of experience as not
                    merely a “synthetic,’’and therefore imperfect, unity of things external to each
                    other, but as an organic unity of transparent differences, a
                    self-differentiating, self-integrating unity, such as seems to be presented to
                    us in pure self-consciousness. Nor can this problem be regarded as insoluble;
                    for the unity of self-consciousness is identical with the unity of
                    consciousness; it is only that unity become self-conscious. Hence the point of
                    view at which consciousness and selfconsciousness seem to be absolutely opposed
                    to each other,— the highest point of view which Kant <hi rend="italic"
                    >distinctly</hi> reaches,— can be regarded only as a stage of transition from
                    the point at which their relative difference and opposition is not yet developed
                    to the point at which they are seen to be the factors or elements of a still
                    higher unity.</p>
                <p>The later philosophy of Germany, from Kant to Hegel, is little more than the
                    development of the idea just stated in its twofold aspect. In the first place,
                    it is an attempt to show what is involved in the idea of thought or
                    selfconsciousness as in itself an organic whole, a many-in-one, a unity which
                    expresses itself in difference, yet so that the difference remains transparent,
                    and therefore is immediately recognized as expression of the unity. In the
                    second place, it is an attempt to bridge over the difference between thought or
                    self-consciousness and the external world of experience, and to show that this
                    opposition also is subordinated to a higher unity. Or, to put it more directly,
                    the idealistic philosophy of Germany seeks, on the one hand, to develop a logic
                    or metaphysic which bases itself, not, like formal logic, on the idea of bare
                    identity, but on the idea of self-consciousness; and, on the other hand, to
                    show, in a philosophy of nature and spirit, how, by means of this logic, the
                    opposition of thought to its object, or of the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    to the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> in knowledge, may be transcended. In
                    the third and fourth sections of this article something more will be said of the
                    manner in which this task was fulfilled. Here only a few words are necessary to
                    sum up the results reached, and to give more distinctness to the new ideal of
                    knowledge which those results suggest. We have seen that Kant’s critical
                    attitude involved two things,—on the one hand, the assertion that the existence
                    we know is necessarily existence for thought, and, on the other hand, the denial
                    that that which exists for our thought is absolute reality, a denial which again
                    involves the presence to our thought of an ideal of knowledge, by which our
                    actual knowledge is condemned. This ideal, however, was falsely conceived by
                    Kant as an identity without any difference, and, in this sense, he does not
                    hesitate to apply it even to self-consciousness itself. For, in a remarkable
                    passage,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Kritik,</hi> p. 279 (Rosenkranz’s edition), <hi rend="italic"
                    >cf.</hi> Hegel, v. p. 258.</p></note> he attempts to prove that the
                    consciousness of self is not a knowledge of the self, by a simple reference to
                    the duality of the self knowing and the self known, arguing that the ego “stands
                    in its own way,” just because it exists only/or <hi rend="italic">itself,
                    i.e.,</hi> because in knowing itself it presupposes itself. Kant evidently
                    thinks that to know the real self it would be necessary to apprehend it in
                    simple identity as purely an object without reference to a subject, or purely a
                    subject without reference to an object. Yet to this it seems sufficient to
                    answer that such an object or subject would lose its character as object or
                    subject and become equivalent to mere being in general, and that, as such being
                    is a mere abstraction, to know it cannot be the ideal of knowledge. If therefore
                    there be a unity or identity of thought which is not realized in experience, and
                    in reference to which we can regard experience as an jmperfect form of
                    knowledge, it cannot be found in this abstract identity of being. In truth, as
                    we have seen, it is found in that very idea of self-consciousness which Kant is
                    criticizing. Just because we are self-conscious, and therefore oppose the unity
                    of the conscious self to the manifoldness of the world in space and time, do we
                    seek <hi rend="italic">in</hi> the world of space and time for a transparent
                    unity which we cannot at first find there. But, when this is seen, we find in
                    Kant himself the partial solution of the difficulty, <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n96/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0096-0087"/> Self-consciousness presupposes consciousness;
                    for, while the apprehension of objects in consciousness is possible only in
                    relation to the unity of the self, yet it is only in relation to and distinction
                    from these objects that we are conscious of that unity. Hence the two opposites,
                    self and not-self, are bound together, and presuppose a unity which reveals
                    itself in their opposition, and which, when made explicit, must reconcile them.
                    If, therefore, selfconsciousness, in its first opposition to consciousness,
                    gives rise to an ideal of knowledge to which our empirical knowledge of objects
                    is inadequate, this arises from the fact that not only empirical knowledge but
                    also the ideal to which it is opposed is imperfect, or that they both point to a
                    unity which is manifested in their difference, and which is capable of
                    containing and resolving it. In other words, the opposition of science to its
                    ideal, which Kant has stated in his <hi rend="italic">Antinomies,</hi> is not an
                    absolute opposition, but one the origin and end of which can be seen.</p>
                <p>This opposition reaches its highest point in the contrast between the transparent
                    unity of self-consciousness, in which the difference of knower and known is
                    evanescent, and the essential manifoldness and self-externality of the world in
                    space, in which the differences seem to be insoluble. We must, indeed, think of
                    self-consciousness as having life in itself and therefore as differentiating
                    itself from itself; but this differentiation is held within the limit of its
                    unity, it is a separation of movements which are separated only as they are
                    united. On the other hand, the world in space presents itself as the sphere of
                    external determination, in which things are primarily disunited and act only as
                    they are acted on from without, and in which this external influence never goes
                    so far as to destroy their reciprocal externality. In this sense it is that the
                    opposition of mind and matter was taken by Descartes, and it is a survival of
                    the same mode of thought that leads many even now to draw absolute lines of
                    division between <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori,</hi> between ideas and facts, between spiritual and natural. Kant
                    and Fichte give a new aspect to the difficulty by showing that the difficulty is
                    one of reconciling consciousness and self-consciousness, and that in
                    consciousness there is already present the unity which is manifested in
                    self-consciousness, as, on the other hand, it is only through consciousness and
                    in opposition to it that self-consciousness is possible. And Fichte made a
                    further step when he attempted to show that the categories and the forms of
                    perception, time and space, which Kant had taken as inexplicable facts, are
                    implied in this contrast of consciousness and self-consciousness. The error that
                    clings to Fichte’s speculations is, however, that he treats consciousness merely
                    as a necessary illusion which exists simply with a view to self-consciousness,
                    and hence is led to regard self-consciousness itself—because it is essentially
                    related to this necessary illusion—as a schema or image of an unknowable
                    absolute. In fact, in the end Fichte falls back upon the abstract identity in
                    which Kant had found his noumenon, and so ends his philosophy with mysticism.
                    Even Schelling, though he saw that the absolute unity must be one that
                    transcends the difference of self and not-self, did not finally escape the
                    tendency to merge all difference in absolute oneness. On the other hand, it was
                    the endeavour of Hegel to proceed in the opposite way,— not to lose
                    self-consciousness or subjectivity in a mere unity of substance, but rather to
                    show that the absolute substance can be truly defined only as a self-conscious
                    subject. And just because he did this he was prepared to take a further step,
                    and to regard the external world, uot as Fichte regarded it, as merely the
                    opposite of spirit, nor as Schelling regarded it, as merely the repetition and
                    co-equal of spirit, but rather as its necessary manifestation or as that in and
                    through which alone it can realize itself. His doctrine therefore might be
                    summed up in two propositions,—first, that the absolute substance is spiritual
                    or self-conscious, and, secondly, that the absolute subject or spirit can be
                    conceived as realizing itself only through that very world of externality which
                    at first appears as its opposite. In both respects Hegel’s philosophy reverses
                    the <hi rend="italic">via</hi><hi rend="italic">negativa</hi> of mysticism, and
                    teaches that it is only through the exhaustion of difference that the unity of
                    science, of which the mind contains in itself the certitude, is to be realized.
                    For mind or spirit, viewed in itself, is conceived as a self-differentiating
                    unity, a unity which exists only through opposition of itself to itself. And it
                    is but a necessary result of such a conception that spirit can fully realize its
                    unity only through a world which in the first instance must present itself as
                    the extreme opposite of spirit. Hence the process of thought in itself, which is
                    exhibited in the logic, ends in the opposition to thought of a world which is
                    its negative counterpart. And the “absolute spirit” of Hegel is thus, not pure
                    self-consciousness, but that more concrete unity of self-consciousness with
                    itself which it attains through and by means of this world.</p>
                <p>The effect of this view upon the relation of metaphysic to science, which we are
                    at present considering, is noticeable. It does not, as is often supposed,
                    supersede science by an <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> construction of the
                    universe, nor does it leave the results of science unchanged and simply provide
                    for it a deeper foundation. The latter was the point at which Kant and Fichte
                    stopped; for, while they showed the relativity of experience to the principle of
                    self-consciousness, they conceived that the function of metaphysic is completed
                    in showing the phenomenal character of the objects of science, and in reserving
                    a free space beyond the phenomenal world for “God, freedom, and immortality.”
                    Schelling, on the other hand, as he did not adopt this merely negative view of
                    the relation of spirit to nature or of <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> to
                    empirical truth, was obliged to reinterpret the latter by the former. As,
                    however, he did not recognize any distinctions which were not merely
                    quantitative, he was led to apply the same easy key to every lock, and to think
                    that he had explained all the different forms of existence, organic and
                    inorganic, when he had merely pointed out a certain analogy between them. The
                    metaphysic of Hegel, whatever may be said of the actual philosophy of nature
                    produced by its author, contains no necessity for any such arbitrary procedure.
                    In his <hi rend="italic">Logic,</hi> indeed, he attempts to give us <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">abstracto</hi> the movement of thought in
                    itself, from its simplest determination of being as qualitative or quantitative,
                    through the reflective categories of substance and cause, up to its full
                    consciousness of itself in its organic unity.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This subject—the progress of thought from
                    lower to higher categories and methods—will be more fully discussed in the third
                    section.</p></note> And in so doing he of course gives us an account of the
                    various categories which science uses in the interpretation of nature. He
                    further attempts to show that the highest categories of science are in
                    themselves imperfect and self-contradictory,—in other words, that they mark a
                    stage of thought which falls short of that unity of being and knowing after
                    which science is striving, and which is the presupposition as well as the goal
                    of all intelligence. But, while he does this, he clearly acknowledges two
                    things,—on the one hand that nature is essentially different from pure
                    selfconsciousness, and that therefore logic can never by direct evolution of its
                    categories anticipate the investigations of science, and, in the second place,
                    that the final interpretation of nature through the highest categories
                    presupposes its interpretation by the lower categories, and cannot be directly
                    achieved without it. In other words, <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0097-0088"/> science must first determine the laws of nature
                    according to the principles of causality and reciprocity, ere philosophy can be
                    in a position to discover the ultimate meaning of nature by the aid of higher
                    principles. “The philosophy of nature,” says Hegel, “takes up the material which
                    physical science by direct dealing with experience has prepared for it at the
                    point to which science has brought it, and again transforms this formed material
                    without going back to experience to verify it. Science must, therefore, work
                    into the hands of philosophy, in order that philosophy in its turn may translate
                    the lower universality of the understanding realized by science into the higher
                    universality of reason, and may show how in the light of this higher
                    universality the intelligible world takes the aspect of a whole which has its
                    necessity in itself. The philosophic way of looking at things is not a
                    capricious attempt, once in a way for a change, to walk upon one’s head after
                    one has got tired of walking upon one’s feet, or to transform one’s work-a-day
                    face by painting it over; but, just because the scientific manner of knowing
                    does not satisfy the whole demand of intelligence, philosophy must supplement it
                    by another manner of knowing.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hegel, vii. p. 18.</p></note></p>
                <p>The result then may be briefly expressed thus. Kant and his successors showed the
                    relativity of the object of knowledge to the knowing mind. He thus pointed out
                    that the ordinary consciousness, and even science, are abstract and imperfect
                    modes of knowing, in so far as in their determination of objects they take no
                    account of a factor which is always present, to wit, the knowing subject. For
                    <hi rend="italic">their</hi> purposes, indeed, this abstraction is justifiable
                    and necessary, for by it they are enabled within their prescribed limits to give
                    a more complete view of these objects in their relation to each other than if
                    the attempt had been made to regard them also in relation to the knowing
                    subject. At the same time the scientific result so arrived at is imperfect and
                    incomplete, and it has to be reconsidered in the light of a philosophy which
                    retracts this provisional abstraction. For it must be remembered that the fact
                    that science looks at things only in their relation to each other, and not to
                    the knowing mind, narrows the points of view or categories under which it is
                    able to regard them, or, in other words, limits the questions which the mind is
                    able to put to nature. Just because science does not treat its objects as
                    essentially related to the mind, it is unable to rise to what Hegel calls the
                    point of view of reason, or of the “notion”; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is
                    obliged to treat objects and their relations merely under a set of categories,
                    the highest of which are those of causality and reciprocity, and it is incapable
                    of attaining to the conception of their organic unity. In other words, it is
                    able to reach only a synthetic unity of given differences, and it cannot
                    discover a principle of unity out of which the differences spring and to which
                    they return. Now philosophy goes beyond science just because, along with the
                    idea of the relativity of things to the mind, it brings in the conception of
                    such a unity. Its highest aim is, therefore, not merely, as Kant still held, to
                    secure a place for the supersensible beyond the region of experience, but to
                    reinterpret experience, in the light of a unity which is presupposed in it, but
                    which cannot be made conscious or explicit until the relation of experience to
                    the thinking self is seen,—the unity of all things with each other and with the
                    mind that knows them.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Relation of Metaphysic to Psychology.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> It has already been shown that the doctrine that the thinking subject is
                    presupposed in all objects of knowledge—or, in other words, that existence means
                    existence for a conscious self —is not to be taken in a psychological sense. The
                    idea that all science is based on psychology, and that, therefore, metaphysic
                    and psychology are identical, cannot be retained by any one who has entered into
                    the full meaning of the Kantian criticism. It is, however, so natural a
                    misinterpretation of it, and it is so much favoured by the letter of the very
                    book in which it was first decisively refuted, that it will be useful to point
                    out more directly the fallacy involved in it, especially as this will place us
                    in a better position to determine the true relation of the two parts of
                    philosophy thus confounded.</p>
                <p>The misunderstanding first took a definite form in the introduction to Locke’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> in which he proposes to provide against any undue
                    application of the intellectual powers of man to problems which are too high for
                    them, by first examining and measuring the powers themselves. Stated in this
                    way, it is obvious that the proposal involves an absurdity; for we have nothing
                    to measure with, except the very powers that are to be measured. To see round
                    our knowledge and find its boundary, we must stand outside of it, and where is
                    such a standing ground to be found? We cannot by knowing prescribe limits to
                    knowledge, or, if we seem to be able to do so, it can only be because we compare
                    our actual knowledge with some idea of knowledge which we presuppose. In this
                    way the ancient sceptics—and modern writers like Sir W. Hamilton and Mr Spencer
                    who have followed them—turned the duality involved in the idea of knowledge
                    against its unity, and argued that, because we cannot know the object except as
                    different from and related to the subject, we cannot know it as it is in itself.
                    Obviously in this argument it is involved that in true or absolute knowledge the
                    object must not be distinguished at all from the subject, —to which the easy
                    answer is that <hi rend="italic">without</hi> such distinction knowledge would
                    be impossible. The sceptic argument, therefore, lands us in the unhappy case
                    pictured in the German proverb: “If water chokes us, what shall we drink?” The
                    object cannot be known if it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> distinguished from the
                    subject, and it cannot be known if it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi>
                    distinguished from the subject. Obviously the one objection is as good as the
                    other, and both combined only show that the idea of knowledge involves
                    distinction as well as unity, and unity as well as distinction. The sceptic
                    insists on one of these characteristics to the exclusion of the other, and
                    condemns our actual knowledge because it contains both. In Kant there is
                    undoubtedly some trace of the same fallacy, in so far as the idea by contrast
                    with which he condemns the objects of experience as phenomenal is the idea of an
                    abstract identity without any difference; but we have seen that with him this
                    abstract identity is on the point of passing into an altogether different
                    idea—the idea of self-consciousness as the type of knowledge.</p>
                <p>It appears, then, that the idea of measuring our powers before we employ them
                    rests on a paralogism; for what is really meant is that we abstract one of the
                    elements of the idea of knowledge, and then condemn knowledge for having other
                    elements in it. It is possible to criticize and condemn special conceptions, as
                    not conforming to our idea of knowledge; but it is not possible to criticize the
                    idea of knowledge itself; all we can do is to explain it. It is possible to see
                    the limited and hypothetical character of certain of our ideas or explanations
                    of things, because we are conscious that in developing them we have left out of
                    account certain elements necessary to the whole truth; but this criticism itself
                    implies, as the standard to which we appeal, a consciousness of truth and
                    reality, a consciousness which we cannot further criticize. Here, therefore, we
                    come upon what must seem to all who think it admissible to question the very
                    possibility of knowledge an inevitable reasoning in a circle. We can answer
                    objections only by means of the very idea which they dispute. But the <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n98/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0098-0089"/> answer is nevertheless a good one; for the
                    objector also stands within the very circle which he seeks to break, and has no
                    means of breaking it except itself. As soon as he speaks, he can be refuted by
                    his own words; for his doubts also presuppose that unity of the intelligence and
                    the intelligible world which he pretends to deny.</p>
                <p>The error, however, cannot be fully corrected until we consider what gives it
                    plausibility. The confusion of the metaphysical with the psychological problem
                    is due to the fact that the being who is the subject of knowledge, for whom all
                    exists that does exist, appears to be one, and only one, of the many objects of
                    knowledge. When we say that existence means only an existence for a thinking
                    self, we seem to be identifying the whole world with the feelings and ideas of
                    men, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> with certain phenomena that belong to the life
                    of a class of beings which only forms a part of that world,—phenomena, moreover,
                    that are not exactly the same in any two of that class of beings. If we are to
                    escape this difficulty it is obvious that we must be able to separate the
                    conscious self or subject, as it is implied in all knowledge, from the nature of
                    man as a being who “though formally self-conscious” is yet “part of this partial
                    world,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one of the objects which we know along with
                    and in distinction from other objects, and in whom “the self-consciousness which
                    is in itself complete, and which in its completeness includes the world as its
                    object,” is only progressively realized.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Hume, vol. i. p. 131 (Green’s edition).</p></note>
                    Metaphysic has to deal with conditions of the knowable, and hence with
                    self-consciousness as that unity which is implied in all that is and is known.
                    Psychology has to inquire how this self-consciousness is realized or developed
                    in man, in whom the consciousness of self grows with the consciousness of a
                    world in space and time, of which he individually is only a part, and to parts
                    of which only he stands in immediate relation. In considering the former
                    question we are considering the sphere within which all knowledge and all
                    objects of knowledge are contained. In considering the latter we are selecting
                    one particular object or class of objects within this sphere,— although no doubt
                    it must make a great difference in our treatment of this object that we have to
                    consider it as existing not only for us but for itself. If nature “becomes
                    self-conscious in man,” it is impossible to treat man <hi rend="italic"
                    >merely</hi> as one among the other objects of nature. But it is not less true
                    that he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> one of those objects, and, in this point of
                    view, the department of science and philosophy that deals with his life is as
                    distinct from metaphysic— which deals with the conditions of all knowing and
                    being —as is astronomy or physics. In both cases we have before us objects which
                    we may consider in themselves apart from their relations to the conscious
                    subject, and in both cases we must take cognizance of these relations if we
                    would have a complete and final view of those objects. It is possible to have a
                    purely objective anthropology or psychology—which abstracts from the relation of
                    man to the mind that knows him—just as it is possible to have a purely objective
                    science of nature. Such a natural science of man, however, will necessarily
                    abstract at the same time from the fact that in man is manifested that universal
                    principle in relation to which all things are and are known. In other words, it
                    will omit that distinctive characteristic of man’s being in virtue of which he
                    is a subject of knowledge and a moral agent. Hence the abstraction in this case
                    is more likely to lead to positive error, more likely to produce not only an
                    imperfect but a distorted view of the object. Inorganic nature, if we take it
                    <hi rend="italic">in itself,</hi> is not untruly viewed, under the categories of
                    causality and reciprocity, as a collection of objects externally determined by
                    each other; the error lies only in taking it as if it could exist in itself.
                    Even organic beings do not suffer much injustice in being brought under such
                    categories; for, though, as living and still more as sensitive beings, they
                    involve in themselves and in their relation to the world a kind of unity of
                    differences to which the categories of external relation imperfectly correspond,
                    yet they are not such unities <hi rend="italic">for themselves,</hi> but only
                    <hi rend="italic">forus.</hi> In other words, the principle through which they
                    are and are known is still external to them. Hence also they are determined by
                    outward influences, though these influences act rather as stimuli to what we may
                    call the self-determined movement of their own life than as mechanical or
                    chemical forces which change it. But in man, in so far as he is
                    self-conscious,—and it is self-consciousness that makes him man, —the unity
                    through which all things are and are known is manifested; and therefore he is
                    emancipated, or at least is continually emancipating himself, from the law of
                    external influence. Nature and necessity exist for him as that from which his
                    life starts, in relation to which he becomes conscious of himself, against which
                    he has to assert himself, and in the complete overcoming of which lies the end
                    of all his endeavour. Nature is the negative rather than the positive
                    starting-point of his existence, the presupposition against which he reacts
                    rather than that on which he proceeds; and, therefore, to treat him simply as a
                    natural being is even more inaccurate and misleading than to forget or deny his
                    relation to nature altogether. A true psychology must, however, avoid both
                    errors: it must conceive man as at once spiritual and natural; it must find a
                    reconciliation of freedom and necessity. It must face all the difficulties
                    involved in the conception of the absolute principle of
                    self-consciousness,—through which all things are and are known,—as manifesting
                    itself in the life of a being like man, who “comes to himself” only by a long
                    process of development out of the unconsciousness of a merely animal
                    existence.</p>
                <p>This problem first presented itself in a distinct form in the discussions of the
                    Socratic school as to the nature of knowledge, discussions which turn mainly
                    upon the relation of the conscious to the unconscious element in thought.
                    Socrates, by his method more than by any direct statement, drew attention to the
                    fact that all particular judgments in morals involve or presuppose a universal
                    principle. At the same time he pointed out that, so far from this universal
                    principle being known to those who are continually making such judgments, they
                    are not even conscious of its existence. They constantly use general terms whose
                    meaning they have never even thought of defining. The beginning of a rational
                    life for them must therefore lie in their becoming conscious of their ignorance,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> conscious that they have been all along judging,
                    and therefore acting, on untested and even unknown assumptions. They must bring
                    the unconscious universal to the light of day and define it, for until that is
                    done it is impossible to live a moral, that is, a rational life. “Virtue is
                    knowledge,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it is acting, not according to
                    opinions, or particular judgments,—whose universal is unknown, and which
                    therefore may be regarded as expressing merely the impulses or habits of the
                    individual,—but in view of a universal principle determined by reason.</p>
                <p>The onesidedness of this view—which absolutely condemns as vice all virtue that
                    is not based on conscious principle—was partly corrected by another part of the
                    doctrine of Socrates, who taught that knowledge is something that must be
                    evolved from within the mind, and not merely communicated to it from without.
                    For this implies that the moral principle may be present in men’s minds, and may
                    rule their thoughts and actions, long before they become directly conscious of
                    it. They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> rational although they have never thought
                    about reason, and they <pb break="no"

                    act morally, any more than they wait for logic to reason correctly. It is this
                    line of thought which is universalized and mythically expressed by Plato in his
                    doctrine of “reminiscence.” According to this myth, we were conscious of ideas
                    or universals in our pre-natal state <hi rend="italic">; we</hi> forgot them in
                    the shock of birth into this mortal life; but in feeling or sharing the rapture
                    of the poet or the lover we recall them as identified or confused with
                    individual objects which “are like them, or partake in them.” The same
                    explanation is given of the practical skill of the general and the statesman,
                    and even of the “right opinion” which guides the ordinary good man. Such opinion
                    is neither knowledge nor ignorance: not knowledge, for general principles or
                    ideas are not in it present to the mind <hi rend="italic">as</hi> ideas, and
                    therefore the particular cannot be distinctly subsumed under them; yet not
                    ignorance, for the ideas are after all present, though wrapped up in the
                    particulars or confused with them. Nay, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theaetetus,</hi> Plato endeavours to show that the pure particular without the
                    universal, sensations without ideas, cannot enter into our consciousness at all,
                    and that therefore the lowest point to which a conscious being can descend is
                    “opinion,” in which particular and universal, sensible and intelligible, are
                    mingled together. In other words, no conscious being can apprehend the
                    particular except through the universal, though that universal may be present
                    only <hi rend="italic">in</hi> consciousness and not <hi rend="italic">to</hi>
                    it. The task of philosophy is therefore only to make men “recollect themselves,”
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> to make <hi rend="italic">self-conscious</hi> that
                    universality of thought in which all rational beings “partake,” or which, in the
                    language of later philosophy, constitutes reason. The imperfection of Plato’s
                    view lay, however, in this, that, while he clearly recognized that the condition
                    of all consciousness of the particular is the universal, he did not see with
                    equal clearness that the universal has a meaning only in relation to the
                    particular. And this tendency to separate universal from particular is naturally
                    accompanied by a tendency to set the subjective against the objective, and to
                    regard the world, not as the manifestation of reason, but as a dualistic world,
                    in which reason is chained to a lower principle—a world which can at best only
                    give a hint or suggestion to the mind to enable it to recollect itself and
                    recover for itself its own treasures. Thus the false method of introspection,
                    the “high <hi rend="italic">priori</hi> road” of mysticism, was at least opened
                    up by Plato, if he did not altogether forsake the narrower and harder way to the
                    spiritual world through nature and experience.</p>
                <p>The great step in advance taken by Aristotle was due to his seeing the danger of
                    this tendency. Those, however, who have maintained that Aristotle is the great
                    <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> philosopher,—as Plato is the great <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> philosopher,— have entirely mistaken the bearing of
                    Aristotle’s criticism •of the Platonic theory. As strongly as Plato does
                    Aristotle maintain that reason is δw&lt;i∕χeι πάντα τα <hi rend="italic"
                    >νοητά,</hi> and that, therefore, the apprehension of truth <hi rend="italic"
                    >by</hi> the mind is not a mere external communication of it <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> the mind, but rather is the mind coming to a consciousness of itself.
                    As firmly as Plato does he declare that truth in its highest form is
                    self-evidencing, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> that the principles of science,
                    the laws of nature, when once they have been discovered, are seen to be true by
                    their own light. His statements to this •effect have been neglected or explained
                    away, because they were supposed to be inconsistent with his still more
                    frequently reiterated assertions that it is only from experience and by
                    induction that the truth of things can be discovered. Writers of a later
                    day,—who came to Aristotle with an idea of a fixed opposition between <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> and who
                    held that the only possible alternatives were <hi rend="italic">either</hi> to
                    divide knowledge between the two <hi rend="italic">or</hi> to explain away one
                    of them,—could not comprehend that Aristotle might be in earnest <hi
                    rend="italic">both</hi> in asserting that knowledge is derived from experience
                    <hi rend="italic">and</hi> in asserting that it is an apprehension by reason of
                    that which is identical with itself and needs no extraneous evidence. But
                    Aristotle started with no such fixed opposition. On the contrary, any one who
                    reads the last chapter of the <hi rend="italic">Posterior Analytics</hi> will
                    see that he had no difficulty in maintaining that knowledge begins in the
                    apprehension of το <hi rend="italic">καθ'</hi><hi rend="italic">eκaστov</hi> in
                    sense perception, and that it proceeds from many perceptions to experience, and
                    from many experiences to science; while at the same time he declared that the
                    principles of science have their evidence in themselves. And the meaning of this
                    declaration is shown in the <hi rend="italic">De Anima,</hi> where we find him
                    speaking of knowledge as the realization in the “passive reason” of man of an
                    “active reason” which is eternal and unchangeable, and which in the
                    consciousness of itself includes the knowledge of all things. Of this
                    realization, indeed, there is in man only the potentiality or capacity, but just
                    because this is a pure or universal capacity, because, as Aristotle puts it, it
                    has no quality or determination of its own to stand between it and its objects,
                    it is a capacity in which the absolute reason can realize itself, a capacity of
                    knowing all things. Here we have Plato’s myth of reminiscence freed from the
                    metaphor of memory, and reduced to scientific terms <hi rend="italic">; for</hi>
                    that myth simply meant that the evolution of knowledge is the development of the
                    mind to the consciousness of itself, and of all that is potentially in it. Only,
                    by the combination of this doctrine with the idea of the necessity of induction,
                    Aristotle at the same time guards against the purely subjective interpretation
                    to which in Plato it was liable. For the process by which the mind “comes to
                    itself” is conceived as a process by which at the same time it rises from the
                    particular to the universal, from the <hi rend="italic">γνώριμα ήμΐν</hi> to the
                    <hi rend="italic">γνώριμα</hi> απλώς, from the bare apprehension of the facts of
                    experience to the knowledge of them through their principles or laws.</p>
                <p>Yet Aristotle was as little able as Plato to work out fully a theory of the
                    relation between the universal and the individual reason; and the cause of this
                    failure was in both cases substantially the same. In Plato’s philosophy, the
                    ideal tended to divorce itself from the phenomenal world in such wise that the
                    latter was regarded only as suggesting or partaking in the former, but not as
                    entirely explicable by it. It was not merely that, to the mind of the individual
                    in its progress, the veil was only gradually lifted from the rationality of the
                    world, but that in the world there was an irrational element from which the mind
                    could save itself only by flight into the region of abstraction. And, though
                    Aristotle by his doctrine of the essential relation of ideas to experience, or
                    of the development of the mind to the acquisition of knowledge of the world,
                    seemed to be on the way to correct this error, yet he too shrinks from regarding
                    the phenomenal world as in itself intelligible. To him also an irrational matter
                    mingles with things, and is in them a source of contingency and imperfection.
                    Chance is not merely the reflexion upon the world of our imperfect knowledge,
                    but a fact of experience, and there is therefore a region in which our best
                    science cannot rise above generality to universality. In this way there remains
                    for Aristotle an absolute <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> a reality which
                    cannot be understood, and which we can scarcely conceive as existing at all for
                    the divine intelligence. At this point the Aristotelian philosophy appears to
                    stand between two alternatives, either that, in the sense of pantheism, the
                    finite world and its contingency is an illusion, or that it is contingent only
                    for the growing intelligence of man, which fully understands neither itself nor
                    the world which is its object. Aristotle, however, does not choose either horn
                    of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n100/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0100-0091"/> the dilemma, and leaves us therefore with an
                    unresolved dualism between thought and its object; and this again necessarily
                    involves a dualism between the active reason, which, as he asserts, realizes
                    itself in man, and the passive reason which constitutes his nature as a finite
                    being.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages the Platonic and Aristotelian idea that the apprehension of
                    objective truth is one with the evolution of the mind to self-consciousness
                    seemed to be entirely lost. Knowledge of the finite world was regarded as
                    indifferent, and knowledge of the infinite was conceived to be something given
                    on authority, and in reference to which the mind was confined to an attitude of
                    passive reception or implicit faith. No greater slavery of the spirit can be
                    conceived than that in which even the truths of religion and morality—the truths
                    that regard the inmost life of the spirit itself—were taken as a lesson to be
                    learned by rote from the lips of a teacher. Yet the consciousness that such
                    truth, if it was to be received by the mind, still more if it was to transform
                    the mind, could not be entirely foreign to it, found a voice in the scholastic
                    philosophy. And the compromise or truce between faith and reason expressed in
                    the saying of Anselm <hi rend="italic">credo ut intelligam,—</hi> according to
                    which reason was to confine itself to the analysis and demonstration of the data
                    received in implicit faith from the church,—prepared the way for the recognition
                    that the two are not essentially at variance. The mind that proceeds from <hi
                    rend="italic">veneratio</hi> to <hi rend="italic">delectatio,</hi> from awe and
                    submission to the doctrine to enjoyment and appreciation of it, must already in
                    its awe and submission have the beginnings of an intelligent appreciation.
                    Anselm’s saying might be understood simply as meaning that we must have
                    spiritual experience ere we can understand the things of the spirit. And in this
                    sense it was adopted by the Reformers to express an idea almost the opposite of
                    that with which the scholastics had associated it,—the idea that the direct
                    apprehension of spiritual truth as entering into the inner life of the subject,
                    as identified with his very consciousness of self, is the basis of all knowledge
                    of it. In the Protestant church of the period after the Reformation, we find a
                    growing tendency to insist on the subjectivity of religion, in the same
                    exclusive and one-sided way in which the mediaeval church had insisted on its
                    objectivity. In some extreme representatives of Protestantism this went so far
                    as to lead to a disregard, almost to a rejection, of all objective doctrine, and
                    a reduction of theology to an account of the religious consciousness. On the
                    other hand, while religion was thus made subjective, science claimed to be
                    purely objective, and the followers of Bacon seemed to adopt towards nature the
                    same attitude of passive receptivity which the mediaeval Christian was taught to
                    hold towards the church. While man was to learn everything from himself in
                    religion, he was to learn nothing from himself in science. His aim must be to
                    exclude subjective <hi rend="italic">idola,</hi> in other words, to accept the
                    facts as they were given, and keep himself out of the way. The inevitable result
                    of this difference of view as to the nature of knowledge in these two different
                    regions was, however, on the one hand a withdrawal of religion from all
                    connexion with finite interests, and, especially from the attempt to connect
                    religious principles with the knowledge of the finite world, and, on the other
                    hand, an increasing tendency in those who represented finite science to regard
                    religion as something merely subjective and even individual, as a feeling which
                    could not be translated into thought or made the basis of any knowledge of the
                    objective world.</p>
                <p>The opposite principles of certitude which were thus set up for religious truth
                    and truth of science need only to be brought together and contrasted to betray
                    that they vest upon opposite abstractions, neither of which expresses the
                    complete nature of truth or knowledge. On the one hand the truths of religion
                    were maintained just because they were not, or were not merely, objective, but
                    were capable of being tested by inner experience, and identified with the
                    self-consciousness of the individual. On the other hand the truths of science
                    were maintained because they were not, or were not merely, subjective, but were
                    capable of being verified in objective experience. It was rightly seen on the
                    one side that mere subjective feelings or opinions have no validity for any one
                    but the subject of them, and on the other side that what is merely objective or
                    externally given can have permanent value and interest for the intelligence only
                    as it ceases to be mere isolated and unrelated fact—nay, that, even when science
                    has discovered law and order in nature, it still wants the highest value and
                    interest so long as that law and order are not seen as standing in essential
                    relation to the intelligence itself. The idea of truth or knowledge as that
                    which is at once objective and subjective, as the unity of things with the mind
                    that knows them, enables us to understand the condemnation which the religious
                    mind passed upon a merely external dogma, and even its lack of interest in a
                    science which presented itself as an account of merely objective or external
                    facts. And it enables us also to understand the way in which scientific men
                    insisted upon objective fact as the basis of all knowledge, and the disrespect
                    which they felt for a religion which seemed to admit that it had no such
                    support. What is wanted to clear up the confusion on both sides is the growth of
                    the perception among scientific men that the objectivity which they are seeking
                    cannot be mere objectivity (which would be unmeaning), but an objectivity that
                    stands in essential relation to the intelligence, and, on the other hand, the
                    growth of the perception among religious men that the subjectivity of religion
                    only means that God, whois the objective principle by whom things are, and are
                    known, is spiritual, and can therefore be revealed to the spirit. When these two
                    corrections have been made, it must become obvious that the religious
                    consciousness is not the consciousness of another object than that which is
                    present in finite experience and science, but simply a higher way of knowing the
                    same object. And in this it is also involved that the two ideas of <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> of that
                    which is evolved from within and that which is given from without, are not
                    essentially opposed to each other, but that the <hi rend="italic">a
                    posteriori</hi> is simply the first form of a consciousness which in its
                    ultimate development must become <hi rend="italic">a priori.</hi></p>
                <p>In that philosophy of compromise which λvas initiated by Descartes, one part of
                    knowledge was regarded as innate, or developed from within, and another part as
                    empirical, or imparted from without. In the second period of the history of
                    modern philosophy this compromise was broken, and the names of Locke and
                    Leibnitz—though with some hesitation on both sides—represent respectively the
                    theories that all knowledge is <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> and that all
                    knowledge is <hi rend="italic">a priori.</hi> The compromise seemed to be
                    renewed with Kant, but the form in which it was renewed pointed, as has been
                    already shown, to something more than a compromise, for his doctrine was that
                    the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> element, the facts, exist for us only
                    under <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> conditions, or, in other words, that what
                    is usually called <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> is in part <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori.</hi> The criticism of this view need not be repeated. It
                    is sufficient here to say that if, as Kant shows, the elements are inseparable
                    or organically united, it is impossible to allege that so much belongs to the
                    one and so much to the other. Furthermore, the consciousness of an essential
                    difference in the elements of knowledge is possible only so far as that
                    difference is transcended by the unity of knowledge. We can distinguish the <hi
                    rend="italic">a priori</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> only on
                    condition that we can transcend <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n101/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0101-0092"/> the distinction, and this means that the
                    distinction itself is not absolute, but that there is a point of view from which
                    the <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> may be regarded as <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> and that which is given from without to the spirit may be referred
                    to its own self-determined development.</p>
                <p>Now it is just here that we come upon the turning-point of the philosophical
                    controversy, in the form which it has taken in modern times. The problem may be
                    expressed thus—In what sense can we apply the idea of development to the human
                    spirit <hi rend="italic">1 Are we</hi> to treat that development as merely a
                    determination from without, or as an evolution from within, or as partly the one
                    and partly the other? In a sense all writers of the present day would admit that
                    this last is the case. For, on the one hand, even the Darwinian theory accounts
                    for development by aid of what we may call the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    tendency of the individual to maintain itself in the struggle for existence,
                    though it supposes that the condition or medium in which the individual is
                    placed determines the direction in which that development proceeds. And, on the
                    other hand, no one now would adopt the Leibnitzian theory that the individual is
                    a monad, whose self-development is entirely conditioned by itself in such a
                    sense that all the relations which it has to other existences are merely
                    apparent, and that the coincidence of its life with the life of the world is the
                    result of a pre-established harmony. On both sides, therefore, the idea of
                    self-determination would be admitted, though the tendency of the Darwinians
                    would be to regard this self-determination as something merely formal; and on
                    both sides it would also be admitted that the self-determination does not
                    exclude a determination from without, though extreme opponents of Darwin might
                    be inclined to reduce this determination to a mere stimulus or external
                    condition of the development of the nature of the subject to which the stimulus
                    is applied. The question, however, remains whether, after all, this opposition
                    of without and within is an absolute one, or whether there is any point of view
                    from which it may be transcended. To Aristotle it seemed possible to answer this
                    question in the affirmative, because he conceived that the reason of man is a
                    pure or universal δwα∕us, the evolution of which to complete selfconsciousness
                    is one with the process whereby the objective world comes to be known. Yet, as
                    Aristotle admitted the existence in the world of a material principle which was
                    essentially different from the ideal principle of reason, he was obliged to
                    limit his statement as to the possible unity of the subjective and the objective
                    consciousness, and to say merely that “in things <hi rend="italic">without
                    matter</hi> the knower is identical with the known.” But this would immediately
                    lead to the conclusion that the pure development of reason must be secured by
                    abstraction from all finite and material objects, rather than by a thorough
                    comprehension of them. The freedom of the spirit, on this theory, must be a
                    negative and not a positive freedom, a freedom won, not by overcoming the world,
                    but by withdrawing ourselves from its influence. It remained, therefore, for
                    modern philosophy to work out the Aristotelian idea that the rational being as
                    such, in spite of its necessary relation to and dependence on an external world,
                    is never in an absolute sense externally determined. And, as we have already
                    seen, the Kantian philosophy brought this problem within the reach of solution,
                    in so far as it showed, first, that objective existence can have no meaning
                    except existence for a thinking self, and, secondly, that existence for a
                    thinking self means existence the consciousness of which is “capable of being
                    combined with the consciousness of self.” Add further to these propositions what
                    was shown by Kant’s successors, that that only can be combined with the
                    consciousness of self which is essentially related to it, and we arrive at an
                    idealistic theory of the world, which enables us at once to understand the
                    relative value of the distinction between self-determination and determination
                    from without, and at the same time to see that its value is only relative. If it
                    be true that nothing exists which is not a possible object of consciousness, and
                    again that there is no possible object of consciousness which is not essentially
                    related to self-consciousness, then the phenomena of the external world, which
                    at first present themselves under the aspect of contingent facts, must be
                    capable of being ultimately recognized as the manifestation of reason; and the
                    history of the conscious being in his relations with that world is not a
                    struggle between two independent and unrelated forces, but the evolution by
                    antagonism of one spiritual principle. It is, on this view, the same life which
                    within us is striving for development, and which without us conditions that
                    development. And the reason why the two terms, the self and the not-self, thus
                    appear to be independent of each other, or to be brought together only as they
                    externally act or react upon each other, lies in this, that the object is
                    imperfectly known, and the subject is imperfectly self-conscious. This, however,
                    does not make it less true that in self-consciousness is to be found the
                    principle in reference to which the whole process may be explained, and
                    therefore that the self-conscious subject, as such, lives a life which belongs
                    to him, not merely as one object among others, but as having in himself the
                    principle from which the life and being of all proceeds.</p>
                <p>From this point of view, as has been already indicated, the relative value of a
                    theory of human development, such as that which might be based on the ideas of
                    Darwin, would not be denied. The conscious being may be regarded simply as an
                    externally determined object, and the incorrectness of this assumption will not
                    entirely destroy the value of the results attained, especially if, as is often
                    the case with those who seek to construct a natural science of man, the
                    assumption itself is not very strictly adhered to, but corrected by the tacit
                    admission of other conceptions somewhat inconsistent with it. But, at the same
                    time, it would require to be pointed out that such a science is necessarily
                    abstract and imperfect, as it omits from its view the central fact in the life
                    of the object of which it treats. It can do nothing to account for man’s
                    consciousness, or his capacity of becoming conscious, of the influences by which
                    he is supposed to be determined; or, to put it from the other side, it takes for
                    granted that the objects that influence man are intelligible objects, “capable
                    of being combined with the consciousness of self,” without seeing how much is
                    involved in this assumption. Now it is evident that the consciousness of an
                    influence cannot be explained by the influence itself, nor even by that taken
                    together with the nature of the sensitive beings subjected to it. It is evident
                    also that an influence mediated by consciousness is not, strictly speaking, an
                    external influence, but that it is already transformed, and in process of being
                    further transformed, by the development of the self to which it is present. For
                    the dawn of consciousness, in which the external object first comes into
                    existence for us as opposed to the self, is at the same time the beginning of
                    the process by which its externality is negated or overcome. Self-consciousness
                    is that which makes us individuals in. a sense in which individuality can be
                    predicated of none but a self-conscious being. For, in determining himself as a
                    self, the individual at the same time excludes from himself every other thing
                    and being, and determines them as external objects. He emancipates himself from
                    the world at the same time that he repels the world from himself. Yet this
                    movement of thought, by which his individuality is constituted, is also that by
                    which he is lifted above mere individuality, for, in becoming conscious of self
                    and not-self in their opposition and relation, he ceases to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n102/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0102-0093"/> be simply identified with the one to the
                    exclusion of the other. His finite individuality is regarded by him from a
                    universal point of view, in which it has no less and no more importance than any
                    other individuality, or in which its greater or less importance is determined
                    only by its place in the whole. On this universality of consciousness rests the
                    possibility of science and of morality. For all science is just a contemplation
                    of the world <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">ordine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">universum</hi> and not <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">ordine</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >individuum,</hi>; and all morality is just action with a view to an interest
                    which belongs to the agent, not as this individual, but as a member of a greater
                    whole, and ultimately of the absolute whole in which all men and all things are
                    included.</p>
                <p>In this nature of the conscious subject lies also the possibility of metaphysic
                    in the sense of Aristotle, as that science which goes back to a <hi
                    rend="italic">πρώτον</hi><hi rend="italic">φυσeι,</hi> a beginning which is
                    prior to the existence in consciousness of the individual self, and onward to an
                    end in which the divisions of the finite consciousness are transcended,—as
                    including, in short, ontology, or metaphysic in the narrower sense, on the one
                    side, and theology, or the philosophy of religion, on the other. In truth, these
                    two extremes of science are necessarily bound together: we can only go back to
                    the beginning if we can go on to the end; we can only recover the first unity if
                    we can anticipate the last. Or, to free the subject more definitely from the
                    associations of time, we cannot apprehend the unity which is involved or
                    presupposed in all the differences of our conscious life except in so far as we
                    can look at our individual existence from the point of view of the whole to
                    which it belongs. This will become evident if we consider the nature of the
                    limits which have to be transcended by such a science. The individual conscious
                    subject, as he finds himself at first, is but one being in a world that
                    stretches out, apparently without limits, on every side of him. Of the things by
                    which he is immediately surrounded he sees but a small part, and the influences
                    which he receives from them are, as he knows, like the wave that breaks upon a
                    shore from an unknown ocean, only the last partial expression of impulses that
                    come from regions beyond his ken. Again, he finds himself as one in a changing
                    series of beings, of which he knows only the last preceding terms, and he is
                    aware that in a few years he, as one of this series, will cease to be. He is
                    thus to himself a definitely limited being, and though his knowledge of himself
                    and his world may be gradually widened so as to reach some little way back into
                    the past, and anticipate a little of the future, or may go outwards in space to
                    embrace a widening circle of existences around him, yet he always stops at a
                    limit, of which he is conscious that it is no absolute limit, but simply an
                    arbitrary halting-place where vision grows indistinct and imperfect. When he
                    reflects upon himself from this point of view, he is forced to regard himself as
                    but a fragment, and a fragment of an unknown whole, by which his whole being is
                    determined to be what it is. His highest knowledge seems to be but a
                    consciousness of his ignorance, his highest freedom a determination by motives
                    the ultimate meaning of which is hid from him.</p>
                <p>So far there seems to be no room for any metaphysical knowledge, any knowledge of
                    ourselves and our world which is other than relative and <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">ordine</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >individuum.</hi> But further reflexion shows that in this very consciousness of
                    limit there is implied a consciousness of that which is beyond limit. While we
                    proceed from part to part, beginning with ourselves and our immediate
                    surroundings, and following out lines of connexion that lose themselves in the
                    distance, we are guided by a consciousness of the whole as a unity through which
                    the parts are determined. Nay, it is just the presence of this consciousness
                    that makes us capable of what seems the piecework of our knowledge, in which, by
                    the aid of the principle of causality, we connect particular with particular,
                    and so gradually extend the sphere of light into the encompassing darkness. For
                    that principle simply means that the limited external object does not
                    sufficiently explain to us its own existence, and that therefore we are foroed
                    to explain it by a reference to something beyond it. It means, in other words,
                    that we cannot rest in that which is not a self-bounded, self-determined whole.
                    The application of the category of external determination has therefore an
                    essential reference to the higher category of self-determination. The mere
                    endlessness of space and time has no meaning except in opposition, yet in
                    relation, to the true infinity’of which we find the type in self-conscious
                    thought. Or, to put it in the Kantian form in which it is already familiar to
                    us, the consciousness of the objective world in space and time stands in
                    essential relation to the unity of self-consciousness. And if when we regard the
                    former exclusively we are forced to view ourselves as insignificant and
                    shortsighted finite beings in an infinite universe, when we regard the latter we
                    are enabled to see that in all this universe there is revealed only that
                    spiritual principle which we find also in ourselves. In this way a new light is
                    thrown on our first consciousness of ignorance. The strivings of our reason
                    after knowledge can no longer be regarded as strivings after an unknown goal,
                    but rather after a goal which it has prescribed for itself. The narrow limits of
                    our individual life are not removed, but they cease to be for us the limits of a
                    narrow circle of definition within a formless infinite. They become the limits
                    of a sphere within a sphere, a sphere which is defined by the idea of knowledge
                    or self-consciousness itself, and in which therefore, however we may wander, we
                    are everywhere at home. In religious language, the sphere is not a mere
                    universe, but God, who is without us only as He is within us, so that “by the
                    God within we can understand the God without.”</p>
                <p>Again, as this consciousness takes man beyond his immediate existence, and
                    énables him to determine it in relation to an absolute unity of all things in
                    God, so it enables him to go back to a unity which is behind or prior to that
                    existence. For, if the individual can look at himself as he looks at others, and
                    at others as he looks at himself, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from a point of
                    view which is unaffected by his individuality, and in which that individuality
                    is for him only what it is for impartial reason, he can have nothing in him
                    which binds his consciousness to his individuality as mere individuality; as
                    therefore he can go beyond himself to apprehend the whole in which his
                    individuality has a place, there is nothing to prevent him from going back upon
                    himself, and upon the conditions which are prior to his own individual being. He
                    is not tied to his immediate life, and can go below it just as he can rise above
                    it.</p>
                <p>“0 God, I think Thy thoughts after Thee,” said Kepler. In reading the “thoughts”
                    written in the planetary system, Kepler was discovering the meaning of that
                    which is simpler and more elementary than the existence of man, as a cycle of
                    mechanical relations are simpler and more elementary than self-consciousness.
                    Yet it was a true feeling that led him to connect this descent into the
                    mechanical world with God. For it is only in virtue of the same faculty which
                    enables us to rise to the absolute life which includes and subordinates our own
                    that we can so free us from the image of our own conscious life as to apprehend
                    and fix in thought the simpler relations of purely physical existence. But the
                    same faculty of going back upon ourselves has a still deeper manifestation. Not
                    only can we abstract from ourselves so as to understand the inorganic world, we
                    can also abstract from ourselves so as to understand the conditions which are
                    prior <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n103/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0103-0094"/> to the thought, and therefore to the existence,
                    of any objective external world at all, the universal conditions of the knowable
                    and therefore also of reality. In doing so, to use Hegel’s metaphor, which is
                    but an extension of Kepler’s, we are “thinking what God thought and was before
                    the creation of the world,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> we are thinking the
                    spiritual unity presupposed in all knowledge, and therefore in all objects of
                    knowledge—the consciousness in relation to which everything is, and is
                    known.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Relation of Logic to Metaphysic.—</hi> The ordinary view
                    of logic is based on two presuppositions which tend to separate it almost
                    entirely from metaphysic: it is based on the presupposition of an opposition, or
                    at least a merely external relation, between thought and its object, and again
                    of an opposition, or merely external relation, between the form or method and
                    the content or matter of thought. The intelligence is regarded as dealing with
                    an object which is given to it externally, and to which, therefore, it can be
                    true only if it leaves it unchanged and introduces into it nothing of its own.
                    Truth, to use a well-known definition, is the agreement of our conceptions with
                    their objects, and in bringing about this agreement all the concessions must be
                    on the side of thought. Conformably to this view, the processes of thought must
                    be purely analytic; <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> thought may break up the given
                    idea of the object into its constituent elements, and again out of these
                    elements it may recompose the idea in its unity, but it can add nothing and take
                    nothing away. It is like an instrument which alternately dissects a solid mass
                    into smaller parts and again mechanically presses them together, but which never
                    penetrates and dissolves the hard matter, still less fuses it into a new form by
                    bringing it into contact with new chemical elements.</p>
                <p>This conception, like much of the philosophy of which it is a specimen, is a kind
                    of exaggerated caricature of one aspect of the philosophy of Aristotle.
                    Aristotle is the great analytic philosopher. He first laid down boundaries in
                    that continuous domain of science which Plato had first surveyed. Not that he
                    ever completely lost sight of the unity or continuity of the different sciences
                    which he thus distinguished. His unrivalled speculative genius is shown nowhere
                    more clearly than in those not unfrequent utterances of speculative insight into
                    the unity of things different, by which, as at a stroke, he makes his own
                    landmarks and all landmarks to disappear. Yet such utterances generally stand by
                    themselves, and do not alter the general analytic spirit of his philosophy. They
                    are not so developed as to show distinctly the merely relative character of the
                    divisions and distinctions which are set up, or the limits of the sphere within
                    which they hold good. Hence it was easy for minds which possessed something of
                    Aristotle’s keenness of understanding without his speculative depth to neglect
                    such expressions, or to explain them away. And this process of degradation was
                    the more rapid as the philosophy of Aristotle soon ceased to be studied in his
                    own writings, and became a traditionary possession of the schools. In this way
                    we may partly explain how logic came to be regarded by mediaeval philosophy as a
                    form of thought which could be altogether separated from the matter, and by the
                    application of which that matter could be in no way affected or changed. But for
                    such a view, indeed, it is difficult to conceive how the schoolmen could have
                    ventured to apply any logical processes at all to the sacred matter of dogma.
                    The idea of externally adding anything to the faith once delivered to the saints
                    was excluded by the principle of authority; and the idea of developing out of
                    that faith anything that was not immediately contained in it had not yet
                    presented itself to any one. Hence the business of thought seemed to be purely
                    formal and analytic, and it was only on the plea of its being such that its
                    activity could be tolerated at all. Nor was this view of logic at once changed
                    by the revolt against scholasticism. The first philosophical exponents of the
                    modern scientific movement, while they rejected the matter of dogma as
                    fictitious, or at least as transcending the sphere of positive knowledge, and
                    while they substituted in its place, as the object of investigation, the facts
                    of experience, did not realize any more than the schoolmen that the form and
                    method of knowledge could be other than analytic of given matter. Bacon, their
                    protagonist, was above all solicitous to guard against any subjective <hi
                    rend="italic">anticipatio</hi><hi rend="italic">naturae·,</hi> nor did he see
                    that the questions which, in his theory of forms, he proposed that science
                    should ask of nature themselves involved any preconceived theory regarding it.
                    Conscious, as every true scientific man must be, that the study of nature
                    involves a constant self-abnegation, a patient selfdistrustful course of
                    experiment and observation, he and his followers did not realize the
                    presuppositions that make the inquiry possible, and by which it must be guided.
                    Still less did they recognize that the separation between the mind and its
                    object which they took for granted can only be a relative division, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a division on the basis of a unity, and that therefore
                    the self-abnegation of the mind in its investigation of facts cannot be an
                    absolute self-abnegation, but is only the first step on the way to the discovery
                    that the facts are intelligible, and so essentially related to the intelligence.
                    Hence to them logic still seemed a mere analytic process, the end and aim of
                    which was understood to be that a world, existing in itself out of relation to
                    thought, should be reproduced in a more or less imperfect image <hi
                    rend="italic">in</hi> thought. And, when it came to be suspected by a less naive
                    philosophy of experience that, after all, certain presuppositions, not given in
                    experience itself, were involved in the scientific interpretation of it, various
                    expedients were devised to reduce these presuppositions in an indirect way to
                    empirical truths,—expedients of which Mill’s attempt to base the law of
                    causality upon an <hi rend="italic">inductio</hi><hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">enumerationem simplicem</hi> may be taken as the type.</p>
                <p>When we go back to Aristotle,—who was the “founder of logic” in the sense that he
                    was the first who treated logical method as a separate branch of science,—we
                    find that his division of logic from metaphysic is by no means so definite and
                    complete as it was made by some of his successors. The verification of the
                    highest principle of thought, the law of contradiction, is treated by him as the
                    business of metaphysic. And, though he separates the idea of truth from the idea
                    of reality, and regards the former as involving a relation of thought to a
                    reality which is determined in itself independent of that relation, yet he does
                    not regard this independence as by any means absolute. Truth is defined by him
                    as a connexion or distinction of ideas which <hi rend="italic">corresponds</hi>
                    to a union or separation of things, but does not necessarily so correspond. This
                    definition, however, holds good only in so far as things are not scientifically
                    known, or in so far as things not essentially related are brought together κατά
                    <hi rend="italic">σvμβeβηκo&lt;i.</hi> Where necessity comes in, and is
                    apprehended by reason, the case is different. For in that case we have not
                    merely an external synthesis, but an essential identity, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> a unity of elements which can neither be, nor be known, apart from
                    each other. In relation to the principles of science, therefore, Aristotle holds
                    that error, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a connexion of ideas not corresponding
                    to a connexion of things, is impossible, and that the only alternatives are
                    knowledge and ignorance. Either we possess the idea or we do not possess it; as
                    Aristotle otherwise expresses it, in thought we are either in contact with the
                    things or not in contact with them; there is no third possibility. The meaning
                    of Aristotle becomes clearer when we remember that, according to his <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n104/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0104-0095"/> view, the intelligence, in apprehending the
                    indivisible unity of elements in the object, is at the same time apprehending
                    the unity of the object with itself. The mind cannot be deceived in regard to
                    that which forms a part of its consciousness of itself. In freeing the essential
                    conception of the object from the contingency of matter, science has freed the
                    object from that which made it foreign to intelligence, and the relation of
                    thought to things ceases to be one of correspondence, and becomes one of
                    identity.</p>
                <p>The legitimate inference from this view of the relation of the intelligence to
                    the intelligible world would seem to be that the partial separation of thought
                    from its object and its imperfect correspondence with it is characteristic of
                    our first empirical consciousness of things, and of the progress from that
                    consciousness to science, but that in completed science the division ceases. The
                    <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> of things is not their <hi rend="italic"
                    >percipi,</hi> but their <hi rend="italic">intelligi.</hi> But, if this be taken
                    as the truth, then it can no longer be supposed that the process by which
                    scientific knowledge is attained consists simply in an analysis of the object as
                    it is given in immediate perception. On the contrary, it must be held that, if
                    our thought has to submit itself to the object, and to be brought into
                    conformity with it, by a process of induction, it is equally true that in this
                    process the object also must be changed, that it may be brought into conformity
                    with the principle of thought. The genesis of science, according to this view,
                    is not merely an analysis of given facts, but a process of vital transformation
                    by which consciousness on the one side and the object on the other are brought
                    into unity with each other. The idea, indeed, of an empty process, a process in
                    which the activity of the mind is merely formal, is one which will not stand the
                    slightest examination. A mind without categories, if such a thing were
                    conceivable, would have no questions to ask in relation to the object presented
                    to it, and could therefore get no answers. Those who make a pretence of
                    approaching a subject in an absolutely receptive attitude, and without any
                    presuppositions, only show that they are unconscious of the categories by which
                    their thought is ruled; and they will be most slavishly guided by these
                    categories just because they are unconscious of them. The schoolmen, when they
                    applied their logical principles to the matter of Christian dogma, did not
                    recognize that they were doing more than analysing and bringing out clearly the
                    meaning of that dogma. But the effect of their work was to turn the system of
                    divinity into a collection of insoluble puzzles; for the doctrine was a doctrine
                    of reconciliation between divine and human, infinite and finite, universal and
                    particular, and the principle of their method was to treat all these oppositions
                    as absolute. In like manner it might be shown that the analysis of social
                    phenomena which was made in the last century was inadequate and superficial,
                    just because of the latent assumption of individualism on which it proceeded,
                    and that the greater success of writers like Comte and Spencer does not arise
                    merely or mainly from their being more careful observers of the phenomena of
                    social life, but in great part from the fact that, rather by the unconscious
                    movement of opinion than by any distinct metaphysic, their minds have become
                    possessed by more adequate categories.</p>
                <p>The idea that the process of thought is merely formal, or analytic of given
                    matter, is, however, an error that has a truth underlying it. This is the truth
                    expressed by Aristotle in his much misunderstood comparison of the intelligence
                    of man to a <hi rend="italic">tabula rasa,</hi> upon which nothing at first is
                    written, and again in his assertion—already quoted—that the miud is a pure
                    δwαμi5, without any distinguishing quality of its own which could prevent it
                    from apprehending the real nature of other things. In other words,
                    self-conscious reason is not a special thing in the world, but the principle
                    through which all things are, and are understood; and hence, as regards the
                    distinction of things from each other, it is in the first instance undetermined
                    and indifferent, and therefore open to be determined in one way or another,
                    according to the object to which it is directed. But this simply means that the
                    conscious subject, as such, is not bound to his own individuality, but can
                    regard things, nay, in a sense, must regard them, from a point of view which is
                    independent of it. This is what makes possible the self-restraint and
                    self-abnegation prescribed to the scientific man, whose whole duty, as it is
                    often said, is to keep himself out of the way and let the objects speak, to lay
                    aside all subjective <hi rend="italic">idola</hi> and prejudices that stand
                    between him and the reality of things. This at first sight may seem to be
                    equivalent to the assertion that the mind ought to be in a state of simple
                    passivity or receptivity towards objects. What is really meant, however, is not
                    that the intelligence should go out of itself, or cease to be itself, that it
                    may know its object, but simply that it should show itself in its universality,
                    or freedom from the limits of the individual nature. The self-abnegation of
                    science is an endeavour, so to speak, to see the object with its own eyes, but
                    this it can do only in so far as the consciousness for which the object is is
                    that consciousness in relation to which alone all objects are, and are
                    understood. Or, to put it in another form, the conscious self in its scientific
                    self-abnegation does not give itself up to another, and become purely passive;
                    it only gives up all activity which is not the activity of that universal
                    thought for which and through which all things are. Hence, when it has so
                    abnegated itself, its most intense constructive activity is just beginning,
                    though, just so far as the self-abnegation has been real, that constructive
                    activity has become one with the self-revelation of the object. As, however, it
                    is only through the constructive activity of thought that there exists for us
                    any object at all, so it is only through its continued activity that the
                    conception of the object is changed, till it is completely revealed and known.
                    And this activity involves a continuous synthesis, by which an ever wider range
                    of facts is brought together in an ever more definite unity, until the mind has,
                    if we may use the expression, exhausted its store of categories upon the world,
                    and until the world has completely revealed itself in its unity with itself and
                    with the mind.</p>
                <p>To combine these two ideas—on the one hand that science begins in a
                    self-abnegation by which the mind renounces all subjective prejudices, and
                    thereby attains a purely objective attitude, and on the other hand that this
                    purely objective attitude is not a mere attitude of reception, but one in which
                    the mind is continually transforming the object by its own categories,—to see
                    that the universality of the mind in knowing is not mere emptiness, and that its
                    activity is synthetic just when it is most free from all presuppositions
                    extraneous to the nature of its object,—is one of the greatest difficulties of
                    the student of metaphysic. Universality at first looks so like emptiness, and a
                    universal activity so like a merely formal activity, that it is no wonder that
                    the one should be mistaken for the other. But if we make such a confusion, we
                    may soon be forced to choose between a sensationalism that makes knowledge
                    impossible and a mysticism which makes it empty. The pure identity of thought
                    with itself which is involved in the process of analysis is put on the one side,
                    and the manifold matter of experience which is the object of thought on the
                    other, and between these opposites no mediation is possible. If we take our
                    stand upon the latter, we are forced to reject all mental synthesis as invalid,
                    because it involves a subjective addition to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n105/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0105-0096"/> facts; if we take our stand on the former, we are
                    compelled to regard all objective experience as irrational, because it does not
                    correspond to the pure identity of thought.</p>
                <p>In Aristotle’s view of logic it cannot be said that this difficulty is clearly
                    solved, though he seems to have seen the error of both extremes. On the one hand
                    he often recognizes the synthetic character of the process of induction, as when
                    he speaks of the universal idea or law as a central principle, in which we must
                    find the key to all the difficulties suggested by different aspects of a given
                    subject. Yet in other places we trace the influence of a merely analytic
                    conception of that process as a process in which the universal is to be reached
                    by abstracting from the peculiarities of individuals. And this conception of it
                    is favoured by Aristotle’s metaphysical theory, according to which the forms of
                    things in the finite world are manifested in a resisting matter, a matter which
                    prevents them from being perfectly or universally realized. For, in so far as
                    this is the case, the facts will not be entirely explained by the knowledge of
                    the form, and the knowledge of the form must be obtained, not by combining all
                    the facts, but rather by abstracting from them. Again, in Aristotle’s account of
                    the process of thought in the <hi rend="italic">Prior Analytics,</hi> he regards
                    it as a formal deductive process; and, though in the <hi rend="italic">Posterior
                    Analytics</hi> he attempts to give a synthetic meaning to the syllogism by
                    treating it as the method in which the properties of a thing may be proved of
                    it, or combined with it, through its essential definition, yet this adventitious
                    meaning bestowed upon the syllogistic process does not alter its essential
                    nature. The ultimate source of this inadequate view of the process of thought
                    seems to lie in Aristotle’s imperfect conception of the unity or identity which
                    is for him the type of knowledge. For, though, both in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Metaphysic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">De Anima,</hi> he defines that
                    identity as self-consciousness or as a consciousness of objects which is
                    identical with self-consciousness, yet he does not seem clearly to distinguish
                    between a unity in which there is no difference and a unity in which difference
                    is transcended and reconciled. This seems to be shown by his description of the
                    principles which reason apprehends as <hi rend="italic">individua</hi> or
                    indivisible unities, rather than unities which imply, while they transcend,
                    difference. Yet, in this definition of the unity of knowledge as
                    self-consciousness, Aristotle has implicitly admitted that there is a duality or
                    difference in the unity itself, and this might have been expected to modify his
                    conception of the relation of consciousness to its objects. For, as
                    self-consciousness is not simple like a chemical element, but only in the sense
                    that it is an indissoluble unity of opposites, it might have been anticipated
                    that one who had realized self-consciousness as the principle of knowledge would
                    be able to regard the opposition between the consciousness of self and the
                    consciousness of the world as itself also capable of being conceived as a
                    unity.</p>
                <p>This misconception of Aristotle may be shown in another way. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysic</hi> we find him laying down what is called the logical
                    law of contradiction as the ultimate principle of knowledge. The meaning of this
                    principle, however, as Aristotle states it, is simply that thought in its
                    essence is definition or distinction. If, as Heraclitus says, everything at once
                    is and is not, if we cannot attach any definite predicates to things by which
                    they may be distinguished from each other, then, as Aristotle argues, thought is
                    chaos, and knowledge is impossible. If determination be not negation, if the
                    assertion of A be not the negation of not-A, then there is no meaning in words.
                    The criticism to be made on this view is obviously, not that it is a false
                    statement of the law of thought, but that it is an imperfect statement of
                    it.</p>
                <p>Thought is undoubtedly distinction; and, if all distinction be confounded, no
                    meaning can be apprehended or expressed. But thought is also relation and
                    connexion of the things distinguished, and this aspect of it is equally
                    important with the other. Aristotle shows his one-sidedness—a one-sidedness
                    which throws him into opposition to Plato, but which enables him to correct
                    Plato only by falling into the opposite error—when he exclusively fixes his
                    attention on the “differentiating” aspect of knowledge, and takes no notice of
                    the “integrating” aspect of it. It is easy to see that this exclusive attention
                    to one side of the truth may lead in many ways to a distorted view both of the
                    world and of the intelligence that apprehends it. If Heraclitus be interpreted
                    as simply denying the right of thought to introduce its definiteness into the
                    flux of sense, nothing but absolute scepticism can come out of his philosophy;
                    and Aristotle was right in maintaining that it is only as the flux is brought to
                    a stand, and the universal is fixed as a permanent and definite object of
                    thought, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> that knowledge becomes possible. But, on
                    the other hand, if distinction be taken as absolute, if the definite assertion
                    of a thing be taken as a negation of all relation to what it is not, if the
                    fixity of thought be taken as an abstract selfidentity which excludes all the
                    movement of finite things wherein they show their finitude and pass beyond
                    themselves into other things, then knowledge will be equally impossible. Our
                    consciousness, on such a theory, would be disintegrated into parts which would
                    own no connexion with each other; nor would it be possible for us to think of
                    things as, in spite of their differences, bound together into the unity of one
                    world. The law of contradiction or distinction, therefore, is likely to lead to
                    serious misconceptions, unless it be complemented by a law of relation— a law
                    expressing the truth that there is a unity which transcends all distinction. For
                    all intelligible distinction —all distinction of things in the intelligible
                    world—must be subordinate to their unity as belonging to that world, and
                    therefore essentially connected with each other and with the intelligence. In
                    such a world, in other words, there can be no absolute distinctions or
                    differences (not even between being and not-being); for distinction without
                    relation is impossible, and a conception held in absolute isolation from all
                    correlated conceptions ceases to have any meaning. This does not, of course,
                    imply a negation of the law of contradiction within its own sphere, but it does
                    imply that that sphere is limited, and that there is no absolute contradiction.
                    All opposition is within a presupposed unity, and therefore points to a higher
                    reconciliation, a reconciliation which is reached when we show that the
                    opposition is one of correlative elements.</p>
                <p>The great step in logical theory which was taken by the idealistic philosophy of
                    the post-Kantian period was simply to dissipate the confusion which had
                    prevailed so long between that bare or formal identity, which is but the
                    beginning of thought and knowledge, and that concrete unity of difference, which
                    is its highest idea and end. It was, in other words, to correct and complete the
                    conceptions of thought as analytical, and as externally synthetical, by the
                    conception of it as self-determining, to show that it is a unity which manifests
                    itself in difference and opposition, yet in all this, even when it seems to be
                    dealing with an object which is altogether external to it, is really developing
                    and revealing itself. This new movement of thought might, in one point of view,
                    be described as the addition of another logic to the logic of analysis and the
                    logic of inductive synthesis which were already in existence. But it was really
                    more than this; for the new logic was not merely an external addition <hi

                <p>to the old logics, it also put a new meaning into these logics by bringing to
                    light the principles that were involved in them. At the same time it broke down
                    the division that had been supposed to exist between logic and metaphysic,
                    between the form or method of thought and its matter. It showed that thought
                    itself contains a matter from which it cannot be separated, and that it is only
                    by reason of this matter that it is able to ask intelligent questions of nature,
                    and to get from nature intelligible answers. A short space must be devoted to
                    explain this relation of the three logics to each other.</p>
                <p>The analytic logic fairly represents our first scientific attitude to the world,
                    in which we concentrate our attention upon the facts as they are given in
                    experience, with no thought of any mental synthesis through which they are
                    given. To ourselves we seem to have to do with an object which is altogether
                    independent of our thought, and what we need in order to know it is to keep
                    ourselves in a purely receptive attitude. All we can do is to analyse what is
                    given, without adding anything of our own to it. It has, however, already been
                    pointed out that this apparent self-abnegation is possible only because, in
                    abnegating our individual point of view, we do not abnegate the point of view
                    that belongs to us as universal or thinking subjects. In other words, the
                    objectivity of knowledge thus attained is not the ceasing of the activity of our
                    thought, but rather of all that interferes with that activity. We seem to
                    abstract from ourselves, but what we do abstract from is only the individuality
                    that stands between us and the world. The scientific observer who has thus
                    denied himself, however, is not necessarily conscious of the meaning of what he
                    has done. The immediate expression of his consciousness is not “I think the
                    object,” but “it, the object, is”; and the more intensely active he is the more
                    his activity is lost for him in the object of it. His whole work is, for
                    himself, only the analysis of given facts, and for the rest he seems to have
                    nothing to do but to take the world as he finds it. The voice of nature to which
                    he listens is for him not his own voice but the voice of a stranger, and it does
                    not occur to him to reflect that nature could not speak to any one but a
                    conscious self. His business is to determine things as they present themselves,
                    to enumerate their qualities, to measure their quantities; and his logic
                    accordingly is a logic governed by the idea of the relative comprehension and
                    extension of the things which he thus names and classifies. Such an analytic
                    logic seems to be all that is necessary, because the only predicates by which
                    things are as yet determined are those which are involved in their presence to
                    us in perception, and as perceived they seem to be at once given in all their
                    reality to the mind that apprehends them.</p>
                <p>A step is taken beyond this first naive consciousness of things, whenever a
                    distinction is made between appearance and reality, or whenever it is seen that
                    the things perceived are essentially related to each other, and that therefore
                    they cannot be known by their immediate presence to sense, but only by a mind
                    which relates that which is, to that which is not, immediately perceived. If
                    “the shows of things are least themselves,” we must go beyond the shows in order
                    to know them; we must seek out the permanent for that which is given as
                    transient, the law for the phenomenon, the cause for the effect. The process of
                    thought in knowledge therefore is no longer lost in its immediate object, but
                    is, partly at least, distinguished from it. For just in proportion as the
                    reality is separated from the appearance does the knower become conscious of an
                    activity of his own thought in determining things. From this point of view
                    nature is no longer an object which spontaneously reveals itself to us, but
                    rather one which hides its meaning from us, and out of which we must wring its
                    secret by persistent questioning. And, as this questioning process obviously has
                    not its direction determined purely by the object itself, it becomes manifest
                    that the mind must bring with it the categories by which it seeks to make nature
                    intelligible. To ask for the causes of things, or the laws of things,
                    presupposes that the immediate appearance of them does not correspond to an idea
                    of reality which the mind brings with it, and by which it judges the appearance.
                    Nature is supposed to be given to or perceived by us as a multitude of objects
                    in space passing through successive changes in time; and what science seeks is
                    to discover a necessity of connexion running through all this apparently
                    contingent coexistence and succession and binding it into a system. Science,
                    therefore, seems to question nature by means of an idea of the necessary
                    interdependence and connexion of all things, as parts of one systematic whole
                    governed by general laws—an idea which it does not get from nature, but which it
                    brings to nature. Hence the logic in which this process of investigation
                    expresses its consciousness of itself will be a synthetic logic, a logic built
                    on certain principles which are conceived to be independent of experience, and
                    by the aid of which we may so transform that experience, so penetrate into it or
                    get beyond it, as to find for it a better explanation than that which it
                    immediately gives of itself. The <hi rend="italic">Posterior Analytic,</hi> in
                    which Aristotle brings in the idea of cause to vivify the syllogistic process,
                    or supply a real meaning to it, may already be regarded as a first essay in this
                    direction. And the theory of inductive logic, as explained by Bacon and his
                    successors down to Mill, is a continuous attempt to determine what are the
                    principles and methods on which experience must be questioned, in order to
                    extract from it a knowledge which is not given in immediate perception.</p>
                <p>It was, however, Hume who first brought into a clear light the subjectivity of
                    the principles postulated in this logic, and especially of the principle of
                    causality, which is the most important of them. In thus contrasting the
                    subjectivity of the principles of science with the objectivity of the facts to
                    which they are applied, it was his intention to cast doubt on the science which
                    is based on the application of the former to the latter. The principles, he
                    maintains, are not legitimately derived from the facts, therefore they cannot
                    legitimately be used to interpret them. They are due to the influence of habit,
                    which by an illegitimate process raises frequency of occurrence into the
                    universality and necessity of law, and so changes a mere subjective association
                    of ideas into an assured belief and expectation of objective facts. The answer
                    given by Kant to this sceptical criticism of science involved a rejection of
                    that very opposition of subjective and objective upon which it was based.
                    Without necessary and universal principles, the experience of things as
                    qualitatively and quantitatively determined objects, coexisting in space and
                    passing through changes in time (or even the determination of the successive
                    states of the subject as successive), would itself have been impossible. Hence
                    necessity of thought cannot be derived from a frequent experience of such
                    objects. It is true that the determination of things as permanent substances
                    reciprocally acting on each other, according to universal laws, goes beyond the
                    determination of them as qualified and quantified phenomena in space and time.
                    But both determinations are possible only through the same <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori</hi> principle, and we cannot admit the former determination without
                    implicitly admitting the latter. As, therefore, it is through the necessity and
                    universality of thought that objects exist for us, even before the application
                    to them of the principles of scientific induction, and as the application of
                    those principles is only a further step in that <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi>
                    synthesis which is already involved in the nerception of these objects, we have
                    no reason for treating <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n107/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0107-0098"/> the former kind of synthesis as objectively valid
                    which does not equally apply to the latter.</p>
                <p>This vindication of the principles of induction has, however, a further
                    consequence, which was not clearly seen by Kant. It is fatal to the antithesis
                    of the “given” and the “known,” of what is perceived and what is conceived, of
                    <hi rend="italic">natura</hi><hi rend="italic">materialiter spectata</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">natura</hi><hi rend="italic">formaliter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spectata,</hi> which he still admitted. For that antithesis really rested on
                    the idea that there is no universal and necessary principle of determination of
                    things involved in the apprehension of them as qualified and quantified
                    phenomena in space and time. So soon, therefore, as it is seen that there is
                    such a principle, and that the first determination of things as objects of
                    perception is due to the same <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> synthesis which
                    determines them in the second place as objects of experience, the ground for
                    that contrast between reality and appearance on which the theory of induction
                    rested is taken away. Kant, indeed, finds a new meaning for that contrast by
                    interpreting it as referring, not to the opposition between things as they are
                    given and things as they are known, but to a supposed opposition between things
                    as they are given and known in experience and things as they are in themselves
                    out of experience. This new antithesis of reality and appearance, however, only
                    means that the former antithesis has broken down, and that therefore the ideal
                    of knowledge based upon it has yielded to a new ideal. The so-called things in
                    themselves are noumena, the objects of an intuitive or perceptive understanding,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> objects in which the contrast of perception and
                    conception, of given and known, is transcended. We can make Kant’s theory
                    consistent only by supposing him to mean that the conception of the world as a
                    system of substances determining each other according to universal laws does not
                    yet satisfy the idea of knowledge which reason brings with it. In other words,
                    just as science from the point of view of necessary law found something wanting
                    in the conception of the world as a mere complex of quantified and qualified
                    phenomena in space and time, so philosophy, in view of a still higher ideal of
                    knowledge, may condemn the conception of the world as a system of objects
                    determined by necessary laws of relation as itself inadequate and imperfect. And
                    we have seen that this higher ideal is that which is involved in the unity of
                    self-consciousness. Unfortunately Kant was unable, as Aristotle had been unable,
                    to distinguish this idea from the idea of an abstract identity in which there is
                    no room for even a relative difference of perception and conception, and
                    therefore the perceptive understanding was named by him only to be rejected.</p>
                <p>If, however, we correct this inadequacy of Kant’s statement, as his later works
                    enable us partly to correct it, we see that it involves a new idea of knowledge
                    and a new logic,—a logic governed by the idea of organic unity and development,
                    just as the analytic logic had been governed by the idea of identity, and as the
                    inductive logic had been governed by the idea of necessary law. For, if the
                    unity of self-consciousness be our type of knowledge, truth must mean to us, not
                    the apprehension of objects as self-identical things, distinguished from each
                    other in quantity and quality, nor even the determination of such things as
                    standing in necessary relations to each other. It must mean the determination of
                    the world (and of whatever in it is in any sense an independent reality, so far
                    as it is so independent) as a unity which realizes itself in and through
                    difference, a unity which is indeed determined, but determined by itself. In a
                    view of the world which is governed by this category, correlation must be
                    reinterpreted as organic unity, and causation as development. Its logical method
                    must be neither analytical nor synthetical, or rather it must be both at once,
                    <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> it must endeavour to exhibit the process of things
                    as the evolution of a unity which is at once self-differentiating and
                    self-integrating, which manifests itself in difference, that through difference
                    it may return upon itself. Further, as this logic arises simply out of a deeper
                    consciousness of that which was contained in the two previous logics, so it
                    first enables us to explain them. In other words, the advance from the analytic
                    to the inductive logic, and again from the inductive to what may be called the
                    genetic logic, may itself be shown to be a self-determined development of
                    thought, in which the first two steps are the imperfect manifestation of a
                    principle fully revealed only in the last step. The consciousness of
                    self-identical objects, independent of each other and of thought, is thus only
                    the beginning of a process of knowledge which reaches its second stage in the
                    determination of these objects as essentially related to each other, and which
                    finds its ultimate end in the knowledge of the correlated objects as essentially
                    related to the mind that knows them. Or if, in this last point of view, things
                    are still conceived as having a certain relative independence of the mind, it
                    can only be in so far as they are in the Leibnitzian sense monads, or
                    microcosms,— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in so far as they are self-determined,
                    and so have, in the narrower circle of their individual life, something
                    analogous to the selfcompleted nature of the world, when it is contemplated in
                    its unity with its spiritual principle.</p>
                <p>Such a genetic logic is inconsistent with any absolute distinction between the
                    <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a posteriori</hi> element
                    in knowledge. For here the <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> is not simply a law
                    of necessary connexion to be applied to an external matter, but a principle of
                    organic development, a principle which, from the very nature of it, cannot be
                    applied to a foreign matter. To treat the world as organic is to apply to it a
                    category which is inconsistent with its being something merely given or
                    externally presented to thought. The relation of things to thought must itself
                    be brought under the same category of organic unity which is applied to the
                    relation of things to each other in the world, otherwise the externality of the
                    world to the thought for which it is will contradict the conception of the world
                    as itself organic. Hence the distinction of <hi rend="italic">a priori</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">a posteriori,</hi> so far as it is maintained at all, must
                    shrink to something secondary and relative. It can be maintained only as a
                    distinction of thought from its object, which presupposes their ultimate unity.
                    From this point of view logic may be said to deal with the <hi rend="italic">a
                    priori,</hi> in so far as it treats the general conditions and methods of
                    knowledge without reference to any particular object. Logic must exhibit
                    abstractly the process by which the intelligence establishes its unity with the
                    intelligible world; or, to put it in another way, it must demonstrate that the
                    being of things can be truly conceived only as their being for thought. It is
                    limited to the <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> in the sense that it ends with
                    the idea that the <hi rend="italic">esse</hi> of things is their <hi
                    rend="italic">intelligi,</hi> and does not consider how this real intelligence
                    or intelligible reality manifests itself in the concrete world of nature and
                    spirit.</p>
                <p>In this sense logic cannot be separated from metaphysic if metaphysic be confined
                    to ontology. They are simply two aspects of one science, which we may regard
                    either as determining the idea of being or the idea of knowing. The process of
                    knowing is never really a formal process; it always involves the application of
                    certain categories, and these categories are simply successive definitions of
                    being or reality. We cannot separate the category from the movement of thought
                    by which it is evolved and applied, nor the transition from lower to higher
                    categories from changes of logical method. Hence a logic divorced from
                    metaphysic inevitably becomes empty and unreal, and a metaphysic divorced from
                    logic reduces itself to a kind of dictionary of abstract terms, which are put in
                    no living <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n108/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0108-0099"/> relation to each other. For such a logic and such
                    a metaphysic must rest on the assumption of an absolute division between being
                    and thought, the very two terms the unity of which it must be the utmost object
                    of both logic and metaphysic to prove and to produce.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">The Relation of Metaphysic to Philosophy of Religion.</hi>
                    —The possibility of a “first philosophy,” as we have already seen, is
                    essentially bound up with the possibility of what we may call a last philosophy.
                    It is only in so far as we can rise above the point of view of the individual
                    and the dualism of the ordinary consciousness—in so far, in other words, as we
                    can have at least an anticipative consciousness of that last unity in which all
                    the differences of things from each other and from the mind that knows them are
                    explained and transcended—that we are able to go back to that first unity which
                    all these differences presuppose. The life of man begins with a divided
                    consciousness, with a consciousness of self which is opposed to the
                    consciousness of what is not-self, with a consciousness of a multiplicity of
                    particulars which do not seem to be bound together by any one universal
                    principle. Such division and apparent independence of what are really parts of
                    one whole is characteristic of nature, and in spirit it is at first only so far
                    transcended that it has become conscious of itself. A conscious difference,
                    however, as it is a difference in consciousness, is no longer an unmediated
                    difference. It is a difference through which the unity has begun to show itself,
                    and which therefore the unity is on the way to subordinate. And all the
                    development of consciousness and self-consciousness is just the process through
                    which this subordination is carried out, up to the point at which the difference
                    is seen to be nothing but the manifestation of the unity. Just so far,
                    therefore, as this end is present to us,—so far as we are able to look forward
                    to the solution or reconciliation of all the divisions and oppositions of which
                    we are conscious and to see that there is an allembracing unity which they
                    cannot destroy,—is it possible that we should look back to the beginning or
                    first unity, and recognize that these divisions and oppositions are but the
                    manifestations of it. Thus the extremes of abstractness and of concreteness of
                    thought are bound up together. The freedom of intelligence by which we get rid
                    of the complexity of our actual life, and direct our thoughts to the simplest
                    and most elementary conditions of being and knowing, is possible only to those
                    who are not limited to that life, but can regard it and all its finite concerns
                    from the point of view of the infinite and the universal. In this sense it is
                    true that religion and metaphysic spring from the same source, and that it is
                    possible to vindicate the rationality of religion only on metaphysical
                    principles. The philosophy of religion is, in fact, only the last application or
                    final expression of metaphysic; and, conversely, a metaphysic which is not
                    capable of furnishing an explanation of religion contradicts itself.</p>
                <p>This last remark affords us a kind of criterion of a true metaphysic. Can it or
                    can it not explain religion? If it cannot, it must be equally unable to explain
                    its own possibility, and therefore implicitly it condemns itself. Thus a
                    pantheistic system, which loses the subject in the absolute substance, cannot
                    explain how that subject should apprehend the substance of which it is but a
                    transitory mode, nor, on the other hand, can it explain why the substance should
                    manifest itself in and to a subject. And the same criticism maybe made on all
                    theories in which the first or metaphysical unity is abstractly opposed to the
                    manifoldness and contingency of things. Not only of Spinoza, but also of Kant,
                    of Fichte, and even of Schelling, it might with some truth be said that their
                    absQlute is like the lion’s den, towards which all the tracks are directed,
                    while none come from it. It is essential that the first unity should be such as
                    to explain the possibility of difference and division, for, if it is not, then
                    the return to unity out of difference is made as accidental as the difference
                    itself. When Aristotle represented the Divine Being as pure self-consciousness,
                    pure form without matter, he found himself unable to account for the existence
                    of any world in which form was realized in matter. When therefore he speaks of
                    tho process of the finite world by which it returns to God, and attributes to
                    nature a will, which is directed to the good as its final cause, his theory
                    seems to be little more than a metaphor in which the analogy of consciousness is
                    applied to the unconscious. For, if the Divine Being is not manifested in the
                    world, any tendency of the world to realize the good becomes an inexplicable
                    fact. A similar difficulty is, as we saw, involved in Kant’s confusion of the
                    bare identity of understanding with the absolute unity of knowledge. Reducing
                    the unity of self-consciousness to such a bare identity, Kant could not be
                    expected to see, what Aristotle had not seen, that pure self-consciousness is
                    essentially related to anything but itself. Hence the various attempts which he
                    made in his ethical works and in his <hi rend="italic">Criticism of
                    Judgment</hi> to find a link of connexion between the noumenal and the empirical
                    were necessarily condemned even by himself as the expressions of a merely
                    regulative and subjective principle of knowledge. Even Fichte, who found in the
                    thought, which is for him the <hi rend="italic">prius</hi> of all existence, a
                    principle of differentiation and integration which explained how
                    self-consciousness in us should be necessarily correlative with the
                    consciousness of a world, was unable to free himself from the Kantian opposition
                    of a noumenal identity in which there is no difference to a phenomenal unity
                    which is realized in difference. Hence by him also the return out of difference
                    is regarded as an impossibility, or as a <hi rend="italic">processus in
                    infinitum,</hi> and the absolute unity as that which is beyond all knowledge and
                    only apprehended by faith.</p>
                <p>If we look to completely elaborated theories, and disregard all tentative and
                    imperfect sketches, it may fairly be said that all that has as yet been done in
                    the region of pure metaphysic is contained in two works, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metaphysic</hi> of Aristotle and the <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi>
                    of Hegel. And up to a certain point the lesson which they teach is one and the
                    same, viz., that the ultimate unity which is presupposed in all differences is
                    the unity of thought with itself, the unity of self-consciousness, and that in
                    this unity is contained the type of all science, and the form of all existence;
                    in other words, I = I is the formula of the universe. The difference between
                    these two works has, however, already been indicated. With Aristotle, because he
                    neglects the essential relation of self-consciousness to consciousness, or of
                    the conscious self to the world of objects in space and time, the unity of
                    self-consciousness tends to pass, as it did pass with the Neo-Platonists, into a
                    pure identity without difference. In the Hegelian logic, on the other hand,
                    selfconsciousness is interpreted as a unity which realizes itself through
                    difference and the reconciliation of difference—as, in fact, an organic unity of
                    elements, which exist only as they pass into each other. In other words, it is
                    shown that the differentiating movement by which the subjective and the
                    objective self are opposed and the integrating movement by which they are
                    reunited are both essential. Hence we cannot think of the conscious self as a
                    simple resting identity, but only as an active self-determining principle; nor
                    can we think of its self-determination as a pure affirmation of itself, without
                    any negation, but only as an affirmation which involves a double negation—an
                    opposition of two elements which yet are essentially united. Each factor in this
                    unity, in fact, is necessarily conceived as passing beyond itself into the
                    other; the subject is subject only as it relates itself to the object, the
                    object is <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n109/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0109-0100"/> object only as it relates itself to the subject.
                    It is this tension against each other of elements which yet are correlated and
                    indissolubly united, this self-surrender to each other of elements which yet are
                    maintained in their distinction, which constitutes the organic unity of thought
                    in itself, and separates it from the mere abstract unity of mysticism. When,
                    however, the concrete or self-differentiating character of the unity of
                    self-consciousness is apprehended in this way,—so that it is impossible to
                    confuse its indivisible unity with the simplicity of that which is one merely
                    because it has no differences in it,—the problem of the relation of pure
                    self-consciousness to the world in space and time ceases to be insoluble.
                    Thought, as it is seen to have difference in itself, is no longer irreconcilable
                    with the world of difference; nor is it necessary to introduce a foreign <hi
                    rend="italic">υλη</hi> to make their connexion intelligible. For, as thought is
                    a principle of difference as well as of unity, of analysis as well as of
                    synthesis, and as it cannot realize itself in its unity except through the
                    utmost development of difference, abstract self-consciousness, with its
                    transparent or merely ideal difference, cannot be its ultimate form. On the
                    contrary, the consciousness of self is possible only in distinction from, and in
                    relation to, a world of objects. In other words, the unity of the thinking
                    subject presupposes, not merely the opposition of the subjective and the
                    objective self, but also the opposition of the self in its pure self-identity to
                    a world of externality and difference. The pure intelligence, which is <hi
                    rend="italic">the</hi><hi rend="italic">prius</hi> of all things, must not,
                    therefore, be regarded—as Aristotle regarded it—as merely theoretical, but also
                    as practical. It must be conceived as a living principle, a principle which only
                    in selfmanifestation can be conscious of itself, and to the very nature of
                    which, therefore, self-manifestation is essential. In this way Hegel—just
                    because he grasped the concrete character of the unity of thought in itself—was
                    enabled to understand the necessary unity of thought or self-consciousness with
                    the world, and to heal the division of physics from metaphysic, which Aristotle
                    had admitted.</p>
                <p>Schelling and others who have raised objections to the Hegelian method have
                    specially directed their criticisms against this transition from logic to the
                    philosophy of nature, from pure self-consciousness to the external world in
                    space and time. In doing so, they have practically fallen back upon the
                    Aristotelian theory, with its opposition of God, as pure form, to the finite
                    world. But this in effect is to deny that “the real is the rational” or
                    intelligible, and to introduce into the world, as the ground of its distinction
                    from reason, a purely irrational or contingent element. A modern follower of
                    Schelling’s later positive philosophy only draws the necessary consequence from
                    this view when he teaches the pessimist creed that the highest good is the
                    negation or extinction of the finite. Nor can we wonder that the same writer who
                    denies that the absolute self-consciousness is essentially related to or
                    manifested in the world should proceed to reduce this self-consciousness to a
                    mystic identity which comes out of itself and becomes self-conscious only by an
                    inscrutable act of will. The fact, indeed, that those who deny the possibility
                    of a rational transition from self-consciousness to the world are forced by the
                    logic of their position to reduce self-consciousness to an abstract identity may
                    be regarded as a kind of indirect proof that the principle of
                    self-consciousness, truly conceived, does involve that transition. Another step
                    in the same direction may be made if we consider how the Cartesian philosophy
                    treated the same opposition, which it also regarded as absolute. By Descartes
                    mind and matter, thought and extension, are defined as abstract opposites, every
                    quality of each finding its contradictory counterpart in a quality of the other.
                    Mind is a pure self-determined unity, which is as it knows itself and knows
                    itself as it is, which has no discretion of parts or capacity of division or
                    determination from without. Matter is essentially discrete or infinitely
                    divided; it is a pure passivity; and all its determination comes to it from
                    without. The world is therefore, as it were, “cut in two with a hatchet,”
                    divided into two unrelated existences, which are held together only by the will
                    of God. Spinoza cuts the knot, and avoids the arbitrariness of this solution, by
                    treating extension and thought as two attributes separated only in respect of
                    our intelligence, but each expressing fully the absolute substance. And
                    something like the same view has been revived in recent times, by writers like
                    Lewes and Mr Spencer, who speak of feelings and motions as two opposite
                    “aspects” of the same fact. When we ask, however, <hi rend="italic">for
                    whom</hi> these attributes or aspects are a unity, it becomes clear that the
                    intelligence which is regarded as standing on one side of the dualism must also
                    be taken as transcending it, and relating the two sides to each other. Moreover,
                    the correspondence of the two attributes upon which Spinoza insists and their
                    contrariety upon which Descartes insists, when taken together, give us the idea
                    of a correlative opposition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of an opposition of
                    elements which yet are necessary to each other. If, therefore, they cannot be
                    simply identified as Spinoza identifies them, yet they need no external bond
                    such as Descartes introduces to combine them; for they cannot exist apart from
                    each other. Their opposition is held within the limits of their unity, and is no
                    absolute contradiction, but rather an opposition which exists only as it is
                    transcended. In other words, it is an abstract opposition, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> it is an opposition of elements which seem to be irreconcilable till
                    it is observed that they are correlative, that each exists or has a meaning only
                    as it relates itself to, or passes out of itself into, the other, and that each,
                    held in its abstraction and separation from the other, loses all the meaning
                    that it seemed to have. For, as in an organic body each member or organ lives
                    only in tension against the others, yet only as continually relating itself to
                    the others, so the utmost opposition of mind to matter, of the intelligence to
                    the intelligible world, presupposes their unity, and is only the realization of
                    it.</p>
                <p>There is here, however, something more than an ordinary case of correlation, for
                    in this unity of opposites mind appears twice, once as one of the opposites, and
                    again as the unity which transcends the opposition. This ambiguity becomes most
                    obvious in theories like that of Mr Spencer, who speaks of “two
                    consciousnesses,” which cannot be resolved into each other, but yet which
                    strangely form inseparable parts of one and the same consciousness. What,
                    however, is really involved in such a statement is that the external world,
                    which in the first instance presents itself as absolutely opposed in nature to
                    the subject whose object it is, is yet one with that subject, and that therefore
                    the antagonism of mind to its object is only the last differentiation through
                    which it realizes its unity with itself. In Hegel’s language, that which
                    presents itself as other than mind is <hi rend="italic">its</hi> other—“an other
                    which is not another,” whose difference and opposition to itself it overreaches
                    and overcomes. We must, therefore, regard the independence and externality of
                    nature, its indifference, and even, as it seems, opposition, to the development
                    of the moral and intellectual life of man, as merely apparent. For man, in this
                    point of view, is not merely one natural being among others, but the being in
                    whom nature is at once completed and transcended. If, therefore, at first he
                    appears to stand in merely accidental and external relations to the other
                    existences among which he finds himself, yet the whole process of his life—the
                    process by which he comes to know the external world, and by which, reacting
                    upon it, he makes it the means to the realization of an individual and <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0110-0101"/> social life of his own—is the negation of this
                    contingency and externality. In all this process he is showing himself to be a
                    being who can only know himself as he knows the objective world, and who can
                    only realize himself as he makes himself the agent of a Divine purpose, to which
                    all things are contributing.</p>
                <p>Such an idea of man’s relation to the world is necessarily involved in any theory
                    that goes beyond that subjective idealism or sensationalism which denies to him
                    every object of knowledge except his own states of feeling, and every end of
                    action except his own pleasures and pains. Recent speculation, indeed, has
                    suggested a compromise by which this dilemma is supposed to be evaded, and
                    mankind are represented as forming an organic unity in themselves, though they
                    are still conceived as standing in an external and accidental relation to
                    nature, the forces of which by their knowledge and skill they have subdued and
                    are more and more subduing to their service. Such a compromise we find in the
                    philosophy of Comte, the first writer who, starting from an apparently empirical
                    basis, was able to break through the individualistic prejudices of the school of
                    Locke. In the latter volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Positive Philosophy,</hi>
                    still more in his <hi rend="italic">Positive Politics,</hi> Comte so far
                    transcends individualism as to deny the externality of men to each other, and to
                    declare that “the individual, as such, is an abstraction,” and that in reality
                    he cannot be separated from the social organism, which is thus not merely an
                    extraneous condition of his development, but essential to his very existence as
                    man. Thus individual men exist only through the universal—through the spirit of
                    the family, of the nation, of humanity, which manifests itself in them as a
                    principle of life and development. Yet this organic unity, according to Comte,
                    is in contact with a world which in relation to it is external and contingent.
                    Nature has not its final cause in man, but on the contrary is, at first, rather
                    his enemy; and it is to humanity itself that the praise is due if to a certain
                    extent the enemy has been turned into a servant. The unity of life which
                    manifests itself in humanity cannot therefore be considered as a universal
                    principle, as the principle of the whole universe, but simply as the principle
                    of the limited existence of man, which is hemmed in on every side by external
                    and, in the main, unknown conditions. If humanity therefore is an organism, it
                    is an organism existing in a medium which in reference to it is inorganic, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> in a medium which has no essential relation to the life
                    which animates man.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, however, that this theory is an illogical attempt to find a
                    standing ground between two opposite philosophies,—between the philosophy which
                    treats man merely as a natural individual, placed among other individual beings
                    and things, and which therefore regards his relation to them as something
                    accidental and external, and the philosophy which treats him as a spiritual
                    subject, a conscious and self-conscious being, and regards him therefore as
                    having no <hi rend="italic">merely</hi> external relations either to other men
                    or to nature. Comte shrinks from regarding the world without us as the
                    manifestation of that spiritual principle which is also within us, which
                    constitutes our very nature as individual men, and therefore connects us with
                    the world at the same time that it separates us from it. Yet he recognizes the
                    existence in us of a principle which is so far universal that it constitutes a
                    community between all men. He thinks that the individual can transcend himself,
                    so far as to see all things, not indeed from a Divine point of view, <hi
                    rend="italic">sub specie</hi><hi rend="italic">aetemitatis,</hi> but from the
                    point of view of universal humanity, and that in conformity with this
                    theoretical consciousness, he can live a practical life of altruism, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a life in which he identifies his own good with the
                    good of humanity. But the philosophy that has gone so far must logically go
                    further. It is impossible to treat humanity as an organism without extending the
                    organic idea to the conditions under which the social life of humanity is
                    developed. The medium by aid of which, or in reacting against which, the
                    organized being maintains itself is an essential part of its life; it remains
                    organic only in so far as it can mould itself to its conditions, and its
                    conditions to itself. This is true even of the animal organism in relation to
                    its small circle of conditions, which, however, is part of a larger circle to
                    which the animal has no relation. But a conscious being is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >universal</hi> centre of relations; there is nothing which it, as conscious,
                    cannot make part of its own life. Hence the application of the organic idea to
                    it involves its application to the whole world. And, if the recognition of a
                    universal principle manifested in humanity naturally led Comte to the idea of
                    the worship of humanity, the recognition of a universal principle manifested in
                    man and nature alike must lead to the idea of the worship of God.</p>
                <p>The rationality of religion, then, rests on the possibility of an ultimate
                    synthesis in which man and nature are regarded as the manifestation of one
                    spiritual principle. For religion involves a faith that, in our efforts to
                    realize the good of humanity, we are not merely straining after an ideal beyond
                    us, which may or may not be realized, but are animated by a principle which
                    within us and without us is necessarily realizing itself, because it is the
                    ultimate principle by which all things are, and are known. This absolute
                    certitude that we work effectually because all the universe is working with us,
                    or, in other words, because God is working in us, can find its explanation and
                    defence only in a philosophy for which “the real is the rational, and the
                    rational is the real.” And such a philosophy, beginning with the Kantian
                    doctrine that existence means existence for a spiritual or thinking subject,
                    must go on to prove that that only can exist for such a subject which is the
                    manifestation of thought or spirit; and, conversely, that spirit or intelligence
                    is essentially self-manifesting, or, in other words, that it cannot be conceived
                    except as standing in essential relation to an external and material world.
                    Finally, if nature be thus regarded as a necessary manifestation of spirit, it
                    can be opposed to spirit only in so far as spirit in its realization becomes
                    opposed to itself. In other words, nature must be regarded as, from a higher
                    point of view, included in spirit. Nature exists that it may show itself to be
                    spiritual in and to man, who transcends it yet implies it, who finds in it the
                    necessary basis of his thought and action, but only that he may build upon it a
                    higher spiritual life.</p>
                <p>Nature is made better by no mean</p>
                <p>But nature makes that mean: so over the art Which, you say, adds to nature is an
                    art Which nature makes.”</p>
                <p>Only the order of precedence suggested by these words must be inverted. For, as
                    nature only is for spirit, so the spiritual energy which reacts upon nature is
                    that which manifests for the first time what nature in reality is. It is the
                    consciousness of this— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> of the identity of that
                    which is realizing itself within and without us,—the consciousness that the
                    necessity which is the precondition of our freedom is the manifestation of the
                    same spirit which makes us free—which turns morality into religion. For it is
                    this alone which enables us to regard the realization of the highest ends of
                    human life as no mere happy accident, or as a conquest to be won by the cunning
                    of man from an unfriendly or indifferent destiny, but as the result towards
                    which all things are working.</p>
                <p>In this philosophy, which finds its most adequate expression in the works of
                    Hegel, there are two things which may be distinguished—the general idealistic
                    view of the world, and the dialectical movement of thought in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n111/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0111-0102"/> which Hegel develops and expresses it. And there
                    are perhaps many at the present time who are prepared to accept the former, but
                    who yet suspect, or even reject, the latter. And no doubt there is much in
                    Hegel’s <hi rend="italic">Logic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of
                    Spirit,</hi> and still more in his <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Nature,</hi>
                    which there is reason to regard with distrust. In clever hands that are not
                    checked by a sufficient consciousness of the whole, the Hegelian dialectic may
                    be made into the means of producing a seeming proof of anything. Nor is it
                    always easy to determine how far Hegel himself was tempted by an impatient
                    consciousness of the universality of his method to employ it in cases where the
                    conditions of its successful application were wanting. Sometimes he seems to
                    forget, what he himself teaches, that science must first have generalized
                    experience and determined it by its finite categories, ere it is possible for
                    philosophy to give its final interpretation. Yet, when we realize the nature of
                    that interpretation, and of the transformation of science which philosophy by
                    means of it proposes to effect, it becomes clear that the dialectic of Hegel is
                    no extraneous addition to his idealism, but is part and parcel of the same
                    movement of thought. For this dialectic rests on the idea that thought or
                    self-consciousness finds in its own organic unity the ultimate key to all
                    difficulties in regard to the objects of thought and their relations to each
                    other and to the mind. Self-consciousness, as has been already shown, is
                    implicitly the whole web of categories which it throws over the world, and by
                    aid of which it makes the world intelligible. All these it contains in itself;
                    and, as it proceeds to determine the meaning of things, it simply produces its
                    store, and exhausts itself on the object. Now, if it be idealism, in the strict
                    sense of the word, to make thought or self-consciousness the principle and
                    ultimate explanation of all that exists, it is obvious that we cannot separate
                    idealism from such a dialectic as this, which is nothing more than the mind’s
                    consciousness of its own movement or process of self-affirmation. If to find
                    thought in things be more than an empty word, then the movement or process which
                    thought is must explain at once the transition from thought to what in
                    opposition to it we call “things,” and must give us the means of reconciling
                    that opposition. In other words, the same movement by which thought determines
                    itself as self-conscious, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> as a unity realized
                    through difference, must also be conceived as the explanation of the difference
                    between pure thought and the world, and as the solution of that difference in
                    the idea of absolute spirit.</p>
                <p>Such idealism has a close relation to Christianity; it may be even said to be but
                    Christianity theorized. It has often been asserted that Hegel’s philosophy of
                    religion is but an artificial accommodation to Christian doctrine of a
                    philosophy which has no inherent relation to Christianity. If, however, we
                    regard the actual development of that philosophy it would be truer to say that
                    it was the study of Christian ideas which first produced it. What delivered
                    Hegel from the mysticism in which the later philosophies of Fichte and Schelling
                    tended to lose themselves, and led him, in his own language, to regard the
                    absolute “not merely as substance but as subject,”—what made him recognize with
                    Fichte that the absolute principle is spiritual, and yet enabled him with
                    Schelling to see in nature, as the opposite of spirit, the very means of its
                    realization,— was his thorough appreciation of the ethical and religious meaning
                    of Christianity. In the great Christian aphorism that “he who loseth his life
                    alone can save it” he found a key to the difficulties of ethics, a
                    reconciliation of hedonism and asceticism. For what this saying implies is that
                    a spiritual or self-conscious being is one who is in contradiction with himself
                    when he makes his individual self his end. In opposing his own interest to that
                    of others, he is preventing their interests from becoming his; all things are
                    his, and his only, who has died to himself. But if this be the truth of
                    morality, it is something more, for “morality is the nature of things.” We
                    cannot separate the law of the life of man from the law of the world in which he
                    lives. And, if it is the nature of things, as it is the nature of spirit, that
                    he who loseth his life shall save it, the world must be referred to a spiritual
                    principle, and the Christian doctrine of the nature of God is only the converse
                    of the Christian law of ethics. To Hegel, starting from this point, a new light
                    was thrown on the Fichtean treatment of the idea of self, and the Fichtean proof
                    that the consciousness of self implies a relation to an object which is opposed
                    to the self, and which yet from another point of view—since an object exists
                    only for a subject—cannot be anything but an element of its own life. It was
                    seen that this movement of thought is no mere fluctuation between contradictory
                    positions, to be terminated finally by an <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi> of
                    faith, but that the unity of the opposite elements is apprehensible by the
                    intelligence, and that indeed it is <hi rend="italic">its</hi> presence to the
                    intelligence which makes the consciousness of opposition possible. It was in
                    this sense that Hegel could say that that unity of opposites which had been
                    called unintelligible by previous writers was just the very nature of the
                    intelligence, and that only a view of the world guided by this idea could be
                    properly intelligible, while every other view must contain in it an unsolved
                    contradiction, an element that remains permanently impervious to thought.</p>
                <p>The great objection to a metaphysic like this, at least an objection which weighs
                    much in the minds of many, is that which springs from the contrast between the
                    claim of absolute knowledge which it seems to involve and the actual limitations
                    which our intelligence encounters in every direction. If the theory were true,
                    it is felt we ought to be nearer the solution of the problems of our life,
                    practical and speculative, than we are; the riddle of the painful earth ought to
                    vex us less; we ought to find our way more easily through the entanglement of
                    facts, and to be able to deal with practical difficulties in a less tentative
                    manner. Yet there is really no antagonism between such a doctrine and a
                    consciousness of the limitation of our faculties; nay rather, it is only on such
                    a theory that a rational distrust of ourselves can be based. When Aristotle
                    meets the warning that we should think finite and human things since we are
                    finite and human with the answer that we ought rather, so far as in us lies, to
                    rise to what is immortal and divine, he is not denying the limits of man’s
                    knowledge and power; on the contrary, he is rather pointing to the very
                    principle which makes us conscious of those limits; for it is just because there
                    is in man a principle of infinity that he knows his finitude, and, conversely,
                    it is just in the consciousness of this finitude that he rises above it. A
                    rational humility is possible only to one who has in himself the measure of his
                    own weakness, and who, if he “trembles like a guilty thing surprised,” is yet
                    conscious that he is trembling before himself. This truth is often expressed by
                    Kant with special relation to the moral consciousness, as where he contrasts the
                    limitation of man, as a sensible being, occupying an infinitesimal space in the
                    boundless world of sense, with his freedom from all limitation as a personal
                    self, a member of the truly infinite world of intelligence. But it is not
                    necessary to adopt Kant’s abstract division of the sensible from the
                    intelligible world to see that the consciousness of the greatness of the problem
                    which has to be solved in human life and thought is deepened and widened by that
                    very idea of philosophy which yet gives us the assurance that the problem is not
                    insoluble, and even that, in principle, it is already solved <hi
