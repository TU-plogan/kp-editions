                    by Denbigh and Montgomery, and W. by Cardigan Bay. It is triangular in shape,
                    its greatest length northeast to south-west being 45 miles, and its greatest
                    breadth north-west to south-east about 30miles. The area is 385,291 acres, or
                    about 600 square miles. Next to Carnarvon, Merioneth is the most mountainous
                    county in Wales. If the scenery is less bold and striking than that of
                    Carnarvon, it excels it in richness, variety, and picturesque beauty. Its lofty
                    mountains are interpenetrated by dark deep dells or smiling vales. The outlines
                    of its rugged crags are softened and adorned by rich foliage. The sea views are
                    frequently fine, and rivers, lakes, and waterfalls add a romantic charm to the
                    valleys. The highest summits in the county are the picturesque Cader Idris
                    (which divides into three peaks,—one, Pen-y-Gadair, having an altitude of 2914
                    feet), Aran Fawddwy (2955), Arenig-fawr (2818), Moel-wyn (2566), Rhobell-fawr
                    (2360). The finest valleys are those of Dyfi, Dysyni, Talyllyn, Mawddach, and
                    Festiniog. The river Dyfrdwy or Dee rises 10 miles north-west of Bala, and,
                    after passing through Bala Lake, flows northeast by Corwen to Denbighshire. The
                    Dyfi rises in a small lake near Aran Fawddwy, and expands into an estuary of
                    Cardigan Bay. The Mawddach or Maw, from the north of Aran Fawddwy, has a course
                    of 12 miles southwest, during which it is joined by several other streams. The
                    Dwyryd and other-streams unite in forming the estuary of Traeth Bach. The finest
                    waterfalls are the <pb break="no"

                    Pistyll Cain, the latter 150 feet high. The lakes are very numerous, but small,
                    the largest being Bala Lake, or Pim-blemere (in Welsh, Llyn Tegid, fair lake), 4
                    miles long by 1 broad, and Llyn Mwyngil (lake in a sweet nook) in the vale of
                    Talyllyn. Both are much frequented by anglers. On account of frequent
                    indentations the coast-line is about 100 miles long. Sandy beaches intervene
                    between the rocky shores. Frequent shoals and sandbanks render navigation very
                    dangerous. There are only two harbours of importance, Barmouth and
                    Aberdovey.</p>
                <p>A mountain tract of the county 15 miles from north to south by 10 from east to
                    west, stretching from the coast inland, is of the Cambrian age, composed of
                    grits, quartzose, and slates, and comprising the Merionethshire anticlinal. This
                    tract is enclosed on the north, east, and south by the Menevian, Lingula,
                    Tremadoc, and Arenig beds, which are pierced by numerous dykes and intrusive
                    masses, mostly greenstone. Rhobell-fawr is one of the greatest igneous masses in
                    the whole area of the Lingula beds. The Arenig beds are interstratified with and
                    overlaid by accumulations of volcanic ashes, felspathic traps, or lava flows,
                    which form the rugged heights of Cader Idris, the Arans, the Arenigs, Manod, and
                    Moel-wyn; and these are in turn overlaid by the Llandeilo and Bala beds, the
                    latter including the Bala limestone. Extensive slate quarries are worked near
                    Festiniog, mostly underground, in strata of the Llandeilo age, giving employment
                    to about 4000 men. Gold, lead, copper, and manganese have been obtained in
                    various places.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate varies much with the
                    elevation, in some places being bleak and cold, and in others remarkably equable
                    and genial. At Aberdovey it is proverbially mild, and the myrtle grows in the
                    open air. All attempts to introduce fruits have proved abortive in most parts of
                    the county. The soil is generally thin and poor, with fertile tracts in the
                    valleys. A great portion of the moss has been reclaimed within late years.</p>
                <p>According to the agricultural returns for 1882, there were 154,406 acres, or
                    considerably less than half the total area, under cultivation. Of this as much
                    as 119,133 acres were permanent pasture, and 13,755 under rotation grasses. Of
                    the 17,312 acres under corn crops, 11,232 were under oats and 4807 under barley.
                    Potatoes occupied 2392 acres, and turnips only 1496 acres. The area under woods
                    extended to 15,049 acres.</p>
                <p>The total number of horses in 1882 was 6088. A breed of ponies is peculiar to
                    this county and Montgomeryshire. The rearing of horned cattle and dairy-farming
                    are largely carried on, but the number of cattle (37,643) is considerably under
                    the average of Wales generally. On the other hand the number of sheep in 1882
                    was 400,553, a larger number than in any other county of Wales, and much beyond
                    the general average in the principality. They are a small hardy breed, which
                    grow heavy fleeces. Goats frequent the loftier crags.</p>
                <p>According to the latest return the number of proprietors was 1695, possessing
                    303,374 acres, with a gross annual value of £183,253. Of the owners 1044, or 62
                    percent., possessed less than 1 acre, the average extent of the properties being
                    189 acres, and the average value per acre a little over 12s. There were ten
                    proprietors who possessed over 5000 acres, viz., Sir w. W. Wynn, 20,295; R. J.
                    I.. Price, 17,718; T. P. Lloyd, 16,975; Mrs Kirkby, 13,410; Hon. C. H. Wynn,
                    10,504; A. J. G. Corbet, 9347; Sir E. Buckley, 8738; W. E. Oakeley, 6018; W. O.
                    Gore, 5497; and R. Μ. Rickards, 5701.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Manufactures.—</hi> Woollen goods are manufactured in various
                    places, especially at Dolgelly. They are principally coarse druggets,
                    Kerseymeres, and flannels. The knitting of stockings was a great industry at the
                    close of last century, the value of the sales at Bala being estimated at from
                    £17,000 to £19,000 annually.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Railways.—</hi> The Cambrian Railway skirts the coast from
                    Portmadoc to Aberdovey. At Barmouth Junction a branch of the same crosses to
                    Dolgelly, where it is joined by a branch of the Great Western Railway. Another
                    branch of the Great Western unites Bala and Festiniog, and the latter place has
                    railway connexion both with Llandudno Junction and with Portmadoc.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Administration and Population.—</hi> Merionethshire comprises
                    five hundreds and thirty-three civil parishes. It has one court of quarter
                    sessions, and the number of petty sessional divisions is six. Ecclesiastically
                    it is partly in the diocese of Bangor, partly in that of St Asaph. The county
                    returns one member to parliament. There is no municipal or parliamentary
                    borough. The towns returned in 1881 as urban sanitary districts are Bala (1653),
                    Barmouth (1512), Dolgelly (2457), Festiniog (11,272), and Towyn (3363). Since
                    1801 the population has nearly doubled. From 29,506 in that year it had
                    increased in 1851 to 38,963, in 1871 to 46,598, and in 1881 to 54,793, of whom
                    27,576 were males, and 27,217 females.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> Originally Merioneth belonged to
                    the territory of the Ordovices, and under the Romans it was included in <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Secunda.</hi> There are many
                    Celtic, Roman, and mediaeval remains. Caer Drewyn on the Dee, near Corwen, was a
                    British camp. There are numerous cromlechs in various parts of the county,
                    especially near the sea-coast. The <hi rend="italic">Via</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Occidentalis</hi> of the Romans passed through Merioneth from south to north,
                    and at Tomen-y-Mur was joined by a branch of the South Watling Street, the
                    Castell Tomen-y-Mur being supposed to be identical with the Roman station of
                    Heriri Mons. The immense ruin of Castel-y-Bere was originally one of the largest
                    castles in Wales, but has not been occupied since the time of Edward I. During
                    the Wars of the Roses the castle of Harlech, still a fine ruin, was held by the
                    Lancastrians, and was the last in Wales to surrender. Of ecclesiastical remains
                    the most important is Cymmer Abbey, founded by the Cistercians in 1198, a very
                    fine ruin containing architecture of various periods from Norman to
                    Perpendicular. There are numerous interesting old churches.</p>
