                <p><label type="entry">MILITIA</label>. The militia of the United Kingdom consists
                    of a number of officers and men maintained for the purpose of augmenting the
                    military strength of the country in case of imminent national danger or great
                    emergency. In such a contingency the whole or any part of the militia is liable,
                    by proclamation of the sovereign, to be embodied,—that is to say, placed on
                    active military service within the confines of the United Kingdom. The occasion
                    for issuing the proclamation must be first communicated by message to parliament
                    if it be then in session; if it be not sitting, parliament must be called
                    together within ten days. For the purpose of keeping the force in a condition of
                    military efficiency, the officers and men are subjected to one preliminary
                    training for a period not exceeding six (usually about two) months, and further
                    to an annual training not exceeding fifty-six (usually twentyeight) days. The
                    force is composed of corps of artillery, engineers, and infantry. Infantry
                    militiamen are formed into battalions constituting part of the territorial
                    regiment of the locality of which the regular forces are the senior battalions.
                    The officers and men when called out are liable to duty with the regulars and in
                    all respects as regular soldiers within the United Kingdom. Of late years the
                    men have been raised exclusively by voluntary enlistment, but where a sufficient
                    number for any county or place is not thus raised a ballot may be resorted to in
                    order to complete the quota fixed by the queen in council for that county or
                    place. Each man is enlisted as a militiaman for the county, to serve in the
                    territorial regiment or corps of the district. The period of engagement is not
                    to exceed six years, but during the last of these years a militiaman may be
                    reengaged for a further period also not exceeding six years.</p>

                <p>Men who illegally absent themselves are liable, in addition to punishment for the
                    offence, to make up for the time of their absence by a corresponding extension
                    of their service. The officers are appointed and promoted by the crown, but
                    first appointments are given to persons recommended by the lord lieutenant of
                    the county who may be approved as fulfilling the prescribed conditions in
                    respect of age, physical fitness, and educational qualifications. Since 1877 the
                    officers have been permanently subject to military law. The general body of the
                    non-commissioned officers and men are so subject only when called out for
                    training or embodiment. At other periods they have simply the legal status of
                    civilians, except as regards a liability to trial and punishment for offences in
                    connexion with enlistment or for military offences committed while called out.
                    Each militia regiment has a permanent staff, consisting of an adjutant and a
                    small body of non-commissioned officers and drummers, to conduct the recruiting
                    drills and ordinary business of the corps; and the members of this permanent
                    staff are always subject to military law. They mostly consist of
                    non-commissioned officers who belong to or have served in the regular portion of
                    the territorial regiment. Many of the militia corps have their headquarters at
                    the brigade dépôt or local establishment of the territorial regiment, and all
                    are under the general supervision of the (regular) colonel commanding the
                    brigade dépôt. The area of service does not extend beyond the United Kingdom;
                    but those who voluntarily offer to serve in the Channel Islands, the Isle of
                    Man, Malta, or Gibraltar may be employed therein. The uniform of the officers
                    and men of the militia is precisely the same as that of the regular corps with
                    which they are associated, or rather of which they form part, except that in
                    addition to the regimental distinguishing mark they bear the letter “Μ” upon
                    their appointments, to denote that they belong to the militia portion of the
                    corps.</p>
                <p>As above stated, the ranks of the militia are usually filled by voluntary
                    enlistment; but by a statute which, though temporarily suspended, can be put in
                    force provisions are made for filling up any deficiency in the allotted quota in
                    any county, city, or riding by ballot of the male inhabitants if within certain
                    limits of age. The enactment provides as follows :—</p>
                <p>The secretary of state is to declare the number of militiamen required, whereupon
                    the lord lieutenant is to cause meetings to be held of the lieutenancy for each
                    subdivision. To these meetings the householders of each parish are to send in
                    lists of all male persons between the ages of eighteen and thirty dwelling in
                    their respective houses. Before the ballot, however, the parish may supply
                    volunteers to fill up the quota, every volunteer so provided and approved
                    counting as if he were a balloted person. If a deficiency still exists, the
                    persons on the lists shall be balloted for, and double the number of those
                    required to supply the deficiency shall be drawn out. Any person whose name is
                    so drawn may claim exemption or object; and the deputy lieutenants settle the
                    question of his liability to serve. From the corrected list those who are of the
                    requisite physique (the height is 5 feet 2) are enrolled in the order in which
                    their names are numbered until the quota is completed. If the list is not
                    sufficient to fill the quota, another ballot in the same manner is to be taken.
                    Any balloted man becoming liable to serve may, however, provide a substitute who
                    has the requisite physical qualifications, and is not himself liable to
                    serve.</p>
                <p>Within the general body of the militia is contained another having an additional
                    and important obligation in the matter of service. It is called the “militia
                    reserve,” and is formed of men who voluntarily undertake a liability to join the
                    regular forces and serve in any place to which they may be ordered in case of
                    the proclamation of a state of imminent national danger or great emergency. In
                    this respect they are in fact upon the same footing as the army reserve, and on
                    the occasion of the mobilization of 1878 more than 20,000 of these men became
                    part of the regular army. The present strength of the militia reserve is a
                    little under 29,000 men, and judging by past experience it may be computed that
                    about 25,000 could be at once added to the ranks of an army in the field in the
                    event of national danger or emergency. It is to be observed, however, that every
                    man thus added to the regulars would be taken away from the effective strength
                    of the militia.</p>
                <p>There is no statutory provision for the number of men to be maintained, that
                    number being what from time to time may be voted by parliament. The latest
                    information available respecting the actual condition of the militia of Great
                    Britain relates to the year 1881, and that of Ireland to 1880, the militia of
                    the latter country for obvious political reasons not having been called out for
                    training in 1881 or 1882. Taking the militia of the United Kingdom in 1881, we
                    find that the establishment provided for was 139,501, of whom 18,618 were
                    artillery, 1317 engineers, and 119,566 infantry. Divided into ranks, this
                    establishment was made up of 3534 sergeants and 1260 drummers of the permanent
                    staff, and of the general body 3909 officers, 2520 sergeants, 5040 corporals,
                    and 123,238 privates. The number actually enrolled was 127,868 of all ranks,
                    leaving 11,633 wanting to complete. Of the number enrolled 84,864 belonged to
                    English, 14,138 to Scotch, and 28,866 to Irish regiments, the numbers wanting to
                    complete being for England 7420, for Scotland 162, and for Ireland 4051. As the
                    Irish regiments were not called out, our information regarding the actual
                    effective condition of the force as shown at the annual training does not
                    include Ireland. With regard to the English regiments, 74,945 were present out
                    of an enrolled strength of 84,864. Of the absentees 3144 were with and 6775
                    without leave. In the Scotch regiments, 12,401 appeared at the training, and of
                    the absentees 616 were with leave and 1121 without. Of the total establishment
                    (106,584) for Great Britain, 99,002 were enrolled, and of those enrolled 87,346
                    presented themselves and 3760 were absent with leave and 7896 actual defaulters.
                    Of the English regiments five-sixths and of the Scotch regiments two-thitds were
                    born in the county to which their regiments respectively belonged. Of 92,677 men
                    (for Great Britain) whose occupations are disclosed, 17,665 were artisans,
                    22,221 mechanical labourers, 26,227 agricultural labourers, and 26,564 other
                    trades. Speaking approximately, more than one-half of the men were between
                    twenty and thirty years of age, about 4 per cent, between seventeen and
                    eighteen, about 9 per cent, between eighteen and nineteen, and about 12 per
                    cent, between nineteen and twenty, while some 20 per cent, were over thirty
                    years of age. More than one-half those inspected in 1881 were between 5 feet 5
                    inches and 5 feet 7 inches in height, about 20 per cent, were under 5 feet 5
                    inches, while only 585 out of a total of 92,677 were 6 feet and upwards. At the
                    date of inspection there were 296 men in military confinement and 465 in the
                    custody of the civil power. On the last occasion (1880) on which the Irish
                    militia were called out, upon an establishment of 32,813 and an enrolled
                    strength of 30,515 the number present at the training was 26,399, leaving 706
                    absent with and 2264 without leave. Regiments numbering in the aggregate 1146
                    men were not trained.</p>
                <p>As distinguished from the regular forces or standing army, the militia has been
                    described as the constitutional military force of the country; and its history
                    justifies the description, at least up to a recent period when it lost its
                    distinctive character and became to a great extent merged in the regular army.
                    It is the oldest force Britain possesses, and in fact represents the train bands
                    of early English history. Its origin is to be found in the obligation of all
                    freemen between certain ages to arm themselves for the preservation of the peace
                    within their respective counties, and generally for the protection of the
                    kingdom from invasion. This obligation, imposed in the first instance upon the
                    individuals themselves, became shifted to the owners of land, who were compelled
                    to keep up their proportion of horses and armour for the national defence. The
                    forces were <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n318/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0318-0301"/> placed under the lieutenant of the county,
                    empowered in this respect by a commission from the crown. This prerogative of
                    the sovereign, which had been in some instances a matter of controversy, was
                    declared by statute shortly after the Restoration. By the same statute the
                    militia of each county was placed under the lieutenant, who was vested with the
                    appointment of officers, but with a reservation to the crown in the way of
                    commissioning and dismissal. The cost of the annual training—for fourteen
                    days—fell upon the local authority. Offences against discipline were dealt with
                    by the civil magistrates, but with a power to the officers of fining and of
                    imprisoning in default. Upon this footing the militia of England remained for
                    nearly a century, with the general approval of the community. It was recognized
                    as an instrument for defence and for the preservation of internal order, while
                    it was especially popular from the circumstance that from its constitution and
                    organization the crown could not use it as a means of violating the constitution
                    or abridging the liberty of the subject. It was controlled and regulated in the
                    county; it was officered by the landowners and their relatives, its ranks were
                    filled by men not depending for their subsistence or advancement upon the favour
                    of the crown; its numbers and maintenance were beyond the royal control; its
                    government was by statute. While the supreme command was distinctly vested in
                    the crown, every practical security was thus taken against its use by the crown
                    for any object not constitutional or legitimate. It was regarded as, and was, in
                    fact, the army of the state as distinguished from the standing army, which was
                    very much the army of the king personally. The latter consisted of hired
                    soldiers, and was more than once recruited by a conscription, confined, however,
                    to persons of the vagrant class not having a lawful employment, while the former
                    was mainly composed of those having a fixed abode and status. The militia thus
                    enjoyed for many years as compared with the regular forces a social as well as a
                    constitutional superiority. About the middle of the last century the militia was
                    reconstituted, with certain modifications, not involving a sacrifice of the
                    principle of its local government, but strengthening somewhat the supervising
                    influence of the crown. Thus the king directly appointed the permanent staff,
                    and was given a veto upon the appointment and promotion of the officers, who
                    were to have a property qualification. A quota was fixed for each county, to be
                    raised by ballot of those between the ages of eighteen and forty-five, each
                    parish having the option of supplying volunteers at its own cost, and each man
                    balloted being permitted in lieu of serving to pay £10 to provide a substitute.
                    When called out for service the pay was to be the same as that of the regulars,
                    and while embodied or assembled for annual training the officers and men were
                    placed under the Mutiny Act and Articles of War, with, however, a proviso that
                    in time of training no punishment was to extend to “life or limb.” The crown was
                    given the power to call out the militia in case of apprehended invasion or of
                    rebellion, and associate it with the regular army, but only upon the condition
                    of previously informing parliament if then sitting, and if it were not sitting
                    of calling parliament together for the purpose. A further and important security
                    was established to prevent an unconstitutional use of the militia by the crown:
                    the estimate for its training was framed each year, not by an executive minister
                    of the sovereign, but by the House of Commons itself. Upon the initiative of a
                    committee of the House, an Act was passed providing for the pay and clothing of
                    the militia for the year. Upon this footing substantially the militia of England
                    remained for many years, the Irish and Scotch militias being meantime brought
                    under the same conditions by various enactments. The force was embodied on
                    several occasions during the last and in the early years of the present century,
                    and it contributed largely to the army engaged in the Peninsula. From 1803 to
                    1813 just 100,000 men, or two-fifths of those raised for the army, came from the
                    militia. In this way, however, it lost its distinctive character as a defensive
                    force. During the peace which followed the final fall of Napoleon the militia
                    was suffered to fall into decay; and up to 1852 it had only a nominal existence
                    in the shape of an effete permanent staff with no duties to perform. In 1853 the
                    militia was revived just in time to enable it to fulfil most valuable functions.
                    In the war with Russia it was embodied and did garrison duty not only in the
                    United Kingdom but in the Mediterranean garrisons, thus enabling the authorities
                    to send most of the available regular troops to the scene of hostilities. It
                    further contributed many officers and some 30,000 men to the line. It still
                    gives annually about 8000 recruits to the regulars. During the Indian mutiny it
                    filled scarcely less useful functions when again called out. It has since then
                    been regularly assembled for annual training; and when it is brigaded with the
                    regular forces at Aidershot and other camps of instruction its military aptitude
                    and proficiency have generally elicited the surprised admiration of professional
                    soldiers. In 1§71 an important constitutional change was made. It was part of
                    the new army system inaugurated in that year that the control of the militia
                    should be removed from the lord lieutenant of the county and vested wholly in
                    the crown. It has now virtually ceased to exist as a distinct body, and is a
                    part of the regular forces with a limitation as to the time and area and other
                    conditions of service. There is no longer a regiment of militia. The body that
                    would formerly be thus described is now a collection of militiamen of a regiment
                    largely composed of regulars. The votes for the maintenance of the militia are
                    now part of the army estimates. The officers of the militia and the line are
                    eligible for duty with either force, and may sit upon courts martial
                    indiscriminately. This practical amalgamation of the old constitutional force
                    with the standing army may appear theoretically open to the objection that it is
                    thereby placed under the direct control of the sovereign. But the day has passed
                    when such an objection could have any value. The fact of the whole army being
                    placed in all respects under the direct control of a minister responsible not
                    only to the crown but to parliament is enough to dissipate any constitutional
                    apprehensions under this head.</p>
                <p>The only colonial militia that forms an effective force is that of Canada, which
                    is organized as an efficient local army. The Government of the Dominion includes
                    a minister of militia and defence. The force is placed under the command of a
                    general officer, assisted by an adjutant-general, belonging to the regular army
                    and appointed by the queen. The training of the officers is a matter of special
                    care, there being a military college at Kingston, several of the governing body
                    and professors of which are officers of the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers,
                    as well as schools of gunnery and musketry. For military purposes the Dominion
                    is mapped out in twelve districts. The militia is divided into the active and
                    the reserve, and the male inhabitants between the ages of eighteen and sixty,
                    with the usual exceptions, are liable to military service, the extent of which
                    varies with the age of each man, the larger amount of duty falling upon the
                    younger. The active militia comprises 12 regiments of cavalry, 17 field and 31
                    garrison batteries of artillery besides a mountain battery, 4 companies of
                    engineers, 2 mounted rifle corps, 97 battalions of from 5 to 10 companies each
                    and 16 independent companies of infantry. The uniform is for the most part like
                    that of the regular army, and the organization and general efficiency of the
                    whole body have been very favourably reported upon. Although the obligations of
                    the Canadian militia are purely local, a large number on a late occasion offered
                    themselves for general service; and, in the event of a war on a large scale, it
                    is believed that the force would contribute a valuable addition to the fighting
                    strength of the imperial army. (J. C. O’D.)</p>
