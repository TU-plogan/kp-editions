                    population (25,000 in 1739) had sunk to 12,000 or 13,000 by the beginning of the
                    19th century, and has only begun recently to increase again, being 15,939 in
                    1882. The dwelling-houses, which in 1739 were about 3800, are now but 3000, and
                    of these about 600 are unoccupied. The vast warehouses and imposing mansions
                    once belonging to wealthy families, which have either died out or left the
                    place, call up the memory of that prosperity which Middelburg enjoyed before its
                    extensive trade, with the East and West Indies, with England and Flanders, was
                    ruined by the war with England and the French occupation. By the opening of the
                    railway (1872) and of the ship canal (1873) to Flushing Middelburg was lifted
                    out of its isolation, and, with the assistance of the chamber of commerce,
                    manufacturing industries (iron, machinery, furniture, oil, cigars, &amp;c.) were
                    established; but the prosperity anticipated for Flushing, and consequently for
                    Middelburg, remains unrealized. One of the chief sights of Middelburg is the
                    splendid town-house, for the most part erected in 1512-13, with its front gable
                    adorned with twenty-five statues of counts and countesses of Holland and
                    Zealand; it contains the archives, and a most valuable antiquarian and
                    historical collection. The abbey, begun in 1150, has frequently been the
                    residence of royal visitors (Maximilian, Philip the Fair, Charles V., and so on
                    down to Napoleon I., and William I., II., and III.); part of it is now an hotel,
                    and part of it is occupied by the provincial authorities. The great hall of the
                    building, in which the states of Zealand assemble, is adorned with beautiful
                    tapestries by Jan de Maecht, representing the heroic feats of the men of Zealand
                    in the contest with Spain. What was formerly the nave of the abbey church is now
                    the New Church, and the ancient choir constitutes the Choir Church. The former
                    contains a fine pulpit resting on an eagle, the monument of William, king of the
                    Romans (d. 1256), and the tombs of Jan and Cornelis Evertsen, two naval heroes
                    who fell in the war against England in 1666; the latter has the monuments of the
                    learned Hadrian Junius and of Jan Pieterszoon. The provincial court, the corn
                    exchange, the Hof St Joris and the Hof St Sebastian (formerly buildings
                    belonging to the guilds of archers, and now places of amusement) deserve
                    mention. The great museum of Zealand antiquities, collected by the Zealand
                    Society of Arts and Sciences (founded at Flushing in 1769 and transferred to
                    Middelburg in 1801), shows that the town is the intellectual centre of the
                    province.</p>
                <p>The principal facts in the history of Middelburg are the sieges by the Flemings
                    in 1288, 1296, and 1303 (the last resulting in the capture of the town by Guy of
                    Dampierre); the recovery of the town from the Spaniards in 1574, after an
                    investment of nearly two years; the frequent disturbances among the townsfolk in
                    the 17th and 18th centuries; the surrender to the English in 1809; and the
                    arrival and departure of the French in 1809 and 1814.</p>
