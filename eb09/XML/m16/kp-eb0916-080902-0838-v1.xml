                        Fernandez de</hi> (1760-1828), Spanish dramatist and poet, was the son of N.
                    F. Moratin mentioned below, and was born at Madrid on 10th March 1760. His
                    poetical and artistic tastes were early developed, but his father, keenly alive
                    to the difficulties of the literary calling, caused him to be apprenticed to a
                    jeweller. At the age of eighteen Moratin surprised his friends by winning the
                    second prize of the Academy for a heroic poem on the conquest of Granada, and
                    two years afterwards he attracted still more general attention by a similar
                    success of his <hi rend="italic">Leccion</hi><hi rend="italic">Poetica,</hi> a
                    satire upon the popular poets of the day. Through Jovellanos he was now
                    appointed secretary to Cabarrus on his special mission to France in 1787, and
                    during his stay there he diligently improved his opportunities of becoming
                    acquainted with the contemporary French drama, and of cultivating the
                    acquaintance of men of letters. Of the literary friendships he then formed the
                    most important was that with Goldoni; indeed, Moratin is much more correctly
                    styled “the Spanish Goldoni” than “the Spanish Molière.” On his return to Spain
                    Florida Blanca presented him to a sinecure benefice in the diocese of Burgos;
                    and in 1790 his first play, <hi rend="italic">El Viejo</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    a highly finished but somewhat dreary verse comedy in three acts, written in
                    1786, but delayed by objections of the actors, was at length produced at the
                    Teatro del Principe. Its success was only moderate. <hi rend="italic">El</hi><hi

                    same theatre two years afterwards, at once became deservedly popular, and had
                    considerable influence in modifying the public taste. It is a short prose comedy
                    in two acts, avowedly intended to expose the follies and absurdities of the
                    contemporary dramatists—the school of Lope de Vega run to seed—who commanded the
                    support of the masses; and it is still read with pleasure for the simple
                    ingenuity of its plot, the liveliness of its dialogue, and the easy grace of its
                    style, while to the student of literature it throws much useful light on the
                    contemporary state of the Spanish drama, and on the reforming aims of the author
                    and his party. In the same year (1792) Florida Blanca was disgraced, but Moratin
                    at once found another patron in Godoy, who provided him with a pension and the
                    means for foreign travel; he accordingly passed through France into England,
                    where he began the free and somewhat incorrect translation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hamlet</hi> which was printed in 1798, but which has never been performed.
                    From England he passed to the Low Countries, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy,
                    and on his return to the Peninsula in 1796 he received a lucrative post at the
                    Foreign Office. His next appearance in the drama did not take place until 1803,
                    when <hi rend="italic">El Earon</hi> was first publicly exhibited in its present
                    form. It successfully weathered a determined attempt to damn it, and still keeps
                    the stage. It was followed in 1804 by <hi rend="italic">La Mogigata</hi> (The
                    Female Hypocrite), of which imperfect manuscript copies had begun to circulate
                    as early as 1791. It was favourably received, as on the whole it deserved to be,
                    by a public which was now at one with the author as to the canons of his art,
                    and an attempt to suppress it by means of the Inquisition on alleged religious
                    grounds <hi rend="italic">(La Mogigata</hi> being an imitation, a somewhat
                    feeble one, of Molière’s <hi rend="italic">Tartuffe')</hi> was successfully
                    frustrated. Moratin’s last and crowning triumph in the*department of original
                    comedy was achieved in 1806, when <hi rend="italic">El Si de las Ninas</hi> (A
                    Girl’s Yes) was performed night after night to crowded houses, ran through
                    several Spanish editions in a year, and was soon translated into several foreign
                    languages. In 1808, on the fall of the Prince of the Peace, Moratin found it
                    necessary to leave Spain, but shortly afterwards he returned and consented to
                    accept the office of royal librarian under Joseph Bonaparte—a false step, which,
                    as the event proved, permanently alienated from him the sympathies of his
                    country, and compelled him to spend almost all the rest of his life in exile. In

                    Moratin lived in France, principally at Paris, and devoted himself to the
                    preparation of a learned work on the history of the Spanish drama <hi
