                    the most westerly of the three peninsulas of the Peloponnesus. Its area is a
                    little over 1160 square miles. It is separated from Elis and Arcadia on the
                    north by the river Neda and the Nomian mountains, and from Laconia on the east
                    by the lofty range of Taygetus. The other sides are washed by the sea, which
                    indents its shores with four gulfs or bays,—Messenia, Phoenicus, Pylus, and
                    Cyparissus. On its south-west corner are the Oenussae Islands, and opposite the
                    bay of Pylus (Navarino) the famous Sphacteria. The interior is divided by
                    mountain chains into fertile plains, watered by rivers, the chief of which is
                    the Pamisus (with its tributaries Leucasia, Charadrus, Amphitus, and Aris),
                    falling into the Messenian Gulf. The great valley <pb break="no"

                    into two distinct parts, the plain or basin of Stenyclarus on the north, and the
                    plain of Macaria, so called from its extreme fertility, on the south. The
                    climate is delightful.</p>
                <p>The earliest inhabitants of Messenia were Leleges, whose capital was at Andania.
                    After these came Aetolians, whose chief centre was at Pylus. After the Dorian
                    conquest the country was divided by Cresphontes into five parts, whose chief
                    cities were respectively Stenyclarus, Pylus, Rhion, Hyamia, and Mesola. The
                    towns of Messenia were not numerous. Homer mentions Pylus (the seat of the
                    Thessalian Neleids), Amphigeneia (possibly the same as Ampheia), Dorion, Aepeia
                    (possibly Methone), Oechalia, Pharae, Antheia (probably the later Thuria),
                    Pedasus, and Ira (the later Abia). Other important towns were Asine, Corone,
                    Limnae, Carnasium, Cyparissia, and, finally, Messene.</p>
                <p>Of the history of Messenia before the Dorian invasion little is known except a
                    few fables related by Pausanias. Two generations after the Trojan war, the
                    country was invaded by the Dorians, who expelled the Neleids and conferred the
                    sovereignty upon Cresphontes, who seems to have been a popular king. Perhaps for
                    this reason he was put to death by the chiefs along with all his sons except
                    Aepytus. Aepytus was restored to the throne by the Arcadians, took vengeance for
                    his father’s death, and became very popular. His line lasted through several
                    generations. We know little of the subsequent history of Messenia until the date
                    of the Messenian wars, waged against Sparta. The ostensible and immediate causes
                    of these wars are variously assigned; but the true cause was the cupidity of
                    Sparta. Our chief trustworthy authority for the history of them is the old
                    elegiac poet Tyrtaeus; but so little is known about them that it is a matter of
                    doubt in which of them the great hero Aristomenes won his fame. The date of the
                    first was from 743 to 724, of the second from 685 to 668 or, according to
                    others, from 648 to 631 B.c. Ithome was the centre of action in the first, Eira
                    in the second. The result of these wars was the complete subjugation of Messenia
                    to Sparta. Its territory was parcelled out among Spartans, and its towns handed
                    over to rerioeci and Helots. Many of the inhabitants took refuge in Arcadia, but
                    still more in Italy and Sicily. A very large number settled in Rhegium, whose
                    chiefs for many generations were of Messenian stock. About 200,000 remained
                    behind in bondage. After the second war a large number of Messenians settled on
                    the Sicilian coast at Zancle, to which they subsequently gave the name Messana
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Messina).</hi> In 464 B.C. the Messenian Helots,
                    taking advantage of an earthquake at Sparta, revolted, and, though they were
                    finally compelled to surrender in 455, they did so only on condition of being
                    allowed to retire to Naupactus on the Corinthian Gulf. This city had been
                    offered them as a residence by the Athenians, ever glad to favour the foes of
                    Sparta. Here the Messenians remained for sixty years, until the loss of the
                    battle of Aegospotami deprived them of the protection of the Athenians. They
                    were then dπven out, and had to find homes in Cephallenia and Zacynthus, or
                    among their kinsmen in Rhegium and Messana. Some even went to Africa, and took
                    up their abode at Euesperidae or Hesneridae, afterwards called Berenice. Things
                    remained in this condition until 369 B.C., when Epaminondas, having broken the
                    power of Sparta, rent from her Messenia, and, collecting from all quarters the
                    descendants of the exiled inhabitants, helped them to found the city of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Messene</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> Sparta never
                    gave up her claim to Messenia, and made many attempts to reconquer it, but
                    without success. The Messenians maintained their independence until 146 B.C.,
                    when, with the Achaeans, they were reduced under the power of Rome. From that
                    time they fall into the background of history. In the Middle Ages the country,
                    like the rest of the Peloponnesus, was largely overrun by Slavic tribes, as is
                    shown by the numerous Slavic local names occurring in it. At the establishment
                    of Greece as a kingdom, Messenia was constituted into a province, with a
                    governor or nomarch residing at Kalamata (officially Kalamai), the ancient
                    Pharae. The country, though beautiful and fertile, is still in a deplorably
                    backward condition, and the population is sparse and semi-barbarous. Agriculture
                    langιιishes, and the roads and bridges are few and bad. More deeds of violence
                    occur in Messenia than in any other part of Greece. With the exception of
                    Kalamata, it contains no town of importance. Navarino, on the Gulf of Pylus, was
                    the scene of the destruction of the Turkish fleet in 1827.</p>
