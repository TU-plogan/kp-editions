                <p><label type="entry">METTERNICH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Clemens Wenzeslaus,
                    Prince</hi></label> (1773- 1859), first minister of Austria from 1809 to 1848,
                    was the son of a Rhenish nobleman employed in high office by the Austrian court.
                    He was born at Coblentz in 1773. At the age of fifteen he entered the university
                    of Strasburg. The French Revolution was then beginning. Everywhere the spirit of
                    hope gave to men’s language an exaltation and a confidence hardly known at any
                    other epoch. But the darker reality soon came into view. Metternich was a
                    witness of the riot in which the town-hall of Strasburg was pillaged by a
                    drunken mob; his tutor subsequently became a member of the revolutionary
                    tribunal in Alsace. If we are to trust to Metternich’s own account of the
                    formation of his opinions, the hatred of innovation, which was the ruling
                    principle of his later life, arose from his experience of the terrible results
                    which followed at this time from the victory of so-called liberal ideas. But in
                    reality Metternich was an aristocrat and a conservative by birth and nature. His
                    sentiment in things political was that of a member of a refined and exclusive
                    society which trusts to no intelligence but its own, and hardly sympathizes with
                    larger interests. The aggressions and violence of the Revolution from 1789 to
                    1799 gave Metternich an historical basis for his political theories, but the
                    instinctive preferences of his own mind were the same from first to last. He
                    began life as a young man of fashion and gallantry. His marriage in 1795 with
                    the Princess Kaunitz, a granddaughter of the famous minister, fixed him in the
                    highest circle of Austrian nobility. His first contact with the great political
                    world was at the congress of Rastadt in 1798, -where, under the auspices of the
                    victorious French republic, arrangements were made for compensating the German
                    princes and nobles whose possessions on the left bank of the Rhine had been
                    ceded to France by the peace of Campo Formio. Metternich was the accredited
                    agent of a group of Westphalian nobles; his private letters give a vivid picture
                    of the rough and uncourtly diplomatists who had succeeded to the polished
                    servants of the old French monarchy. In 1801 Metternich was appointed Austrian
                    ambassador at Dresden, and in 1803 he was promoted to Berlin; but he had hardly
                    become as yet a prominent man in Europe. His stay at Berlin was the
                    turning-point of his life. The war of the third coalition was impending. Austria
                    united with England and Russia against Napoleon, and the task of the youthful
                    ambassador was to win over the court of Berlin to the cause of the allies.
                    Metternich seems to have done all that it was possible for him to do; but
                    Prussia persisted in its neutrality. The earnestness with which Metternich had
                    worked against France did not prevent him from remaining on the friendliest
                    terms with Μ. Laforest, the French ambassador at Berlin; and so agreeable an
                    account of him was transmitted to Paris by his rival that, at the close of the
                    conflict, Napoleon himself requested that Metternich might henceforward
                    represent Austria at the Tuileries. Metternich was accordingly sent to Paris in
                    1806. This was the beginning of the period when Austria, humbled but not
                    exhausted by the blow of Austerlitz and by the losses accompanying the peace of
                    Pressburg, determined, under the leadership of Count Stadion, to prepare for
                    another war on a greater scale. But the sudden overthrow of Prussia, and the
                    alliance between France and Russia which was made at Tilsit in 1807, added
                    immeasurably to the difficulties of the court of Vienna. It became clear that
                    Napoleon was intending to dismember Turkey, and to gain for himself some part of
                    the spoils of the Ottoman empire. Metternich’s advice was that Austria should
                    endeavour to detach the czar from the French alliance, and by this means
                    frustrate the plan of partition; but, should Russia hold fast to Napoleon, that
                    Austria itself should unite with the two aggressors, and secure its share of
                    Turkey. Oriental affairs, however, fell into the background, and in the summer
                    of 1808 Metternich was convinced that Napoleon was intending to attack Austria,
                    though not immediately. He warmly supported Count Stadion’s policy in raising
                    the forces of Austria to the highest strength; and, although he did not share
                    the minister’s hopes in a <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n209/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0209-0200"/> general rising throughout Germany, he expressed
                    in his despatches no distrust of the power of Austria to cope with Napoleon.
                    This is the more singular because, after the disastrous issue of the campaign of
                    1809, Metternich seems to have taken credit for having opposed the policy of
                    war. Napoleon again captured Vienna; the battle of Wagram was lost; and after a
                    long negotiation Austria had to purchase peace by the cession of part of
                    Austrian Poland and of its Illyrian provinces. Metternich, who had virtually
                    taken Count Stadion’s place immediately after the battle of Wagram, was now
                    installed as minister of foreign affairs. The first striking event that took
                    place under his administration was the marriage of Marie Louise, daughter of the
                    emperor Francis, to his conqueror Napoleon. To do justice to Metternich’s policy
                    it must be remembered that the alliance of Tilsit between France and Russia was
                    still in existence, and that Austria was quite as much threatened by the czar’s
                    designs upon Turkey as by Napoleon’s own aggressions. Metternich himself seems,
                    in spite of his denials, to have been the real author of the family union
                    between the houses of Hapsburg and Bonaparte,—a most politic, if not a
                    high-spirited measure, which guaranteed Austria against danger from the east, at
                    the same time that it gave it at least some prospect of security from attack by
                    Napoleon, and enabled Metternich to mature his plans for the contingency of an
                    ultimate breach between France and Russia. In 1812 this event occurred.
                    Metternich, in nominal alliance with Napoleon, sent a small army into southern
                    Russia, allowing it to be understood by the czar that the attack was not
                    serious. Then followed the annihilation of the French invaders. While Prussia,
                    led by its patriots, declared war against Napoleon, Metternich, with rare and
                    provoking coolness, held his hand, merely stating that Austria would no longer
                    regard itself as a subordinate ally, but would act with all its force on one
                    side or the other. The result of this reserve was that Metternich could impose
                    what terms he pleased on Russia and Prussia as the price of his support. The
                    armies of these two powers, advancing into central Germany, proved no match for
                    the forces with which Napoleon took the field in the spring of 1813; and the
                    hard-fought battles of Lützen and Bautzen resulted in the retreat of the allies.
                    After the combatants had made an armistice, Metternich tendered Austria’s armed
                    mediation, requiring Prussia to content itself with the restoration of its
                    territory east of the Elbe, and leaving Napoleon’s ascendency in Germany almost
                    untouched. Napoleon, after a celebrated interview with Metternich, madly
                    rejected terms so favourable that every Prussian writer has denounced
                    Metternich’s proposal of them as an act of bitter enmity to Prussia. On the
                    night of the 10th of August the congress of Prague, at which Austria, as armed
                    mediator, laid down conditions of peace, was dissolved. Metternich himself gave
                    orders for the lighting of the watch-fires which signalled to the armies in
                    Silesia that Austria had declared war against Napoleon. The battle of Leipsic
                    and the campaign of 1814 in France followed, Metternich steadily pursuing the
                    policy of offering the most favourable terms possible to Napoleon, and retarding
                    the advance of the allied armies upon the French capital. Metternich had nothing
                    of that personal hatred towards the great conqueror which was dominant both in
                    Prussia and in England; on the contrary, though he saw with perfect clearness
                    that, until Napoleon’s resources were much diminished, no one could be safe in
                    Europe, he held it possible to keep him in check without destroying him, and
                    looked for the security of Austria in the establishment of a balance of power in
                    which neither Russia nor France should preponderate, while Prussia should be
                    strictly confined within its own limits in northern Germany. The assistance of
                    the Austrian army, which was no doubt necessary to the allies, had, so far as
                    related to Prussia, been dearly purchased. When, at the beginning of 1813,
                    Prussia struck for the freedom of Germany, its leading statesmen and patriots
                    had hoped that the result of the war of liberation would be the establishment of
                    German unity, and that the minor German princes, who had been Napoleon’s vassals
                    since 1806, would be forced to surrender part of their rights as sovereigns, and
                    submit to a central authority. This dream, however, vanished as soon as Austria
                    entered the field as an ally. It was no part of Metternich’s policy to allow
                    anything so revolutionary as German unity to be established, least of all under
                    the influence of Prussian innovators. He made treaties with the king of Bavaria
                    and Napoleon’s other German vassals, guaranteeing them, in return for their
                    support against France, separate independence and sovereignty when Germany
                    should be reconstructed. Accordingly, though the war resulted, through
                    Napoleon’s obstinate refusal of the terms successively offered to him, in the
                    limitation of France to its earlier boundaries and in a large extension of
                    Prussia’s territory, the settlement of Germany outside Prussia proceeded upon
                    the lines laid down by Metternich, and the hopes of unity raised in 1813 were
                    disappointed. A German confederation was formed, in which the minor sovereigns
                    retained supreme power within their own states, while the central authority, the
                    federal diet, represented, not the German nation, but the host of governments
                    under which the nation was divided. Metternich even advised the emperor Francis
                    of Austria to decline the old title of German emperor, disliking any open
                    embodiment of the idea of German unity, and preferring to maintain the
                    ascendency of Austria by a gentle pressure at the minor courts rather than by
                    the avowed exercise of imperial rights. In this unprogressive German policy
                    Metternich was completely successful. His great opponent, Stein, the champion of
                    German unity and of constitutional systems, abandoned his work in despair, and
                    refused the useless post of president of the diet, which Metternich, with a kind
                    of gentle irony, offered to him.</p>
                <p>The second branch of Metternich’s policy in 1813-14 was that which related to
                    Italy. Following the old maxims of Austrian statesmanship, Metternich aimed not
                    only at securing a large territory beyond the Alps but at making the influence
                    of Austria predominant throughout the Italian peninsula. The promises of
                    national independence which had been made to the Italians when they were called
                    upon to rise against Napoleon were disregarded. In the secret clauses of the
                    first treaty of Paris the annexation of both Lombardy and Venetia was guaranteed
                    to Austria, and the rest of Italy was divided into small states as of old.
                    Napoleon’s return from Elba led to the downfall of Murat, who had been allowed
                    to retain the kingdom of Naples, and to the reunion of this country with Sicily,
                    under the Bourbon Ferdinand. After the second overthrow of Napoleon, Metternich
                    endeavoured to make every Italian sovereign enter into a league under Austria’s
                    presidency. Ferdinand of Naples accepted the position of vassal, but the pope
                    and the king of Sardinia successfully maintained their independence. With the
                    construction of the German federation, and the partial construction of an
                    Italian federation, both under Austria’s guidance, the first part of
                    Metternich’s career closes. He had guarded Austria’s interests with great skill
                    during the crisis of 1813 and 1814. It was not his own fault, but the fault of
                    ages, that Austria’s interests were in antagonism to those of German and of
                    Italian nationality. He thought as an Austrian, and as nothing else; his task
                    was to serve the house of Hapsburg, and this he did with signal ability and
                    success. To denounce Metternich as a kind of criminal, according to the practice
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n210/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0210-0201"/> of Prussian writers, because he did not work for
                    German unity, is to ignore the existence of such a thing as statepolicy. Judged
                    by the ordinary standards of practical statesmanship, not by the philosophy of
                    history, Metternich’s action in 1813 and 1814 was that of a very superior man;
                    and the qualities of calmness and dexterity which he displayed would have given
                    an infinitely greater effectiveness to the life of his great rival Stein, who in
                    patriotic and moral enthusiasm was so far above him.</p>
                <p>The second part of Metternich’s career, which extends from 1815 to 1848, is that
                    of a leader of European conservatism. . It is difficult to describe his attitude
                    towards almost all the great questions which were now arising as any but one of
                    absolute blindness and infatuation. He acknowledged that exceptional
                    circumstances in the past had made it possible for England to exist under a
                    constitution; he knew that France would not surrendei’ the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Charta</hi> given to it by King Louis XVIII.; but in all other great states he
                    maintained that there were no alternatives but absolute monarchical government
                    and moral anarchy. His denunciations of liberals and reformers everywhere and at
                    all times are perfectly childish; and in many instances his hatred of change led
                    him into errors of judgment not surpassed in the annals of political folly. When
                    Napoleon fell, there was a prospect of the introduction of constitutional
                    government throughout a great part of Europe. King Frederick William,
                    stimulating the efforts of the Prussian people against F rance by the hopes of
                    liberty, had definitely promised them a constitution and a general assembly. The
                    czar had determined to introduce parliamentary life into the kingdom of Poland,
                    and even hoped to extend it, after some interval, to Russia. The Federal Act
                    drawn up for Germany at the congress of Vienna declared that in every state
                    within the German league a constitution should be established. Against this
                    liberal movement of the age Metternich resolutely set his face. Though wide
                    general causes were at work, the personal influence of the Austrian statesman
                    had no small share in prolonging the existence of autocratic government, and in
                    developing that antagonism between the peoples and their rulers which culminated
                    in the revolutions of 1848. The nature of the Austrian state, composed of so
                    many heterogeneous provinces and nationalities, no doubt made it natural for its
                    representative to defend and exalt the principle of personal sovereignty, on
                    which alone the unity of Austria was based; the relation of Austria to Italy
                    rendered the growth of the sentiment of nationality a real source of danger to
                    the house of Hapsburg; but Metternich’s abhorrence of constitutional and popular
                    ideas was more than the outcome of a calculating policy. He was not a man of
                    much faith, but one belief he held with all the force of religious
                    conviction,—namely, the belief that his own task and mission in the world was to
                    uphold established authority. All efforts to alter the form or to broaden the
                    basis of government he classed under the same head, as works of the spirit of
                    revolution; and in one of his most earnest writings he places side by side, as
                    instances of evil sought for its own sake, the action of the secret societies in
                    Germany, the Carbonaria of Italy, and the attempts of the English to carry the
                    Reform Bill. Working on principles like these, and without the shadow of a doubt
                    in his own wisdom, Metternich naturally proved a great power at a time when the
                    sovereigns who had inclined to constitutional ideas began to feel the
                    difficulties in the way of putting them into practice. Metternich’s advice,
                    tendered with every grace of manner and with the most winning and persuasive
                    art, was indeed not hard for rulers to accept, for he simply recommended them to
                    give up nothing that they had got. It was at the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle
                    (1818) that the retrograde tendency, which was now succeeding to the hopes of
                    1815, first gained expression. An agitation among the students at the German
                    universities had caused some scandal in the previous year, and secret societies
                    had just been discovered in Russia. Metternich plied the king of Prussia with
                    arguments for withholding the national representation which he had promised to
                    his people, and stimulated the misgivings which were arising in the mind of the
                    czar, hitherto the champion of European liberalism. A few months later the
                    murder of Alexander’s German agent, Kotzebue, by a fanatical student gave
                    Metternich an excellent pretext for organizing a crusade against German liberty.
                    A conference of ministers was held at Carlsbad. The king of Prussia allowed his
                    representative to follow Metternich’s lead. The resistance of the constitutional
                    minor states proved of no avail; and a series of resolutions was passed which
                    made an end of the freedom of the press throughout Germany, and subjected the
                    teaching and the discipline of the universities to officers of state. A
                    commission was established at Mainz to investigate the conspiracies which
                    Metternich alleged to have been formed for the overthrow of all existing
                    governments, and for the creation of a German republic, one and indivisible. In
                    the following year new articles were added by Metternich’s direction to the
                    original Federal Act, the most important being one that forbade the creation in
                    any German state of an assembly representing the community at large, and
                    enforced the system of representation by separate estates or orders, each
                    possessed of certain limited definite rights, and all alike subordinate to the
                    supremacy of the crown. Metternich would gladly have made an end of the
                    parliamentary constitutions which had already come into being in Bavaria and the
                    southern states; but he was unable to attack them openly, and had to confine
                    himself to the advocacy of strict monarchical principles through his
                    representatives at these courts. With regard to Prussia, however, he was
                    completely successful. The king of Prussia broke his promise of establishing a
                    national representation, and satisfied his conscience by creating certain
                    powerless provincial diets, exactly as Metternich had recommended him.
                    Throughout Germany at large a system of repression was carried out against the
                    advocates of constitutional right. The press was silenced; societies were
                    dissolved; prosecutions became more and more common. While Metternich imagined
                    himself to be stifling the spirit of discontent, he was in fact driving it into
                    more secret and more violent courses, and convincing eager men that the
                    regeneration of Germany must be sought not in the reform but in the overthrow of
                    governments.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile revolution broke out in Spain and Italy. Ferdinand of Spain, who had
                    restored despotism, was compelled, in March 1820, to accept the constitution of
                    1812 which he had subverted. The same constitution was accepted a few months
                    later by Ferdinand of Naples. Spain was outside Metternich’s range, but his hand
                    fell heavily upon Naples. A congress of the great powers was held at Troppau in
                    October 1820. Metternich, who was president, as he had been at Vienna, and
                    continued to be in later congresses, completely won over the czar to his own
                    views. Resolutions in favour of an intervention, if necessary by force of arms,
                    against the Neapolitan liberal Government were adopted by Austria, Russia, and
                    Prussia, though England and France held aloof. The congress was then adjourned
                    to Laibach in Carniola, whither Ferdinand of Naples was summoned, in order that
                    he might mediate between the powers and his people, and induce the latter to
                    give up a constitution which offended the three northern courts. Ferdinand’s
                    journey and mediation were an imposture as regarded the Neapolitans; he
                    pretended that he went to negotiate on behalf of his people, when in fact his
                    intention was exactly the same as Metternich’s, namely, to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0211-0202"/> have absolute monarchy restored. The proceedings
                    of the congress at Laibach were a farce. A letter was concocted by Metternich
                    for King Ferdinand to send to his subjects, informing them that the powers would
                    not permit the constitution to exist, and that, in default of their submission,
                    the allied courts would employ force. The British Government, while protesting
                    against the joint action of the three powers as an assumption of international
                    sovereignty, was perfectly willing that Austria, as a state endangered by the
                    Neapolitan revolution, should act on its own account. Metternich, however,
                    continued to treat the Neapolitan question as the affair of Europe, and
                    maintained his concert with Russia and Prussia. Early in 1821 an Austrian force,
                    acting in the name of the allies, entered central Italy. The armies opposed to
                    it collapsed, and the Austrians entered Naples on March 24. But in the meantime
                    a revolution broke out in Piedmont, which threatened to cut off the Austrians
                    from their supports, and to raise all Italy against them. For a moment the bold
                    action of Metternich seemed to have resulted in immense danger both to his own
                    conservative policy and to the peace of Europe <hi rend="italic">; for</hi> it
                    was believed that the Piedmontese revolution would be answered, not only by a
                    general Italian movement, but by a rising against the Bourbons in France. The
                    cloud, however, passed away. Order was quickly restored in Piedmont; Lombardy
                    was safely held by Austrian garrisons; and the conclusion of the Italian
                    difficulties, in which Metternich had played a very difficult part with great
                    resolution and dexterity, was his complete and brilliant personal triumph. No
                    statesman in Europe at this moment held a position that could compare with his
                    own.</p>
                <p>At the congress of Verona, held in 1822, the affairs of Spain were considered by
                    the powers. In the end, the Spanish constitution was overthrown by a French
                    invading army; but, though the arm employed was that of France, the principle of
                    absolutism which animated the crusade was that which Metternich had made his
                    own. A severe check, however, now met him in another quarter. Greece had risen
                    against Turkish rule in 1821. The movement was essentially a national and a
                    religious one, but Metternich treated it as a Jacobinical revolt against lawful
                    authority, —confusing, or affecting to confuse, the struggle for national
                    independence with the shallow and abortive efforts of political liberalism in
                    Italy and Spain. Metternich’s attitude towards the Greeks was for some time one
                    of unqualified hostility. If, under the pressure of the Tilsit alliance, he had
                    once been willing that Austria should join Russia in dismembering Turkey, he had
                    now reverted to the principle of maintaining Turkey at all costs against a
                    Russian advance southwards; and he attributed the Greek movement to the efforts
                    of Russian agitators unauthorized by the czar. His desire was that the sultan
                    should deprive Russia of all possible cause for complaint as regarded its own
                    separate interests, and so gain freedom to deal summarily with the Greeks.
                    Metternich’s hopes failed, partly through the obstinacy of the Turks, partly
                    through the wavering conduct of Alexander, and partly through the death of
                    Castlereagh and the accession of Canning to power. It was in great part owing to
                    Canning’s moral support that Greece ιdtimately became an independent state; and
                    the extraordinary violence of Metternich’s language whenever he mentions this
                    English statesman marks only too well the opposite character of his aims. No
                    politician has left a more damning record against himself than Metternich in his
                    bigoted abuse of Canning. The Greek question, however, was only the first on
                    which the judgment of events was now beginning to declare itself against
                    Metternich and all his principles. The French revolution of 1830 shattered the
                    moral fabric which he had so proudly inaugurated, and in great part himself
                    raised, in 1815. The accord that grew up between England and France now made any
                    revival of the kind of presidency that he had once held in Europe impossible. He
                    was indeed bold and rapid in throwing troops into the papal territory when
                    revolutionary movements broke out there in 1831 and 1832, though war with France
                    seemed likely to result from this step. He was as unsparing as he had been in
                    1819 in suppressing the agitation which after 1830 spread from France to
                    Germany; and the union of the three eastern courts was once more exhibited in
                    the meeting of the monarchs which took place at Münchengrätz in 1833, and in a
                    declaration delivered at Paris, insisting on their right of intervention against
                    revolution in other countries. It was, however, the new czar of Russia,
                    Nicholas, who was now the real head of European conservatism; and the stubborn
                    character, the narrow, unimaginative mind, of this prince made it impossible for
                    Metternich to shape his purposes by that delicate touch which had been so
                    effective with his predecessor. But in Austria itself Metternich continued
                    without a rival. In 1835 the emperor Francis, λvith whom he had worked for
                    nearly thirty years, died. Metternich, himself falling into the mental habits of
                    old age, remained at the head of the state till 1848. The revolution of that
                    year ended his political career. He resigned office with the dignity of
                    demeanour which had never failed him; his life was scarcely safe in Vienna, and
                    the old man came for a while to England, which he had not visited since 1794.
                    Living on till June 1859, he saw every great figure of his earlier life, and
                    many that had appeared on the horizon since his own prime, pass away; and a few
                    more months of life would have enabled him to see the end of that political
                    order which it had been his lifework to uphold; for the army of Napoleon III.
                    was crossing the Sardinian frontier at the moment when he died, and before a
                    second summer had gone Victor Emmanuel had been proclaimed king of Italy.</p>
                <p>Metternich was a diplomatist rather than a statesman. His influence was that of
                    an expert manager of individuals, not of a man of great ideas. All his greatest
                    work was done before fifty; and at an age when most statesmen are in the
                    maturity of their powers he had become tedious and pedantic. His private
                    character was very lovable. He was an affectionate if not a faithful husband, a
                    delightful friend, and a most tender father. The excessive egotism which runs
                    through his writings gives perhaps an impression of weakness which did not
                    really belong to his nature. Drawn by a firmer pen, the scene in which he
                    describes himself labouring in the German conferences of 1820, while his
                    favourite daughter was dying in an adjoining room, would have been one of the
                    most affecting things in political biography. The man who could so have worked
                    and felt together must have possessed no ordinary strength of character, no
                    common force of selfcontrol.</p>
                <p>The collection of Metternich’s writings published by his family under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">Denkwürdigkeiten,</hi> along with French and English
                    editions, contains letters and despatches of great value. The autobiography is
                    not always trustworthy, and must be read with caution. Gentz’s correspondence is
                    of first-rate importance for the years 1813-30. Original papers are also
                    contained in various German works upon particular events or movements, as in
                    Oncken for the negotiations of 1813; Weicker, Aegidi, Nauwerck for German
                    affairs in 1819 and following years; Prokesch von Osten for Eastern affairs. (C
