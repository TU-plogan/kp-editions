                <p><label type="entry">MOORE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label> (1779-1852),
                    born at Dublin on 28th May 1779, fairly shares with Lord Byron the honour of
                    being the most popular poet of his generation. Whatever may be thought now of
                    the intrinsic qualities of his verse, this much cannot be denied. The most
                    trustworthy of all measures of popularity is the price put upon a writer’s work
                    in the publishing market, and when Moore’s friend Perry, in negotiating the sale
                    of the unwritten <hi rend="italic">Lalla</hi><hi rend="italic">Rookh</hi><hi
                    rend="italic subscript"> t</hi> claimed for the poet the highest price that had
                    up to that time been paid for a poem the publisher at once assented. Moore was
                    then in the heyday of his reputation, but twenty years later publishers were
                    still willing to risk their thousands on his promise to produce. Much of Moore’s
                    success was due to his personal charm. This at least gave him the start on his
                    road to popularity. There is not a more extraordinary incident in the history of
                    our literature than the instantaneousness with which the son of a humble Dublin
                    grocer just out of his teens, on his first visit to London, captivated the
                    fashionable world and established himself in the course of a few months as one
                    of its prime favourites. The youth crossed St George’s Channel in 1799 to keep
                    terms at the Middle Temple, carrying with him a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes of Anacreon,</hi> which he wished to publish by subscription.
                    In a very short time he had enrolled half the fashionable world among his
                    subscribers, and had obtained the permission of the prince of Wales to dedicate
                    the work to him. The mere power of writing graceful and fluent amatory verses
                    would not alone have enabled the poet to work this miracle. Moore’s social gifts
                    were of the most engaging kind. He charmed all whom he met, and charmed them,
                    though he was not a trained musician, with nothing more than with his singing of
                    his own songs. The piano, and not the harp, was his instrument, but he came
                    nearer than anybody else in modern times to Bishop Percy’s romantic conception
                    of the minstrel. To find a parallel to him we must go back to the palmy days of
                    Provençal song, to such <hi rend="italic">troubadours</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >jongleurs</hi> as Arnaud Daniel and Perdigon, whose varied powers of
                    entertainment made them welcome guests wherever they went. It was not merely the
                    fashionable world that the young adventurer captivated; the landlady of his
                    lodgings in London, a countrywoman of his own, offered to place at his disposal
                    all the money of which she had the command.</p>
                <p>The fragment of autobiography in which Moore draws a softly-coloured picture of
                    his early life in Dublin lets us into the secret of the seeming miracle of his
                    social conquest. Externals apart, the spirit of his social surroundings in
                    Little Aungier Street had much in common with the society to which he was
                    introduced in London. He was born in the proscribed sect of Catholics, whose
                    exclusion from the society of the Castle produced a closer union among their
                    various ranks, and thus, from the first, Moore was no stranger to the more
                    refined gaieties of social intercourse. It was, upon the whole, a gay life in
                    Catholic society, though the conspiracy of the United Irishmen was being quietly
                    formed beneath the surface. Amateur theatricals was one of their favourite
                    diversions, and gifts of reciting and singing were not likely to die for want of
                    applause. Moore’s schoolmaster was a leader in these entertainments, a writer of
                    prologues and epilogues and incidental songs; and at a very early age Master
                    Thomas Moore was one of his show-boys, ardently encouraged in all his exercises
                    by a very affectionate mother at home. Before he left school he had acquired
                    fame in his own circle as a song-writer, and had published, in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthologia Hibernica,</hi> verses “to Zelia on her charging the
                    author with λvriting too much on love.” This was in 1793. In that year the
                    prohibition against Catholics entering Trinity College was removed, and next
                    year Moore took advantage of the new freedom. As one of the first Catholic
                    entrants, he had an exceptional stimulus to work, and there industriously
                    acquired that classical scholarship with which he won the hearts of such learned
                    Whigs as Lansdowne and Holland, while he charmed fashionable ladies with the
                    grace of his songs. Young Moore’s social atmosphere was, of course, strongly
                    charged with patriotism and hatred of the excesses of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n835/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0835-0806"/> English despotism. Some of his closest friends in
                    Trinity were deep in the conspiracy of 1798. But even for his patriotism—a
                    genuine passion which he never sought to disguise—Moore found plenty of sympathy
                    among the Whig political leaders, when he made their acquaintance in the first
                    years of the century.</p>
                <p>Moore was fairly established in London society in the first year of the century,
                    and from that time the hope of its applause was the ruling aspiration of his
                    life and its judgment the standard of his work. In his letters to his mother,
                    which are delightful prose lyrics and show the most charming side of Moore’s
                    character—he wrote to her constantly and with warm affection in his busiest
                    weeks— we find him, even in 1800, declaring himself surfeited with duchesses and
                    marchionesses, and professing his readiness at any moment to exchange all his
                    fineries for Irish stew and salt fish. But he never did make the exchange, even
                    for more potent attractions than the fare of his youth. He could not bear the
                    shortest banishment from fashionable drawing-rooms without uneasy longings. The
                    dignity and ease, the luxury, the gaiety, the brightness of fashionable life,
                    wholly satisfied his joyous and self-indulgent nature. When men of rank courted
                    his company, when princesses sang his songs and peeresses wept at them, Moore
                    was too frank to affect indifference; he was in the highest heaven of delight,
                    and went home to record the incident to his relatives or transmit it to
                    posterity in his diary. If prudence whispered that he was frittering away his
                    time and dissipating his energies, he persuaded himself that his conduct was
                    thoroughly worthy of a solid man of business: that to get a lucrative
                    appointment from his political friends he must keep himself in evidence, and
                    that to make his songs sell he must give them a start with his own voice. But
                    his mind was seemingly not much troubled either with sordid care or with sober
                    prudence; he lived in the happy present, and he liked fashionable company for
                    its own sake,—and no wonder, seeing how he was petted, caressed, and admired.
                    Swift’s saying that great men never reward in a more substantial way those whom
                    they make the companions of their pleasures was often in Moore’s mind. It was
                    verified to some extent in his own case. Through Lord Moira’s influence he was
                    appointed registrar of the admiralty court in Bermuda in 1803. He went there to
                    take possession, but four or five months of West India society, jingling
                    pianofortes, and dusky beauties bored him excessively, and he appointed a deputy
                    and returned to London, after little more than a year’s absence. The office
                    continued to bring him about £400 a year for fourteen or fifteen years, but at
                    the end of that time embezzlement by the deputy, for whom he was responsible,
                    involved him in serious embarrassment. This was all that Moore received from his
                    great political friends, —no great boon as things went in the days of patronage.
                    He had hopes from Lord Moira in the Grenville ministry in 1806,—hopes of an
                    Irish commissionership or something substantial, but the king’s obstinacy about
                    Catholic emancipation destroyed the ministry before anything worth having turned
                    up. The poet’s long-deferred hopes were finally extinguished in 1812, when Lord
                    Moira, under the Liverpool administration, went out as governor-general to India
                    without making any provision for him. From that time Moore set himself in
                    earnest to make a living by literature, his responsibilities being increased by
                    his marriage in 1811. From his boyhood to 1812 may be called the first period of
                    Moore’s poetical activity. He had formed the design of translating Anacreon
                    while still at college, and several of the pieces published in 1801 under the
                    <hi rend="italic">nom,</hi><hi rend="italic">de plume</hi> of “Thomas Little”
                    were written before he was eighteen. The somewhat ostentatious scholarship of
                    the notes to his <hi rend="italic">Anacreon,</hi> the parade of learned
                    authorities, he explained by his habit of omnivorous reading in Trinity College
                    library. Throughout his literary life he retained this habit of out-of-the-way
                    reading and clever display of it. Moore had really abundance of miscellaneous
                    scholarship as well as great quickness in the analogical application of his
                    knowledge; and, though he made sad havoc of quantities when he tried to write in
                    Greek, there was probably no scholar of his time who would have surpassed him in
                    the interpretation of a difficult passage. He seems to have spent a good deal of
                    time in the libraries of the great houses that he frequented; Moira, Lansdowne,
                    and Holland were all scholarly men and book-collectors. It might be asked,—What
                    had “passion’s warmest child,” whose “only books were women’s looks,” to do with
                    obscure mediaeval epigrammatists, theologians, and commentators? But it would
                    seem that Moore took the hints for many of his lyrics from books, and, knowing
                    the great wealth of fancy among mediaeval Latinists, turned often to them as
                    likely quarters in which to find some happy word-play or image that might serve
                    as a motive for his muse. The public, of course, were concerned with the product
                    and not with the process of manufacture, and “Little’s” songs at once became the
                    rage in every drawing-room. He found his songs in Virginia when he landed there
                    on his way to Bermuda. And not only were his songs sung but his poems were read,
                    passing rapidly through many editions. The bulk of them were simple fancies,
                    gracefully, fluently, and sometimes wittily expressed, the lyrist’s models being
                    the amatory poets of the 17 th century from Carew to Rochester. Carew is the
                    only eminent poet of that century with whom Moore will bear comparison. The
                    highest praise that can be given to his amatory lyrics is that he knew his
                    audience, wrote directly for them, and pleased them more than any of his
                    competitors. His publication of 1806 was savagely reviewed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi> by Jeffrey, who accused him of a deliberate design
                    to corrupt the minds of innocent maidens with his wanton fancies, and who had in
                    consequence to figure in a ludicrous attempt at a duel—ludicrous in its
                    circumstances, though Moore was ferociously in earnest. We may well acquit Moore
                    of the diabolic intention attributed to him, but Jeffrey’s criticism of his
                    poetry as poetry was just enough. The only parts of the volume that Jeffrey
                    praised were the satirical epistles. The vein essayed in these epistles Moore
                    pursued afterwards in his <hi rend="italic">Corruption, Intolerance</hi> (1808),
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Sceptic,</hi> a philosophical satire (1809); but as
                    long as he kept to the heroic couplet and the manner of Pope he could not give
                    full scope to his peculiar powers as a satirist. It may be remarked in passing
                    that the result of the hostile meeting with Jeffrey is a striking evidence of
                    the impressiveness of Moore’s personality; in the course of a few minutes’
                    conversation he changed a bitter critic into a lifelong friend. Of all the
                    poetical enterprises that Moore undertook, either at this period or later, none
                    was so exactly suited to his powers as the task proposed to him by the publisher
                    Power of supplying fit words to a collection of Irish melodies. The first number
                    appeared in 1807, and it was so successful that for twenty-seven years
                    afterwards writing words to music was one of Moore’s most regular occupations
                    and his steadiest source of income, Power paying him an annuity of £500. Six
                    numbers of Irish melodies were published before 1815; then they turned to sacred
                    songs and national airs, issuing also four more numbers of Irish melodies before
                    1834. Moore entered into this work with his best and most practised powers and
                    with all his heart. From his boyhood he had been in training for it. The most
                    characteristic moods of Irish feeling, grave and gay, plaintive and stirring,
                    were embodied in those airs, and their variety touched the whole range of
                    Moore’s sensitive spirit, carrying him far beyond the shallows of his <pb

                    not prurient; he wrote with full inspiration, unreserved sincerity, and
                    thoroughly roused faculty. Divorced from the music, many of them are insipid
                    enough, but they were never meant to be divorced from the music; the music was
                    meant, as Coleridge felt when he heard them sung by the poet himself, to twine
                    round them and overtop them like the honeysuckle. Moore accomplished this with
                    exquisite art. His most conspicuous failures may be traced to his habit of
                    taking as his starting-point not an emotional incident but some unmanageable
                    intellectual conceit. Hence arose intellectual discords, incongruous and
                    imperfectly harmonized fancies, which even the music can hardly gloss over.</p>
                <p>The regent’s desertion of the Whigs in 1812 cut them off from all hope of office
                    for many years to come, and Moore from his last hope of a snug sinecure, when
                    Lord Moira also was practically “oblivious” of him. There was at once a marked
                    increase in his literary fertility, and he broke ground in a new field, which he
                    cultivated with pre-eminent success—political squib-writing. Moore was incapable
                    of anything like rancour, but he felt the disappointment of his hopes enough to
                    quicken his fancy and sharpen the edge of his wit. The prince regent, his old
                    friend and patron, who was said to have begged all Lord Moira’s appointments for
                    personal favourites, was his first butt. The prince’s defects and foibles, his
                    fatness, his huge whiskers, his love for cutlets and curaçoa, for aged
                    mistresses and practical jokes, were ridiculed with the lightest of clever
                    hands. Moore opened fire in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Chronicle,</hi> and
                    crowned his success next year (1813) with a thin volume of “Intercepted
                    Letters,” <hi rend="italic">The Twopenny Post Bag.</hi> A very little knowledge
                    of the gossip of the time enables us to understand the delight with which
                    Moore’s sallies were received in the year which witnessed the imprisonment of
                    Leigh Hunt for more outspoken attacks on the regent. Moore received every
                    encouragement to work the new vein. He was at one time in receipt of a regular
                    salary from the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>; and his little volumes Of squibs
                    published at intervals,— <hi rend="italic">The Fudge Family in Paris,</hi> 1818
                    <hi rend="italic">; The Journal of a Member of the Pococurante Society,</hi>
                    1820; <hi rend="italic">Fables for the Holy Alliance,</hi> 1823; <hi
                    rend="italic">Odes on Cash, Corn, Catholics, and other Matters,</hi> 1828; <hi
                    rend="italic">The Fudges in England,</hi> 1835—went through many editions. The
                    prose <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Captain Rock</hi> (1824) may be added to the
                    list. Moore’s only failure was <hi rend="italic">Tom Cribb</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s Memorial to Congress</hi> (1819), for
                    which he had made an elaborate study of thieves’ slang. It was of course on the
                    side of the Whigs that Moore employed his pen, and his favourite topics were the
                    system of repression in Ireland and the disabilities of the Catholics. He made
                    rather too serious a claim for his pasquinades when he spoke of “laying the lash
                    on the back of the bigot and the oppressor.” It was not exactly a lash or a
                    scourge that he wielded. It was in happy, airily malicious ridicule of personal
                    foibles that his strength lay; he pricked and teased his victims with sharp and
                    tiny arrows. But, light as his hand was, he was fairly entitled to the
                    enthusiastic gratitude of his countrymen for his share in effecting Catholic
                    emancipation.</p>
                <p>The disappointment of 1812, which started Moore on his career as a squib-writer,
                    nerved him also to a more sustained effort in serious verse than he had before
                    attempted. <hi rend="italic">Lalla</hi><hi rend="italic">Rookh</hi> would never
                    have been written if the author’s necessities had not compelled him to work. To
                    keep himself at the oar, he contracted with the Longmans to supply a metrical
                    romance on an Eastern subject, which should contai» at least as many lines as
                    Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Rokeby,</hi> and for which the publishers bound
                    themselves to pay three thousand guineas on delivery. The poem was not published
                    till May 1817. Moore, as was his habit, made most laborious preparation, reading
                    himself slowly into familiarity with Eastern scenery and manners. He retired to
                    a cottage in Derbyshire, near Lord Moira’s library at Donington Park, that he
                    might work uninterruptedly, safe from the distractions of London society; and
                    there, “amid the snows of a Derbyshire winter” as he put it, he patiently
                    elaborated his voluptuous pictures of flower-scented valleys, gorgeous gardens,
                    tents, and palaces, and houris of ravishing beauty. The confidence of the
                    publishers was fully justified. Moore’s contemporaries were dazzled and
                    enchanted with <hi rend="italic">Lalla</hi><hi rend="italic">Rookh.</hi> It was
                    indeed a wonderful <hi rend="italic">tour de force.</hi> There was not a single
                    image or allusion in it that an ordinary Englishman could understand without a
                    foot-note. High testimonies were borne to the correctness of the local
                    colouring, and the usual stories were circulated of Oriental natives who would
                    not believe that Moore had never travelled in the East. Moore was less
                    successful in realizing Oriental character than he was in details of dress and
                    vegetation. His fire-worshipper is an Irish patriot betrayed by an informer, his
                    Zelica a piously nurtured Catholic maiden brooding over unpardoned sin, his
                    Mokanna a melodramatic stage monster,—though they are so thickly covered with
                    Oriental trappings that their identity is considerably disguised. Of the four
                    tales put into the mouth of Feramorz, the “Veiled Prophet” was the least suited
                    to Moore’s Turkey-carpet treatment. We can understand the enthusiasm with which
                    Moore’s Orientalism was received as “the best that we have had yet,” and we can
                    honour the honest labour with which he achieved this success; but such
                    artificial finery, as the poet himself had the sense to suspect, could have only
                    a temporary reputation. He deliberately sacrificed the higher qualities of
                    poetry for accuracy of costume and soft melody of rhyme and rhythm, and he had
                    his reward. His next Orientalism, the <hi rend="italic">Loves of the
                    Angels,</hi> published in 1822, was hardly less popular than <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lalla</hi><hi rend="italic">Rookh.</hi> The artificiality of the manufacture
                    was shown by the ease with which, after a few editions, he changed his angels
                    from Jews into Turks, to evade a charge of impiety which was supposed to impede
                    the sale of the work. Immediately after the completion of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lalla</hi><hi rend="italic">Rookh</hi> Moore changed his residence to Sloperton
                    Cottage in Wiltshire, to be near Lord Lansdowne and the library at Bowood, his
                    next literary project being a life of Sheridan. His plans were interrupted by
                    the consequences of the rascality of his deputy at Bermuda, which has been
                    already mentioned. To avoid arrest for the sum embezzled, Moore retired to the
                    Continent, and fixed his residence at Paris. He could not return till November
                    1822, when the affair was compromised. His friends lamented that the attractions
                    of Paris occupied so much of his time, but, though his diary contains almost
                    daily records of visits to operas, fêtes, and fashionable entertainments, it
                    shows also that he was busier than he seemed. He wrote a goodly number of squibs
                    during his exile, besides composing the <hi rend="italic">Loves of the
                    Angels</hi> and accumulating materials for his prose tale of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Epicurean—</hi> a fair amount of production considering his slow
                    and painstaking habits of composition. His alertness of mind, self-possession,
                    and steadiness of purpose enabled him to work as few men could in the midst of
                    diversions and distractions; and, although he himself took a brilliant part in
                    conversation, we can see, from a comparison of his diary with his published
                    writings, that he kept his ears open for facts and witticisms which he
                    afterwards made his own. The darling of the drawing-room was as much bee as
                    butterfly. On his return to England he resumed work steadily at his memoirs of
                    Sheridan, writing <hi rend="italic">Captain Rock</hi> as a <hi rend="italic">jeu
                    d'esprit</hi> by the way. The <hi rend="italic">Sheridan</hi> triumphantly
                    despatched in the autumn of 1825, Moore’s next important work was the <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Byron.</hi> The first <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n837/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0837-0808"/> volume of this was published early in 1830, and
                    the second was ready by the end of the same year. In 1831 he completed a memoir
                    of Lord Edward Fitzgerald, for which he had been collecting materials for some
                    time. Moore’s biographies call for no comment, except that they were faithful
                    and conscientious pieces of work. He spent much industry in the collection of
                    characteristic anecdotes, for which his position in society gave him exceptional
                    opportunity. His connexion with the burning of Byron’s autobiography is too
                    complicated a question to be discussed here. His own version of the
                    circumstances is given in his diary for May 1824.</p>
                <p>It was a misfortune for the comfort of the last twenty years of Moore’s life that
                    he allowed himself to be drawn into a project for writing the “History of
                    Ireland” in <hi rend="italic">Lardner's Cydopεedia.</hi> Scott and Mackintosh
                    scribbled off the companion volumes on Scotland and England with very little
                    trouble, but Moore had neither their historical training nor their despatch in
                    writing. Laborious conscientiousness and indecision are a fatal combination for
                    a man who undertakes a new kind of task late in life. The history sat like a
                    nightmare on Moore for fifteen years, and after all was left unfinished on the
                    melancholy collapse of his powers in 1845. From the time that he burdened
                    himself with it Moore did very little else, beyond a few occasional squibs and
                    songs, the last flashes of his genius, and the <hi rend="italic">Travels of an
                    Irish Gentleman in Search of a Religion,</hi> although he had tempting offers of
                    more lucrative and, it might have been thought, more congenial work. Moore’s
                    character had a deeper manliness and sincerity than he often gets credit for;
                    and his tenacious persistence in this his last task was probably due to an
                    honourable ambition to connect himself as a benefactor with the history of his
                    country, by opening the eyes of the English people to the misgovernment of
                    Ireland. It was a misjudgment altogether; the light irony of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Captain Rock</hi> was much more effective than the minute carefully-weighed
                    details of the history. Moore’s last years were harassed by the weakness and
                    misconduct of his sons, and by pecuniary embarrassments. An annual pension of
                    £300 was conferred upon him in 1833, and he had always received large sums for
                    his work; but, while waiting for the sinecure which never came, he had
                    contracted an unfortunate habit of drawing upon his publishers in advance. After
                    the death of his last child in 1845, Moore became a total wreck, but he lingered
                    on till 26th February 1852. The diary, which he seems to have kept chiefly that
                    it might be the means of making some provision for his wife, and which contains
                    so many touching expressions of his affection for her, was edited by Lord John
                    Russell with his letters and a fragment of autobiography in 1853- 56. The charge
                    of vanity has often been brought against this diary from the writer’s industry
                    in recording many of the compliments paid him by distinguished personages and
                    public assemblies. It is only vanity that is annoyed by the display of vanity in
                    others. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">μ.)</hi></p>
