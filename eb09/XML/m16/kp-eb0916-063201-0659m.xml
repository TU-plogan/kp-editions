                <p>THE Mollusca form one of the great “phyla,” or subkingdoms of the Animal Pedigree
                    or Kingdom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Literary History of the Group.—</hi> The shell-bearing forms
                    belonging to this group which were known to Linnaeus were placed by him (in
                    1748) in the third order of his class Vermes under the name “Testacea,” whilst
                    the Echinoderms, Hydroids, and Annelids, with the naked Molluscs, formed his
                    second order, termed “Zoophyta.” Ten years later he replaced the name “Zoophyta”
                    by “Mollusca,” which was thus in the first instance applied, not to the Mollusca
                    at present so termed, but to a group consisting chiefly of other organisms.
                    Gradually, however, the term Mollusca became used to include those Mollusca
                    formerly placed among the “Testacea,” as well as the naked Mollusca.</p>
                <p>It is important to observe that the term /χαλάκια, of which Mollusca is merely a
                    Latinized form, was used by Aristotle to indicate a group consisting of the
                    Cuttle-fishes only.</p>
                <p>The definite erection of the Mollusca into the position of one of the great
                    primary groups of the animal kingdom is due to George Cuvier (1788-1800), who
                    largely occupied himself with the dissection of representatives of this type
                    (1).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These figures refer
                    to the bibliography at the end of the article, p. 695.</p></note> An independent
                    anatomical investigation of the Mollusca had been carried on by the remarkable
                    Neapolitan naturalist Poli (1791), whose researches (2) were not published until
                    after his death (1817), and were followed by the beautiful works of another
                    Neapolitan zoologist, the illustrious Delle Chiaje (3).</p>
                <p>The “embranchement” or sub-kingdom Mollusca, as defined by Cuvier, included the
                    following classes of shell-fish :— 1, the cutties or poulps, under the name <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cephalopoda;</hi> 2, the snails, whelks, and slugs, both
                    terrestrial and marine, under the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Gastropoda</hi>; 3,
                    the sea-butterflies or winged-snails, under the name <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pteropoda</hi>; 4, the clams, mussels, and oysters, under the name <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Acephala</hi>; 5, the lamp-shells, under the name <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Brachiopoda;</hi> 6, the seasquirts or ascidians, under the
                    name <hi rend="smallcaps">Nuda</hi>; and 7, the barnacles and sea-acorns, under
                    the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Cirrhopoda.</hi></p>
                <p>The main limitations of the sub-kingdom or phylum Mollusca, as laid down by
                    Cuvier, and the chief divisions thus recognized within its limits by him, hold
                    good to the present day. At the same time, three of the classes considered by
                    him as Mollusca have been one by one removed from that association in
                    consequence of improved knowledge, and one additional class, incorporated since
                    his day with the Mollusca with general approval, has, after more than forty
                    years, been again detached and assigned an independent position owing to
                    newly-acquired knowledge.</p>
                <p>The first of Cuvier’s classes to be removed from the Mollusca was that of the
                    Cirrhopoda. Their affinities with the lower Crustacea were recognized by Cuvier
                    and his contemporaries, but it was one of the brilliant discoveries of that
                    remarkable and too-little-honoured naturalist, J. Vaughan Thompson of Cork,
                    which decided their position as Crustacea. The metamorphoses of the Cirrhopoda
                    were described and figured by him in 1830 in a very complete manner, and the
                    legitimate conclusion as to their affinities was formulated by him (4). Thus it
                    is to Thompson (1830), and not to Burmeister (1834), as erroneously stated by
                    Kef erstem, that the merit of this discovery belongs. The next class to be
                    removed from Cuvier’s Mollusca was that of the Nuda, better known as Tunicata.
                    In 1866 the Russian embryologist Kowalewsky startled the zoological world with a
                    minute account of the developmental changes of Ascidia, one of the Tunicata (5),
                    and it became evident that the affinities of that class were with the
                    Vertebrata, whilst their structural agreements with Mollusca were only
                    superficial. The last class which has been removed from the Cuvierian Mollusca
                    is that of the Lamp-shells or Brachiopoda. The history of its dissociation is
                    connected with that of the class, viz., the Polyzoa or Bryozoa, which has been
                    both added to and again removed from the Mollusca between Cuvier’s date and the
                    present day. The name of J. Vaughan Thompson is again that which is primarily
                    connected with the history of a Molluscan class. In 1830 he pointed out that
                    among the numerous kinds of “polyps” at that time associated by naturalists with
                    the Hydroids, there were many which had a peculiar and more elaborate type of
                    organization, and for these he proposed the name Polyzoa (6). Subsequently (7)
                    they were termed Bryozoa by Ehrenberg (1831).</p>
                <p>Henri Milne-Edwards in 1844 demonstrated (8) the affinities of the Polyzoa with
                    the Molluscan class Brachiopoda, and proposed to associate the three classes
                    Brachiopoda, Polyzoa, and Tunicata in a large group “Molluscoidea,” coordinate
                    with the remaining classes of Cuvier’s Mollusca, which formed a group retaining
                    the name Mollusca. By subsequent writers the Polyzoa have in some cases been
                    kept apart from the Mollusca and classed with the “Vermes;” whilst by others
                    (including the present writer) they have, together with the Brachiopoda, been
                    regarded as true Mollusca. The recent investigation by Mr. Caldwell (1882) of
                    the developmental history of Phoronis (9), together with other increase of
                    knowledge, has now, however, established the conclusion that the agreement of
                    structure supposed to obtain between Polyzoa and true Mollusca is delusive; and
                    accordingly they, together with the Brachiopoda, have to be removed from the
                    Molluscan phylum. Further details in regard to this, the last revolution in
                    Molluscan classification, will be found in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Polyzoa.</hi></p>
                <p>As thus finally purified by successive advances of embryological research, the
                    Mollusca are reduced to the Cuvierian classes of Cephalopoda, Pteropoda,
                    Gastropoda, and Acephala. Certain modifications in the disposition of these
                    classes are naturally enough rendered necessary by the vast accumulation of
                    knowledge as to the anatomy and embryology of the forms comprised in them during
                    fifty years. Foremost amongst those who have within that period laboured in this
                    group are the French zoologists Henri Milne-Edwards (20) and Lacaze Duthiers
                    (21), to the latter of whom we owe the most accurate dissections and beautiful
                    illustrations of a number of different types. To Kölliker (22), Gegenbaur (23),
                    and more recently Spengel (24), amongst German anatomists, we are indebted for
                    epoch-making researches of the same kind. In England, Owen’s anatomy of the
                    Pearly Nautilus (10), Huxley’s discussion of the general morphology of the
                    Mollusca (11), and Lankester’s embryological investigations (12), have aided in
                    advancing our knowledge of the group. Two remarkable works of a systematic
                    character dealing with the Mollusca deserve mention here—the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Manual of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Mollusca</hi> by the late Dr. S. P.
                    Woodward, a model of clear systematic exposition, and the exhaustive treatise on
                    the Malacozoa or Weichthiere by the late Professor Keferstein of Göttingen,
                    published as part of Bronn’s <hi rend="italic">Classen</hi><hi rend="italic">und
                    Ordnungen des Thier-Reichs.</hi> The latter work is the most completely
                    illustrated and most exhaustive survey of existing knowledge of a large division
                    of the animal kingdom which has ever been produced, and, whilst forming a
                    monument to its lamented author, places the student of Molluscan morphology in a
                    peculiarly favourable position.</p>

                    whilst exhibiting an extreme range of variety in shape, as may be seen on
                    comparing an Oyster, a Cuttle-fish, and a Sea-slug such as Doris; whilst
                    adapted, some to life on dry land, others to the depths of the sea, others to
                    rushing streams; whilst capable, some of swimming, others of burrowing,
                    crawling, or jumping, some, on the other hand, fixed and immobile; some amongst
                    the most formidable of carnivores, others feeding on vegetable mud, or on the
                    minutest of microscopic organisms—yet all agree in possessing in common a very
                    considerable number of structural details which are not possessed in common by
                    any other animals.</p>
                <p>The structural features which the Mollusca do possess in common with other
                    animals belonging to other great phyla of the animal kingdom are those
                    characteristic of the Coelomata, one of the two great grades (the other and
                    lower being that of the Ccelentera) into which the higher animals, or Enterozoa
                    as distinguished from the Protozoa, are divided (13). The Enterozoa all commence
                    their individual existence as a single cell or plastid, which multiplies itself
                    by transverse division. Unlike the cells of the Protozoa, these embryonic cells
                    of the Enterozoa do not remain each like its neighbour and capable of
                    independent life, but proceed to arrange themselves in two layers, taking the
                    form of a sac. The cavity of the two-cell-layered sac or Diblastula thus formed
                    is the primitive gut or <hi rend="smallcaps">arch-enteron.</hi> In the
                    Coelentera, whatever subsequent changes of shape the little sac may undergo as
                    it grows up to be Polyp or Jelly-fish, the original arch-enteron remains as the
                    one cavity pervading all regions of the body. In the Coelomata the arch-enteron
                    becomes in the course of development divided into two totally distinct cavities
                    shut off from one another—an axial cavity, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >met-enteron,</hi> which retains the function of a digestive gut; and a
                    peri-axial cavity, the <hi rend="smallcaps">coelom</hi> or body-cavity, which is
                    essentially the bloodspace, and receives the nutritive products of digestion and
                    the waste products of tissue-change by osmosis. The Mollusca agree in being
                    Coelomate with the phyla Vertebrata, Platyhelmia (Flat-worms), Echinoderma,
                    Appendiculata (Insects, Ringed-worms, &lt;fcc.), and others,—in fact, with all
                    the Enterozoa except the Sponges, Corals, Polyps, and Medusae.</p>
                <p>In common with all other Coelomata, the Mollusca are at one period of life
                    possessed of a <hi rend="smallcaps">prostomium</hi> or region in front of the
                    mouth, which is the essential portion of the “head,” and is connected with the
                    property of forward locomotion in a definite direction and the steady carriage
                    of the body (as opposed to rotation of the body on its long axis). As a result,
                    the Coelomata, and with them the Mollusca, present (in the first instance) the
                    general condition of body known as <hi rend="smallcaps">bilateral symmetry;</hi>
                    the dorsal is differentiated from the ventral surface, whilst a right and a left
                    side similar to, or rather the complements of, one another are permanently
                    established. In common with all other Coelomata, the Mollusca have the mouth and
                    first part of the alimentary canal which leads into the met-enteron formed by a
                    special invagination of the outer layer of the primitive body-wall, not to be
                    confounded with that which often, but not always, accompanies the antecedent
                    formation of the arch-enteron; this invagination is termed the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">stomodaeum.</hi> Similarly, an anal aperture is formed in
                    connexion with a special invagination which meets the hinder part of the
                    met-enteron, and is termed the PROCTODAeUM.</p>
                <p>In common with many (if not all) Coelomata, the Mollusca are provided with at
                    least one pair of tube-like organs, which open each by one end into the coelom
                    or body cavity, and by the other end to the exterior, usually in the
                    neighbourhood of the anus. These are the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nephridia.</hi></p>
                <p>Like all other Coelomata, the Mollusca are also provided with special groups of
                    cells forming usually paired or median growths upon the walls of the coelomic
                    cavity, the cells being specially possessed of reproductive power, and
                    differentiated as egg-cells and sperm-cells. These are the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >gonads.</hi> As in other Coelomata, the cells of the gonads may escape to the
                    exterior in one of two ways—either through the nephridia, or, on the other hand,
                    by special apertures.</p>
                <p>As in all other Coelomata, the cells, which build up respectively the primary
                    outer layer of the body, the lining layer of the met-enteron, and the lining
                    layer of the coelom, are multiplied and differentiated in a variety of ways in
                    the course of growth from the early embryonic condition. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tissues</hi> are formed by the adhesion of a number of similarly modified cells
                    in definite tracts. As in all Coelomata, there is a considerable variety of
                    tissues characterized by, and differentiated in relation to, particular
                    physiological activities of the organism. Not only the Coelomata but also many
                    Ccelentera show, in addition to the EPITHELIA (the name given to tissue which
                    bounds a free surface, whether it be that of the outer body-wall, of the gut, or
                    of a blood-space), also deeper lying tissues, of -which the first to appear is
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">muscular</hi> tissue, and the second <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nervous</hi> tissue.</p>
                <p>The epithelia are active in throwing off their constituent cells
                    (blood-corpuscles from the wall of the coelom), or in producing secretions
                    (glands of body-wall and of gut), or in forming horny or calcareous plates,
                    spines, and processes, known as <hi rend="smallcaps">cuticular products</hi>
                    (shells and bristles of the body-wall, teeth of the tongue, gizzard,
                    &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>In the Mollusca, as in all other Coelomata, in correspondence with the primary
                    bilateral symmetry and in relation to the special mechanical conditions of the
                    prostomium, the nervous tissue which is in Ccelentera, and even in Flatworms,
                    diffused over the whole body in networks, tends to concentrate in paired lateral
                    tracts, having a special enlargement in the prostomium. The earlier plexiform
                    arrangement is retained in the nervous tissue of the walls of the alimentary
                    canal of many Coelomata, whilst a concentration to form large nerve-masses <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(ganglia),</hi> to which numerous afferent and efferent fibres
                    are attached, affects the nervous tissue of the body-wall.</p>
                <p>In all Coelomata, including Mollusca, muscular tissue is developed in two chief
                    layers, one subjacent to the deric or outer epithelium <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(somatic musculature),</hi> and a second surrounding the alimentary canal <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(splanchnic musculature).</hi> Thus, primarily, in Coelomata
                    the body has the character of two muscular sacs or tubes, placed one within the
                    other and separated from one another by the coelomic space. The somatic
                    musculature is the more copious and develops <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n661/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0661-0634"/> very generally an outer circular layer (t.e., a
                    layer in which the muscular fibres run in a direction transverse to the long
                    axis of the body) and a deeper longitudinal layer; to these oblique and
                    radiating fibres may be added. The splanchnic musculature, though more delicate,
                    exhibits a circular layer nearer the enteric epithelium, and a longitudinal
                    layer nearer the coelomic surface.</p>
                <p>In Coelomata and in many Coelentera there are found distributed between the
                    tracts of muscular tissue, bounding them and giving strength and consistency
                    also to the walls of the body, of the alimentary canal, of the coelom, and of
                    the various organs and tissue-masses (such as nerve-centres, gonads, &amp;c.)
                    connected with these, tracts of tissue the function of which is skeletal. The
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">skeletal tissue</hi> of Mollusca, in common with that of
                    other Coelomata, exhibits a wide range of minute structure, and is of differing
                    density in various parts; it may be fibrous, membranous, or cartilaginous. The
                    Mollusca, in common with the other Coelomata, exhibit a remarkable kind of
                    association between the various forms of skeletal tissue and the epithelium
                    which lines the coelomic cavity. The coelomic cavity contains a liquid which is
                    albuminous in chemical composition <hi rend="smallcaps">(bloodlymph</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">haemolymph),</hi> and into this liquid cells are shed from the
                    coelomic epithelium. They float therein and are known as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >blood corpuscles</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">lymph corpuscles.</hi> The
                    coelomic space with its contained haemolymph is not usually in Coelomata, and is
                    not in Mollusca, a simple even-walled cavity, but is broken up into numerous
                    passages and recesses by the outgrowths, both of the alimentary canal and of its
                    own walls. By the adhesion of its opposite walls, and by an irregularity in the
                    process of increase of its area during growth, the coelom becomes to a very
                    large extent a spongy system of intercommunicating <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >lacunae</hi> or irregular spaces, filled with the coelomic fluid. At the same
                    time, the coelomic space has a tendency to push its way in the form of narrow
                    canals and sinuses between the layers of skeletal tissue, and thus to permeate
                    together with the skeletal tissue in the form of a spongy, or it may be a
                    tubular, network all the apparently solid portions of the animal body. This
                    association of the nutritive and skeletal functions is accompanied by a complete
                    identity of the tissues concerned in these functions. Not only is there complete
                    gradation from one variety of skeletal tissue to another (e.&lt;∕., from
                    membranous to fibrous, and from fibrous to cartilaginous) even in respect of the
                    form of the cells and their intercellular substance, but the coelomic
                    epithelium, and consequently the haemolymph with its floating corpuscles derived
                    from that epithelium, is brought into the same continuity. The skeletal and
                    blood-containing and -producing tissues in fact form one widely-varying but
                    continuous whole, which may be called the <hi rend="smallcaps">skeleto-trophic
                    system of tissues.</hi></p>
                <p>In many Coelomata not only do the skeletal tissues allow the coelomic space with
                    its fluid and corpuscles to penetrate between their layers, but a special mode
                    of extension of that space is found, which consists in the hollowing out of the
                    solid substance of elongated cells having the form of fibres, which thus become
                    tubular, and, admitting the nutritive fluid, serve as channels for its
                    distribution. These are “capillary vessels,” and it has yet to be shown that
                    such are formed in the Mollusca. Larger vessels, however, concerned in guiding
                    the movement of the coelomic fluid in special directions are very usually
                    developed in the Mollusca, as in other Coelomata, by the growth of skeletal
                    tissue around what are at first ill-defined extensions of the coelomic space. In
                    this way a portion of the coelomic space becomes converted into vessels, whilst
                    a large part remains with irregular walls extending in every direction between
                    the skeletal tissues and freely communicating with the system of vessels. As in
                    many other Coelomata, muscular tissue grows around the largest vessel formed
                    from the primitive coelom, which thus becomes a contractile organ for propelling
                    the bloodlymph fluid. This “<hi rend="smallcaps">heart</hi>” has in Mollusca, as
                    in most other Coelomata in which it is developed, a dorsal position. A
                    communication of the blood-lymph space with the exterior by means of a pore
                    situated in the foot or elsewhere has been very generally asserted to be
                    characteristic of Mollusca. It has been maintained that water is introduced by
                    such a pore into the blood, or admitted into a special series of water-vessels.
                    It has also been asserted that the blood-fluid is expelled by the Mollusca from
                    these same pores. Recent investigation (14) has, however, made it probable that
                    the pores are the pores of secreting glands, and do not lead into the vascular
                    system. There is, it therefore appears, no admission or expulsion of water
                    through such pores in connexion with the blood, although in some other Coelomata
                    it is established that water is taken into the coelomic space through a pore
                    (Echinoderms), whilst in some others there is no doubt that the coelomic
                    haemolymph is occasionally discharged in quantity through pores of definite size
                    and character (Earthworm, &amp;c.).</p>
                <p>We have thus seen that the Mollusca possess, in common with the other

                    features common to them and the rest of the Coelomata, we may now point out what
                    are the peculiar developments of structure which characterize the Mollusca and
                    lead to the inference that they are members of one peculiar branch or phylum of
                    the animal pedigree. In attempting thus to set forth the dominating structural
                    attributes of a great group of organisms it is not possible to make use of
                    arbitrary definitions. Of Mollusca, as of other great phyla, it is not possible
                    categorically to enunciate a series of structural peculiarities which will be
                    found to be true in reference to every member of the group. We have to remember
                    that the process of adaptation in the course of long ages of development has
                    removed in some cases one, in other cases another, of the original features
                    characteristic of the ancestors from which the whole group may be supposed to
                    have taken origin, and that it is possible (and actually is realized in fact)
                    that some organisms may have lost all the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi>
                    characteristics of Molluscan organization, and yet be beyond all doubt
                    definitely stamped as Mollusca by the retention of some <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondary</hi> characteristic which is so peculiar as to prove their
                    relationship with other Mollusca. An example in point is found in the curious
                    fish-like form Phyllirhoë (fig. 58), which has none of the primary
                    characteristics of a Mollusc, and yet is indisputably proved to belong to the
                    Molluscan phylum by possessing the peculiar and elaborate lingual apparatus
                    present in one branch of the phylum, the Glossophora.</p>

                    which shall possess in an unexaggerated form the various structural arrangements
                    which are more or less specialized, exaggerated, or even suppressed in
                    particular members of the group. Such a schematic Mollusc is not to be regarded
                    as an arche type, in the sense which has been attributed to that word, nor as
                    the embodiment of an idea present to a creating mind, nor even as an epitome of
                    developmental laws. Were knowledge sufficient, we should wish to make this
                    schematic</p>
                <p>Mollusc the representation of the actual Molluscan ancestor from which the
                    various living forms have sprung. To definitely claim for our schematic form any
                    such significance in the present state of knowledge would be premature, but it
                    may be taken as more or less coinciding with what we are justified, under
                    present conditions, in picturing to ourselves as the original Mollusc or
                    archi-Mollusc (more correctly Archimalakion). After describing this schematic
                    form, we shall proceed to show how far it is realized or justified in each class
                    and order of Mollusca successively.</p>
                <p>The schematic Mollusc (fig. 1, A to E) is oblong in shape, bilaterally
                    symmetrical, with strongly differentiated dorsal and ventral surface, and has a
                    well-marked <hi rend="smallcaps">head,</hi> consisting of the prostomium (ό) and
                    the region immediately behind the mouth. Upon the head we place a pair of short
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">cephalic tentacles</hi> (a). The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mouth</hi> is placed in the median line anteriorly, and is overhung by the
                    prostomium (B, o); the <hi rend="italic">anus</hi> is placed in the median line
                    posteriorly, well raised on the dorsal surface (A, <hi rend="italic">m).</hi>
                    The apertures of a pair of <hi rend="smallcaps">nephridia</hi> are seen in the
                    neighbourhood of the anus right and left (A, Z). Near the nephridial apertures,
                    and in front of them, right and left, are the pair of apertures (⅛) appropriate
                    to the ducts of the <hi rend="smallcaps">gonads</hi> (generative pores).</p>
                <p>The most permanent and distinctive Molluscan organ is the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >foot</hi> (Podium). This is formed by an excessive development of the somatic
                    musculature along the ventral surface, distinctly ceasing at the region of the
                    head, below which it suddenly projects as a powerful muscular mass (B, <hi
                    rend="italic">p;</hi> E, <hi rend="italic">p).</hi> It may be compared, and is
                    probably genetically identical, with the muscular ventral surface of the
                    Planarians and with the suckers of Trematoda, but is more extensively developed
                    than are those corresponding structures. The muscular tissue of the foot, and of
                    all other parts of the body of all Mollusca, is cellular and unstriated, as
                    distinguished from the composite muscular fibre (consisting of cell-fusions
                    instead of separable cells) which occurs in Arthropoda and in Vertebrata, and
                    which has the further distinction of being composed of alternating bands of
                    substance of differing refractive power (hence “striated ”). The appearance of
                    cross striation seen in the muscular cells of some Molluscs (odontophore of
                    Haliotis, Patella, &lt;fcc.) requires further investigation. It is by no means
                    altogether the same thing as the marking characteristic of striated muscular
                    fibre.</p>
                <p>Contrasting with the ventral foot is the thin-walled dorsal region of the body,
                    which may be termed the anti-podial region. This thin-walled region is formed by
                    soft viscera covered in by the comparatively delicate and non-muscular body-wall
                    (fig. 1, E). As the ventral foot is clearly separate from the projecting head,
                    so is this dorsal region, and it is conveniently spoken of as the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">visceral hump</hi> or “dome” (cupola). Protecting the visceral
                    dome is a <hi rend="smallcaps">shell</hi> (conchylium) consisting of a horny

                    Mollusc is single, cap-shaped, and symmetrical. It does not lie entirely naked
                    upon the surface of the visceral dome, but is embedded all round its margin, to
                    a large extent in the body-wall. In fact, the integument of the visceral dome
                    forms an open flattened sac in which the shell lies. This is the <hi

                    (A and E, ∕). The wall of the body projects all round the visceral dome in the
                    form of a flap or skirt, so as to overhang and conceal to some extent the head
                    and the sides of the foot. This skirt, really an outgrowth<pb break="no"

                    rend="smallcaps">mantle-flap</hi> (limbus pallialis), or more shortly the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">mantle</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">pallium</hi> (c). The space
                    between the overhanging mantle-flap and the sides and neck of the animal which
                    it overhangs is called the SUB-PALLIAL <hi rend="smallcaps">space</hi> or <hi

                    the pair of nephridial apertures (see fig. 1, E).</p>
                <p>The development of the mantle-skirt and its sub-pallial space appears to have a
                    causal relation, in the way of protection, to a pair of processes of the
                    body-wall which spring, one on the right and one on the left, from the sides of
                    the body, nearer the anus than the mouth, and are concealed by the mantle-flap
                    to some extent (A, B, i). These processes have an axis in which are two
                    blood-vessels, and are beset with two rows of flattened filaments, like the
                    teeth of a comb in double series. These are the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ctenidia</hi> or gill-combs. Usually, as will be seen in the sequel, they play
                    the part of gills, but since in many Molluscs (Lamellibranchs) their function is
                    not mainly respiratory, and since also other completely-formed gills are
                    developed as special organs in some Molluscs to the exclusion of these
                    processes, it is well not to speak of them simply as “gills” or “branchiae,” but
                    to give them a non-physiological name such as that here proposed. Near the base
                    of the stem of each ctenidium is a patch of the epithelium of the bodywall,
                    peculiarly modified and supplied with a special nerve and ganglion. This is
                    Spengel’s olfactory organ, which tests the respiratory fluid, and is persistent
                    in its position and nerve-supply throughout the group Mollusca. We propose to
                    call it the <hi rend="smallcaps">osphradium.</hi></p>
                <p>Passing now to the internal organs, our schematic Mollusc is found to possess an
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">alimentary canal,</hi> which passes from mouth to anus in
                    the middle line, leaving between it and the muscular body-wall a more or less
                    spongy, in parts a spacious, <hi rend="smallcaps">c&lt;elom.</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">stomodaeum</hi> is large and muscular, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >proctodaeum</hi> short; the bulk of the alimentary canal is therefore developed
                    from the met-enteron or remnant of the arch-enteron after the coelom has been
                    pinched off from it. A paired outgrowth of the met-enteron forms the glandular
                    diverticulum known as the digestive gland or (commonly) liver (E, <hi
                    rend="italic">zg, zV).</hi></p>
                <p>Dorsally to the alimentary tract the coelom is spacious. The space (C, E, s) is
                    termed the <hi rend="smallcaps">pericardium,</hi> since it is traversed by a
                    vessel running fore and aft in the median line, which has contractile muscular
                    walls and serves as a heart to propel the coelomic blood-fluid. This pericardial
                    space, although apparently derived from the original coelom, is not in
                    communication with the other spaces and bloodvessels derived from the coelom; it
                    never (or perhaps in a very few instances) contains in the adult the Molluscan
                    blood or haemolymph, and is always in free communication with the exterior
                    through the tubes called <hi rend="italic">nephridia</hi> (renal organs). The
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">heart</hi> receives symmetrically on each side, right and
                    left, a dilated vessel bringing aerated blood from the ctenidia. These dilated
                    vessels are termed the <hi rend="italic">auricles of the heart,</hi> whilst the
                    median portion itself, at the point where these vessels join it, is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">ventricle of the heart</hi> (C, <hi rend="italic">v).</hi> The
                    vessel passing fore and aft from the ventricle gives off a few trunks which open
                    into spaces of the coelom, the so-called lacunae; these are excavated in every
                    direction between the viscera and the various bundles of fibrous and muscular
                    tissue, and may assume more or less the character of tube-like vessels with
                    definite walls. Right and left opening into the pericardial coelom is a coiled
                    tube, the farther extremity of which opens to the exterior by the side of the
                    anus. These two tubes (C, <hi rend="italic">u)</hi> are the symmetrically
                    disposed <hi rend="smallcaps">nephridia</hi> (renal organs).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">gonads</hi> (ovaries or spermaries) are placed in the
                    mid-dorsal region of the coelom (C, <hi rend="italic">i),</hi> and have their
                    own apertures in the immediate neighbourhood of those of the nephridia. The
                    apertures are paired right and left, and so are the ducts into which they lead;
                    but at present we have no ground for determining whether the gonad itself was
                    primarily in Molluscs a paired organ or a median organ, nor have we any
                    well-founded conception as to the nature of the ducts when present, and their
                    original relationship to the gonads. The genital ducts of some organisms are
                    modified nephridia, but the nature of those of Mollusca, of Arthropoda, of
                    Echinoderma, of Nematoidea, and of some Vertebrata has yet to be elucidated.</p>
                <p>The disposition of the nerve-centres is highly characteristic. There are four
                    long cords composed of both nervefibres and nerve-cells which are disposed in
                    pairs, two right and left of the pedal area or foot, two more dorsally and
                    tending to a deeper position than that occupied by the pedal cords, so as to lie
                    freely within the coelomic space unattached to the body-wall. These are
                    respectively the <hi rend="smallcaps">pedal nerve-cords</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">visceral nerve-cords.</hi> The latter meet and join one another
                    posteriorly. A right and left (D, <hi rend="italic">g.v),</hi> and a median
                    abdominal <hi rend="italic">(g.db')</hi> ganglion are placed on these cords, and
                    from them are given off the osphradial nerves which have special ganglia <hi
                    rend="italic">(g.olf}.</hi> In the region of the prostomium the pedal
                    nerve-cords are enlarged behind the mouth, forming the <hi rend="italic">pedal
                    ganglia (g.pe),</hi> and are united by nerve-fibres to one another. From this
                    spot they are continued forward into the prostomium, where they enlarge to form
                    the right and left <hi rend="italic">cerebral ganglia (g.c),</hi> which are
                    united to one another by nerve-fibres in front of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n664/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0664-0637"/> the mouth, just as the pedal ganglia are behind
                    it. The right and left pedal ganglia are joined by transverse cords to the right
                    and left visceral cords respectively, the point of union being marked on either
                    side by a swelling <hi rend="italic">(g.pl)</hi> known as the pleural ganglion.
                    The visceral nervè-cord can also be traced up on each side beyond the pleural
                    ganglion to the cerebral ganglion. Thus we have a nearly complete double
                    nerve-ring formed around the oesophagus by the two pairs of nerve-cords which
                    are in this region drawn, as it were, towards each other and away from their
                    lateral position both behind and before the stomodaeal invagination. Whilst the
                    swollen parts of the nerve-tracts are termed <hi rend="italic">ganglia,</hi> the
                    connecting cords are conveniently distinguished either as <hi rend="italic"
                    >connectives</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">commissures.</hi> Commissures connect
                    two ganglia of the same pair We have a cerebral commissure, a pedal commissure
                    and a visceral commissure. Connectives connect ganglia of dissimilar pairs, and
                    we speak accordingly of the cerebro-pedal connective, the cerebro-pleural
                    connective, the pleuro-pedal connective, and the viscero-pleural connective.</p>
                <p>An <hi rend="smallcaps">enteric nervous system</hi> forming a plexus on the walls
                    of the alimentary canal exists, but does not exhibit cords and ganglia visible
                    to the naked eye except in the large Dibranchiate Cephalopods.</p>
                <p>Our schematic Mollusc is provided with certain <hi rend="smallcaps">organs of
                    special sense.</hi> Tactile organs occur on the head in the form of short <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">cephalic tentacles</hi> (a). Deeply placed are a pair of closed
                    vesicles containing each a calcareous concretion and acting as auditory organs;
                    these are known as <hi rend="smallcaps">octocysts</hi> (D, y). They are situated
                    behind the mouth in the foremost portion of the foot. At the base of each
                    cephalic tentacle is a pigmented eye-spot—the <hi rend="smallcaps">cephalic
                    eye</hi> (D, <hi rend="italic">τv).</hi> The <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the ctenidium, has already been mentioned.</p>
                <p>To the scheme thus exhibited of the possible organization of the ancestral
                    Mollusc we shall now add a sketch of the mode in which this form of body and
                    series of internal organs are developed from the egg.</p>
                <p>The egg-cell of Mollusca is either free from food material —a simple protoplasmic
                    corpuscle—or charged with food material to a greater or less extent. Those cases
                    which appear to be most typical—that is to say, which adhere to a procedure
                    which was probably common at one time to all then existing Mollusca, and which
                    has been departed from only in later and special lines of descent—show

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0665-0638"/> the following history. By division of the
                    egg-cell (fig. 3, A, B; fig. <hi rend="italic">4,</hi> A, B; and fig. 5) a
                    mulberry-mass of embryonic-cells is formed (Morula), which dilates, forming a
                    one-cell-layered sac (Blastula). By invagination one portion of this sphere
                    becomes tucked into the other—as in the preparation of a woven night-cap for the
                    head (fig. 6, B; fig. 7, A). The orifice of invagination (blastopore) narrows,
                    and we now have a two-cell-layered sac,—the Diblastula. The invaginated layer is
                    the enteric cell-layer or endoderm; the outer cell-layer is the deric cell-layer
                    or ectoderm. The cavity communicating with the blastopore and lined by the
                    endoderm is the arch-enteron. The blastopore, together with the whole embryo,
                    now elongates. The blastopore then closes along the middle portion of its
                    extent, which corresponds with the later developed foot. At the same time the
                    stomodaeum or oral invagination forms around the anterior remnant of the
                    blastopore, and the proctodaeum or anal invagination forms around the posterior
                    remnant of the blastopore. There are, however, variations in regard to the
                    relation of the blastopore to the mouth and to the anus which are probably
                    modifications of the original process described above. An examination of figs.
                    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and of others illustrative of the embryology of particular forms
                    which occur later in this article, is now recommended to the reader. The
                    explanation of the figures has been made very full so as to avoid the necessity
                    of special descriptions in the text. Internally, by the nipping off of a pair of
                    lateral outgrowths (forming part of the indefinable “mesoblast ”) from the
                    enteric celllayer the foundations of the coelomic cavity are laid. In some
                    Coelomata these outgrowths are hollow and of large size. In Mollusca they are
                    not hollow and large, which is probably the archaic condition, but they consist
                    at first of a few cells only, adherent to one another; these cells then diverge,
                    applying themselves to the body-wall and to the gut-wall so as to form the
                    lining layer of the coelomic cavity. Muscular tissue develops from deep-lying
                    cells, and the rudiments of the paired nerve-tracts from thickenings of the
                    deric-cell layer or ectoderm.</p>
                <p>The external form meanwhile passes through highly characteristic changes, which
                    are on the whole fairly constant throughout the Mollusca. A circlet of cilia
                    forms when the embryo is still nearly spherical (fig. 4, F; fig. 6, E; fig. 7,
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n666/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0666-0639"/> B), in an equatorial position. As growth
                    proceeds, one hemisphere remains relatively small, the other elongates and
                    enlarges. Both mouth and anus are placed in the larger area; the smaller area is
                    the prostomium simply; the ciliated band is therefore in front of the mouth. The
                    larval form thus produced is known as the Trochosphere. It exactly agrees with
                    the larval form of many Chaetopod worms and other Coelomata. Most remarkable is
                    its agreement with the adult form of the Wheel animalcules or Rotifera, which
                    retain the prae-oral ciliated band as their chief organ of locomotion and
                    prehension throughout life. So far the young Mollusc has not reached a
                    definitely Molluscan stage of development, being only in a condition common to
                    it and other Coelomata. It now passes to the veliger phase, a definitely
                    Molluscan form, in which the disproportion between the area in front of the
                    ciliated circlet and that behind it is very greatly increased, so that the
                    former is now simply an emarginated region of the head fringed with cilia (fig.
                    8; fig. 6, F; fig. 7, F; and fig. 60, A). It is termed the “velum,” and is
                    frequently drawn out into lobes and processes. As in the Rotifera, it serves the
                    veliger larva as an organ of locomotion. In a very few Molluscs, but notably in
                    the Common Pond-Snail, the emarginated bilobed velum is retained in full
                    proportions in adult life (fig. 70), having lost its marginal fringe of
                    specially long cilia and its locomotor function. The body of the Veliger is
                    characterized by the development of the visceral hump on one surface, and by
                    that of the foot on the other. Growth is greater in the vertical dorso-ventral
                    axis than in the longitudinal oro-anal axis; consequently the foot is relatively
                    small and projects as a blunt process between mouth and anus, which are not
                    widely distant from one another, whilst the antipedal area projects in the form
                    of a great hump or dome. In the centre of this antipedal area there has appeared
                    (often at a very early period) a gland-like depression or follicle of the
                    integument (fig. 6, C, <hi rend="italic">sk</hi>; fig. 7, E, F, <hi
                    rend="italic">shgl;</hi> fig. 60, B; fig. 68, <hi rend="italic">shs;</hi> fig.
                    72***, ss). This is the primitive shell-sac discovered by Lankester (18) in
                    1871, and shown by him to precede the development of the permanent shell in a
                    variety of Molluscan types. The cavity of this small sac becomes filled by a
                    horny substance, and then it very usually disappears, whilst a delicate shell,

                <p>The embryonic shell-sac or shell-gland represents in a transient form, in the
                    individual development of most Mollusca, that condition of the shell-forming
                    area which we have sketched above in the schematic Mollusc. In very few
                    instances (in Chiton, and probably in Limax), as we shall see below, the <hi
                    rend="italic">primitive shell-sac</hi> is retained and enlarged as the permanent
                    shell-forming area. It is supplanted in other Molluscs by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >secondary shell-forming area,</hi> namely, that afforded by the free surface of
                    the visceral hump, the shell-forming activity of which extends even to the
                    surface of the depending mantle-skirt. Accordingly, in most Mollusca the <hi
                    rend="italic">primitive shell</hi> is represented only by the horny plug of the
                    primitive shell-sac. The permanent shell is a new formation on a new area, and
                    should be distinguished as a <hi rend="italic">secondary shell.</hi></p>
                <p>The ctenidia, it will be observed, have not yet been mentioned, and they are
                    indeed the last of the characteristic Molluscan organs to make their appearance.
                    Their possible relation to the prae-oral and post-oral ciliated bands of embryos
                    similar to the Trochosphere will be discussed in the final section of this
                    article dealing with the Polyzoa and Brachiopoda. The Veliger, as soon as its
                    shell begins to assume definite shape, is no longer of a form commôn to various
                    classes of Mollusca, but acquires characters peculiar to its class. At this
                    point, therefore, we shall for the present leave it.</p>

                <p>We are now in a position to pass systematically in review the various groups of
                    Mollusca, showing in what way they conform to the organization of our schematic
                    Mollusc, and in what special ways they have modified or even suppressed parts
                    present in it, or phases in the representative embryonic history which has just
                    been sketched. It will be found that the foot, the shell, the mantle-skirt, and
                    the ctenidia, undergo the most remarkable changes of form and proportionate
                    development in the various classes —changes which are correlated with extreme
                    changes and elaboration in the respective functions of those parts.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Division of the Phylum into tvuo Branches.—</hi> The Mollusca
                    are sharply divided into two great lines of descent or branches, according as
                    the prostomial region is atrophied on the one hand, or largely developed on the
                    other.</p>
                <p>The probabilities are in favour of any ancestral form— the hypothetical
                    archi-Mollusc which connected the Mollusca with their non-Molluscan
                    forefathers—having possessed, as do all the more primitive forms of Coelomata, a
                    well-marked prostomium, and consequently a head. The one series of Mollusca
                    descended from the primitive headbearing Molluscs have acquired an organization
                    in which the Molluscan characteristics have become modified in definite relation
                    to a sessile inactive life. As the most prominent result of the adaptation to
                    such sessile life they exhibit an atrophy of the cephalic region. They form the
                    branch <hi rend="smallcaps">lipocephala</hi> —the mussels, oysters, cockles, and
                    clams. The other series have retained an active, in many cases a highly
                    aggressive, mode of life; they have, correspondingly, not only retained a
                    well-developed head, but have developed a special aggressive organ in connexion
                    with the mouth, which, on account of its remarkable nature and the peculiarities
                    of the details of its mechanism, serves to indicate a very close genetic
                    connexion between all such animals as possess it. This remarkable organ is the
                    odontophore, consisting of a lingual ribbon, rasp, or radula, with its cushion
                    and muscles. On account of the possession of this organ this great branch of the
                    Molluscan phylum may be best designated <hi rend="smallcaps">glossophora.</hi>

                    is objectionable, since this is common to them and the hypothetical
                    archi-Mollusca from which they descend. The term Odontophora, which has been
                    applied to them, is also unsuitable, since the organ which characterizes them is
                    not a tooth, but a tongue.</p>
                <p>The general structure of the odontophore ( = toothbearer, in allusion to the
                    rasp-like ribbon) of the glossophorous Mollusca may be conveniently described at
                    once. Essentially it is a tube-like outgrowth—the <hi rend="italic">radular
                    sac</hi> (fig. 9, A, <hi rend="italic">g, n)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> in the
                    median line of the ventral floor of the stoinodaeum, upon the inner surface of
                    which is formed a chitinous band (the radula) beset with minute teeth like a
                    rasp (∕&gt;). Anteriorly the ventral wall of the diverticulum is converted into
                    cartilage (A), to which protractor and retractor muscles are attached (Z∙, t),
                    so that by the action of the former the cartilage, with the anterior end of the
                    ribbon resting firmly upon it, may be brought forward into the space between the
                    lips of the oral aperture <hi rend="italic">(au,</hi><hi rend="italic">al),</hi>
                    and made to exert there a backward and forward rasping action by the alternate
                    contraction of retractor and protractor muscles attached to the cartilage. But
                    in many Glossophora <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> the Whelk) the apparatus is
                    complicated by the fact that the diverticulum itself, with its contained radula,
                    rests but loosely on the cartilage, and has special muscles attached to each end
                    of it, arising from the body wall; these muscles pull the whole diverticulum or
                    radular sac alternately backwards and forwards over the surface of the
                    cartilage. This action, which is quite distinct from the movement of the
                    cartilage itself, may be witnessed in a Whelk if the pharynx be opened whilst it
                    is alive. It has also been seen in living transparent Gastropods. The chitinous
                    ribbon is continuously growing forward from the tube-like diverticulum as a
                    finger-nail does on its bed, and thus the wearing away of the part which rests
                    on the cartilage and is brought into active use, is made up for by the advance
                    of the ribbon in the same way as the wearing down of the finger-nail is
                    counterbalanced by its own forward growth. And, just as the new substance of the
                    finger-nail is formed in the concealed part, sunk posteriorly below a fold of
                    skin, and yet is continually carried forward with the forward movement of the
                    bed on which it rests, and which forms its undermost layers, so is the new
                    substance of the radula formed in the compressed extremity of the radular sac
                    <hi rend="italic">(n),</hi> and carried forward by the forward movement of the
                    bed (o) on which it rests, and by which is formed its undermost layer. This
                    forward-moving bed is not merely the ventral wall of the radular diverticulum,
                    but includes also that portion of the floor of the oral cavity to which the
                    radula adheres (as far forward as the point <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in fig. 9,
                    A). At the spot where the radula ceases, the forward. growth-movement of the
                    floor also ceases, just as in the case of the finger-nail the similar
                    growth-movement ceases at the line where the nail becomes free.</p>
                <p>The radula or cuticular product of the slowly-moving bed can be stripped off, and
                    is then found to consist of a ribbon-like area, upon which are set numerous
                    tooth-like processes of various form in transverse rows, which follow one
                    another closely, and exactly resemble one another in the form of their teeth
                    (fig. 9, B). The tooth-like processes in a single transverse row are of very
                    different shape and number in different members of the Glossophora, and it is
                    possible to use a formula for their description. Thus, when in each row there is
                    a single median tooth with three teeth on each side of it more or less closely
                    resembling one another, as in fig. 9, G, we write the formula 3.1.3. When there
                    are additional lateral pieces of a different shape to those immediately
                    adjoining the central tooth, we indicate them by the figure 0, repeated to
                    represent their number, thus 0000.1.1.1.0000 is the formula for the lingual
                    teeth of <hi rend="italic">Chiton Stelleri.</hi> A single median tooth, an
                    admedian series, and a lateral series may be thus distinguished. In some
                    Glossophora only median teeth are present, or large median teeth with a single
                    small admedian tooth on each side of it (fig. 9, H); these are termed
                    Rachiglossa (formula, —.1.— or 1.1.1). In a large number of Glossophora we have
                    three admedian on each side and one median, no lateral pieces (fig. 9, G); these
                    are termed Taenioglossa (formula, 3.1.3). Those with numerous lateral pieces,
                    four to six or more admedian pieces, and a median piece or tooth (fig. 9, C) are
                    termed Rhipi doglossa (formula, x.6.1.6.x, where x stands for an indefinite
                    number of lateral pieces). The Toxoglossa have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n668/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0668-0641"/> 1.0.1, the central tooth being absent and the
                    lateral teeth peculiarly long and connected with muscles. The term Ptenoglossa
                    (fig. 9, D) is applied to those Glossophora in which the radula presents no
                    median tooth, but an indefinite and large number of admedian teeth, giving the
                    formula x.0.x. When the admedian teeth are indefinite (forty to fifty), and a
                    median tooth is present, the term Myriaglossa is applied (formula, x.l.x). It
                    must be understood that the pieces or teeth thus formulated may themselves vary
                    much in form, being either flat plates, or denticulated, hooked, or spine-like
                    bodies. We shall revert to the terms thus explained in the systematic
                    descriptions of the groups of Glossophora.</p>
                <p>The muscular development in connexion with the whole buccal mass, and with each
                    part of the radular apparatus, is exceedingly complicated,—as many as twenty
                    distinct muscles having been enumerated in connexion with this organ. In
                    addition to the radula, and correlated with its development, we find almost
                    universally present in the Glossophora a pair of horny jaws (usually calcified)
                    developed as cuticular productions upon the epidermis of the lips (fig. 9, A,
                    δ). The radula and the shelly jaws of the Glossophora enable their possessors
                    not only to voraciously attack vegetable food, but the radula is used in some
                    instances for boring the shells of other Mollusca, and the jaws for crushing the
                    shells of Crustacea, and for wounding even Vertebrata.</p>

                    specimens brought from the arctic regions by the Barents Dutch expedition.</p>
                <p>By some writers— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Keferstein—the Chitons have been
                    too intimately associated with the other Gastropoda, whilst, on the other hand,
                    Gegenbaur seems to have gone a great deal too far in separating them altogether
                    from the other Mollusca as a primary subdivision of that phylum, inasmuch as
                    they are intimately bound to the other Glossophora by the possession of a
                    thoroughly typical and well - developed odontophore. They undoubtedly stand
                    nearer to the archi-Mollusca than any other Glossophora in having retained a
                    complete bilateral symmetry and the primitive shell-sac, though the metameric
                    repetition of this organ and of the ctenidia is a complication of, and departure
                    from, the primitive character. It is not improbable that in the calcareous
                    spines and plates of the dorsal integument of Neomenia and Chaetoderma, which
                    occur also on the part of the dorsum uncovered by shell in Chiton, we have the
                    retention of a condition preceding the development of the solid Molluscan shell,
                    or a reversion to it. The minute calcareous bodies may have the same relation to
                    a compact shell which the shagreen denticles of the sharks have to a continuous
                    dermal bone.</p>
                <p>The anatomy of the Gastropoda Isopleura has been largely elucidated within the
                    past year by the researches of Hubrecht and of Sedgwick, who have been the first
                    to apply the method of sections to the study of this group.</p>
                <p>The leading points in the modifications of mantle-flap, foot, and ctenidia are
                    set forth in the preceding summaries, and in the accompanying references to the
                    figures. With regard to other organs, we have to note the form of the alimentary
                    canal (fig. 13), which is simplest in Chaetoderma, symmetrically sacculated in
                    Neomenia, and λvound upon itself, forming a few coils, in Chiton. The latter has
                    a compact liver with arborescent duct, which is represented by the sacculi in
                    Neomenia and by a single caecum in Chaetoderma. Salivary glands are present in
                    Chiton and in Proneomenia. The radula is highly developed in Chiton, and, though
                    present in Proneomenia, has not been described in Neomenia. A single tooth in
                    Chaetoderma appears to represent the radula in a reduced state. The circulatory
                    organs of Chiton alone are known with any degree of detail (fig. 10, C). There
                    is a median dorsal blood-vessel—the aorta—which is enlarged to form a ventricle
                    in the posterior region of the body. On either side the ventricle is connected
                    to a well-developed auricle, which pours into it the aerated blood from the
                    gills (ctenidia). The extent to which vascular trunks are developed has not been
                    determined, but vessels to and from the ctenidia, and in the mid-line of the
                    foot, are known. As in other Mollusca, the vessels do not extend far, but lead
                    into lacunae between the organs and tissues. Dorsal and ventral vessels have
                    been detected in Neomenia and Chaetoderma, but no specialized heart.</p>
                <p>The heart of Chiton lies in a space which is to be regarded as a specialized part
                    of the coelom, and, as in other Molluscs, is termed the pericardium. In front of
                    this space in Chiton lies the ovary (fig. 14, D). In the other Isopleura the
                    genital bodies (gonads) lie in the peri cardium, which has a longer form and
                    extends dorsally above the intestine. Opening into the pericardium equally in
                    all the Isopleura (fig. 14) is a pair of bent tubes which lead to the exterior.
                    These are the nephridia, which in Chiton are essentially renal in function.
                    Their disposition has been determined by Sedgwick (26), who has shown that each
                    nephridium is much bent on itself, so that, as in the <pb break="no"

                    internal aperture lies near the external. From the folded stem of the nephridium
                    very numerous secreting caeca are given off, —omitted in the diagram (fig. 14,
                    D), but accurately drawn in fig. 15. The sexes in Chiton are distinct, and the
                    ovary or testis, as the case may be, though lying in and filling a chamber of
                    the original coelom, does not discharge into the pericardium, but has its own
                    ducts, which pass to the exterior just in front of those of the nephridia (fig.
                    14, D, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and fig.</p>
                <p>16). In this respect Chiton is less primitive than the other Isopleura, and even
                    than some other Gastropods (the Zygobranchia), and some Conchifera (Spondylus,
                    &lt;fcc.), which have no special genital apertures, but make use of the
                    nephridia for this purpose. In C‰7on <hi rend="italic">discrepans,</hi> in which
                    there are sixteen pairs of ctenidia, the orifices of the nephridia are
                    coincident with the sixteenth pair of ctenidia, those of the genital ducts with
                    a point between the thirteenth and fourteenth ctenidia.</p>
                <p>In the Neomeniae and Chaetoderma the nephridia are short and wide <hi
                    rend="italic">{N</hi> in fig. 14, A, B, C), and function as excretory ducts for
                    the genital products, the gonads being lodged in the long pericardium. Their
                    separate or united apertures open near the anus into the small chamber formed by
                    the restriction of the mantle-skirt to the immediate neighbourhood of the
                    anus.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of the Gastropoda Isopleura is represented in the diagram fig.
                    17. In all it is important to observe that nerveganglion cells are by no means
                    limited to special swellings—the ganglia—but are abundant along the whole course
                    of the four great longitudinal trunks. This is a primitive character comparab
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> e to that presented by the nerve-cords of
                    Nemertine worms, and of the Arthropod Peripatus. Higher differentiation in other
                    Mollusca leads to predominance if not an exclusive presence of nerve <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ∕z6zv ’ s in the cords, and of nerve-&lt;7twψ‰n <hi
                    rend="italic">cells</hi> in the specialized ganglia. The numerous transverse
                    connexions of the pedal nerve-cords in Chiton and Neomenia (seen also in
                    Fissurella (fig. 36) and some other Gastropods) are comparable to the transverse
                    connexions of the ventral nervecords of Chaetopod worms and Arthropods. In the
                    abundance of the nervous network connected with its longitudinal nerve-tracts,
                    Chiton appears to retain something of the early condition of the Coelomate
                    nervous system when it had the form of a sub-epidermic network or nerve-tunic
                    (seen more clearly in Planarians and some Nemertines), and when the
                    concentration into definitely compacted cords had not set in.</p>
                <p>Ganglia are, however, distinguishable upon the nervous cords of Chiton (fig. 18).
                    The cerebral ganglia are not distinguishable as such, but a pair of buccal
                    ganglia (B in fig. 18) are developed on two connectives which pass forward from
                    the cerebral region to the great muscular mass of the mouth. These buccal
                    ganglia are special developments connected with the special muscularity of the
                    lips and odontophore, and are found in all Glossophora, but not in the
                    Lipocephala. Such special ganglia related to special organs (and not introduced
                    in our schematic Mollusc, fig.</p>
                <p>1) we find in connexion with the siphons of the Lipocephala, and in various
                    positions upon the visceral nervecords of other Mollusca, both Glossophora and
                    Lipocephala. A pair of pedal ganglia but little developed <hi rend="italic"
                    >(p</hi> in fig. 18), and a special group of sublingual ganglia are present in
                    Chiton. On the whole, the nervous system of the Isopleura is exceedingly simple
                    and archaic, whilst it does not well serve as a type with which to compare that
                    of other Mollusca on account of the small amount of concentration of its
                    nerve-ganglion cells into ganglia, such as we find well developed in other

                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters.—</hi> Gastropoda in which, whilst the head and foot
                    retain the bilateral symmetry of the archi-Mollusca, the visceral dome,
                    including the mantle-flap dependent from it, and the region on which are placed
                    the ctenidia, anus, generative and nephridial apertures, have been subjected to
                    a <hi rend="smallcaps">rotation</hi> tending to bring the anus from its
                    posterior median position, by a movement along the right side, forwards to a
                    position above the right side of the animal’s neck, or even to the middle line
                    above the neck. This torsion is connected mechanically with the excessive
                    vertical growth of the visceral hump and the development upon its surface of a
                    heavy shell. The <hi rend="smallcaps">shell</hi> is not a plate enclosed in a
                    shell-sac, but the primitive shell-sac appears and disappears in the course of
                    embryonic development, and a relatively large nautiloid shell (with rare
                    exceptions) develops over the whole surface of the visceral hump and
                    mantle-skirt. Whilst such a shell might retain its median position in a swimming
                    animal, it and the visceral hump necessarily fall to one side in a creeping
                    animal which carries them uppermost.</p>
                <p>The shell and visceral hump in the Anisopleura incline normally to the right side
                    of the animal. As mechanical results, there arise a one-sided pressure and a
                    one-sided strain, together with a one-sided development of the muscular masses
                    which are related to the shell and foot. Both the <hi rend="smallcaps">torsion
                    through a semicircle</hi> of the base of the visceral dome and the continued
                    leiotropic spiral growth of the visceral dome itself, which is very usual in the
                    Anisopleura, appear to be traceable to these mechanical conditions. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Atrophy</hi> of the representatives on one side of the body of
                    paired organs is very usual. Those placed primitively on the left side of the
                    rectum, which in virtue of the torsion becomes the right side, are the set which
                    suffer (see fig. 19). Some Anisopleura, after having thus acquired a
                    strongly-marked inequilateral character in regard to such organs as the
                    ctenidia, nephridia, genital ducts, heart, and rectum, appear by further change
                    of conditions of growth to have acquired a superficial bilateral symmetry, the
                    secondary nature of which is revealed by anatomical examination
                    (Opisthobranchia, Natantia).</p>
                <p>In all groups of Anisopleura examples are numerous in which the shell is greatly
                    developed, forming a “house” into which the whole animal can be withdrawn, the
                    entrance being often closed by a second shelly piece carried upon the foot (the
                    opérculum). The power of rapidly extending and of again contracting large
                    regions of the body to an enormous degree is usual, as in the Lipocephalous
                    Mollusca. In spite of the theories which have been held on this matter, it
                    appears highly probable that no fluid from without is introduced into the blood,
                    nor is any expelled during these changes of form. A large mucous gland with a
                    median pore is usually developed on the ventral surface of the foot, comparable
                    to the similar gland and pore in Lipocephala, and in some cases <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Pyrula, fig. 37, B) this has been mistaken for a

                <p>The leiotropic torsion of the visceral dome has had less deep-seated effect in
                    one series of i Anisopleura than in another. Accordingly, as the loop formed by

                    Streptoneura have developed independently from the ancestral bilaterally
                    symmetrical Gastropods. The escape of the visceral nerve-loop from the torsion
                    depends on its having acquired a somewhat deeper position and shorter extent,
                    previously to the commencement of the phenomenon of torsion, in the ancestors of
                    the Euthyneura than in those of the Streptoneura. The junction of the two halves
                    of the visceral loop in the Euthyneura is below the anus, and the loop is
                    therefore not caught by the intestine. In the Streptoneura the junction is (as
                    in the Isopleura) above the anus.</p>

                    organs is not carried out. The right and left ctenidia, which have now become

                    rend="italic">—</hi> The Common Limpet is a specially interesting and abundant
                    example of the remarkable order Zygobranchia. A complete and accurate account of
                    its anatomy has yet to be written. Here we have only space for a brief outline.
                    The foot of the Limpet is a nearly circular disc of muscular tissue; in front,
                    projecting from and raised above it, are the head and neck (figs. 26, 30). The
                    visceral hump forms a low conical dome above the subcircular foot, and standing
                    out all round the base of this dome so as to completely overlap the head and
                    foot, is the circular mantle-skirt. The depth of free mantle-skirt is greatest
                    in front, where the head and neck are covered in by it. Upon the surface of the
                    visceral dome, and extending to the edge of the free mantle-skirt, is the
                    conical shell. When the shell is taken away (best effected by immersion in hot
                    water) the surface of the visceral dome is found to be covered by a
                    black-coloured epithelium, which may be removed, enabling the observer to note
                    the position of some organs lying below the transparent integument (fig. 27).
                    The muscular columns (c) attaching the foot to the shell form a ring incomplete
                    in front, external to which is the free mantle-skirt. The limits of the large
                    area formed by the flap over the head and neck <hi rend="italic">(ecr)</hi> can
                    be traced, and we note the anal papilla showing through and opening on the right
                    shoulder, so to speak, of the animal into the large anterior region of the
                    sub-pallial space. Close to this the small renal organ (?', mediad) and the
                    larger renal organ (A∙, to the right and posteriorly) are seen, also the
                    pericardium (∕) and a coil of the intestine (tni) embedded in the compact
                    liver.</p>
                <p>On cutting away the anterior part of the mantle-skirt so as to expose the
                    sub-pallial chamber in the region of the neck, we find the right and left renal
                    papillae (discovered by Lankester (27) in 1867) on either side the anal papilla
                    (fig. 28), but no gills. If a similar examination be made of the allied genus
                    Fissurella (fig. 24, &lt;Z), we find right and left of the two renal apertures a
                    right and left gill-plume or ctenidium, which by their presence here and in
                    Haliotis furnish the distinctive character to which the name Zygobranchia
                    refers. In Patella no such plumes exist, but right and left of the neck are seen
                    a pair of minute oblong yellow bodies (fig. 28, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> which
                    were originally described by Lankester as orifices possibly connected with the
                    evacuation of the generative <pb break="no"

                    termed by him the “capito-pedal orifices,” being placed near the junction of
                    head and foot. Spengel (24) has, however, in a most ingenious way shown that
                    these bodies are the representatives of the typical pair of ctenidia, here
                    reduced to a mere rudiment. Near to each rudimentary ctenidium Spengel has
                    discovered an olfactory patch or osphradium (consisting of modified epithelium)
                    and an olfactory nerve-ganglion (fig. 32). It will be remembered that, according
                    to Spengel, the osphradium of Mollusca is definitely and intimately related to
                    the gill - plume or ctenidium, being always placed near the base of that organ;
                    further, Spengel has shown that the nerve-supply of this olfactory organ is
                    always derived from the visceral loop. Accordingly, the nervesupply affords a
                    means of testing the conclusion that we have in Lankester’s capito-pedal bodies
                    the rudimentary ctenidia. The accompanying diagrams (figs. 34, 35) of the
                    nervous systems of Patella and of Haliotis, as determined by Spen gel, show the
                    identity in the origin of the nerves passing from the visceral loop to SpengeΓs
                    olfactory ganglion of the Limpet, and that of the nerves which pass from the
                    visceral loop of Haliotis to the olfactory patch or osphradium, which lies in
                    immediate relation on the right and on the left side to the right and the left
                    gill-plumes (ctenidia) respectively. The same diagrams serve to demonstrate the
                    Streptoneurous condition of the visceral loop in Zygobranchia.</p>
                <p>Thus, then, we find that the Limpet possesses a symmetrically-disposed pair of
                    ctenidia in a rudimentary condition, and justifies its position among
                    Zygobranchia. At the same time it possesses a totally distinct series of <hi
                    rend="italic">functional</hi> gills, which are not derived from the modification
                    of the typical Molluscan ctenidium.</p>
                <p>These gills are in the form of delicate lamellae (fig. 26, ∕), which form a
                    series extending completely round the inner face of the depending mantleskirt.
                    This circlet of gill-lamellae led Cuvier to class the Limpets as
                    Cyclobranchiata, and, by erroneous identification of them with the series of
                    metamerically repeated ctenidia of Chiton, to associate the latter Mollusc with
                    the former. The gill-lamellae of Patella are processes of the mantle comparable
                    to the plaitlike folds often observed on the roof of the branchial chamber in
                    other Gastropoda <hi rend="italic">(e.g.∙&gt;</hi> Buccinum and Haliotis). They
                    are termed palliai gills. The only other Molluscs in which they are exactly
                    represented are the curious Opisthobranchs Phyllidia and Pleurophyllidia (fig.
                    57). In these, as in Patella, the typical ctenidia are aborted, and the
                    branchial function is assumed by close-set lamelliform processes arranged in a
                    series beneath the mantle-skirt on either side of the foot. In fig. 26, <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> the large branchial vein of Patella bringing blood from the
                    gill-series to the heart is seen; where it crosses the series of lamellae there
                    is a short interval devoid of lamellae.</p>
                <p>The heart in Patella consists of a single auricle (not two as in Haliotis and
                    Fissurella) and a ventricle; the former receives the blood from the branchial
                    vein, the latter distributes it through a large aorta which soon leads into
                    irregular blood-lacunae.</p>

                <p>The existence of two renal organs in Patella, and their relation to the
                    pericardium (a portion of the coelom), is important. Each renal organ is a sac
                    lined with glandular epithelium (ciliated cells with concretions) communicating
                    with the exterior by its papilla, and by a narrow passage with the pericardium.
                    The connexion with the pericar dium of the smaller of the two renal organs was
                    demonstrated by Lankester in 1867, at a time when the fact that the renal organ
                    of the Mollusca, as a rule, opens into the pericardium, and is therefore a
                    typical nephridium, was not known. Subsequent investigations (27) carried on
                    under the direction of the same naturalist have shown that the larger as well as
                    the smaller renal sac is in communication with the pericardium. The walls of the
                    renal sacs are deeply plaited and thrown into ridges. Below the surface these
                    walls are excavated with blood-vessels, so that the sac is practically a series
                    of blood-vessels covered with renal epithelium, and forming a mesh-work within a
                    space communicating with the exterior. The larger renal sac (remarkably enough,
                    that which is aborted in other Anisopleura) extends between the liver and the
                    integument of the visceral dome very widely. It also bends round the liver as
                    shown in fig. 30, and forms a large sac on half of the upper surface of the
                    muscular mass of the foot. Here it lies close upon the genital body (ovary or
                    testis), and in such intimate rela tionship with it that, when ripe, the gonad
                    bursts into the renal sac, and its products are carried to the exterior by the
                    papilla on the right side of the anus (Robin, Dall). This fact led Cuvier
                    erroneously to the belief that a duct existed leading from the gonad to this
                    papilla. The position of the gonad, best seen in the diagrammatic section (fig.
                    31), is, as in other Zygobranchia, devoid of a special duct communicating with
                    the exterior. This condition, probably an archaic one, distinguishes the
                    Zygobranchia among all Glossophorous Mollusca.</p>
                <p>The digestive tract of Patella offers some interesting features. The odontophore
                    is powerfully developed; the radular sac is extraordinarily long, lying coiled
                    in a space <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n675/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0675-0648"/> between the mass of the liver and the muscular
                    foot. The radula has 160 rows of teeth with twelve teeth in each row. Two pairs
                    of salivary ducts, each leading from a salivary gland, open into the buccal
                    chamber. The oesophagus leads into a remarkable stomach, plaited like the
                    manyplies of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> sheep, and after this the intestine takes
                    a very large number of turns embedded in the yellow liver, until at last it
                    passes between the two renal sacs to the anal papilla. A curious ridge (spiral?
                    valve) which secretes a slimy cord is found upon the inner wall of the
                    intestine. The general structure of the Molluscan intestine has not been
                    sufficiently investigated to render any comparison of this structure of Patella
                    with that of other Mollusca possible. The eyes of the Limpet (28) deserve
                    mention as examples of the most primitive kind of eye in the Molluscan series.
                    They are found one on each cephalic tentacle, and are simply minute open pits or
                    depressions of the epidermis, the epidermic cells lining them being pigmented
                    and connected with nerves (compare fig.</p>
                <p>118).</p>
                <p>The Limpet breeds upon the southern English coast in the early part of April, but
                    its development has not been followed. It has simply been traced as far as the
                    formation of a Diblastula which acquires a ciliated band, and becomes a nearly
                    spherical Trochosphere. It is probable that the Limpet takes several years to
                    attain full growth, and during that period it frequents the same spot, which
                    becomes gradually sunk below the surrounding surface, especially if the rock be
                    carbonate of lime. At low tide the Limpet (being a strictly intertidal organism)
                    is exposed to the air, and is to be found upon its spot of fixation; but when
                    the water again covers it, it (according to trustworthy observers) quits its
                    attachment and walks away in search of food (minute encrusting algae), and then
                    once more as the tide falls returns to the identical spot, not an inch in
                    diameter, which belongs, as it were, to it. Several million Limpets —twelve
                    million in Berwickshire alone—are annually used on the east coast of Britain as
                    bait.</p>
                <p>Order 2.—Azygobranchia.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Streptoneura which, as
                    a sequel to the torsion of the visceral hump, have lost by atrophy the
                    originally left ctenidium and the originally left nephridium, retaining the
                    right ctenidium as a comb-like gill-plume to the actual left of the rectum, and
                    the right nephridium (that which is the smaller in the Zygobranchia) also to the
                    actual left of the rectum, between it and the gill-plume. The right olfactory
                    organ only is retained, and may assume the form of a comb-like ridge to the
                    actual left of the ctenidium or branchial plume. It has been erroneously
                    described as the second gill, and is known as the parabranchia. The rectum
                    itself lies on the animal’s right shoulder. The presence of glandular plication
                    of the surface of the mantle-flap (fig. 46, <hi rend="italic">x)</hi> and an
                    adrectal gland (purplegland, fig. 47, <hi rend="italic">gp)</hi> are frequently
                    observed. The sexes are always distinct; a special genital duct (oviduct or
                    sperm duct) unpaired is present, opening either by the side of the anus or, in
                    the males, on the right side of the neck in connexion with a large penis. The
                    shell is usually large and spiral; often an operculum is developed on the upper
                    surface of the hinder part of the foot. The dentition of the lingual ribbon is
                    very varied; In most cases the visceral hump and the foot increase along axes at
                    right angles to one another, so that the foot is extended far behind the
                    visceral hump in the ab-oral direction, whilst the visceral hump is lofty and
                    spirally twisted.</p>
                <p>This is a very large group, and is conveniently divided into two sections, the
                    Reptantia and the Natantia. The former, containing the immense majority of the
                    group, breaks up into three sub-orders, the Holochlamyda, Pneumonochlamyda, and
                    Siphonochlamyda, characterized by the presence or absence of a trough-like
                    prolongation of the margin of the mantle-flap, which conducts water to the
                    respiratory chamber (sub-pallial space where the gill, anus, &lt;fcc., are
                    placed), and notches the mouth of the shell by its presence, or again by
                    adaptation to aerial respiration. The sub-orders are divided into groups
                    according to the characters of the lingual dentition. In some Azygobranchia the
                    mouth is placed at the end of a more or less elongated snout or rostrum which is
                    not capable of introversion (Rostrifera); in the others (Proboscidifera) the
                    rostrum is partly invaginated and is often of great length. It is only everted
                    when the animal is feeding, and is withdrawn (introverted) by the action of
                    special muscles; the over-worked term “proboscis” is applied to the retractile
                    form of snout. The term “introversible snout,” or simply “introvert,” would be
                    preferable. The presence or absence of this arrangement does not seem to furnish
                    so natural a division of the Reptant Azygobranchia as that afforded by the
                    characters of the mantle-skirt.</p>

                    number of fresh-water, and some terrestrial forms. The partial dissection of a

                <p>The branchial chamber formed by the mantle-skirt overhanging the head has been
                    exposed by cutting along a line extending backward from the letters <hi

                    >me,</hi> and the whole roof of the chamber thus detached from the right side of
                    the animal’s neck has been thrown over to the left, showing the organs which lie
                    upon the roof. No opening into the body-cavity has been made; the organs which
                    lie in the coiled visceral hump show through its transparent walls. The head is
                    seen in front resting on the foot and carrying a median non-retractile snout or
                    rostrum, and a pair of cephalic tentacles at the base of each of which is an
                    eye. In many Gastropoda the eyes are not thus sessile but raised upon special
                    eye-tentacles (figs. 43, 69). To the right of the head is seen the muscular
                    penis <hi rend="italic">p</hi> close to the termination of the vas deferens

                    occupies a median position in the coiled visceral mass. Behind the penis on the
                    same side is the hooklike columella muscle, a development of the retractor
                    muscle of the foot, which clings to the spiral column or columella of the shell
                    (see fig. 42). This columella muscle is the same thing as the muscular surface

                    the roof of the branchial chamber is the rectum <hi rend="italic">i'</hi>,
                    ending in the anus <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> It can be traced back to the
                    intestine <hi rend="italic">i</hi> near the surface of the visceral hump, and it
                    is found that the apex of the coil formed by the hump is occupied by the liver
                    <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and the stomach <hi rend="italic">v.</hi> Pharynx and
                    oesophagus are concealed in the head. The enlarged glandular structure of the
                    walls of the rectum is frequent in the Azygobranch ia, as is also though not
                    universally the gland marked <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> next to the rectum. It is
                    the adrectal gland, and in the genera Murex and Purpura secretes a colourless
                    liquid which turns purple upon exposure to the atmosphere, and was used by the
                    ancients as a dye. Near this, and less advanced into the branchial chamber, is
                    the single renal organ or nephridium <hi rend="italic">r</hi> with its opening
                    to the exterior <hi rend="italic">r'.</hi> Internally this glandular sac
                    presents a second slit or aperture which leads into the pericardium (as is now
                    found to be the case in all Mollusca). The heart <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi>
                    lying in the pericardium is seen in close proximity to <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0678-0651"/> the renal organ, and consists of a single auricle
                    receiving blood from the gill, and of a single ventricle which pumps it through
                    the body by an anterior and posterior aorta (see fig. 105). The surface <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> of the mantle between the rectum and the gillplume is
                    thrown into folds which in many sea-snails (Whelks, &amp;c.) are very strongly
                    developed. The whole of this surface appears to be active in the secretion of a
                    mucous-like substance. The single gill-plume <hi rend="italic">br</hi> lies to
                    the left of the median line in natural position. It corresponds to the right of
                    the two primitive ctenidia in the untwisted archaic condition of the Molluscan
                    body, and does not project freely into the branchial cavity, but its axis is
                    attached (by concrescence) to the mantle-skirt (roof of the branchial chamber).
                    It is rare for the gill-plume of an Anisopleurous Gastropod to stand out freely
                    as a plume, but occasionally this more archaic condition is exhibited, as in
                    Valvata (fig. 45). Next beyond (to the left of) the gillplume we find the
                    so-called parabranchia, which is here simple, but sometimes lamellated as in
                    Purpura (fig. 47). This organ has, without reason, been supposed to represent
                    the second ctenidium of the typical Mollusc, which it cannot do on account of
                    its position. It should be to the right of the anus were this the case. Recently
                    Spengel has shown that the parabranchia of Gastropods is the typical olfactory
                    organ or osphradium in a highly-developed condition The minute structure of the
                    epithelium which clothes it, as well as the origin of the nerve which is
                    distributed to the parabranchia, proves it to be the same organ which is found
                    universally in Molluscs at the base of each gill-plume, and tests the indrawn
                    current of water by the sense of smell. The nerve to this organ is given off
                    from the superior (original right, see fig. 19) visceral ganglion.</p>
                <p>The figures which are here given of various Azygobranchia are in most cases
                    sufficiently explained by the references attached to them. As an excellent
                    general type of the nervous system, attention may be directed to that of
                    Paludina drawn in fig. 21. On the whole, the ganglia are strongly individualized
                    in the Azygobranchia, nerve-cell tissue being concentrated in the ganglia and
                    absent from the cords (contrast with Zygobranchia and Isopleura). At the same
                    time, the junction of the visceral loop above the intestine prevents in all
                    Streρto-neura the shortening of the visceral loop, and it is rare to find a
                    fusion of the visceral ganglia with either pleural, pedal, or cerebral—a fusion
                    which can and does take place where the visceral loop is not above but below the
                    intestine, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the Euthyneura (fig. 67),
                    Cephalopoda(fig. 112), and Lamellibranchia (fig. 144). As contrasted with the
                    Zygobranchia and the Isopleura, we find that in the Azygobranchia the pedal
                    nerves are distinctly nerves given off from the pedal ganglia, rather than
                    cord-like nerve-tracts containing both nerve-cells or ganglionic elements and
                    nerve-fibres. Yet in some Azygobranchia (Paludina) a lad-1 der-like arrangement
                    of the two pedal nerves and their lateral branches has been detected (30). The
                    histology of the nervous system of Mollusca has yet to be seriously inquired
                    into.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal of the Azygobranchia presents little diversity of character,
                    except in so far as the buccal region is concerned. Salivary glands are present,
                    and in some carnivorous forms (Dolium) these secrete free sulphuric<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n679/mode/1up"

                    secretion), which assists the animal in boring holes by means of its rasping
                    tongue through the shells of other Molluscs upon which it preys. A crop-like
                    dilatation of the gut and a recurved intestine, embedded in the compact
                    yellowish-brown liver, the ducts of which open into it, form the rest of the
                    digestive tract and occupy a large bulk of the visceral hump. The buccal region
                    presents a pair of shelly jaws placed laterally upon the lips, and a wide range
                    of variation in the form of the denticles of the lingual ribbon or radula, the
                    nature of which will be understood by a reference to fig. 9, whilst the
                    systematic list of families given above shows the particular form of dentition
                    characteristic of each division of the order.</p>
                <p>The modification in the form of the snout upon which the mouth is placed, leading
                    to the distinction of “proboscidiferous” and “rostriferous” Gastropods, requires
                    further notice. The condition usually spoken of as a “proboscis” appears to be
                    derived from the condition of a simple rostrum (having the mouth at its
                    extremity) by the process of <hi rend="italic">incomplete introversion</hi> of
                    that simple rostrum.</p>
                <p>There is no reason in the actual significance of the word why the term
                    “proboscis” should be applied to an alternately introversible and eversible tube
                    connected with an animal’s body, and yet such is a very customary use of the
                    term. The introversible tube may be completely closed, as in the “proboscis” of
                    Nemertean worms, or it may have a passage in it leading into a non-eversible
                    oesophagus, as in the present case, and in the case of the eversible pharynx of
                    the predatory Chaetopod worms. The diagrams here introduced (fig. 48) are
                    intended to show certain important distinctions which obtain amongst the various
                    “introverts,” or intro-and e-versible tubes so frequently met with in animal
                    bodies. Supposing the tube to be completely introverted and to commence its
                    eversion, we then find that eversion may take place, either by a forward
                    movement of the side of the tube near its attached base, as in the proboscis of
                    the Nemertine worms, the pharynx of Chaetopods, and the eye-tentacle of
                    Gastropods, or, by a forward movement of the inverted apex of the tube, as in
                    the proboscis of the Rhabdoccel Planarians, and in that of Gastropods here under
                    consideration. The former case we call “pleurecbolic” (fig. 48, A, B, C, H, I,
                    K), the latter “acrecbolic” tubes or introverts (fig. 48, D, E, F, G). It is
                    clear that, if we start from the condition of full eversion of the tube and
                    watch the process of introversion, we shall find that the pleurecbolic variety
                    is introverted by the apex of the tube sinking inwards; it may be called
                    acrembolic, whilst conversely the acrecbolic tubes are pleurembolic. Further, it
                    is obvious enough that the process either of introversion or of eversion of the
                    tube may be arrested at any point, by the development of fibres connecting the
                    wall of the introverted tube with the wall of the body, or with an axial
                    structure such as the oesophagus; on the other hand, the range of movement of
                    the tubular introvert may be unlimited or complete. The acrembolic proboscis or
                    frontal introvert of the Nemertine worms has a complete range. So has the
                    acrembolic pharynx of Chaetopods, if we consider the organ as terminating at
                    that point where the jaws are placed and the oesophagus commences. So too the
                    acrembolic eye-tentacle of the snail has a complete range of movement, and also
                    the pleurembolic proboscis of the Rhabdocoel prostoma. The introverted rostrum
                    of the Azygobranch Gastropods presents in contrast to these a limited range of
                    movement. The “introvert” in these Gastropods is not the pharynx as in the
                    Chaetopod worms, but a prae-oral structure, its apical limit being formed by the
                    true lips and jaws, whilst the apical limit of the Chaetopod’s introvert is
                    formed by the jaws placed at the junction of pharynx and oesophagus, so that the
                    Chaetopod’s introvert is part of the stomodaeum or fore-gut, whilst that of the
                    Gastropod is external to the alimentary canal altogether, being in front of the
                    mouth, not behind it, as is the Chaetopod’s. Further, the Gastropod’s introvert
                    is pleurembolic (and therefore acrecbolic), and is limited both in eversion and
                    in introversion; it can not be completely everted owing to the muscular bands
                    (fig. 48, G), nor can it be fully introverted owing to the bands (fig. 48, F)
                    which tie the axial pharynx to the adjacent wall of the apical part of the
                    introvert. As in all such intro-and e-versible organs, eversion of the Gastropod
                    proboscis is effected by pressure communicated by the muscular body-wall to the
                    liquid contents (blood) of the body-space, accompanied by the relaxation of the
                    muscles which directly pull upon either the sides or the apex of the tubular
                    organ. The inversion of the proboscis is effected directly by the contraction of
                    these muscles. In various members of the Azygobranchia the mouth-bearing
                    cylinder is introversible <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> is a <hi rend="italic"

                    mantle-skirt. On the other hand, many which have a siphonate mantle-skirt are
                    not provided with an introversible mouth-bearing cylinder, but have a simple

                    the mouth-bearing region in nearly all other Gastropoda. One of the best
                    examples of the introversible mouth-cylinder or proboscis which can be found is
                    that of the Common Whelk and its immediate allies. In fig. 37 the proboscis is
                    seen in an everted state; it is only so carried when feeding, being withdrawn
                    when the animal is at rest. Probably its use is to enable the animal to
                    introduce its rasping and licking apparatus into very narrow apertures for the
                    purpose of feeding, e.y., into a small hole bored in the shell of another
                    Mollusc.</p>
                <p>The foot of the Azygobranchia, unlike the simple muscular disc of the Isopleura
                    and Zygobranchia, is very often divided into lobes, a fore, middle, and hind
                    lobe (pro-, meso-, and meta-podium, see figs. 39 and 43). Very usually, but not
                    universally, the meta-podium carries an operculum. The division of the foot into
                    lobes is a simple case of that much greater elaboration or breaking up into
                    processes and regions which it undergoes in the class Cephalopoda. Even among
                    some Gastropoda (viz., the Opisthobranchia), we find the lobation of the foot
                    still further carried out by the development of lateral lobes, the epipodia,
                    whilst there are many Azygobranchia, on the other hand, in which the foot has a
                    simple oblong form without any trace of lobes.</p>
                <p>The development of the Azygobranchia from the egg has been followed in several
                    examples, e.y., Paludina, Purpura, Nassa, Vermetus, Neritina. As in other
                    Molluscan groups, we find a wide variation in the early process of the formation
                    of the first embryonic cells, and their arrangement as a Diblastula dependent on
                    the greater or less amount of food-yelk which is present in the egg-cell when it
                    commences its embryonic changes. In fig. 7, the early stages of <hi
                    rend="italic">Paludina</hi><hi rend="italic">vivipara</hi> are represented.
                    There is but very little food-material in the egg of this Azygobranch, and
                    consequently the Diblastula forms by invagination; the blastopore or orifice of
                    invagination coincides with the anus, and never closes entirely. A well-marked
                    Trochosphere is formed by the development of an equatorial ciliated band; and
                    subsequently, by the disproportionate growth of the lower hemisphere, the
                    Trochosphere becomes a Veliger. The primitive shell-sac or shell-gland is well
                    marked at this stage, and the pharynx is seen as a new ingrowth (the
                    stomodaeum), about to fuse with and open into the primitively invaginated
                    arch-enteron (fig. 7, F).</p>
                <p>In other Azygobranchs (and such variations are representative for all Mollusca,
                    and not characteristic only of Azygobranchia), we find that there is a very
                    unequal division of the egg-cell at the commencement of embryonic development,
                    as in Nassa (fig. 5). Consequently there is strictly speaking no invagination
                    (emboly), but an overgrowth (epiboly) of the smaller cells to enclose the
                    larger. The general features of this process and of the relation of the
                    blastopore to mouth and anus have been explained above in treating of the
                    development of Mollusca generally. In such cases the blastopore may entirely
                    close, and both mouth and anus develop as new ingrowths (stomodaeum and
                    proctodaeum), whilst, according to the observations of Bobretzky, the closed
                    blastopore may coincide in position with the mouth in some instances (Nassa,
                    &lt;fcc.), instead of with the anus. But in these epibolic forms, just as in the
                    embolic Paludina, the embryo proceeds to develop its ciliated band and
                    shell-gland, passing through the earlier condition of a Trochosphere to that of
                    the Veliger. In the veliger stage many Azygobranchia (Purpura, Nassa, &lt;fcc.)
                    exhibit, in the dorsal region behind the head, a contractile area of the
                    body-wall. This acts as a larval heart, but ceases to pulsate after a time.
                    Similar rhythmically contractile areas are found on the foot of the embryo
                    Pulmonate Limax and on the yelk-sac (distended foot-surface) of the Cephalopod
                    Loligo (see fig. 72**).</p>
                <p>The history of the shell in the development of Azygobranchia (and other
                    Gastropods) is important. Just as the primitive shell-sac aborts and gives place
                    to a cap-like or boat-like shell, so in some cases (Marsenia, Krohn) has this
                    first shell been observed to be shed, and a second shell of different shape is
                    formed beneath it.</p>
                <p>A detailed treatment of what is known of the histogenesis in relation to the
                    cell-layers in these Mollusca would take us far beyond the limits of this
                    article, which aims at exposing only the well-ascertained characteristic
                    features of the Mollusca and the various subordinate groups. There is still a
                    great deficiency in our knowledge of the development of the Gastropoda, as
                    indeed of all classes of animals. The development of the gill (ctenidium) as
                    well as of the renal organ, and details as to the process of torsion of the
                    visceral hump, are still quite insufficiently known.</p>
                <p>One further feature of the development of the Azygobranchia deserves special
                    mention. Many Gastropoda deposit their eggs, after fertilization, enclosed in
                    capsules; others, as Paludina, are viviparous; others, again, as the
                    Zygobranchia, agree with the Lamellibranch Conchifera (the Bivalves) in having
                    simple exits for the ova without glandular walls, and therefore discharge their
                    eggs unenclosed in capsules freely into the sea-water; such unencapsuled eggs
                    are merely enclosed each in its own delicate chorion. When egg-capsules are
                    formed they are often of large size, have tough walls, and in each capsule are
                    several eggs floating in a viscid fluid. In some cases all the eggs in a capsule
                    develop; in other cases one egg only in a capsule (Neritina), or a small
                    proportion (Purpura, Buccinum), advance in development; the rest are arrested
                    either after the first process of cell-division (cleavage) or before that
                    process. The arrested embryos or eggs are then swallowed and digested by those
                    in the same capsule which have advanced in development. The details of this
                    history require renewed study, our present knowledge of it being derived from
                    the works of Koren and Danielssen, Carpenter and Claparède. In any case it is
                    clearly the same process in essence as that of the formation of a vitellogenous
                    gland from part of the primitive ovary, or of the feeding of an ovarian egg by
                    the absorption of neighbouring potential eggs; but here the period at which the
                    sacrifice of one egg to another takes place is somewhat late. What it is that
                    determines the arrest of some eggs and the progressive development of others in
                    the same capsule is at present unknown.</p>

                    which have the form and texture of the body adapted to a free-swimming pelagic
                    habit. They appear to be derived from holochlamydic forms of Reptant
                    Azygobranchia. The foot takes the form of a swimming organ. The nervous system
                    and sense-organs (eyes, otocysts, ami osphradium) are highly developed. The
                    odontophore also is remarkably developed, its admedian teeth being mobile, and
                    it serves as an efficient organ for attacking other pelagic forms upon which the
                    Natantia prey. The sexes are distinct as in all Streptoneura; and genital ducts
                    and accessory glands and pouches are present as in all Azygobranchia. The
                    Natantia exhibit a series of modifications of the form and proportions of the
                    visceral mass and foot, leading from a condition readily comparable with that of
                    a typical Azygobranch such as Rostellaria, with the three regions of the foot
                    (pro-, meso-, and meta-podium) strongly marked, and a coiled visceral hump of
                    the usual proportions, up to a condition in which the whole body is of a
                    tapering cylindrical shape, the foot a platelike vertical fin, and the visceral
                    hump almost completely atrophied. Three steps of this modification may be

                    viz., as a special branch or section of the Azygobranchia, related to them
                    somewhat as are the Birds to the Reptiles. They are true Azygobranchia which
                    have taken to a pelagic life, and the peculiarities of structure which they
                    exhibit are strictly adaptations of the structure common to them and the
                    Azygobranchia consequent upon their changed mode of life. Such adaptations are
                    the transparency and colourlessness of the tissues, and the modifications of the
                    foot, which still shows in Atlanta the form common in Azygobranchia (compare
                    fig. 49 and fig. 39).</p>
                <p>The cylindrical body of Ptcrotracheacea is paralleled by the slug-like forms of
                    Euthyneura. Spengel has shown that the visceral loop of the Natantia is
                    Streptoneurous. Special to the Natantia is the high elaboration of the lingual
                    ribbon, and, as an agreement with some of the Opistho-branchiate Euthyneura but
                    as a difference from the Azygobranchia, we find the otocysts closely attached to
                    the cerebral ganglia. This is, however, less of a difference than it was at one
                    time supposed to be, for it has been shown by Lacaze Duthiers, and also by
                    Leydig, that the otocysts of Azygobranchia even when lying close upon the pedal
                    ganglion (as in fig. 21) yet receive their special nerve (which can sometimes be
                    readily isolated) from the cerebral ganglion (see fig. 36). Accordingly the
                    difference is one of position of the otocyst and not of its nerve-supply. The
                    Natantia are further remarkable for the high development of their cephalic eyes,
                    and for the typical character of their osphradium (Spengel’s olfactory organ).
                    This is a groove, the edges of which are raised and ciliated, lying near the
                    branchial plume in the genera which possess that organ, whilst in Firuloides,
                    which has no branchial plume, the osphradium occupies a corresponding position.
                    Beneath the ciliated groove is placed an elongated ganglion (olfactory ganglion)
                    connected by a nerve to the supra-intestinal (therefore the primitively dextral)
                    ganglion of the long visceral nerve-loop, the strands of which cross one
                    another,—this being characteristic of Streptoneura (Spengel).</p>
                <p>The Natantia belong to the “pelagic fauna” occurring near the surface in the
                    Mediterranean and great oceans in company with the Pteropoda, the Siphonophorous
                    Hydrozoa, Salpae, Leptocephali, and other specially-modified transparent
                    swimming representatives of various groups of the animal kingdom. In development
                    they pass through the typical trochosphere and veliger stages provided with

                    being below, and not above, the intestine as it is in Streptoneura. Although the
                    anus is not brought so far forward by the visceral torsion as in the
                    Streptoneura, and may even by <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> growth assume a
                    posterior median position, yet, as fully developed, an asymmetry has resulted as
                    in the Azygobranchia, only the original right renal organ, right ctenidium (if
                    any), right osphradium, right side of the heart, and right genital ducts being
                    retained. All the Euthyneura are hermaphrodite. The lingual ribbon has very
                    usually numerous fine denticles undifferentiated into series in each row. The
                    shell is light and little calcified; often it is not developed in the adult,
                    though present in the embryo. An operculum, often found in the embryo, is never
                    present in the adult (except in Tornatella, fig. 53). Many Euthyneura show a
                    tendency to, or a complete accomplishment of, the suppression of the mantleskirt
                    as well as of the shell, also of the ctenidium, and acquire at the same time a
                    more or less cylindrical (slug-like) form of body.</p>

                    and a small visceral hump, from the base of which projects on the right side a
                    short mantle-skirt. The anus is placed in such forms far back beyond the
                    mantle-skirt. In front of the anus, and only partially covered by the
                    mantle-skirt, is the ctenidium with its free end turned backwards. The heart
                    lies in front of, instead of to the side of, the attachment of the ctenidium,
                    —hence Opisthobranchia as opposed to “Prosobranchia,” which correspond to the
                    Streptoneura. A shell is possessed in the adult state by but few
                    Opisthobranchia, but all pass through a veliger larval stage with a nautiloid
                    shell (fig. 60). Many Opisthobranchia have by a process of atrophy lost the
                    typical ctenidium and the mantle-skirt, and have developed other organs in their
                    place. As in some Azygobranchia, the free margin of the mantle-skirt is
                    frequently reflected over the shell when a shell exists; and, as in some
                    Azygobranchia, broad lateral outgrowths of the foot (epipodia) are often
                    developed, which, as does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> occur in Azygobranchia, may

                    is very great, and renders their classification difficult. Two sections of the
                    order may be distinguished, according as the typical Molluscan mantle-skirt
                    (limbus pallialis) is or is not atrophied, and within each section certain

                    —</hi> The typical Molluscan mantle-skirt is atrophied in the adult. No shell is
                    present in the adult, though the dorsal integument may be strengthened by
                    calcareous spicules (Doris). The otocysts are not sessile on the pedal ganglia
                    as in other Gastropods, but, as in the Natantia Azygobranchia, lie close to the
                    cerebral ganglia. In one sub-order (Pygobranchia) the typical ctenidium appears
                    to be retained in a modified form; in the others special developments of the
                    body-wall take its place, or no special respiratory processes exist at all. The
                    general form of the body is slug-like, the foot and visceral hump being
                    coextensive, and a secondary bilateral symmetry is asserted by the usually
                    median (sometimes right-sided) dorsal position of the anus on the hinder part of

                    Opisthobranchia present the same wide range of superficial appearance as do the
                    Azygobranchiate Streptoneura, forms carrying well-developed spiral shells and
                    large mantleskirts being included in the group, together with flattened or
                    cylindrical sluglike forms. But in respect of the substitution of other parts
                    for the mantle-skirt and for the gill which the more degenerate Opisthobranchia
                    exhibit, this Order stands alone. Some Opisthobranchia are striking examples of
                    degeneration (some Haplomorpha), having none of those regions or processes of
                    the body developed which distinguish the archaic Mollusca from such flabworms as
                    the Dendrocoel Planarians. Indeed, were it not for their retention of the
                    characteristic odontophore we should have little or no indication that such
                    forms as Phyllirhoë and Limapontia really belong to the Mollusca at all. The
                    interesting little <hi rend="italic">Rhodope Veranyii,</hi> which has no
                    odontophore, has been associated by systematists both with these simplified
                    Opisthobranchs and with Rhabdocoel Planarians (29).</p>
                <p>In many respects the Sea-Hare (Aplysia) of which several species are known (some
                    occurring on the English coast), serves as a convenient example of the fullest
                    development of the organization characteristic of Opisthobranchia. The woodcut
                    (fig. 56) gives a faithful representation of the great mobility of the various
                    parts of the body. The head is well marked and joined to the body by a somewhat
                    constricted neck. It carries two pairs of cephalic tentacles and a pair of
                    sessile eyes. The visceral hump is low and not drawn out into a spire. The foot
                    is long, carrying the oblong visceral mass upon it, and projecting (as
                    metapodium) a little beyond it (∕). Laterally the foot gives rise to a pair of
                    mobile fleshy lobes, the epipodia <hi rend="italic">(ep),</hi> which can be
                    thrown up so as to cover in the dorsal surface of the animal. Such epipodia are
                    common, though by no means universal, among Opisthobranchia. The torsion of the
                    visceral hump is not carried out very fully, the consequence being that the anus
                    has a posterior position a little to the right of the median line above the
                    metapodium, whilst the branchial chamber formed by the overhanging mantle-skirt
                    faces the right side of the body instead of lying well to the front as in
                    Streptoneura and as in Pulmonate Euthyneura. The gill-plume which in Λplysia is
                    the typical Molluscan ctenidium is seen in fig.</p>

                <p>63 projecting from the branchial sub-pallial space. The relation of the delicate
                    shell to the mantle is peculiar, since it occupies an oval area upon the
                    visceral hump, the extent of which is indicated in fig.</p>
                <p>56, C, but may be better understood by a glance at the figures of the allied
                    genus Umbrella (figs. 54, 55), in which the margin of the mantle-skirt
                    coincides, just as it does in the Limpet, with the margin of the shell. But in
                    Aρlysia the mantle is reflected over the edge of the shell, and grows over its
                    upper surface so as to completely enclose it, excepting at the small central
                    area s where the naked shell is exposed. This enclosure of the shell is a
                    permanent development of the arrangement seen in many Streptoneura <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Pyrula, Ovulum, see figs. 38 and 41), where the border
                    of the mantle can be, and usually is, drawn over the shell, though it is
                    withdrawn (as it cannot be in Aplysia) when they are irritated. From the fact
                    that Aplysia commences its life as a free-swimming Veliger with a nautilo id
                    shell not enclosed in any way by the border of the mantle, it is clear that the
                    enclosure of the shell in the adult is a secondary process. Accordingly, the
                    shell of Aplysia must not be confounded with a primitive shell in its shell-sac,
                    such as we find realized in the shells of Chiton and in the plugs which form in
                    the remarkable transitory “shell-sac” or “shell-gland” of Molluscan embryos</p>
                <p>(see figs. 7, 68, and 72***). Aplysia, like other Mollusca, develops a primitive
                    shell-sac in its trochosphere stage of development (fig. 68), which disappears
                    and is succeeded by a nautiloid shell (fig. 60). This forms the nucleus of the
                    adult shell, and, as the animal grows, becomes enclosed by a reflexion of the
                    mantle-skirt.</p>
                <p>In reference to the possible comparison of the enclosed shell of Aplysia and its
                    allies with those of some Slugs and of Cuttle-fishes, the reader is referred to
                    the paragraphs dealing especially with those Molluscs. When the shell of an
                    Aplysia enclosed in its mantle is ' pushed well to the left, the sub-pallial
                    space is fully exposed as in fig. 63, and the various apertures of the body are
                    seen. Posteriorly we have the anus, in front of this the lobate gill-plume,
                    between the two (hence corresponding in position to that of the Azygobranchia)
                    we have the aperture of the renal organ. In front, near the anterior attachment
                    of the gillplume, is the osphradium (olfactory organ) discovered by Spengel,
                    yellowish in colour, in the typical position, and overlying an olfactory
                    ganglion with typical nerve-connexion (see fig.</p>
                <p>20). To the right of Spengel’s osphradium is the opening of a peculiar gland
                    which has, when dissected out, the form of a bunch of grapes; its secretion is
                    said to be poisonous. On the under side of the free edge of the mantle are
                    situated the numerous small cutaneous glands which, in the large <hi
                    rend="italic">Aplysia</hi><hi rend="italic">camelus</hi> (not in other species),
                    form the purple secretion which was known to the ancients. In front of the
                    osphradium is the single genital pore, the aperture of the common or
                    hermaphrodite duct. From this point there stretches forward to the right side of
                    the head a groove—the spermatic groove—down which the spermatic fluid passes. In
                    other Euthyneura this groove may close up and form a canal. At its termination
                    by the side of the head is the muscular introverted penis. In the hinder part of
                    the foot (not shown in any of the diagrams) is the opening of a large
                    mucous-forming gland very often found in the Molluscan foot.</p>

                <p>With regard to internal organization we may commence with the disposition of the
                    renal organ (nephridium), the external opening of which has already been noted.
                    The position of this opening and other features of the renal organ have been
                    determined recently by Mr. J. T. Cunningham, Fellow of University College,
                    Oxford, who writes as follows from Naples, February 1883 :—</p>
                <p>“There is considerable uncertainty with respect to the names of the species of
                    Aplysia. There are two forms which are very common in the Gulf of Naples, and
                    which I have used in studying the anatomy of the renal organ in the genus. One
                    is q <hi rend="superscript"> ,1</hi> ite black in colour, and measures when
                    outstretched eight or nine inches in length. The other is light brown and
                    somewhat smaller, its length usually not exceeding seven inches. The first is
                    flaccid and sluggish in its movements, and has not much power of contraction;
                    its epipodial lobes are enormously developed and extend far forward along the
                    body; it gives out when handled an abundance of purple liquid, which is derived
                    from cutaneous glands situated on the under side of the free edge of the mantle.
                    In the Zoological Station this form is known as <hi rend="italic">Ap.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">leporina</hi>; but according to Blochmann it is identical with <hi

                    forcibly when irritated; the secretion of the mantle-glands is not abundant, and
                    is milky white in appearance. The kidney has similar relations in both genera,
                    and is identical with the organ spoken of by many authors as the triangular
                    gland. Its superficial extent is seen when the folds covering the shell are cut
                    away and the shell removed; the external surface forms a triangle with its base
                    bordering the pericardium and its apex directed posteriorly and reaching to the
                    left-hand posterior corner of the shell-chamber. The dorsal surface of the
                    kidney extends to the left beyond the shell-chamber beneath the skin in the
                    space between the shell-chamber and the left epipodium.</p>

                    opened, the gill being turned over to the left, a part of the kidney is seen
                    beneath the skin between the attachment of the gill and the right epipodium
                    (fig. 63). On examination this is found to be the under surface of the posterior
                    limb of the gland, the upper surface of which has just been described as lying
                    beneath the shell. In the posterior third of this portion, close to that edge
                    which is adjacent to the base of the gill, is the external opening (fig. 63,
                    o).</p>
                <p>“When the pericardium is cut open from above in an animal otherwise entire, the
                    anterior face of the kidney is seen forming the posterior wall of the
                    pericardial chamber; on the deep edge of this face, a little to the left of the
                    attachment of the auricle to the floor of the pericardium, is seen a depression;
                    this depression contains the opening from the pericardium into the kidney.</p>
                <p>“To complete the account of the relations of the organ: the right anterior corner
                    can be seen superficially in the wall of the mantlechamber above the gill. Thus
                    the base of the gill passes in a slanting direction across the right-hand side
                    of the kidney, the posterior end being dorsal to the apex of the gland, and the
                    anterior end ventral to the right-hand corner.</p>
                <p>“As so great a part of the whole surface of the kidney lies adjacent to external
                    surfaces of the body, the remaining part which faces the internal organs is
                    small; it consists of the left part of the under surface; it is level with the
                    floor of the pericardium, and lies over the globular mass formed by the liver
                    and convoluted intestine.</p>
                <p>“Mere dissection does not give sufficient evidence concerning such communications
                    as these of the kidney in Aplysia. I studied the external opening by taking a
                    series of sections through the surrounding region of the gland; to demonstrate
                    the internal aperture injected a solution of Berlin blue into the pericardium;
                    it did not fill the whole kidney easily, but ran down into the part adjacent to
                    the base of the gill.”</p>
                <p>Thus the renal organ of Aplysia is shown to conform to the Molluscan type. The
                    heart lying within the adjacent pericardium has the usual form, a single auricle
                    and ventricle. The vascular system is not extensive, the arteries soon ending in
                    the well-marked spongy tissue which builds up the muscular foot, epipodia, and
                    dorsal body-wall.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal commences with the usual buccal mass; the lips are
                    cartilaginous, but not armed with horny jaws, though these are common in other
                    Opisthobranchs; the lingual ribbon is multidenticulate, and a pair of salivary
                    glands pour in their secretion. The oesophagus expands into a curious gizzard,
                    which is armed internally with large horny processes, some broad and thick,
                    others spinous, fitted to act as crushing instruments. From this we pass to a
                    stomach and a coil of intestine embedded in the lobes of a voluminous liver; a
                    caecum of large size is given off near the commencement of the intestine. The
                    liver opens by two ducts into the digestive tract.</p>
                <p>The generative organs lie close to the coil of intestine and liver, a little to
                    the left side. When dissected out they appear as represented in fig. 64. The
                    essential reproductive organ or gonad consists of both ovarian and testicular
                    cells (see fig. 65). It is an ovo-testis. From it passes a common or
                    hermaphrodite duct, which very soon becomes entwined in the spire of a gland—the
                    albuminiparous gland. The latter opens into the common duct at the point <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and here also is a small diverticulum of the duct <hi
                    rend="italic">y.</hi> Passing on, we find not far from the genital pore a
                    glandular spherical body (the spermatheca <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> opening by
                    means of a longish duct into the common duct, and then we reach the pore (fig.
                    63, Â·). Here the female apparatus terminates. But when the male secretion of
                    the ovo-testis is active, the seminal fluid passes from the genital pore along
                    the spermatic groove (fig. 63,) to the penis, and is by the aid of that
                    eversible muscular organ introduced into the genital pore of a second Aplysia,
                    whence it passes into the spermatheca,there to await the activity of the female
                    element of the ovo-testis of this second Aplysia. After an interval of some
                    days—possibly weeks—the ova of the second Aplysia commence to descend the
                    hermaphrodite duct; they become enclosed in a viscid secretion at the point
                    where the albuminiparous gland opens into the duct intertwined with it; and on
                    reaching the point where the spermathecal duct debouches they are impregnated by
                    the spermatozoa which escape now from the spermatheca and meet the ova.</p>
                <p>The development of Aplysia from the egg presents many points of interest from the
                    point of view of comparative embryology, but in relation to the morphology of
                    the Opisthobranchia it is sufficient to point to the occurrence of a
                    trochosphere and a veliger stage (fig. 60), and of a shell-gland or primitive
                    shell-sac (fig. 68, δ∙∕zs), which is succeeded by a nautiloid shell.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of Aplysia will be found on comparison of fig. 20, which
                    represents it, with our schematic Mollusc (fig. 1, D) to present but little
                    modification. It is in fact a nervous system in which the great ganglion-pairs
                    are well developed and distinct. The Euthyneurous visceral loop is long, and
                    presents only one ganglion (in <hi rend="italic">Aplysia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >camelus,</hi> but two distinct ganglia joined to one another in <pb break="no"

                    extreme limit, representing both the right and left visceral ganglia and the
                    third or abdominal ganglion, which are so often separately present. The diagram
                    (fig. 20) shows the nerve connecting this abdomino-visceral ganglion with the
                    olfactory ganglion of Spengel. It is also seen to be connected with a more
                    remoteganglion—the genital. Such special irregularities in the development of
                    ganglia upon the visceral loop, and on one or more of the main nerves connected
                    with it, are, as the figures of Molluscan nervous systems given in this article
                    show, very frequent. Our figure of the nervous system of Aplysia does not give
                    the small pair of buccal ganglia which are, as in all Glossophorous Molluscs,
                    present upon the nerves passing from the cerebral region to the odontophore.</p>
                <p>For a comparison of various Opisthobranchs, Aplysia will be found to present a
                    convenient starting-point. It is one of the more typical Opisthobranchs, that is
                    to say, it belongs to the section Palliata, but other members of the Palliata,
                    namely, Bulla and Tornatella (figs. 52 and 53), are less abnormal than Aplysia
                    in regard to their shells and the form of the visceral hump. They have naked
                    spirally-twisted shells which may be concealed from view in the living animal by
                    the expansion and reflexion of the epipodia, but are not enclosed by the mantle,
                    whilst Tornatella is remarkable amongst all Euthyneura for possessing an
                    operculum like that of so many Streptoneura.</p>
                <p>The great development of the epipodia seen in Aplysia is usual in Palliate
                    Opisthobranchs; it occurs also in Elysia (fig. 62, D) among Non-Falliata; in
                    Doris it seems probable that the mantle-like fold overhanging the foot is to be
                    interpreted as epipodium, the mantle-skirt being altogether absent, as shown by
                    the naked position of the gills and anus on the dorsal surface (figs. 61 and 62,
                    C). The whole surface of the body becomes greatly modified in those Non-Palliate
                    forms which have lost, not only the mantle-skirt and the shell, but also the
                    ctenidium. Many of these (Ceratonota) have peculiar processes developed on the
                    dorsal surface (fig. 62, A, B), or retain purely negative characters (fig. 62,
                    D). The chief modification υf internal organization presented by these forms, as
                    compared with Aplysia, is found in the condition of the alimentary canal. The
                    liver is no longer a compact organ opening by a pair of ducts into the median
                    digestive tract, but we find very numerous hepatic diverticula on a shortened
                    axial tract (fig. 66). These diverticula extend usually one into each of the
                    dorsal papillae or “cerata” when these are present. They are not merely
                    digestive glands, but are sufficiently wide to act as receptacles of food, and
                    in them the digestion of food proceeds just as in the axial portion of the
                    canal. A precisely similar modification of the liver or great digestive gland is
                    found in the Scorpions, where the axial portion of the digestive canal is short
                    and straight, and the lateral ducts sufficiently wide to admit food into the
                    ramifications of the gland there to be digested; whilst in the Spiders the gland
                    is reduced to a series of simple caeca.</p>
                <p>The typical character is retained by the heart, pericardium, and the
                    communicating nephridium or renal organ in all Opisthobranchs. An interesting
                    example of this is furnished by the fish-like transparent Phyllirhoë (fig. 58),
                    in which it is possible most satisfactorily to study in the living animal, by
                    means of the microscope, the course of the blood-stream, and also the
                    reno-pericardial communication. With reference to the existence of pores placing
                    the vascular system in open communication with the surrounding water, see the
                    paragraph as to Mollusca generally. In a form closely allied to Aplysia
                    (Pleurobranchus) such a pore leading outwards from the branchial vein has been
                    precisely described by Lacaze Duthiers. No such pore has been detected in
                    Aplysia. In many of the Non-Palliate Opisthobranchs the nervous system presents
                    a concentration of the ganglia (fig. 67), contrasting greatly with what we have
                    seen in Aplysia. Not only are the pleural ganglia fused to the cerebral, but
                    also the visceral to these (see in further illustration the condition attained
                    by the Pulmonate Limnaeus, fig. 22), and the visceral loop is astonishingly
                    short and insignificant (fig. 67, e'). That the parts are rightly thus
                    identified is probable from Spengel’s observation of the osphradium and its
                    nerve-supply in these forms; the nerve to that organ, which is placed somewhat
                    anteriorly—on the dorsal surface—being given off from the hinder part (visceral)
                    of the right compound ganglion—the fellowtothat markedAin fig. 67. The
                    Ceratonotous Opisthobranchs, amongst other specialities of structure, are stated
                    to possess (in some cases at any rate) apertures at the apices of the “cerata”
                    or dorsal papillae, which lead from the exterior into the hepatic caeca. This
                    requires confirmation. Some amongst them (Tergipes, Eolis) are also remarkable
                    for possessing peculiarly modified epidermic cells placed in sacs at the apices
                    of these same papillae, which resemble the “threadcells” of the Planarian
                    Flatworms and of the Coelentera. The existence of these thread-cells is
                    sufficiently remarkable, seeing that the Non-Palliate Opisthobranchs resemble in
                    general form and habit the Planarian worms, many of which also possess
                    thread-cells. But it is not conceivable that theirpresence is an indication of
                    genetic affinity between the two groups, rather they are instances of homoplasy.
                    The development of many Opisthobranchia has been examined— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.y.,</hi> Aplysia, Pleurobranchidium, Elysia, Polycera, Doris, Tergipes. All
                    pass through trochosphere and veliger stages, and in all a nautiloid or
                    boat-like shell is developed, preceded by a well-marked “shell-gland” (see figs.
                    60 and 68). The transition from the free-swimming veliger larva with its
                    nautiloid shell (fig. 60) to the adult form has not been properly observed, and
                    many interesting points as to the true nature of folds (whether epipodia or
                    mantle or velum) have yet to be cleared up by a knowledge of such development in
                    forms like Tethys, Doris, Phyllidia, &lt;fcc.</p>

                <p>As in other Molluscan groups, we find even in closely-allied genera (for
                    instance, in Aplysia and Pleurobranchidium, and other genera observed by

                    by emboly (fig. 7), others by epiboly (fig. 5); and in the later history of the
                    further development of the enclosed cells (arch-enteron) very marked variations
                    occur in closely-allied forms, due to the influence of a greater or less
                    abundance of food-material mixed with the protoplasm of the egg.</p>

                    Palliate Opisthobranchia by adaptation to a terrestrial life. The ctenidium is
                    atrophied, and the edge of the mantle-skirt is fused to the dorsal integument by
                    concrescence, except at one point which forms the aperture of the
                    mantle-chamber, thus converted into a nearly closed sac. Air is admitted to this
                    sac for respiratory and hydrostatic purposes, and it thus becomes a lung. An
                    operculum is never present; a contrast being thus afforded with the operculate
                    Pulmonate Streptoneura (Cyclostoma, &amp;c.), which differ in other essential
                    features of structure from the Pulmonata. The Pulmonata are, like the other
                    Euthyneura, hermaphrodite, with elaborately-developed copulatory organs and
                    accessory glands. Like other Euthyneura, they have very numerous small denticles
                    on the lingual ribbon. The ancestral Pulmonata appear to have retained both the
                    right and the left osphradia (SpengeΓs olfactory organs), since in some
                    (Planorbis, Auricularia) we find the single osphradium to be that of the
                    original left side, whilst in others (Limnaeus) it is that of the original right

                    >Pulmonata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The land-snails and slugs forming the
                    group Pulmonata are widely distinguished from a small set of teιτestrial
                    Azygobranchia, the Pneumonochlamyda (see above), at one time associated with
                    them on account of their mantle-chamber being converted, as in</p>
                <p>Pulmonata, into a lung, and the ctenidium or branchial plume aborted. The
                    Pneumonochlamyda (represented in England by the common genus Cyclostoma) have a
                    twisted visceral nerve-loop, an operculum on the foot, a complex rhipidoglossate
                    or taenioglossate radula, and are of distinct sexes <hi rend="italic">;
                    they</hi> are, in fact, Azygobranchiate Streptoneura. The Pulmonata have a
                    straight visceral nerve-loop, never an operculum (even in the embryo), and a
                    multidenticulate radula, the teeth being equi-formal; and they are
                    hermaphrodite. Some Pulmonata (Limnaeus, àc.) live in fresh-waters although
                    breathing air. The remarkable discovery has been made that in deep lakes such
                    Limnaei do not breathe air, but admit water to the lung-sac and live at the
                    bottom. The lung-sac serves undoubtedly as a hydrostatic apparatus in the
                    aquatic Pulmonata, as well as assisting respiration. It is not improbable that
                    here, and in other air-breathing animals, the hydrostatic function was the
                    primary one, and the respiratory a later development.</p>

                <p>The same general range of body-form is shown in Pulmonata as in the Natant
                    Azygobranchia and in the Opisthobranchia; at one extreme we have Snails with
                    coiled visceral hump, at the other cylindrical or flattened Slugs (see fig. C9).
                    Limpet-like forms are also found (fig. 71, Ancylus). The foot is always simple,
                    with its flat crawling surface extending from end to end, but in the embryo
                    Limnaeus (fig. 4, H) it shows a bilobed character, which leads on to the
                    condition characteristic of Pteropoda.</p>
                <p>The adaptation of the Pulmonata to terrestrial life has entailed little
                    modification of the internal organization. The vascular system appears to be
                    more complete in them than in other Gastropoda, fine vessels and even
                    capillaries being present in place of lacunae, in which arteries and veins find
                    their meetingpoint. The subject has not, however, been investigated by the
                    proper methods of recent histology, and our knowledge of it, as of the vascular
                    system of Molluscs generally, is most unsatisfactory. In one genus (Planorbis)
                    the plasma of the blood is coloured red by haemoglobin, this being the only
                    instance of the presence of this body in the blood of Glossophorous Mollusca,
                    though it occurs in corpuscles in the blood of the bivalves Area and Solen
                    (Lankester, 31).</p>
                <p>The generative apparatus of the Snail (Helix) may serve as an example of the
                    hermaphrodite apparatus common to the Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia (fig. 72*).
                    From the ovo-testis, which lies near the apex of the visceral coil, a common
                    hermaphrodite duct <hi rend="italic">v.e</hi> proceeds, which receives the duct
                    of the compact white albuminiparous gland <hi rend="italic">E.d.,</hi> and then
                    becomes much enlarged, the additional width being due to the development of
                    glandular folds, which are regarded as forming a uterus <hi rend="italic"
                    >u.</hi> Where these folds cease the common duct splits into two portions, a
                    male and a female. The male duct <hi rend="italic">v.d</hi> becomes fleshy and
                    muscular near its termination at the genital pore, forming the penis <hi
                    rend="italic">p.</hi> Attached to it is a diverticulum fl., in which the
                    spermatozoa which have descended from the ovo-testis are stored and modelled
                    into sperm ropes or spermatophores. The female portion of the duct is more
                    complex. Soon after quitting the uterus it is joined by a long duct leading from
                    a glandular sac, the spermatheca (7?./). In this duct and sac the spermatophores
                    received in copulation from another snail are lodged. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helix</hi><hi rend="italic">hortensis</hi> the spermatheca is simple. In other
                    species of Helix a second duct (as large in <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aspersa</hi> as the chief one) is given off from the spermathecal
                    duct, and in the natural state is closely adherent to the wall of the uterus.
                    This second duct has normally no spermathecal gland at its termination, which is
                    simple and blunt. But in rare cases in <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">aspersa</hi> a second spermatheca is found at the end of this
                    second duct. Tracing the widening female duct onwards we now come to the
                    openings of the digitate accessory glands <hi rend="italic">d, d,</hi> which
                    probably assist in the formation of the egg-capsule. Close to them is the
                    remarkable darbsac <hi rend="italic">ps,</hi> a thick-walled sac, in the lumen
                    of which a crystalline four-fluted rod or dart consisting of carbonate of lime
                    is found. It is supposed to act in some way as a stimulanv in copulation, but
                    possibly has to do with the calcareous covering of the eggcapsule. Other
                    Pulmonata exhibit variations of secondary importance in the details of this
                    hermaphrodite apparatus.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of Helix is not favourable as an example on account of the
                    fusion of the ganglia to form an almost uniform ring of nervous matter around
                    the oesophagus. The Pond-Snail (Limnaeus) furnishes, on the other hand, a very
                    beautiful case of distinct ganglia and connecting cords (fig. 22). The
                    demonstration which it affords of the extreme shortening of the Euthyneurous
                    visceral nerve-loop is most instructive and valuable for comparison "with and
                    explanation of the condition of the nervous centres in Cephalopoda, as also of
                    some Opisthobranchia. The figure (fig. 22) is sufficiently described in the
                    letterpress attached to it; the pair of buccal ganglia joined by the connectives
                    to the cerebrals are, as in most of our figures, omitted. Here we need only
                    further draw attention to the osphradium, discovered by Lacaze Duthiers (32),
                    and shown by Spengel to agree in its innervation with that organ in all other
                    Gastropoda. On account of the shortness of the visceral loop and the proximity
                    of the right visceral ganglion to the oesophageal nerve-ring, the nerve to the
                    osphradium and olfactory ganglion is very long. The position of the osphradium
                    corresponds more or less closely with that of the vanished right ctenidium, with
                    which it is normally associated. In Helix and Limax the osphradium has not been
                    described, and possibly its discovery might clear up the doubts which have been
                    raised as to the nature of the mantle-chamber of those genera. In Planorbis,
                    which is dexiotropic (as are a few other genera or exceptional varieties of
                    various Anisoρleurous Gastropods) instead of being leiotropic, the osphradium is
                    on the left side, and receives its nerve from the left visceral ganglion, the
                    whole series of unilateral organs being reversed. This is, as might be expected,
                    what is found to be the case in all “reversed” Gastropods. It is also the case
                    in the Pulmonate Auricula, which is leiotropic.</p>
                <p>The shell of the Pulmonata, though always light and delicate, is in many cases a
                    well-developed spiral “house,” into which the creature can withdraw itself; and,
                    although the foot possesses no operculum, yet in Helix the aperture of the shell
                    is closed in the winter by a complete lid, the “hybernaculum,” more or less
                    calcareous in nature, which is secreted by the foot. In Clausilia a peculiar
                    modification of this lid exists permanently in the adult, attached by an elastic
                    stalk to the mouth of the shell, and known as the “clausilium.” In Limnaeus the
                    permanent shell is preceded in the embryo by a well-marked shell-gland or
                    primitive shell-sac (fig. 72***), at one time supposed to be the developing
                    anus, but shown by Lankester to be identical with the “shell-gland” discovered
                    by him in other Mollusca (Pisidium, Pleurobranchidium, Neritina, &lt;fcc.). As
                    in other Gastropoda Anisopleura, this shell-sac may abnormally develop a plug of
                    chitonous matter, but normally it flattens out and disappears, whilst the
                    cap-like rudiment of the permanent shell is shed out from the dome-like surface
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n689/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0689-0662"/> of the visceral hump, in the centre of which the
                    shell-sac existed for a brief period.</p>
                <p>In Clausilia, according to the observations of Gegenbaur, the primitive shell-sac
                    does not flatten out and disappear, but takes the form of a flattened closed
                    sac. Within this closed sac a plate of calcareous matter is developed, and after
                    a time the upper wall of the sac disappears, and the calcareous plate continues
                    to grow as the nucleus of the permanent shell. In the slug Testacella (fig. 69,
                    C) the shell-plate never attains a large size, though naked. In other slugs,
                    namely, Limax and Arion, the shell-sac remains permanently closed over the
                    shell-plate, which in the latter genus consists of a granular mass of carbonate
                    of lime. The permanence of the primitive shell-sac in these slugs is a point of
                    considerable interest. It is clear enough that the sac is of a different origin
                    from that of Aplysia (described in the section treating of Opisthobranchia),
                    being primitive instead of secondary. It seems probable that it is identical
                    with one of the open sacs in which each shell-plate of a Chiton is formed, and
                    the series of plate-like imbrications which are placed behind the single
                    shell-sac on the dorsum of the curious slug, Plectrophorus, suggest the
                    possibility of the formation of a series of shell-sacs on the back of that
                    animal similar to those which we find in Chiton. Whether the closed primitive
                    shell-sac of the slugs (and with it the transient embryonic shell-gland of all
                    other Mollusca) is precisely the same thing as the closed sac in which the
                    calcareous pen or shell of the Cephalopod Sepia and its allies is formed, is a
                    further question, which we shall consider when dealing with the Cephalopoda. It
                    is important here to note that Clausilia furnishes us with an exceptional
                    instance of the <hi rend="italic">continuity</hi> of the shell or secreted
                    product of the primitive shell-sac with the adult shell. In most other Mollusca
                    (Anisopleurous Gastropods, Pteropods, and Conchifera) there is a want of such
                    continuity; the primitive shell-sac contributes no factor to the permanent
                    shell, or only a very minute knob-like particle (N^eritina and Paludina). It
                    flattens out and disappears before the work of forming the permanent shell
                    commences. And just as there is a break at this stage, so (as observed by Krohn
                    in Marsenia = Echinospira) there <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be a break at a
                    later stage, the nautiloid shell formed on the larva being cast, and a new shell
                    of a different form being formed afresh on the surface of the visceral hump. It
                    is, then, in this sense that we may speak of primary, secondary, and tertiary
                    shells in Mollusca, recognizing the fact that they <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be
                    merely phases fused by continuity of growth so as to form but one shell, or that
                    in other cases they <hi rend="italic">may</hi> be presented to us as separate
                    individual things, in virtue of the non-development of the later phases, or in
                    virtue of sudden changes in the activity of the mantlesurface causing the
                    shedding or disappearance of one phase of shell-formation before a later one is
                    entered upon.</p>
                <p>The development of the aquatic Pulmonata from the egg offers considerable
                    facilities for study, and that of Limnaeus has been elucidated by Lankester,
                    whilst Rabi has with remarkable skill applied the method of sections to the
                    study of the minute embryos of Planorbis. The chief features in the development
                    of Limnaeus are exhibited in the woodcuts (figs. 3, 4, and 72***). There is not
                    a very large amount of food-material present in the egg of this snail, and
                    accordingly the cells resulting from division are not so unequal as in many
                    other cases. The four cells first formed are of equal size, and then four
                    smaller cells are formed by division of these four so as to lie at one end of
                    the first four (the pole corresponding to that at which the “directive
                    corpuscles” <hi rend="italic">de</hi> are extruded and remain). The smaller
                    cells now divide and spread over the four larger cells (fig. 3); at the same
                    time a space</p>
                <p>—the cleavage cavity or blastocoel—forms in the centre of the mulberry-like mass.
                    Then the large cells recommence the process of division and sink into the hollow
                    of the sphere, leaving an elongated groove, the blastopore, on the surface (fig.
                    3, C, and fig, 4, G). The invaginated cells (derived from the division of the
                    four big cells) form the endoderm or arch-enteron; the outer cells are the
                    ectoderm. The blastopore now closes along the middle part of its course, which
                    coincides in position with the future “foot.” One end of the blastopore becomes
                    nearly closed, and an ingrowth of ectoderm takes place around it to form the
                    stomodaeum or fore-gut and mouth. The other extreme end closes, but the
                    invaginated endoderm cells remain in continuity with this extremity of the
                    blastopore, and form the “rectal peduncle” or “pedicle of invagination” of
                    Lankester (see also the account and figures (fig. 151, A) of the development of
                    the bivalve Pisidium), although the endoderm cells retain no contact with the
                    middle region of the now closed-up blastopore. The anal opening forms at a late
                    period by a very short ingrowth or proctodaeum coinciding with the blind
                    termination of the rectal peduncle (fig. 72***, <hi rend="italic">pi).</hi></p>

                    archenteron, partly to cells derived from the ectoderm, which at a very early
                    stage is connected by long processes with the invaginated endoderm, as shown in
                    fig. 3, D. The external form of the embryo goes through the same changes as in
                    other Gastropods, and is not, as was held previously to Lankester’s
                    observations, exceptional. When the middle and hinder regions of the blastopore
                    are closing in, an equatorial ridge of ciliated cells is formed, converting the
                    embryo into a typical “Trochosphere” (fig. 4, E, F).</p>
                <p>The foot now protrudes below the mouth (fig. 4), and the post-oral hemisphere of
                    the Trochosphere grows more rapidly than the anterior or velar area. The young
                    foot shows a bilobed form (fig. 4, D, ∕). Within the velar area the eyes and the
                    cephalic tentacles commence to rise up (fig. 4, D, 0, and on the surface of the
                    post-oral region is formed a caplike shell and an encircling ridge, which
                    gradually increases in prominence and becomes the freely depending mantleskirt.
                    The outline of the velar area becomes strongly emarginated and can be traced
                    through the more mature embryos to the cephalic lobes or labial processes of the
                    adult Limnaeus (fig. 70).</p>
                <p>This permanence of the distinction of the part known as the velar area through
                    embryonic life to the adult state is exceptional among Mollusca, and is
                    therefore a point of especial interest in Limnaeus. None of the figures of adult
                    Limnaeus in recent works on Zoology show properly the form of the head and these
                    velar lobes, and accordingly the figures here given have been specially sketched
                    for the present article. The increase of the visceral dome, its spiral twisting,
                    and the gradual closure of the space overhung by the mantle-skirt so as to
                    convert it into a lung-sac with a small contractile aperture, belong to stages
                    in the development later than any represented in our figures.</p>
                <p>We may now revert briefly to the internal organization at a period when the
                    Trochosphere is beginning to show a prominent foot growing out from the area
                    where the midregion of the elongated blastopore was situated, and having
                    therefore at one end of it the mouth and at the other the anus. Fig. 72***
                    represents such an embryo under slight compression as seen by transmitted light.
                    The ciliated band of the left side of the velar area is indicated by a line
                    extending from <hi rend="italic">v</hi> to <hi rend="italic">v</hi>; the foot

                    Pisidium, fig. 151), and its cells are swollen <hi rend="italic">(gs</hi> and

                    >entirely</hi> the liver in the adult; the intestine and stomach are formed from
                    the pedicle of invagination, whilst the pharynx, oesophagus, and crop form from
                    the stomodaeal invagination <hi rend="italic">ph.</hi> To the right (in the
                    figure) of the rectal peduncle is seen the deeply invaginated shell-gland ss,
                    with a secretion <hi rend="italic">sh</hi> protruding from it. The shell-gland
                    is destined in Limnaeus to become very rapidly stretched out, and to disappear.
                    Farther up, within the velar area, the rudiments of the cerebral nerve-ganglion
                    <hi rend="italic">ng</hi> are seen separating from the ectoderm. A remarkable
                    cord of cells having a position just below the integument occurs on each side of
                    the head. In the figure the cord of the left side is seen, marked <hi
                    rend="italic">re.</hi> This paired organ consists of a string of cells which are
                    perforated by a duct. The opening of the duct at either end is not known. Such
                    cannulated cells are characteristic of the nephridia of many worms, and it is
                    held that the organs thus formed in the embryo Limnaeus are embryonic nephridia.
                    The most important fact about them is that they disappear, and are in no way
                    connected with the typical nephridium of the adult. In reference to their first
                    observer they are conveniently called “Stiebel’s canals.” Other Pulmonata
                    possess, when embryos, Stiebel’s canals in a more fully-developed state, for
                    instance, the common slug Lιmax (fig. 72**, <hi rend="italic">pl·).</hi> Here
                    too they disappear during embryonic life. Further knowledge concerning them is
                    greatly needed. It is not clear whether there is anything equivalent to them in
                    the embryos of marine Gastropoda or other Mollusca, the ectodermal cells called
                    “embryonic renal organs” in some Gastropod embryos having only a remote
                    resemblance to them. The three pairs of transient embryonic nephridia of the
                    medicinal leech, the ciliated cephalic pits of Nemertines, and the anterior
                    nephridia of Gephyraeans, all suggest themselves for comparison with these
                    enigmatical canals.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Marine Pulmonata.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Whilst the
                    Pulmonata are essentially a terrestrial and fresh-water group, there is one
                    genus of slug-like Pulmonates which frequent the seacoast (Peronia, fig. 72),
                    whilst their immediate congeners (Onchidium) are found in marshes of brackish
                    water. Semper (33) has shown that these slugs have, in addition to the usual
                    pair of cephalic eyes, a number of eyes developed upon the dorsal integument.
                    These dorsal eyes are very perfect in elaboration, possessing lens, retinal
                    nerve-end cells, retinal pigment, and optic nerve. Curiously enough, however,
                    they differ from the cephalic Molluscan eye (for an account of which see fig.
                    118) in the fact that, as in the vertebrate eye, the filaments of the optic
                    nerve penetrate the retina, and are connected with the surfaces of the nerve-end
                    cells nearer the lens instead of with the opposite end. The significance of this
                    arrangement is not known, but it is important to note, as shown by Hensen,
                    Hickson, and others, that in the bivalves Pecten and Spondylus, which also have
                    eyes upon the mantle quite distinct from typical cephalic eyes, there is the
                    same relationship as in Onchidiadae of the optic nerve to the retinal cells
                    (fig. 145). In both Onchidiadae and Pecten the palliai eyes have probably been
                    developed by the modification of tentacles, such as coexist in an unmodified
                    form with the eyes. The Onchidiadae are, according to Semper, pursued as food by
                    the leaping fish Periophthalmus, and the dorsal eyes are of especial value to
                    them in aiding them to escape from this enemy.</p>

                    Thus a <hi rend="smallcaps">cylindrical form</hi> is attained by the mantle, and

                    The right serves as a genital duct, the left is apparently renal in function.
                    The <hi rend="smallcaps">liver</hi> (p) is large and bilobed, the lobes divided

                    (fig. 7 4, C) as well-marked cerebral, pleural, pedal, and visceral pairs the
                    typical pleural pair being closely joined to the cerebral. The visceral loop or
                    commissure is untwisted, that is to say, the Scaphopoda are <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >euthyneur-</hi> ous. <hi rend="smallcaps">Heart</hi> and distinct <hi

                    >gonads</hi> are either male or female, the sexes being distinct.</p>
                <p>The embyro is remarkable for developing five ciliated rings posterior to the
                    ciliated ring and tuft characteristic of the trochosphere larval condition of
                    Molluscs generally. These rings are comparable to those of the larva of
                    Pneumodermon (fig. 84), and like them disappear.</p>
                <p>The class Scaphopoda is not divisible into orders or families. It contains only
                    three genera: <hi rend="italic">Dentalium,</hi> I.. (figs. 73, 74); <hi
                    rend="italic">Siphonodentalium,</hi> Sars.; and <hi rend="italic">Entaluιm,</hi>
                    Dfr.</p>
                <p>They inhabit exclusively the sand on the sea-coast in depths of from 10 to 100
                    fathoms.</p>
                <p>It is worthy of remark that the Scaphopoda constitute among the Glossophora a
                    parallel to the sand-boring forms so common among the Lipocephala (such as Solen
                    and Mya). This parallelism is seen in the special mode of elongation of the
                    body, in the form of the foot, and in the tubular form of the mantle brought
                    about by the concrescence of its ventral margins, as in the Lipocephala
                    mentioned. The cylindrical shell of Dentalium is also comparable to the two
                    semi-cylindrical valves of the shell of Solen; or, better, to the tubular shell
                    of Aspergillum and Teredo. Nevertheless, it is necessary to consider the
                    Scaphopoda as standing far apart from the Lipocephala, and as having no special
                    genetic but only a homoplastic relationship to them, in consequence of their
                    possessing a well-developed odontophore, the characteristic organ of the
                    Glossophora never possessed by any Lipocephala.</p>

                    >bilateral symmetry</hi> predominates both in the external and internal organs
                    generally, though in many cases (especially the smaller forms) a one-sided
                    displacement of primitively median organs and a suppression of one of the
                    primitively paired organs is to be noted.</p>
                <p>An <hi rend="smallcaps">anterior, median,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >posterior</hi> region of the <hi rend="smallcaps">foot</hi> can be
                    distinguished (fig. 75, (4), (5), (6)), corresponding to but probably not
                    derived from the pro-, meso-, and meta-podium of Gastropoda. The fore-foot
                    invariably has the <hi rend="smallcaps">head merged</hi> into it, and grows up
                    on each side (right and left) of that part so as to surround the mouth, the two
                    upgrowths of the fore-foot meeting on the dorsal aspect of the snout,—whence the
                    name Cephalopoda. In the more typical forms of both branches of the class, the

                    Eurybia), or lengthy (Pneumodermon, Octopus); these may be beset with suckers or
                    hooks, or both. The mid-foot (fig. 75, <hi rend="italic">m∩</hi> is expanded
                    into a pair of muscular lobes right and left, which either are used for striking
                    the water like the wings of a butterfly (Pteropoda), or are bent round towards
                    one another so that their free margins meet and constitute a short tube,—the
                    siphon or funnel (Siphonopoda). The hind foot is either very small or
                    absent.</p>
                <p>A distinctive feature of the Cephalopoda is the <hi rend="smallcaps">absence</hi>
                    of anything like the <hi rend="smallcaps">torsion</hi> of the visceral mass seen
                    in the Anisopleurous Gastropoda, although as an exception this torsion occurs in
                    one family (the Limacinidae).</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">anus,</hi> although it may be a little displaced from
                    the median line, is (except in Limacinidae) approximately median and posterior.
                    The <hi rend="smallcaps">mantle-skirt</hi> may be aborted (Gymnosomatous
                    Pteropoda); when present it is deeply produced posteriorly, forming a large
                    sub-pallial chamber around the anus. As in our schematic Mollusc, by the side of
                    the anus are placed the single or paired apertures of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nephridia,</hi> the GENITAL <hi rend="smallcaps">apertures</hi> (paired only in

                    elongated (see fig. 75, (4), (5), (6)) in a direction almost at right angles to
                    the primary horizontal axis (A, P in fig. 75) of the foot.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">shell</hi> is frequently, but not invariably, secreted on
                    the visceral hump and mantle-skirt of Cephalopoda; but there are both Pteropoda
                    and Siphonopoda devoid of any shell. The shell is usually light in substance or
                    lightened by air-chambers in correlation with the free-swimming habits of the
                    Cephalopoda. It may be external, when it is box-like or boat-like, or internal,
                    when it is plate-like. Very numerous minute pigmented sacs capable of expansion
                    and contraction, and known as <hi rend="smallcaps">chromatophores,</hi> are
                    usually present in the integument in both branches of the class. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">gonads</hi> of both sexes are developed in one individual in
                    some Cephalopoda (Pteropoda), in others the sexes are separate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sense-organs,</hi> especially the cephalic eyes and the
                    otocysts, are very highly developed in the higher Cephalopoda. The osphradia
                    have the typical form and position in the lower forms, but appear to be more or
                    less completely replaced by other olfactory organs in the higher. The normal <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">nerve-ganglia</hi> are present, but the connectives are
                    shortened, and the ganglia concentrated and fused in the cephalic region. Large
                    special ganglia (optic, stellate, and supra-buccal) are developed in the higher
                    forms (Siphonopoda).</p>
                <p>The Cephalopoda exhibit a greater range from low to high organization than any
                    other Molluscan class, and hence they are difficult to characterize in regard to
                    several groups of organs; but they are definitely held together by the existence
                    in all of the encroachment of the fore-foot so as to surround the head, and by
                    the functionally important BILOBATION OF THE MID-FOOT.</p>
                <p>Two very distinct branches of the Cephalopoda are to be recognized: the one, the
                    Pteropoda, more archaic in the condition of its bilobed mid-foot, including a
                    number of minute, and in all probability degenerate, oceanic forms of simplified
                    and obscure organization; the other, the Siphonopoda, containing the Pearly
                    Nautilus and the Cutties, which have for ages (as their fossil remains show)

                    Cephalopoda in which the mid-region of the foot is (as compared with the
                    Siphonopoda) in its more primitive condition, being relatively largely developed
                    and drawn out into a paiι of wing-like muscular lobes (identical with the two
                    halves of the siphon of the Siphon opoda) which are used as paddles (see figs.
                    76-86). The hind-region of the foot is often aborted, but may carrj an operculum
                    (figs. 76, 77). The fore-region of the fool (that embracing the head) is also
                    often rudimentary, bul may be drawn out into one or more pairs of tentacles,
                    simulating cephalic tentacles, and provided with suckers (figs. 84, 85).</p>
                <p>Though the visceral hump is not twisted except in the Limacinidae (fig. 76),
                    there is a very general tendency to one-sided development of the viscera, and of
                    their external apertures (as contrasted with Siphonopoda). The ctenidia are
                    aborted, with the possible exception of the processes (fig. 85, c) at the end of
                    the body of Pneumodermon. The vascular system resembles that of the Gastropoda.
                    The nephridium is a single tubular body corresponding to the right nephridium of
                    the typical pair of the archi-MoIlusc. The anal aperture is usually placed a
                    little to the left of the median line, more rarely to the right. In the
                    Limacinidae it has an exceptional position, owing to the torsion of the visceral
                    mass, as in Anisopleurous Gastropoda.</p>

                <p>Jaws and a lingual ribbon are present as in typical Glossophora, the dentition of
                    the ribbon and the number of jaw-pieces presenting a certain range of variation.
                    Senseorgans are present in the form of cephalic eyes in very few forms
                    (Cavolinia, Clione, and in an undescribed form discovered by Suhm during the
                    “Challenger” Expedition); otocysts are universally present. The osphradia are
                    present in typical form, although the ctenidia are aborted; only one osphradium
                    (the right of the typical pair) is present (fig.</p>
                <p>87). The gonads are both male and female in the same individual. The genital
                    aperture is single. Copulatory organs, often of considerable size, are present
                    (fig. 86, z).</p>
                <p>The mantle-skirt is present in one division of the Pteropoda (Thecosomata), and
                    in these an extensive sub-pallial chamber is developed, the walls of which in
                    the absence of ctenidia have a branchial function. In a second division
                    (Gymnosomata), which comprises forms highly developed in regard to the processes
                    of the fore-foot, the mantle-skirt is aborted. A shell is developed on the
                    surface of the visceral hump and mantle-skirt of the Thecosomata, whilst in the
                    Gymnosomata, which have no mantle-skirt, there is in the adult animal no shell.
                    The embryo passes through a trochosphere and a veliger stage (fig. 81), provided
                    with boat-like shell, except in some Gymnosomata in which the Trochosphere with
                    its single velar ciliated band becomes metamorphosed into a larva which has
                    three additional ciliated bands but no velum (resembling the larva of the
                    &gt;Scaphopod Dentalium); this banded larva does <hi rend="italic">not</hi> form
                    a larval shell (fig. 84).</p>

                <p>Cephalopoda in which the two primarily divergent right and left lobes of the
                    mid-region of the foot have their free borders recurved towards the middle line,
                    where they are either held in apposition (Tetrabranchiata), or fused with one
                    another to form a complete cylinder open at each end (Dibranchiata). This
                    fissured or completely closed tube is the siphon (fig. 75, (6), <hi
                    rend="italic">mf)</hi> characteristic of the Siphonopoda, and is used to guide
                    the stream of water expelled by the contractions of the walls of the branchial
                    chamber. The palliai skirt is accordingly well developed and muscular,
                    subserving by its contractions not only respiration but locomotion. The visceral
                    hump is never twisted, and accordingly the main development of the palliai skirt
                    and chamber is posterior, the excretory apertures, anus, and gills having a
                    posterior position, as in the archi-Mollusc. At the same time the visceral hump
                    is usually much elongated in a direction corresponding to an oblique line
                    between the vertical dorso-ventral and the horizontal anteroposterior axes (see
                    fig. 75, (6)).</p>

                <p>The fore-part of the foot which surrounds the mouth, as in all Cephalopoda, is
                    drawn out into four or five pairs of lobes, sometimes short, but usually
                    elongated and even fili form. These lobes either carry peculiar sheathed
                    tentacles (Nautilus), or, on the other hand, acetabuliform suckers, whict may be
                    associated with claw-like hooks (Dibranchiata) The hind-foot is probably
                    represented by the valve whicl depends from the inneι wall of the siphon in many
                    cases.</p>
                <p>A shell (figs. 89, 100) is very generally present, affording protection to the
                    visceral mass and attachment for muscles. It may be external or enclosed in
                    dorsal upgrowing folds of the mantle, which (except in Spirula) close up at an
                    early period of development, so as to form a shut sac in which the shell is
                    secreted. The ctenidia are well developed as paired gill-plumes, serving as the
                    efficient branchial organs (figs. 101, 103, and fig. 2, B).</p>
                <p>The vascular system is very highly developed; the heart consists of a pair of
                    auricles and a ventricle (figs. 104, 105). Branchial hearts are formed on the
                    advehent vessels of the branchiae. It is not known to what extent the minute
                    subdivision of the arteries extends, or whether there is a true capillary
                    system.</p>
                <p>The pericardium is extended so as to form a very large sac passing among the
                    viscera dorsal wards and sometimes containing the ovary or testis—-the
                    viscero-ρericardial sac—which opens to the exterior either directly or through
                    the nephridia. It has no connexion with the vascular system. The nephridia are
                    always paired sacs, the walls of which invest the branchial advehent vessels
                    (figs. 104, 108). They open each by a pore into the viscero-</p>
                <p>pericardial sac except in Nautilus. The anal aperture is median and raised on a
                    papilla. Jaws (fig. 88, <hi rend="italic">e)</hi> and a lingual ribbon (fig.
                    107) are well developed. The jaws have the form of a pair of powerful beaks,
                    either horny or calcified (Nautilus), and are capable of inflicting severe
                    wounds.</p>

                <p>Sense-organs are highly developed; the eye exhibits a very special elaboration of
                    structure in the Dibranchiata, and a remarkable archaic form in the Nautilus.
                    Otocysts are present in all. The typical osphradium is not present, except in
                    Nautilus, but other organs are present in the cephalic region, to which an
                    olfactory function is ascribed both in Nautilus and in the other
                    Siphonopoda.</p>
                <p>The gonads are always separated in male and female individuals. The genital
                    aperture and duct is sometimes single, when it is the left; sometimes the
                    typical pair is developed right and left of the anus. The males of nearly all
                    Siphonopoda have been shown to be characterized by a peculiar modification of
                    the arm-like processes or lobes of the fore-foot, connected with the copulative
                    function. The term hectocotylιzatιon is applied to this modification (see figs.
                    88, 95, 96). Elaborate spermatophores or sperm-ropes are formed by all
                    Siphonopoda, and very usually the female possesses special capsule-forming and
                    nidamental glands for providing envelopes to the eggs (fig. 101, <hi
                    rend="italic">g.n.}.</hi> The egg of all Siphonopoda is large, and the
                    development is much modified by the presence of an excessive amount of
                    food-material diffused in the protoplasm of the egg-cell. Trochosphere and
                    veliger stages of development are consequently not recognizable.</p>
                <p>The Siphonopoda are divisible into two orders, the names of which (due to Owen)
                    describe the number of gill-plumes present; but in fact there are several
                    characters of as great importance as those derived from the gills by which the
                    members of these two orders are separated from one another.</p>
                <p>Order 1.—Tetrabranchiata ( = Schizosiphona, Tentaculifera).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Characters. —</hi> Siphonopodous Cephalopods in which the
                    inrolled lateral margins of the mid-foot are not fused, but form a siphon by
                    apposition (fig. 101). The circum-oral lobes of the fore-foot carry numerous
                    sheathed tentacles (not suckers) (fig. 88). There are two pairs of ctenidial
                    gills (hence Tetrabranchiata), and two pairs of nephridia, consequently four
                    nephridia! apertures (fig. 101). The viscero-pericardial chamber opens by two
                    independent apertures to the exterior and not into the nephridial sacs. There
                    are two oviducts (right and left) in the female and two spermducts in the male,
                    the left duct in both sexes being rudimentary.</p>
                <p>A large external shell either coiled or straight is present, and is not enclosed
                    by reflexions of the mantle-skirt, except such narrow-mouthed shells as that of
                    Gomυhoceras. which were probably enclosed by the mantle as in the Dibranch
                    Spirula. The shell consists of a series of chambers, the last formed of which is
                    occupied by the body of the animal, the hinder ones (successively deserted)
                    containing gas (fig. 89).</p>
                <p>The pair of cephalic eyes are hollow chambers (fig. 118, A) opening to the
                    exterior by minute orifices (pinhole camera), and devoid of refractive
                    structures. A pair of osphradia are present at the base of the gills (fig. 101,

                    inflected lateral margins of the mid-foot are fused so as to form a complete
                    tubular siphon (fig. 96, <hi rend="italic">ι).</hi> The circumoral lobes of the
                    fore-foot carry suckers disposed upon them in rows (as in the Pteropod
                    Pneumodermon), <hi rend="italic">not</hi> tentacles (see figs. 92, 95, 96).
                    There is a single pair of typical ctenidia (fig. 103) acting as gills (hence
                    Dibranchiata), and a single pair of nephridia opening by apertures right and
                    left of the median anus (fig. 103, r), and by similar internal pores into the
                    pericardial chamber, which consequently does not open directly to the surface as
                    in Nautilus. The oviducts are sometimes paired right and left (Octopoda),
                    sometimes that of one side only is developed (Decapoda, except Ommastrephes).
                    The sperm-duct is always single except, according to Keferstein, in <hi
                    rend="italic">Eledone moschata.</hi></p>
                <p>A plate-like shell is developed in a closed sac formed by the mantle (figs. 98,
                    99), except in the Octopoda, which have none, and in Spirula (fig. 100, D) and
                    the extinct Belemnitidae, which have a small chambered shell resembling that of
                    Nautilus with or without the addition of plate-like and cylindrical accessory
                    developments (fig. 100, C).</p>
                <p>The pair of cephalic eyes are highly-developed vesicles with a refractive lens
                    (fig. 120), cornea, and lid-folds,—the vesicle being in the embryo an open sac
                    like that of Nautilus (fig. 119). Osphradia are not present, but cephalic
                    olfactory organs are recognized. One or two pairs of large salivary glands with
                    long ducts are present. An ink-sac formed as a diverticulum of the rectum and
                    opening near the anus is present in all Dibranchiata (fig. 103, <hi
                    rend="italic">t),</hi> and has been detected even in the fossil Belemnitidae.
                    Branchial hearts are developed on the two branchial advehent bloodvessels (fig.
                    104, <hi rend="italic">vc', vi</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> y</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">).</hi></p>
                <p>The Dibranchiata are divisible into two sub-orders, according to the number and
                    character of the arm-like suckerbearing processes of the fore-foot.</p>
                <p>Suborder 1.— <hi rend="italic">Decapoda.</hi><hi rend="italic">Characters.—</hi>
                    Dibranchiata with the fore-foot drawn out into eight shorter and two longer arms
                    (prehensile arms), the latter being placed right and left between the third and
                    fourth shorter arms. The suckers are stalked and strengthened by a horny ring.
                    The eyes are large and have a horizontal in place of a sphincter-like lid. The
                    body is elongated and provided with lateral fins (lamelliform expansions of the
                    mantle). The mouth has a buccal membrane. The mantle-margin is locked to the
                    base of the siphon by a specially-developed cartilaginous apparatus. Numerous
                    water-pores are present in the head and anterior region of the body, leading
                    into recesses of the integument of unknown significance. The oviduct is single;
                    large nidamental glands are present. The viscero-pericardial space is large, and
                    lodges the ovary (Sepia). There is always a shell present which is enclosed by
                    the upgrowth of the mantle, so as to become “internal.”</p>

                    cartilaginous locking apparatus, and is always fused to the head dorsally by a
                    broad nuchal band. No buccal membrane surrounds the mouth. The siphon is devoid
                    of valves. The oviducts are paired; there are no nidamental glands. The
                    viscero-pericardial space is reduced to two narrow canals, passing from the
                    nephridia to the capsule of the genital gland. There is no shell on or in the
                    visceral hump.</p>

                    more precise conception of the organization of the Cephalopoda in a concrete
                    form we select the Pearly Nautilus for further description, and in passing its
                    structure in review we shall take the opportunity of comparing here and there
                    the peculiarities presented by that animal with those obtaining in allied forms.
                    In the last edition of this work the Pearly Nautilus was made the subject of a
                    detailed exposition by Professor Owen, and it has seemed accordingly appropriate
                    that it should be somewhat fully treated on the present occasion also. The
                    figures which illustrate the present description are (excepting fig. 89)
                    original, and prepared from dissections (made under the direction of the writer)
                    of a male and female <hi rend="italic">Nautilus pompilius,</hi> lately purchased

                <p><hi rend="italic">Visceral Hump and Shell.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The
                    visceral hump of Nautilus (if we exclude from consideration the fine siphuncular
                    pedicle which it trails, as it were, behind it) is very little, if at all,
                    affected by the coiled form of the shell which it carries, since the animal
                    always slips forward in the shell as it grows, and inhabits a chamber which is
                    practically cylindrical (fig. 89). Were the deserted chambers thrown off instead
                    of being accumulated behind the inhabited chamber as a coiled series of
                    air-chambers, we should have a more correct indication in the shell of the
                    extent and form of the animal’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n698/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0698-0671"/> body. Amongst Gastropods it is not very unusual
                    to find the animal slipping forward in its shell as growth advances and leaving
                    an unoccupied chamber in the apex of the shell. This may indeed become shut off
                    from the occupied cavity by a transverse septum, and a series of such septa may
                    be formed (fig. 42), but in no Gastropod are these apical chambers known to
                    contain a gas during the life of the animal in whose shell they occur. A further
                    peculiarity of the Nautilus shell and of that of the allied extinct Ammonites,
                    Scaphites, Orthoceras, &lt;fcc., and of the living Spirula, is that the series
                    of deserted air-chambers are traversed by a cord-like pedicle extending from the
                    centro-dorsal area of the visceral hump to the smallest and first-formed chamber
                    of the series. No structure comparable to this siphuncular pedicle is known in
                    any other Mollusca. Its closest representative is found in the so-called
                    “contractile cord” of the remarkable form Rhabdopleura, referred according to
                    present knowledge to the Polyzoa. There appears to be no doubt that the deserted
                    chambers of the Nautilus shell contain in * the healthy living animal a gas
                    which serves to lessen the specific gravity of the whole organism. The gas is
                    said to be of the same composition as the atmosphere, with a larger proportion
                    of nitrogen. With regard to its origin we have only conjectures. Each septum
                    shutting off an air-containing chamber is formed during a period of quiescence,
                    probably after the reproductive act, when the visceral mass of the Nautilus may
                    be slightly shrunk, and gas is secreted from the dorsal integument so as to fill
                    up the space previously occupied by the animal. A certain stage is reached in
                    the growth of the animal when no new chambers are formed. The whole process of
                    the loosening of the animal in its chamber and of its slipping forward when a
                    new septum is formed, as well as the mode in which the air-chambers may be used
                    as a hydrostatic apparatus, and the relation to this use, if any, of the
                    siphuncular pedicle, is involved in obscurity, and is the subject of much
                    ingenious speculation. In connexion with the secretion of gas by the animal,
                    besides the parallel cases ranging from the Protozoon Arcella to the
                    Physoclistic Fishes, from the Hydroid Siphonophora to the insect-larva Corethra,
                    we have the identical phenomenon observed in the closely-allied Sepia when
                    recently hatched. Here, in the pores of the internal rudimentary shell, gas is
                    observable, which has necessarily been liberated by the tissues which secrete
                    the shell, and not derived from any external source (Huxley).</p>
                <p>The coiled shell of Nautilus, and by analogy that of the Ammonites, is peculiar
                    in its relation to the body of the animal, inasmuch as the curvature of the coil
                    proceeding from the centro-dorsal area is towards the head or forward, instead
                    of away from the head and backwards as in other discoid coiled shells such as
                    Planorbis; the coil is in fact absolutely reversed in the two cases. Amongst the
                    extinct allies of the Nautilus (Tetrabranchiata) we find shells of a variety of
                    shapes, open coils such as Scaphites, leading on to perfectly cylindrical shells
                    with chamber succeeding chamber in a straight line (Orthoceras), whence again wc
                    may pass to the cork-screw spires formed by the shell of Turrilites.</p>
                <p>Whilst the Tetrabranch iata, so far as we can recognize their remains, are
                    characterized by these large chambered shells, which, as in Nautilus, were with
                    the exception of some narrow-mouthed forms such as Gomphoceras but very
                    partially covered by reflexions of the mantle-skirt (fig. 89, <hi rend="italic"
                    >b),</hi> the Dibranchiata present an interesting series of gradations, in which
                    we trace— (a) the diminution in relative size of the chambered shell; (δ) its
                    complete investiture by reflected folds of the mantle (Spirula, fig. 100, D):

                    definitely-closed shell-sac; (J) the secretion by these mantle-folds or walls of
                    the shell-sac of additional laminae of calcareous shellsubstance, which invest
                    the original shell and completely alter its appearance (Spirulirostra, fig. 100,
                    C; Belemnites); (e) the gradual dwindling and total disappearance of the
                    original chambered shell, and survival alone of the calcareous laminae deposited
                    by the inner walls of the sac (Sepia, fig. 100, B); (∕) the disappearance of all
                    calcareous substance from the pen or plate which now represents the contents of
                    the shell-sac, and its persistence as a horny body simply (Loligo, fig. 99);
                    (&lt;∕) the total disappearance of the shell-sac itself, and consequently of its
                    pen or plate, nevertheless the rudiments of the shell-sac appearing in the
                    embryo and then evanescing (Octopus). The early appearance of the sac of the
                    mantle in which the shell is enclosed, in Dibranchiata, has led to an erroneous
                    identification of this sac with the primitive shell-sac of the archiMollusc
                    (fig. 1), of Chiton (fig. 10, A), of Arion (fig. 69, D, <hi rend="italic"
                    >a),</hi> and of the normally-developing Molluscan embryo (figs. 68 and 72***,
                    ∙s√⅛). The first appearance of the shell-sac of Dibranchiata is seen in figs.
                    121 and 122, its formation as an open upgrowth of the centro-dorsal area of the
                    embryo having been demonstrated by Lankester (34) in 1873, who subsequently
                    showed (35) that the same shell-sac appears and disappears without closing up in
                    Argonauta and Octopus, and pointed out the distinctness of this sac and the
                    primitive shell-gland. The shell of the female Argonauta is not formed by the
                    visceral hump, but by the enlarged arms of the foot, which are in life always
                    closely applied to it.</p>
                <p>The shell of such Pteropoda as have shells (the Thecosomata) is excessively
                    light, and fits close to the animal, no air-chambers being formed. It is
                    important to note that in this division of the Cephalopoda there is the same
                    tendency, which is carried so far in the Dibranchiate Siphonopods, for the
                    mantle-skirt to be reflected over and closely applied to the shell <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Cavolinia, figs. 79 and 80). But in Pteropoda there is
                    no complete formation of a closed sac by the reflected mantle, no thickening of
                    the enclosed shell, no dwindling of the original shell and substitution for it
                    of a laminated plate. The variety of form of the glass-like shells of Pteropoda
                    is a peculiarity of that group.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Head, Foot, Mantle-skirt, and Sub-pallial Chamber.—</hi> In the
                    Pearly Nautilus the ovoid visceral hump is completely encircled by the free flap
                    of integument known as mantleskirt (fig. 91, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> e). In
                    the antero-dorsal region this flap is enlarged so as to be reflected a little
                    over the coil of the shell which rests on it. In the postero-ventral region the
                    flap is deepest, forming an extensive sub-pallial chamber, at the entrance of
                    which <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is placed in fig. 91. A view of the interior of
                    the sub-pallial chamber, as seen when the mantle-skirt is retroverted and the

                    compared the similar view of the sub-pallial chamber of the Dibranchiate Sepia
                    (fig. 103). It should be noted as a difference between Nautilus and the
                    Dibranchiates that in the former the nidamental gland (in the female) lies on
                    that surface of the palliai chamber formed by the dependent mantle-flap (figs.
                    101, <hi rend="italic">g.n.</hi>; 89, F), whilst in the latter it lies on the
                    surface formed by the body-wall; in fact in the former the base of the fold
                    forming the mantle-skirt comprises in its area a part of what is unreflected
                    visceral hump in the latter.</p>
                <p>The apertures of the two pairs of nephridia, of the viscero-pericardial sac, of
                    the genital ducts, and of the anus are shown in position on the body-wall of the
                    palliai charnier of Nautilus in figs. 101, 102. There are nine apertures in all,
                    one median (the anus), and four paired. Besides these apertures we notice <hi
                    rend="italic">two</hi> pairs of gill-plumes which are undoubtedly typical
                    ctenidia, and a short papilla (the osphradium) between each anterior and
                    posterior gill-plume (see figs. 101, 102, and explanation). As compared with
                    this in a Dibranchiate, we find (fig. 103) only four aper tures, viz., the
                    median anus with adjacent orifice of the ink-sac, the single pair of nephridial
                    apertures, and one asymmetrical genital aperture (on the left side), except in
                    female Octopoda and a few others where the genital ducts and their apertures are
                    paired. No viscero-pericardial pores are present on the surface of the palliai
                    chamber, since in the Dibranchiata the viscero-pericardial <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n700/mode/1up"

                    of directly to the surface. A single pair of ctenidia (gillplumes) is present
                    instead of the two pairs in Nautilus. The existence of two pairs of ctenidia and
                    of two pairs of nephridia in Nautilus, placed one behind the other, is highly
                    remarkable. The interest of this arrangement is in relation to the general
                    morphology of the Mollusca, for it is impossible to view this repetition of
                    organs in a linear series as anything else than an instance of metameric
                    segmentation, comparable to the segmentation of the ringed worms and Arthropods.
                    The only other example which we have of this metamerism in the Mollusca is
                    presented by the Chitons. There we find not two pairs of ctenidia merely, but
                    sixteen pairs (in some species more) accom panied by a similar metamerism of the
                    dorsal integument, which carries eight shells. In Chiton the nephridia are not
                    affected by the metamerism as they are in Nautilus. It is impossible on the
                    present occasion to discuss in the way which their importance demands the
                    significance of these two instances among Mollusca of incomplete or partial
                    metamerism; but it would be wrong to pass them by without insisting upon the
                    great importance which the occurrence of these isolated instances of metameric
                    segmentation in a group of otherwise unsegmented organisms possesses, and the
                    light which they may be made to throw upon the nature of metameric segmentation
                    in general.</p>
                <p>The foot and head of Nautilus are in the adult inextricably grown together, the
                    eye being the only part belonging primarily to the head which projects from the
                    allembracing foot. The fore-foot or front portion of the foot in Nautilus has
                    the form of a number of lobes carrying tentacles and completely surrounding the
                    mouth (figs. 88, 89, 91). The mid-foot is a broad median muscular process which
                    exhibits in the most interesting manner a curling in of its margins so as to
                    form an incomplete siphon (fig. 101), a condition which is completed and
                    rendered permanent in the tubular funnel, which is the form presented by the
                    corresponding part of Dibranchiata (fig. 96). The hind-foot possibly is
                    represented by the valvular fold on the surface of the siphon-like mid-foot. In
                    the Pteropoda the wing-like swimming lobes (epipodia or pteropodia) correspond
                    to the two halves of the siphon, and are much the largest element of the foot.
                    The fore-foot surrounding the head is often quite small, but in Clione and
                    Pneumodermon carries lobes and suckers. A hind-foot is in Pteropoda often
                    distinctly present; it is open to doubt as to whether the corresponding region
                    of the foot in Siphonopoda is developed at all.</p>
                <p>The lobes of the fore-foot of Nautilus and of the other Siphonopoda require
                    further description. It has been doubted whether these lobes were rightly
                    referred (by Huxley) to the fore-foot, and it has been maintained by some
                    zoologists (Grenadier, Jhering) that they are truly processes of the head. It
                    appears to the present writer to be impossible to doubt that the lobes in
                    question are the foreportion of the foot when their development is examined (see

                    they are innervated by the pedal ganglion, and, lastly, when the comparison of
                    such a Siphonopod as Sepia is made with such a Pteropod as Pneumodermon in its
                    <hi rend="italic">larval</hi> (fig. 84) as well as in its adult condition (fig.
                    85). The larval Pneumodermon shows clearly that the sucker-bearing processes of
                    that Mollusc are originally far removed from the head and close in position to
                    the pteropodial lobes of the foot. By differential growth they gradually embrace
                    and obliterate the head, as do the similar sucker-bearing processes of Sepia. In
                    both cases the sucker-bearing processes are “fore-foot.” The fore-foot of
                    Nautilus completely surrounds the buccal cone (fig. 88, e), so as to present an
                    appearance with its expanded tentacles similar to that of the disc of a
                    sea-anemone (Actinia). No figure has hitherto been published exhibiting this
                    circum-oral disc with its tentacles in natural position as when the animal is
                    alive and swimming, the small figure of Valenciennes being deficient in detail.
                    All the published figures represent the actual appearance of the contracted
                    spirit-specimens. Mr A. G.</p>

                <p>Bourne, B.Sc., of University College, has prepared from actual specimens the
                    drawings of this part in the male and female Nautilus reproduced in fig. 88, and
                    has restored the parts to their natural form when expanded. The drawings show
                    very strikingly the difference between male and female. In the female (lower
                    figure), we observe in the centre of the disc the buccal cone <hi rend="italic"
                    >e</hi> carrying the beak-like pair of jawswhich project from the finely
                    papillate buccal membrane. Three tentaculiferous lobes of the fore-foot are in
                    immediate contact with this buccal cone; they are the right and left (c, c)
                    inner lobes, as we propose to call them, and the inferior inner lobe
                    (&lt;7),—called inferior because it really lies ventralwards of the mouth. This
                    inner inferior lobe is clearly a double one, representing a right and left inner
                    inferior lobe fused into one. A lamellated organ on its surface, probably
                    olfactory in function <hi rend="italic">(n),</hi> marks the separation of the
                    constituent halves of this double lobe. Each half carries a group of fourteen
                    tentacles. The right and the left inner lobes <hi rend="italic">(c, c)</hi> each
                    carry twelve tentacles. External to these three lobes the muscular substance of
                    the mouth-embracing foot is raised into a wide ring, which becomes especially
                    thick and large in the dorsal region where it is notably modified in form,
                    offering a concavity into which the coil of the shell is received, and
                    furnishing a protective roof to the retracted mass of tentacles. This part of
                    the external annular lobe of the fore-foot is called the “hood” (figs. 90, 91,
                    wι.). The median anteroposterior line traversing this hood exactly corresponds
                    to the line of concrescence of the two halves of the fore-foot, which
                    primitively grew forward one on each side of the head, and finally fused
                    together along this line in front of the mouth. The tentacles carried by the
                    great annular lobe are nineteen on each side, thirty-eight in all. They are
                    somewhat larger than the tentacles carried on the three inner lobes. The
                    dorsalmost pair of tentacles (marked <hi rend="italic">g</hi> in fig. 88) are
                    the only ones which actually belong to that part of the disc which forms the
                    great dorsal hood <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> The hood is, in fact, to a large
                    extent formed by the enlarged sheaths of these two tentacles. In the Ammonites
                    (fossil Tetrabranchiata allied to Nautilus) the dorsal surface of the hood
                    secreted a shelly plate in two pieces, known to palaeontologists as
                    Trigonellites and Aptychus. Possibly, however, this double plate was carried on
                    the surface of the bilobed nidamental gland with the form and sculpturing of
                    which, in Nautilus, it closely agrees. All the tentacles of the circum-oral disc
                    are set in remarkable tubular sheaths, into which they can be drawn. The sheaths
                    of some of those belonging to the external or annular lobe are seen in fig. 91,
                    marked <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> The sheaths are muscular as well as the
                    tentacles, and are simply tubes from the base of which the solid tentacle grows.
                    The functional significance of this sheathing arrangement is as obscure as its
                    morphological origin. With reference to the latter, it appears highly probable
                    that the tubular sheath represents the cup of a sucker such as is found on the
                    fore-foot of the Dibranchiata. In any case, it seems to the writer impossible to
                    doubt that each tentacle, and its sheath on a lobe of the circum-oral disc of
                    Nautilus, corresponds to a sucker on such a lobe of a Dibranchiate. Keferstein
                    follows Owen in strongly opposing this identification, and in regarding such
                    tentacle as the equivalent of a whole lobe or arm of a Decapod or Octopod
                    Dibranch. We find in the details of these structures, especially in the facts
                    concerning the hectocotylus and spadix, the most conclusive reasons for
                    dissenting from Owen’s view. We have so far enumerated in the female Nautilus
                    ninety tentacles. Four more remain which have a very peculiar position, and
                    almost lead to the suggestion that the eye itself is a modified tentacle. These
                    remaining tentacles are placed one above (before) and one below (behind) each
                    eye, and bring up the total to ninety-four (fig. 91, <hi rend="italic">v,
                    υ).</hi> They must be considered as also belonging to the fore-foot which thus
                    surrounds the eye.</p>
                <p>In the adult male Nautilus we find the following important differences in the
                    tentaculiferous disc as compared with the female (see upper drawing in fig. 88).
                    The inner inferior lobe is rudimentary, and carries no tentacles. It is
                    represented by three groups of lamellae (&lt;Z), which are not fully exposed in
                    the drawing. The right and left inner lobes are subdivided each into two
                    portions. The right shows a larger portion carrying eight tentacles, and smaller
                    detached groups <hi rend="italic">(q)</hi> of four tentacles, of which three
                    have their sheaths united whilst one stands alone. These four tentacles may be
                    called the “anti-spadix.” The left inner lobe shows a similar larger portion
                    carrying eight tentacles, and a curious conical body in front of it
                    corresponding to the anti-spadix. This is the “spadix” of Van der Hoeven (36).
                    It carries no tentacles, but is terminated by imbricated lamellae. These
                    lamellae appear to represent the four tentacles of the anti-spadix of the right
                    internal lobe, and are generally regarded as corresponding to that modification
                    of the sucker-bearing arms of male Dibranchiate Siphonopods to which the name
                    “hectocotylus” is applied. The spadix is in fact the hectocotylized portion of
                    the forefoot of the male Nautilus. The hectocotylized arm or lobe of male
                    Dibranchiata is connected with the process of copulation, and in the male
                    Nautilus the spadix has probably a similar significance, though it is not
                    possible to suggest how it acts in this relation. It is important to observe
                    that the modification of the fore-foot in the male as compared with the female
                    Nautilus is not confined to the existence of the spadix. The anti-spadix and the
                    reduction of the inner inferior lobe are also male peculiarities. The external
                    annular lobe in the male does not differ from that of the female; it carries
                    nineteen tentacles on each side. The four ophthalmic tentacles are also present.
                    Thus in the male Nautilus we find altogether sixty-two tentacles, the thirty-two
                    additional tentacles of the female being represented by lamelliform
                    structures.</p>
                <p>If we now compare the fore-foot of the Dibranchiata with that of Nautilus, we
                    find in the first place a more simple arrangement of its lobes, which are either
                    four or five pairs of tapering processes (called “arms ”) arranged in a series
                    around the buccal cone, and a substitution of suckers for tentacles on the
                    surface of these lobes (figs. 92, 95, 96). The most dorsally-placed pair of
                    arms, corresponding to the two sides of the hood of Nautilus, are in reality the
                    most anterior (see fig. 75, (6) ), and are termed the first pair. In the
                    Octopoda there are four pairs of these arms (figs. 94, 95), in the Decapoda five
                    pairs, of which the fourth is greatly elongated (figs. 92, 93). In Sepia and
                    other Decapoda (not all) each of these long arms is withdrawn into a pouch
                    beside the head, and is only ejected for the purpose of prehension. The figures
                    referred to show some of the variations in form which these arms may assume. In
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n702/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0702-0675"/> Octopoda they are not unfrequently connected by a
                    web, and form an efficient swimming-bell. The suckers are placed on the ad-oral
                    surface of the arms, and may be in one, two, or four rows, and very numerous. In
                    place of suckers in some genera we find on certain arms or parts of the arms
                    horny hooks; in other cases a hook rises from the centre of each sucker. The
                    hooks on the long arms of Onychoteuthis are drawn in fig. 97. The fore-foot,
                    with its apparatus of suckers and hooks, is in the Dibranchiata essentially a
                    prehensile apparatus, though the whole series of arms in the Octopoda serve as
                    swimming organs, and in many <hi rend="italic">{e.g.,</hi> the Common Octopus or
                    Poulp) the suckerbearing surface is used as a crawling organ.</p>
                <p>In the males of the Dibranchiata one of the arms is more or less modified in
                    connexion with the reproductive function, and is called the “hectocotylized
                    arm.” This name is derived from the condition assumed by the arm in those cases
                    in which its modification is carried out to the greatest extent. These cases are
                    those of the Octopods <hi rend="italic">Argonauta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >argo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Parasira catenulata</hi> (fig. 96). In the
                    males of these the third arm (on the left side in Argonauta, on the right side
                    in Parasira) is^ found before the breeding season to be represented by a
                    globular sac of integument. This sac bursts, and from it issues an arm larger
                    than its neighbours, having a small sac at its extremity in Parasira (fig. 96,
                    x), from which subsequently a long filament issues. Before copulation the male
                    charges this arm with the spermatophores or packets of spermatozoa removed from
                    its generative orifice beneath the mantle-skirt, and during coitus the arm
                    becomes detached and is left adhering to the female by means of its suckers. A
                    new arm is formed at the cicatrix before the next breeding season. The female,
                    being much larger than the male, swims away with the detached arm lodged beneath
                    her mantle-skirt. There, in a way which is not understood, the fertilization of
                    the eggs is effected. Specimens of the female Parasira with the detached arm
                    adherent were examined by Cuvier, who mistook the arm for a parasitic worm and
                    gave to it the name Hectocotylus. Accordingly, the correspondingly modified arms
                    of other Siphonopoda are said to be hectocotylized. Steenstrup has determined
                    the hectocotylized condition of one or other of the arms in a number of male
                    Dibranchs as follows :—in all, excepting Argonauta and Parasira, the
                    modification of the arm is slight, consisting in a small enlargement of part or
                    the whole of the arm, and the obliteration of some of its suckers, as shown in
                    fig. 95, A, B; in Octopus and Eledone the third right arm is hectocotylized; in
                    Rossia the first left arm is hectocotylized along its whole length, and the
                    first right arm also in the middle only; in Sepiola only the first left arm
                    along its whole length; in Sepia it is the fourth left arm which is modified,
                    and at its base only; in Sepioteuthis, the same at its apex; in Loligo, the same
                    also at its apex; in Loliolus, the same along its whole length; in Ommastrephes,
                    Onychoteuthis, and Loligopsis no hectocotylized arm has hitherto been
                    observed.</p>
                <p>In the females of several Dibranchs (Sepia, àc.) the packets of spermatozoa or
                    spermatophores received from the male have been observed adhering to the smaller
                    arms. How they are passed in this case by the female to the ova in order to
                    fertilize them is unknown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Musculature, Fins, and Cartilaginous Skeleton.—</hi> Without
                    entering into a detailed account of the musculature of Nautilus, we may point
                    out that the great muscular masses of the fore-foot and of the mid-foot (siphon)
                    are ultimately traceable to a large transverse mass of muscular tissue, the ends
                    of which are visible through the integument on the right and left surfaces of
                    the body dorsal of the free flap of the mantle-skirt (fig. 89, <hi rend="italic"
                    >I, I,</hi> and fig. 91, <hi rend="italic">k∖</hi> These muscular areae have a
                    certain adhesion to the shell, and serve both to hold the animal in its shell
                    and as the fixed supports for the various movements of the tentaculiferous lobes
                    and the siphon. They are to be identified with the ring-like area of adhesion by
                    which the foot-muscle of the Limpet is attached to the shell of that animal (see
                    fig. 27). In the Dibranchs a similar origin of the muscular masses of the
                    fore-foot and mid-foot from the sides of the shell—modified, as this is, in
                    position and relations—can be traced.</p>
                <p>In Nautilus there are no fin-like expansions of the integument, whereas such
                    occur in the Decapod Dibranchs along the sides of the visceral hump (figs. 92,
                    93). As an exception among Octopoda lateral fins occur in Pinnoctopus (fig. 94,
                    A), and in Cirrhoteuthis (fig. 94, D). In the Pteropodous division of the
                    Cephalopoda such fin-like expansions of the dorsal integument do not occur,
                    which is to be connected with the fact that another region, the mid-foot, which
                    in Siphonopods is converted into a siphon, is in them expanded as a pair of
                    fins.</p>
                <p>In Nautilus there is a curious plate-like expansion of integument in the
                    mid-dorsal region just behind the hood, lying between that structure and the
                    portion of mantleskirt which is reflected over the shell. This is shown in fig.
                    90, <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> If we trace out the margin of this plate we find
                    that it becomes continuous on each side with the sides of the siphon or
                    mid-foot. In Sepia and other Decapods (not in Octopods) a closely similar plate
                    exists in an exactly corresponding position (see <hi rend="italic">b</hi> in
                    figs. 110, 111). In Sepia a cartilaginous development occurs here immediately
                    below the integument forming the so-called “nuchal plate,” drawn in fig. 116, D.
                    The morphological significance of this nuchal lamella, as seen both in Nautilus
                    and in Sepia, is not obvious. Cartilage having the structure shown in fig. 117
                    occurs in various regions of the body of Siphonopoda. In all Glossophorous
                    Mollusca the lingual apparatus is supported by internal skeletal pieces, having
                    the character of cartilage; but in the Siphonopodous Cephalopoda such cartilage
                    has a wider range.</p>
                <p>In Nautilus a large H-shaped piece of cartilage is found forming the axis of the
                    mid-foot or siphon (fig. 116, A, B). Its hinder part extends up into the head
                    and supports the peri-oesophageal nerve-mass <hi rend="italic">(a),</hi> whilst
                    its two anterior rami extend into the tongue-like siphon. In Sepia, and
                    Dibranchs generally, the cartilage takes a different form, as shown in fig. 116,
                    C. The processes of this cartilage cannot be identified in any way with those of
                    the capito-pedal cartilage of Nautilus. The lower larger portion of this
                    cartilage in Sepia is called the cephalic cartilage, and forms a complete ring
                    round the oesophagus; it completely invests also the ganglionic nerve-collar, so
                    that all the nerves from the latter have to pass through foramina in the
                    cartilage. The outer angles of this cartilage spread out on each side so as to
                    form a cup-like receptacle for the eyes. The two processes springing right and
                    left from this large cartilage in the median line (fig. 116, C) are the
                    “prae-orbital cartilages;” in front of these, again, there is seen a piece like
                    an inverted T, which forms a support to the base of the “arms <hi rend="italic"
                    >” of</hi> the fore-foot, and is the “basi-brachial” cartilage. The Decapod
                    Dibranchs have, further, the “nuchal cartilage” already mentioned, and in Sepia,
                    a thin plate-like “sub-ostracal” or (so-called) dorsal cartilage, the anterior
                    end of which rests on and fits into the concave nuchal cartilage. In Octopoda
                    there is no nuchal cartilage, but two band-like “dorsal cartilages.” In Decapods
                    there are also two cartilaginous sockets on the sides of the funnel
                    —“siphon-hinge cartilages ”—into which fleshy knobs of the mantle-skirt are
                    loosely fitted. In Sepia, along the whole base-line of each lateral fin of the
                    mantle (fig. 92), is a “basi-pterygial cartilage.” It is worthy of remark that
                    we have, thus developed, in Dibranch Siphonopods a more <pb break="no"

                    to be found in some of the lower Vertebrates. There are other instances of
                    cartilaginous endo-skeleton in groups other than the Vertebrata. Thus in some
                    capito-branchiate Chaetopods cartilage forms a skeletal support for the
                    gill-plumes, whilst in the Arachnids (Mygale, Scorpio) and in Limulus a large
                    internal cartilaginous plate—the ento-sternite—is developed as a support for a
                    large series of muscles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Alimentary Tract.—</hi> The buccal cone of Nautilus is
                    terminated by a villous margin (buccal membrane) surrounding the pair of
                    beak-like jaws. These are very strong and dense in Nautilus, being calcified.
                    Fossilized beaks of Tetrabranchiata are known under the name of Rhyncholites. In
                    Dibranchs the beaks are horny, but similar in shape to those of Nautilus. They
                    resemble in general those of a parrot, the lower beak being the larger, and
                    overlapping the upper or dorsal beak. The lingual ribbon and odontophoral
                    apparatus has the structure which is typical for Glossophorous Mollusca. In fig.
                    107, A is represented a single row of teeth from the lingual ribbon of Nautilus,
                    and in fig. 107, B, C, of other Siphonopoda.</p>
                <p>In Nautilus a long and wide crop or dilated oesophagus (er, fig. 110) passes from
                    the muscular buccal mass, and at the apex of the visceral hump passes into a
                    highly muscular stomach, resembling the gizzard of a bird <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gizz,</hi> fig. 110). A nearly straight intestine passes from the muscular
                    stomach to the anus, near which it develops a small caecum. In other Siphonopods
                    the oesophagus is usually narrower (fig. 106, <hi rend="italic">oe),</hi> and
                    the muscular stomach more capacious (fig. 106, v), whilst a very important
                    feature in the alimentary tract is formed by the caecum. In all but Nautilus the
                    caecum lies near the stomach, and may be very capacious —much larger than the
                    stomach in <hi rend="italic">Loligo</hi><hi rend="italic">vulgaris—</hi> or

                <p>U-shaped flexure of the alimentary tract as seen in fig. 106, and in fig. 110, is
                    the only important one which it exhibits in the Cephalopoda,—the Pteropoda
                    (except the Limacinida) agreeing with the Siphonopoda in this simplicity in
                    consequence of their visceral hump being untwisted. The acini of the large liver
                    of Nautilus are compacted into a solid reddish-brown mass by a firm membrane, as
                    also is the case in the Dibranchiata. The liver has four paired lobes in
                    Nautilus, which open by two bile-ducts into the alimentary canal at the
                    commencement of the intestine. The bile-ducts unite before entering the
                    intestine. In Dibranchiata the two large lobes of the liver are placed
                    antero-dorsally (beneath the shell in Decapoda), and the bile-ducts open into
                    the caecum. Upon the bile-ducts in Dibranchiata are developed yellowish
                    glandular diverticula, which are known as “pancreas,” though neither
                    physiologically nor morphologically is there any ground for considering either
                    the so-called liver or the so-called pancreas as strictly equivalent to the
                    glands so denominated in the Vertebrata. In Nautilus the equivalents of the
                    pancreatic diverticula of the Dibranchs can be traced upon the relatively
                    shorter bileducts.</p>
                <p>Salivary Glands are not developed in Nautilus unless a pair of glandular masses
                    lying on the buccal cavity are to be considered as such. In the Dibranchs, on
                    the contrary, one (Sepia, Loligo) or two pairs of large salivary glands are
                    present, an anterior and a posterior (Octopus, Eledone, Onychoteuthis). Each
                    pair of salivary glands has its paired ducts united to form a single duct, which
                    runs forward from the glands and opens into the buccal cavity near the radula.
                    The anterior pair of glands when present lie in the head near the buccal mass,
                    the posterior pair lie much farther back beneath the liver, at the sides of the
                    oesophagus. It is the posterior pair which alone are present in Sepia and
                    Loligo. The ink-bag is to be considered as an appendage of the rectum. It is not
                    developed in Nautilus, nor in the Pteropoda; in all Dibranchiata (even in the
                    fossil Belemnites) it is present (fig. 106, <hi rend="italic">a</hi>; fig. 103,
                    i), and has been observed to develop as a diverticulum of the rectum, with
                    spirally plaited walls which very early secrete a black pigment. The spiral

                    increases. Its outer surface acquires a metallic iridescence similar to that of
                    the integuments of many fishes. The opening of the ink-sac is in the adult
                    sometimes distinct from but near to the anus (Sepia); in other cases it opens
                    into the rectum near the anus. The ink-bag of Dibranch Siphonopoda is possibly
                    to be identified with the adrectal (purpuriparous) gland of some Gastropoda.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coelom, Blood-vascular System, and Excretory Organs.—</hi>
                    Nautilus and the other Siphonopoda conform to the general Molluscan characters
                    in regard to these organs. Whilst the general body-cavity or coelom forms a
                    lacunar blood-system or series of narrow spaces, connected with the trunks of a
                    well-developed vascular system, that part of the original coelom surrounding the
                    heart and known as the Molluscan pericardium becomes shut off from this general
                    blood-lymph system, and communicates, directly in Nautilus, in the rest through
                    the nephridia, with the exterior. In the Siphonopoda this specialized
                    pericardial cavity is particularly large, and has been recognized as distinct
                    from the blood-carrying spaces, even by anatomists who have not considered the
                    pericardial space of other Mollusca to be thus isolated. The enlarged
                    pericardium, which may even take the form of a pair of sacs, has been variously
                    named, but is best known as the viscero-pericardial sac or chamber. In Nautilus
                    this sac occupies the whole of the postero-dorsal surface and a part of the
                    antero-dorsal (see fig. 110, #), investing the genital and other viscera which
                    lie below it, and having the ventricle of the heart suspended in it. Certain
                    membranes forming incomplete septa, and a curious muscular band—the
                    pallio-cardiac band—traverse the sac. The four branchial advehent veins, which
                    in traversing the walls of the four nephridial sacs give off, as it were,
                    glandular diverticula into those sacs, also give off at the same points four
                    much larger glandular masses, which hang freely into the viscero-pericardial
                    chamber (fig. 109, <hi rend="italic">r.e).</hi> In Nautilus the
                    viscero-pericardial sac opens to the exterior directly by a pair of apertures,
                    one placed close to the right and one close to the left posterior nephridial
                    aperture (fig. 101, <hi rend="italic">υiscper.).</hi> This direct opening of the
                    pericardial sac to the exterior is an exception to what occurs in all other
                    Mollusca. In all other Molluscs the pericardial sac opens into the nephridia,
                    and through them or the one nephridium to the exterior. In Nautilus there is no
                    opening from the viscero-pericardial sac into the nephridia. Therefore the
                    external pore of the viscero-pericardial sac may possibly be regarded as a
                    shifting of the reno-pericardial orifice from the actual wall of the nephridial
                    sac to a position alongside of its orifice. Parallel cases of such shifting are
                    seen in the varying position of the orifice of the ink-bag in Dibranchiata, and
                    in the orifice of the genital ducts of Mollusca, which in some few cases <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Spondylus) open into the nephridia, whilst in other
                    cases they open close by the side of the nephridia on the surface of the body.

                    the dorsal region. It varies in shape—that is to say, in the extensions of its
                    area right and left between the various viscera—in different genera, but in the
                    Decapods is largest. In an extension of this chamber is placed the ovary of
                    Sepia, whilst the ventricle of the heart and the branchial hearts and their
                    appendages also lie in it. It is probable that water is drawn into this chamber
                    through the nephridia, since sand and other foreign matters are found in it. In
                    all it opens into the pair of nephridial sacs by an orifice on the wall of each,
                    not far from the external orifice (fig. 108, <hi rend="italic">y, y'</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> s</hi><hi rend="italic">).</hi> There does not seem
                    any room for doubting that each orifice corresponds to the reno-pericardial
                    orifice which we have seen in the Gastropoda, and shall find again in the
                    Lamellibranchia. The single tube-like nephridium and the pericardium of the
                    Pteropoda also communicate by an aperture.</p>
                <p>The circulatory organs, blood-vessels, and blood of Nautilus do not differ
                    greatly from those of Gastropoda. The ventricle of the heart is a four-cornered
                    body, receiving a dilated branchial efferent vessel (auricle) at each corner
                    (fig. 109). It gives off a cephalic aorta anteriorly, and a smaller abdominal
                    aorta posteriorly. The diagram, fig. 105, serves to show how this simple form of
                    heart is related to the dorsal vessel of a worm or of an Arthropod, and how by a
                    simple flexure of the ventricle (D) and a subsequent suppression of one auricle,
                    following on the suppression of one branchia, one may obtain the form of heart
                    characteristic of the Anisopleurous Gastropoda (excepting the Zygobranchia). The
                    flexed condition of the heart is seen in Octopus, and is to some extent
                    approached by Nautilus, the median vessels not presenting that perfect
                    parallelism which is shown in the figure (B). The most remarkable feature
                    presented by the heart of Nautilus is the possession of four instead of two
                    auricles, a feature which is simply related to the metamerism of the branchiae.
                    By the left side of the heart of Nautilus, attached to it by a membrane, and
                    hanging loosely in the viscero-pericardial chamber, is the pyriform sac of Owen.
                    This has recently been shown to be the rudimentary left oviduct or sperm-duct,
                    as the case may be (Lankester and Bourne, 37), the functional right ovi-sac and
                    its duct being attached by a membrane to the opposite side of the heart.</p>
                <p>The cephalic and abdominal aortae of Nautilus appear, after running to the
                    anterior and posterior extremes of the animal respectively, to open into
                    sinus-like spaces surrounding the viscera, muscular masses, &lt;fcc. These
                    spaces are not large, but confined and shallow. Capillaries are stated to occur
                    in the integument. In the Dibranchs the arterial system is very much more
                    complete; it appears in some cases to end in irregular lacunae or sinuses, in
                    other cases in true capillaries which lead on into veins. An investigation of
                    these capillaries in the light of modern histological knowledge is much needed.
                    From the sinuses and capillaries the veins take origin, collecting into a large
                    median trunk (the vena cava), which in the Dibranchs as well as in Nautilus has
                    a ventral (postero-ventral) position, and runs parallel to the long axis of the
                    animal. In Nautilus this vena cava gives off at the level of the gills four
                    branchial advehent veins (fig. 109, <hi rend="italic">v.c.∖</hi> which pass into
                    the four gills without dilating. In the Dibranchs at a similar position the vena
                    cava gives off a right and a left branchial advehent vein (fig. 108, <hi
                    rend="italic">r.s.v.c, r.d.v.c),</hi> each of which, traversing the wall of the
                    corresponding nephridial sac and receiving additional factors (fig. 108, <hi
                    rend="italic">v.g, υ.p.d, v.a.d, v.b.a),</hi> dilates at the base of the
                    corresponding branchial plume, forming there a pulsating sac—the branchial heart
                    (fig. 104, <hi rend="italic">x;</hi> and fig 108, cA). Attached to each
                    branchial heart is a curious glandular body, which may possibly be related to
                    the larger masses <hi rend="italic">(r.e</hi> in fig. 109) which depend into the
                    viscero-pericardial cavity from the branchial advehent veins of Nautilus. From
                    the dilated branchial heart the branchial advehent vessel proceeds, running up
                    the ad-pallial face of the gill-plume <hi rend="italic">∖yi, vc</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> fig. 104). From each

                    >(v',</hi> fig. 104) to the heart, the two auricles being formed by the

                <p>The blood of Siphonopoda contains the usual amoeboid corpuscles,. and a diffused
                    colouring matter—the haemocyanin of Fredericque—which has been found also in the
                    blood of Helix, and in that of the Arthropods Homarus and Limulus. It is
                    colourless in the oxidized, blue in the deoxidized state, and contains copper as
                    a chemical constituent.</p>
                <p>The nephridial sacs and renal glandular tissue are closely connected with the
                    branchial advehent vessels in Nautilus and in the other Siphonopoda. The
                    arrangement is such as to render the typical relations and form of a nephridium
                    difficult to trace. In accordance with the metamerism of Nautilus already
                    noticed, there are two pairs of nephridia. Each nephridium assumes the form of a
                    sac opening by a pore to the exterior. As is usual in nephridia, a glandular and
                    a non-glandular portion are distinguished in each sac; these portions, however,
                    are not successive parts of a tube, as happens in other cases, but they are
                    localized areae of the wall of the sac. The glandular renal tissue is, in fact,
                    confined to a tract extending along that part of the sac’s wall which
                    immediately invests the great branchial advehent vein. The vein in this region
                    gives off directly from its wall a complete herbage of little venules, which
                    branch and anastomose with one another, and are clothed by the glandular
                    epithelium of the nephridial sac. The secretion is accumulated in the sac and
                    passed by its aperture to the exterior. Probably the nitrogenous excretory
                    product is very rapidly discharged; in Nautilus a pink-coloured powder is found
                    accumulated in the nephridial sacs, consisting of calcium phosphate. The
                    presence of this phosphatic calculus by no means proves that such was the sole
                    excretion of the renal glandular tissue. In Nautilus a glandular growth like
                    that rising from the wall of the branchial vessel into its corresponding
                    nephridial sac, but larger in size, depends from each branchial advehent vessel
                    into the viscero-pericardial sac,—probably identical with the “appendage” of the
                    branchial hearts of Dibranchs.</p>
                <p>The chief difference, other than that of number between the nephridia of the
                    Dibranchs and those of Nautilus, is the absence of the accessory growths
                    depending into the viscero-pericardial space just mentioned, and, of more
                    importance, the presence in the former of a pore leading from the nephridial sac
                    into the viscero-pericardial sac (y, <hi rend="italic">y'</hi> in fig. 108). The
                    external orifices of the nephridia are also more prominent in Dibranchs than in
                    Nautilus, being raised on papillae <hi rend="italic">(np</hi> in fig. 108 <hi
                    rend="italic">; r</hi> in fig. 103). In Sepia, according to Vigelius (38), the
                    two nephridia give off each a diverticulum dorsalwards, which unites with its
                    fellows and forms a great median renal chamber, lying between the ventral
                    portions of the nephridia and the viscero-pericardial chamber. In Loligo the
                    fusion <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n706/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0706-0679"/> of the two nephridia to form one sac is still
                    more obvious, since the ventral portions are united. In Octopus the nephridia
                    are quite separate.</p>
                <p>Tegumental pores have not been described in Nautilus, but exist in Dibranchiata,
                    and have been (probably erroneously, but further investigation is needed)
                    supposed to introduce water into the vascular system. A pair of such pores
                    leading into sub-tegumental spaces of considerable area, the nature of which is
                    imperfectly known, exist on the back of the head in Philonexis, Tremoctopus, and
                    Argonauta. At the base of the arms and mouth four such pores are found in
                    Histioteuthis and Ommastrephes, six in Sepia, Loligo, Onychoteuthis. Lastly, a
                    pair of such pores are found in the Decapoda at the base of the long arms,
                    leading into an extensive sub - tegumental pouch on each side of the head into
                    which the long arms can be, and usually are, withdrawn. In Sepia, Sepiola, and
                    Rossia the whole arm is coiled up in these sacs; in Loligo only a part of it is
                    so; in Histioteuthis, Ommastrephes, and Onychoteuthis, the sacs are quite small
                    and do not admit the arms.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System. —</hi> Nautilus, like the other Cephalopoda <hi
                    rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Pneumodermon, fig. 87; Octopus, fig. 113), exhibits a
                    great concentration of the typical Molluscan ganglia, as shown in fig. 112. The
                    ganglia take on a band-like form, and are but little differentiated from their
                    commissures and connectives, — an archaic condition reminding us of Chiton. The
                    special optic outgrowth of the cerebral ganglion, the optic ganglion (fig. 112,
                    o), is characteristic of the big-eyed Siphonopoda. The cerebral ganglion-pair
                    (a) lying above the oesophagus is connected with two sub-oesophageal
                    ganglion-pairs of band-like form. The anterior of these is the pedal <hi
                    rend="italic">b, b,</hi> and supplies the fore-foot with nerves <hi
                    rend="italic">t', t,</hi> as also the mid-foot (siphon). The hinder band is the
                    visceral and pleural pair fused (compare fig. 112 with fig. 87, and especially
                    with the typical Euthyneurous nervous system of Limnaeus, fig. 22); from its
                    pleural portion nerves pass to the mantle, from its visceral portion nerves to
                    the branchiae and genital ganglion (√ in fig. 112), and in immediate connexion
                    with the latter is a nerve to the osphradium or olfactory papilla. No buccal
                    ganglia have been observed in Nautilus, nor has an enteric nervous system been
                    described in this animal, though both attain a special development in the
                    Dibranchiata. The figures (114 and 115) representing the nerve-centres of
                    Octopus serve to exhibit the disposition of these parts in the Dibranchiata. The
                    ganglia are more distinctly swollen than in Nautilus. In Octopus an infra-buccal
                    ganglion-pair are present corresponding to the buccal ganglion-pair of
                    Gastropoda. In Decapoda a supra-buccal ganglion-pair connected with these are
                    also developed. Instead of the numerous radiating palliai nerves of Nautilus, we
                    have in the Dibranchiata on each side (right and left) a large pleural erve
                    passing from the pleural portion of the pleuro-visceral ganglion to the mantle,
                    where it enlarges to form the stellate ganglion. From each stellate ganglion
                    nerves radiate to supply the powerful muscles of the mantle-skirt. The nerves
                    from the visceral portion of the pleuro-visceral ganglion have the same course
                    as in Nautilus, but no osphradial papilla is present. An enteric nervous system
                    is richly developed in the Dibranchiata, connected with the somatic nervous
                    centres through the buccal ganglia, as in the Arthropoda through the
                    stomato-gastric ganglia, and anastomosing with deep branches of the visceral
                    nerves of the viscero-pleural ganglion-pair. It has been especially described by
                    Hancock (39) in Ommastrephes. Upon the stomach it forms a single large and
                    readily-detected gastric ganglion. It is questionable as to how far this and the
                    “caval ganglion” formed in some Decapoda by branches of the visceral nerves
                    which accompany the vena cava are to be considered as the equivalents of the
                    “abdominal ganglion,” which in a typical Gastropod nervous system lies in the
                    middle of the visceral nerve-loop or commissure, having the right and left
                    visceral ganglia on either side of it, separated by a greater or less length of
                    visceral nerve-cord (see figs. 20, 21, 22). There can be little doubt that the
                    enteric nervous system is much more developed in the Dibranchiata than in other
                    Mollusca, and that it effects a fusion with the typical “visceral” cords more
                    extensive than obtains even in Gastropoda, where such a fusion no doubt must
                    also be admitted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Special Sense-Organs.—</hi> Nautilus possesses a pair of
                    osphradial papillae (fig. 101, o(∕) corresponding in position and innervation to
                    Spengel’s organ placed at the base of the ctenidia (branchiae) in all classes of
                    Mollusca. This organ has not been detected in other Siphonopoda. In Pteropoda it
                    is well developed as a single ciliated pit, although the ctenidia are in that
                    group aborted (fig. 87, <hi rend="italic">Osp.).</hi> Nautilus possesses other
                    olfactory organs in the region of the head. Just below the eye is a small
                    triangular process (not seen in our figures), having the structure of a
                    shortened and highly-modified tentacle and sheath. By Valenciennes, who is
                    followed by Keferstein, this is regarded as an olfactory organ. The large nerve
                    which runs to this organ originates from the point of juncture of the pedal with
                    the optic ganglion. The lamelliform organ upon the inner inferior tentacular
                    lobe of Nautilus is possibly also olfactory in function. In Dibranchs behind the
                    eye is a pit or open canal supplied by a nerve corresponding in origin to the
                    olfactory nerve of Nautilus above mentioned.</p>

                <p>Possibly the sense of taste resides in certain processes within the mouth of
                    Nautilus and other Siphonopoda.</p>
                <p>The otocysts of Nautilus were discovered by Macdonald (40). Each lies at the side
                    of the head, ventral of the eye, resting on the capito-pedal cartilage, and
                    supported by the large auditory nerve which arises from the pedal ganglion. It
                    has the form of a small sac, 1 to 2 mm. in diameter, and contains whetstone -
                    shaped crystals, such as are known to form the otoliths of other Mollusca. The
                    otocysts of Dibranchiata are larger and deeply sunk in the cephalic cartilage.
                    It has been shown by Lankester that they develop as open pits (fig. 121, (5),
                    (6), o), which gradually close up, the communication with the exterior becoming
                    narrowed into a fine canal, which is reflected over one end of the sac, and
                    finally has its external opening obliterated. A single otolith only is found in
                    all Dibranchiata.</p>
                <p>The eye of Nautilus is among the most interesting structures of that remarkable
                    animal. No other animal which has the same bulk and general elaboration of
                    organization has so simple an eye as that of Nautilus. When looked at from the
                    surface no metallic lustre, no transparent coverings, are presented by it. It is
                    simply a slightly projecting hemispherical box like a kettle-drum, half an inch
                    in diameter, its surface looking like that of the surrounding integument, whilst
                    in the middle of the drum-membrane is a minute hole (fig. 91, <hi rend="italic"
                    >u).</hi> Owen very naturally thought that some membrane had covered this hole
                    in life, and had been ruptured in the specimen studied by him. It, however,
                    appears from the researches of Hensen (41) that the hole is a normal aperture
                    leading into the globe of the eye, which is accordingly filled by sea-water
                    during life. There is no dioptric apparatus in Nautilus, and in place of
                    refracting lens and cornea we have actually here an arrangement for forming an
                    image on the principle of “the pin-hole camera.” There is no other eye known in
                    the whole animal kingdom which is so constructed. The wall of the eyeglobe is
                    tough, and the cavity is lined solely by the naked retina, which is bathed by
                    sea-water on one surface and receives the fibres of the optic nerve on the other
                    (see fig. 118, A). As in other Siphonopods (e.y., fig. 120, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hi,</hi> Ae, <hi rend="italic">p∖</hi> the retina consists of two layers of
                    cells separated by a layer of dark pigment. The most interesting consideration
                    connected with this eye of Nautilus is found when the further facts are
                    noted—(1) that the elaborate lens-bearing eyes of Dibranchiata pass through a
                    stage of development in which they have the same structure as the eye of
                    Nautilus —namely, are open sacs (fig. 119); and (2), that amongst other Mollusca
                    examples of cephalic eyes can be found which in the adult condition are, like
                    the eye of Nautilus and the developing eye of Dibranchs, simple pits of the
                    integument, the cells of which are surrounded by pigment and connected with the
                    filaments of an optic nerve. Such is the structure of the eye of the Limpet
                    (Patella); and in such a simple eye we obtain the clearest demonstration of the
                    fact that the retina of the Molluscan cephalic eye, like that of the Arthropod
                    cephalic eye and unlike that of the Vertebrate myelonic eye, is essentially a
                    modified area of the general epiderm, and that the sensitiveness of its cells to
                    the action of light and their relation to nerve-filaments is only a
                    specialization and intensifying of a property common to the whole epiderm of the
                    surface of the body. What, however, strikes us as especially remarkable is that
                    the simple form of a pit, which in Patella serves to accumulate a secretion
                    which acts as a refractive body, should in Nautilus be glorified and raised to
                    the dignity of an efficient optical apparatus. Natural selection has had an
                    altogether exceptional opportunity in the ancestors of Nautilus. In all other
                    Mollusca, starting as we may suppose from the follicular or pit-like condition,
                    the eye has proceeded to acquire the form of a <hi rend="italic">closed</hi>
                    sac, the cavity of the closed vesicle being then filled partially or completely
                    by a refractive body (lens) secreted by its walls (fig. 118, B). This is the
                    condition attained in most Gastropoda. It presents a striking contrast to the
                    simple Arthropod eye, where, in consequence of the existence of a dense exterior
                    cuticle, the eye does not form a vesicle, and the lens is always part of that
                    cuticle.</p>
                <p>In the Dibranchiate division of the Siphonopoda the greatest elaboration of the
                    dioptric apparatus of the eye is attained, so that we have in one sub-class the
                    extremes of the two lines of development of the Molluscan eye, those two lines
                    being the punctigerous and the lentigerous. The structure of the Dibranchiate’s
                    eye is shown in section in fig. 118, C, and in fig. 120, and its development in
                    fig. 119 and fig. 123. The open sac which forms the retina of the young
                    Dibranchiate closesup, and constitutes the posterior chamber of the eye, or
                    primitive optic vesicle (fig. 123, A,∕&gt;oc). The <pb break="no"

                    inwards from the front wall of this vesicle (fig. 123, B, Z). The integument
                    around the primitive optic vesicle which has sunk below the surface now rises up
                    and forms firstly nearest the axis of the eye the iridian folds <hi
                    rend="italic">(if</hi> in B, fig. 123; <hi rend="italic">ik</hi> in fig. 120;
                    <hi rend="italic">Ir</hi> in fig. 118), and then secondly an outer circular fold
                    grows up like a wall and completely closes over the iridian folds and the axis
                    of the primitive vesicle (fig. 120, C). This covering is transparent, and is the
                    cornea. In the oceanic Decapoda the cornea does not completely close, but leaves
                    a central aperture traversed by the optic axis. These forms are termed
                    Oigopsidae by d’Orbigny (42), whilst the Decapoda with closed cornea are termed
                    Myopsidae. In the Octopoda the cornea is closed, and there is yet another fold
                    thrown over the eye. The skin surrounding the cornea presents a free circular
                    margin, and can be drawn over the surface of the cornea by a sphincter muscle.
                    It thus acts as an adjustable diaphragm, exactly similar in movement to the iris
                    of Vertebrates. Sepia and allied Decapods have a horizontal lower eyelid, that
                    is to say, only one-half of the sphincter-like fold of integument is movable.
                    The exact history of the later growth of the lens in the Dibranchs’ eye is not
                    clear. As seen in fig. 120, it appears, after attaining a certain size, to push
                    through the front wall of the primitive optic vesicle at the point corresponding
                    to its centre of closure, and to project a little into the anterior chamber
                    formed by the cornea. The wall of the primitive optic vesicle adjacent to the
                    embedded lens (I.) now becomes modified, forming a so-called “ciliary body,” in
                    which muscular tissue is present, serving to regulate the focus of the lens <hi
                    rend="italic">(ci</hi> in fig. 120). Bobretzky (43) differs from Lankester,
                    whose view is above given, in assigning a distinct origin to the protruding
                    anterior segment of the lens <hi rend="italic">(l</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> x</hi> in fig. 118). The optic ganglion, as well as the other
                    large ganglia of the Dibranchiata, originate in the mesoblast of the embryo. The
                    connexion between the cells of the retina and the nerve-fibres proceeding from
                    the optic ganglion must therefore be a secondary one.</p>

                    intimately associated with the nervous system, appear to be absent. In
                    Dibranchiata they play an important part in the economy, enabling their
                    possessor, in conjunction with the discharge of the contents of the ink-bag, to
                    elude the observation of either prey or foe. They consist of large vesicular
                    cells (true nucleated cells converted into vesicles), arranged in a layer
                    immediately below the epidermis. Each chromatophore-cell has from six to ten
                    muscular bands attached to its walls, radiating from it star-wise. The
                    contraction of these fibres causes the chromatophore-cell to widen out; it
                    returns to its spherical resting state by its own elasticity. In the spherical
                    resting state such a cell may measure Ό1 mm., whilst when fully stretched by its
                    radiating muscles it covers an area of <hi rend="italic">'5</hi> mm. The
                    substance of the chromatophore-cells is intensely coloured with one of the
                    following colours—scarlet, yellow, blue, brown— which are usually of the
                    greatest purity and brilliance. The action of the chromatophores may be watched
                    most readily in young Loligo, either under the microscope or with the naked eye.
                    The chromatophores are suddenly expanded, and more slowly retracted with
                    rapidly-recurring alternation. All the blue, or all the red, or all the yellow
                    may be expanded and the other colours left quiescent. Thus the animal can assume
                    any particular hue, and change its appearance in a dazzling way with
                    extraordinary rapidity. There is a definite adaptation of the colour assumed in
                    the case of Sepia and others to the colour of the surrounding rock and
                    bottom.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gonads and Genital Ducts.—</hi> In Nautilus it has recently
                    been shown by Lankester and Bourne (37) that the genital ducts of both sexes are
                    paired right and left, the left duct being rudimentary and forming the “pyriform
                    appendage,” described by Owen as adhering by membranous attachment to the
                    ventricle of the heart, and shown by Keferstein to communicate by a pore with
                    the exterior. Thus the Cephalopoda agree with our archi-Mollusc in having
                    bilaterally symmetrical genital ducts in the case of the most archaic member of
                    the class. The ovary (female gonad) or the testis (male gonad) lies in Nautilus
                    as in the Dibranchs in a distinct cavity walled off from the other viscera, near
                    the centro-dorsal region. This chamber is formed by the coelomic or peritoneal
                    wall; the space enclosed is originally part of the coelom, and in Sepia and
                    Loligo is, in the adult, part of the viscero-pericardial chamber. In Octopus it
                    is this genital chamber which communicates by a right and a left canal with the
                    nephridium, and is the only representative of pericardium. The ovary or testis
                    is itself a growth from the inner wall of this chamber, which it only partly
                    fills. In Nautilus the right genital duct, which is functional, is a simple
                    continuation to the pore on the postero-dorsal surface of the membranous walls
                    of the capsule in which lies the ovary or the testis, as the case may be. The
                    gonad itself appears to represent a single median or bilateral organ.</p>
                <p>The true morphological nature of the genital ducts of the Cephalopoda and of
                    other Mollusca is a subject which invites speculation and inquiry. In all the

                    itself occur— viz., in Nematoid worms, in Arthropoda, and in Teleostean fishes,
                    besides Mollusca—there is an absence of definite knowledge as to the mode of
                    development of the duct. It seems, however, from such facts as have been
                    ascertained that the gonad lies at first freely in the coelom, and that the duct
                    develops in connexion with the genital pore, and attaches itself to the
                    embryonic gonad, or to the capsule which grows around it. The question then
                    arises as to the nature of the pore. In other groups of animals we find that the
                    pore, and funnel or tube connected with it by which the genital products are
                    conveyed to the exterior, is a modified nephridium (usually a pair, one right
                    and one left). Is it possible that this is also the case where the duct very
                    early becomes united to the gonad, and even gives rise to the appearance of a
                    tubular ovary or testis? Probably this is the case in Teleostean fishes (see
                    Huxley’s observations on the oviducts of the smelt, 44); but it seems to be a
                    tenable position that in other cases, including the Mollusca, the genital pore
                    is a simple opening in the body-λvall leading into the body-cavity or coelom,
                    such as we find on the dorsal surface of the earth-worm, which has become
                    specialized for the extrusion of the genital products. Possibly, as in Nemertine
                    and Chaetopod worms, the condition preceding the development of these definite
                    genital pores was one in which a temporary rupture of the body-wall occurred at
                    the breeding season, and this temporary aperture has gradually become permanent.
                    The absence of genital pores in Patella, and some Lamellibranchs which make use
                    of the nephridia for the extrusion of their genital products, suggests that the
                    very earliest Mollusca or their forefathers were devoid of genital ducts and
                    pores. In no Mollusca, however, is the nephridium used in the same way as a
                    genital duct as it is in the Chaetopoda, the Gephyraea, and the Vertebrata; for
                    the open mouth of the nephridium in Mollusca leads into the pericardial space,
                    and it is not through this space and this mouth that the genital products of any
                    Mollusca enter the nephridium (except perhaps in Neomenia), although it is by
                    this mouth that the genital products enter the nephridium in the former classes
                    above named. Hence the arrangement in Patella, Ac., is to be looked upon as a
                    special development from the simpler condition when the Mollusca brought forth
                    by rupture ( = schizodinic, from ωδA, travail), and not as derived from the
                    common arrangement of adaptation of a nephridium to the genital efferent
                    function ( = nephrodinic).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Coelomate animals are, according to this nomenclature, either Schizodinic or
                    Porodinic. The Porodinic group is divisible into Nephrodinic and Idiodinic, in
                    the former the nephridium serving as a pore, in the latter a special (ι <hi

                    groups the pore maybe—(1) devoid of a duct, (2) provided with a duct which is
                    unattached to the gonad and opens into the body- cavity, (3) provided with a
                    duct which fuses with the gonad. The genital ducts of Idiodinic forms may be
                    called Idiogonaducts, as distinguished from the Nephrogonaducts of nephrodinic
                    forms.</p></note></p>
                <p>The functional oviduct of Nautilus forms an albuminiparous gland as a
                    diverticulum, which appears to correspond to a dilatation in the male duct,
                    which succeeds the testis itself, and is called the “accessory gland.” The male
                    duct has a second dilatation (Needham’s sac), and then is produced in the form
                    of a large papilla. In Dibranchs the genital ducts are but little more
                    elaborated. They are ciliated internally. In female Octopoda, in Ommastrephes,
                    and in one male Octopod <hi rend="italic">(El</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >edone</hi><hi rend="italic">mosc∕ιata)</hi> the genital ducts are paired,
                    opening right and left of the anus. But in all other Dibranchs a single genital
                    duct only is developed, viz., that of the left side, and leads from the genital
                    capsule or chamber of the gonad to an asymmetrically-placed pore. In the male
                    Dibranchs the genital duct is coiled and provided with a series of glandular
                    dilatations and receptacles. These are connected with the formation of the
                    spermatophores. In the Siphonopoda the spermatic fluid does not flow as a liquid
                    from the genital pore, but the spermatozoa are made up into little packets
                    before extrusion. In other Mollusca (Pulmonata) and in other animals
                    (Chaetopoda) this formation of “sperm-ropes” is known, but in the Siphonopoda it
                    attains its highest development. Exceedingly complicated structures of a
                    cylindrical form (sometimes an inch in length) are formed in the male genital
                    duct by a secretion which embeds and cements together the spermatozoa. They are
                    formed in Nautilus as well as in Dibranchs, the actual manner in which their
                    complicated structure is produced being not easily conjectured. Accessory glands
                    not forming part of the oviduct, but furnishing the material for enclosing the
                    eggs in an elastic envelope, are found as paired structures, opening some way
                    behind the anus in Nautilus (101, <hi rend="italic">g.n.)</hi> and in the
                    Dibranchs. They are known as the nidamental glands. In the female Sepia they are
                    particularly large and prominent, and are accompanied by a second smaller
                    pair.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Reproduction and Development.—</hi> The details of sexual
                    congress and of the actual fertilization of the egg are quite unknown in
                    Nautilus, and imperfectly in the Dibranchs and the Pteropoda. Allusion has
                    already been made to the subject in connexion with the hectocotylized arm. The
                    mature eggs of Nautilus are unknown, as well as the appearance which they
                    present when deposited. In the Dibranchs the eggs are always very large; in some
                    cases the amount of food-yelk infused into the original egg-cell is so great as
                    to give it the size of a large pea. This results in that mode of development
                    which is only known outside this class among the Vertebrata; it is discoblastic.
                    The protoplasm of the fertilized egg-cell segregates to one pole of the egg, and
                    there undergoes cell-division, resulting in the formation of a disc of cleavage
                    cells (fig. 121, (1)) resembling the cicatricula of the hen’s egg, which
                    subsequently spreads over and invests the whole <hi rend="italic">egg (fig.</hi>
                    121, (2)). For details of this process we must refer the reader to other works
                    (45, 46); but it may here be noted that in addition to the layer of cleavage
                    cells, which consists of more than one stratum of cells in the future embryonic
                    area as opposed to the yelk-sac area, additional cells are formed in the mass of
                    residual yelk apparently by an independent process of segregation, each cell
                    having a separate origin, whence they are termed “autoplasts.” The autoplasts
                    eventually form a layer of fusiform cells (fig. 121, (7), Ä; fig. 122, <hi
                    rend="italic">m;</hi> and fig. 123, <hi rend="italic">ps</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> y</hi><hi rend="italic">),—</hi> the “yelk-membrane” which
                    everywhere rests upon and encloses the residual yelk. The cleavage cells form a
                    single layer on the yelk-sac area and two layers on the embryonic area, an outer
                    layer one cell deep (fig. 122, ψ), and an inner—the middle layer of the
                    three—which is often thick and many cells deep (fig. 122, <hi rend="italic"
                    >m).</hi> There is great difficulty here in identifying the layers with the
                    three typical layers of other animal embryos, except in regard to the outermost,
                    which corresponds with the epiblast of Vertebrates in many respects. The middle
                    layer, however, gives rise to the nerve-ganglia as well as to the muscles,
                    coelom, and skeleto-trophic tissues, and to the mid-portion of the alimentary
                    canal with its hepatic diverticula, the liver (see fig. 121, (7) and
                    explanation, where the origin of the mid-gut as a vesicle <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> is seen). It is clearly, therefore, something more than the mesoblast of
                    the Vertebrate, giving rise, as it does, to important organs formed both by
                    epiblast and hypoblast in other animals. Lastly, the yelkmembrane, though
                    corresponding to the Vertebrate hypoblast in position and structure, furnishes
                    no part of the alimentary tract, but disappears when the yelk is completely
                    absorbed. In fact, the developmental phenomena in Sepia, Loligo, and Octopus are
                    profoundly perturbed by the excessive proportion of food-yelk. Balfour has shown
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n710/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0710-0683"/> that in the chick the orifice of closure of the
                    overspreading blastoderm does not represent the whole of the blastopore, but
                    that this is in part to be sought in the widely-separated primitive streak. The
                    present writer has little doubt that a structure corresponding to the primitive
                    streak of the chick, and lying near the klastic pole, will be found in Sepia and
                    Loligo, and the strange vesicular origin of the mid-gut will be traced to and
                    explained by it.</p>
                <p>Leaving this difficult question of the cell-layers of the embryo, we would draw
                    the reader’s attention to the series of sketches representing the
                    semi-transparent embryo of Loligo, drawn in fig. 121. When the cleavage cells
                    have nearly enclosed the yelk, the upper or embryonic area shows the rudiments
                    of the centro-dorsal mantle-sac or pen-sac, the mouth, the paired optic pits,
                    and the paired otic pits (fig. 121, (3), (5)). The eye-pits close up (fig. 119),
                    the orifice of the mantle-sac narrows, and its margin becomes raised and freely
                    produced as mantle-skirt; at the same time an hour-glass-like pinching in of the
                    whole embryo commences, separating the embryo proper from the so-called yelk-sac
                    (fig. 121, (4) ). Around the “waist” of constriction, pair by pair, ten lobes
                    arise (fig. 121, (8) ),—the arms of the fore-foot. It now becomes obvious that
                    the yelk-sac is but the median surface of the fore-foot bulged out inordinately
                    by food-yelk, just as the hind region of the foot is in the embryo slug (see
                    fig. 72**, and explanation). Just as in the slug, this dilated yelkholding foot
                    is rhythmically contractile, and pulsates steadily over the area <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> in fig. 121, (4). At this stage, and long subsequently, the
                    mouth of the young Cephalopod is in no way surrounded by the fore-foot, but lies
                    well above its nascent lobes (e in fig. 121). Subsequently it sinks, as it were,
                    between the right and left most anterior pair of the series, which grow towards
                    one another and fuse above it, and leave no trace of their original position and
                    relations. Fig. 121, (6) gives a view of the postero-dorsal surface of an
                    embryo, in which the important fact is seen of the formation of the funnel or
                    siphon by the union of two pieces (&lt;?), which grow up each independently, one
                    right and one left, like the sides of the siphon of Nautilus or the swimming
                    lobes of a Pteropod, and subsequently come together, as shown in (9), where the
                    same letter <hi rend="italic">q</hi> indicates the same part. The explanations
                    of figs. 121 and 123 are given very full, and here, therefore, we shall only
                    allude to two additional points. A curious mass of tissue of unknown
                    significance occurs in the orbit of Dibranchs, known as the white body <hi
                    rend="italic">(w</hi> in fig. 120). A strongly-marked invagination just above
                    the orbit is a very prominent feature in the embryo of Loligo, Sepia, and
                    Octopus, and appears to give rise to this so-called white body. This invaginated
                    portion of the outer cell-layer is seen in fig. 121, (8) and (9), lettered c; in
                    fig. 123, A and B, it is lettered <hi rend="italic">wb.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, in fig. 123, A, the origin of the optic nerveganglion <hi rend="italic"
                    >ng</hi> from the cells of the middle layer should be especially noticed. In
                    some other Molluscs the nerveganglia have been definitely traced to the outer

                    Bobretzky, they originate, as here shown, for Loligo.</p>
                <p>The egg-coverings of the Dibranchiate are very complete. Argonauta and Octopus
                    deposit each egg in a firm oval case, thin and transparent, which has a long
                    stalk by which (in Octopus) the egg is fixed in company with two or three
                    hundred others to some foreign object. Sepia encloses each egg in a thick
                    envelope of many layers resembling india-rubber. Loligo encloses many rows of
                    eggs in a copious tough jelly, and affixes a dozen or twenty such egg-strings to
                    one spot. Sepia and Loligo desert their eggs when laid. The female Octopus most
                    jealously guards them, building a nest of stones and incubating. Argonauta
                    carries hers with her in a special brood-holding shell.</p>
                <p>The development of the Pteropoda, so far as is known, presents no points of
                    contact with that of the Siphonopoda rather than with that of the Gastropoda,
                    owing to the fact that in them the egg has not an excess of food-yelk.
                    Consequently, we find typical trochosphere and veliger larvae among the
                    Thecosomata (fig. 8, C, and fig. 81), whilst the isolated observation of
                    Gegenbaur has made known very remarkable larvae referable to the Gymnosomata,
                    and with little doubt to Pneumodermon (fig. 84). The former set of larvae are
                    sufficient to demolish once for all the view which has been entertained by some
                    zoologists, viz., that the velar disc of the veliger larva is the same thing as
                    the pteropodial lobes of the mid-foot of Pteropoda. The latter larvae are of
                    importance in showing that, as in embryo Siphonopods so in embryo Pteropods, the
                    sucker-bearing lobes of the fore-foot are truly podial structures, and only
                    embrace the head and surround the mouth as the result of late embryonic
                    growth.</p>

                    rend="italic">Characters.—</hi> Mollusca with the head region undeveloped. No
                    cephalic eyes are present; the buccal cavity is devoid of biting, rasping, or
                    prehensile organs. The animal is sessile, or endowed with very feeble locomotive
                    powers. The Lipocephala comprise but one class, the Lamellibranchia, also known
                    as Elatobranchia and Conchifera.</p>
                <p>Class LAMELLIBRANCHIA.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">bilateral symmetry</hi> of the Mollusca is usually fully
                    retained, and raised to a dominant feature of the organization by the lateral
                    compression of the body and the development of the shell as two bilaterally
                    symmetrical plates or valves covering each one side of the animal. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">foot</hi> is commonly a simple cylindrical or
                    ploughshare-shaped organ, used for boring in sand and mud, and more rarely
                    presents a crawling disc similar to that of Gastropoda; in some forms it is
                    aborted. The paired <hi rend="smallcaps">ctenidia</hi> are very greatly
                    developed right and left of the elongated body, and form the most prominent
                    organ of the group. Their function is chiefly not respiratory but nutritive,
                    since it is by the currents produced by their ciliated surface that
                    food-particles are brought to the feebly-developed mouth and buccal cavity.</p>
                <p>The Lamellibranchia present as a whole a somewhat uniform structure, so that,
                    although they are very numerous, it is not possible to divide them into
                    well-marked sub-classes or sections, and orders. The chief points in -which they
                    vary are—(1) in the structure of the ctenidia or branchial plates; (2) in the
                    presence of one or of two chief muscles, the fibres of which run across the
                    animal’s body from one valve of the shell to the other (adductors); (3) in the
                    greater or less elaboration of the posterior portion of the mantleskirt so as to
                    form a pair of tubes, by one of which water is introduced into the sub-pallial
                    chamber, whilst by the other it is expelled; (4) in the perfect or deficient
                    symmetry of the two valves of the shell and the connected soft parts, as
                    compared with one another; (5) in the development of the foot as a disc-like
                    crawling organ (Arca, Nucula, Pectunculus, Trigonia, Lepton, Galeomma), as a
                    simple ploughlike or tongue-shaped organ (Unionacea, &lt;fcc.), as a re-curved
                    saltatory organ (Cardium, &amp;c.), as a long burrowing cylinder (Solenacea,
                    &lt;fcc.), or its partial (Mytilacea) or even complete abortion (Ostracea).</p>
                <p>The essential Molluscan organs are, with these exceptions, uniformly well
                    developed. The <hi rend="smallcaps">mantle-skirt</hi> is always long, and hides
                    the rest of the animal from view, its dependent margins meeting in the middle
                    line below the ventral surface when the animal is retracted; it is, as it were,
                    slit in the median line before and behind so as to form two flaps, a right and a
                    left; on these the right and the left calcareous valves of the shell are borne
                    respectively, connected by an uncalcified part of the shell called the ligament.
                    In many embryo Lamellibranchs a centro-dorsal <hi rend="smallcaps">primitive
                    shell-gland</hi> or follicle has been detected (figs. 8 and 151). The <hi

                <p>Both <hi rend="smallcaps">ctenidia</hi> right and left are invariably present,
                    the axis of each taking origin from the side of the body as in the schematic
                    archi-Mollusc (see fig. 1 and fig. 131). A pair of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nephridia</hi> opening right and left, rather far forward on the sides of the
                    body, are always present. Each opens by its internal extremity into the
                    pericardium. A pair of <hi rend="smallcaps">genital apertures,</hi> connected by
                    genital ducts -with the paired gonads, are found right and left near the
                    nephridial pores, except in a few cases where the genital duct joins that of the
                    nephridium (Spondylus). The sexes are often, but not always, distinct. No
                    accessory glands or copulatory organs are ever present in Lamellibranchs. The
                    ctenidia often act as brood-pouches.</p>
                <p>A dorsal contractile <hi rend="smallcaps">heart,</hi> with symmetrical right and

                    The typical <hi rend="smallcaps">pericardium</hi> is well developed. It appears,
                    as in other Mollusca, not to be a blood-space although developed from the
                    coelom, and it communicates with the exterior by the pair of nephridia. As in
                    Cephalopoda (and possibly other Mollusca) water can be introduced through the
                    nephridia into this space. The <hi rend="smallcaps">alimentary canal</hi> keeps
                    very nearly to the median vertical plane whilst exhibiting a number of flexures
                    and loopings in this plane. A pair of large glandular outgrowths, the so-called
                    “liver” or great digestive gland, exists as in other Molluscs. A pair of pedal
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">otocysts,</hi> and a pair of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >osphradia</hi> at the base of the gills, appear to be always present. A typical
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">nervous system</hi> is present (fig. 144), consisting of a
                    cerebro-pleuro-visceral ganglion-pair, united by connectives to a pedal
                    ganglion-pair and an osphradial ganglion-pair (parieto-splanchnic).</p>
                <p>A special caecum connected with the pharynx is sometimes found, containing a
                    tough flexible cylinder of transparent cartilaginous appearance and unknown
                    significance, called the “crystalline style” (Mactra), which possibly represents
                    the radular sac of Glossophora. In manyLamellibranchs a gland is found on the
                    hinder surface of the foot in the mid line, which secretes a substance which
                    sets into the form of threads—the so-called “byssus ”—by means of which the
                    animal can fix itself. Sometimes this gland is found in the young and not in the
                    adult (Anodon, Unio, Cyclas). In some Lamellibranchs (Pecten, Spondylus, Pholas,
                    Mactra, Tellina, Pectunculus, Galeomma, &amp;c.), although cephalic eyes are
                    always absent, special eyes are developed on the free margin of the
                    mantle-skirt, apparently by the modification of tentacles which are commonly
                    found there (fig. 145). The existence of pores in the foot and elsewhere in
                    Lamellibranchia by which liquid can pass into and out of the vascular system,
                    although asserted as in the case of other Mollusca, appears to be improbable. It
                    has yet to be shown by satisfactory microscopic sections that the supposed pores
                    are anything but epidermal glands.</p>
                <p>The Lamellibranchia live chiefly in the sea, some in fresh waters. A very few
                    have the power of swimming by opening and shutting the valves of the shell
                    (Pecten, Lima); most can slowly crawl or rapidly burrow; others are, when adult,
                    permanently fixed to stones or rocks either by the shell or the byssus. In
                    development some Lamellibranchia pass through a free-swimming trochosphere stage
                    with praeoral ciliated band; other fresh-water forms which carry the young in
                    brood-pouches formed by the ctenidia have suppressed this larval phase.</p>
                <p>The following classification and enumeration of genera are based primarily upon
                    the characters of the adductor muscles. The Heteromya and Monomya must be
                    conceived of as derived from forms resembling such Gastropodous Isomya as Nucula
                    and Trigonia, which undoubtedly are the nearest living representatives of the
                    ancestral Lipocephala, and bring us nearest to the other branch of the Mollusca,
                    the Glossophora.</p>

                    Lamellibranchia are the only members of the Lipocephalous branch of Mollusca
                    existing at the present day; and we must suppose that, whilst on the one hand
                    the earliest Glossophorous forms were developing from the archi-Mollusca by the
                    elaboration of the buccal apparatus, the bivalved sessile Lamellibranchs were
                    developing in another direction from univalve cephalophorous ancestors. The
                    large bilobed mantle-flap with its pair of shells covering in the whole animal,
                    the current-producing largely-expanded ctenidia, and the reduced cephalic region
                    are characters which go hand in hand, and were simultaneously acquired, each
                    being related to the development of the others. Unless the “crystalline style”
                    of Lamellibranchs is to be considered as the rudiment of the “radular sac” of
                    Glossophora, as suggested by Balfour, there is no indication whatever that the
                    ancestors of the Lamellibranchia had acquired a representative of the buccal
                    apparatus—so highly developed in Glossophora—before diverging from the
                    archi-Mollusca; that is to say, the common ancestors of the two great branches
                    of Mollusca presented the distinctive character of neither branch—they had not
                    an aborted cephalic region, and they had not a lingual ribbon.</p>
                <p>As an example of the organization of a Lamellibranch, we shall review the
                    structure of the Common Pond-Mussel <hi rend="italic">(Anodonta cygneai),</hi>
                    comparing its structure with those of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0713-0686"/> other Lamellibranchia. The Swan Mussel has
                    superficially a perfectly-developed bilateral symmetry. The left side of the
                    animal is seen as when removed from its shell in fig. 124 (1). The valves of the
                    shell have been removed by severing their adhesions to the muscular areae <hi
                    rend="italic">h, i,</hi> Z∙, <hi rend="italic">I, m, u.</hi></p>
                <p>The free edge of the left half of the mantle-skirt <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    represented as a little contracted in order to show the exactly similar free
                    edge of the right half of the mantle-skirt c. These edges are not attached to,
                    although they touch, one another; each flap (right or left) can be freely thrown
                    back in the way which has been carried out in fig. 124, (3) for that of the left
                    side. This is not always the case with Lamellibranchs; there is in the group a
                    tendency for the corresponding edges of the mantle-skirt to fuse together by
                    concrescence, and so to form a more or less completely closed bag, as in the
                    Scaphopoda (Dentalium). In this way the notches <hi rend="italic">d, e</hi> of
                    the hinder part of the mantle-skirt of Anodon are in the Siphonate forms
                    converted into two separate holes, the edges of the mantle being elsewhere fused
                    together along this hinder margin. Further than this, the part of the
                    mantle-skirt bounding the two holes is frequently drawn out so as to form a pair
                    of tubes which project from the shell (figs. 130, 141). In such Lamellibranchs
                    as the oysters, scallops, and many others which have the edges of the
                    mantle-skirt quite free, there are numerous tentacles upon those edges. In
                    Anodon these palliai tentacles are confined to a small area surrounding the
                    inferior siphonal notch (fig. 124, (3), <hi rend="italic">t).</hi></p>
                <p>The centro-dorsal point <hi rend="italic">a</hi> of the animal of Anodonta (fig.
                    124, (1)) is called the umbonal area; the great anterior muscular surface <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> is that of the anterior adductor muscle, the posterior
                    similar surface <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is that of the posterior adductor
                    muscle; the long line of attachment <hi rend="italic">u</hi> is the simple
                    “palliai muscle,”—a thickened ridge which is seen to run parallel to the margin
                    of the mantle-skirt in this Lamellibranch. In some of the Siphonate Isomya,
                    which are hence termed “Sinupallia,” the palliai muscle is not simple but deeply
                    incurved at the posterior region so as to allow of the large palliai siphons
                    being retracted within the shell or expanded at will (fig. 127, and figs. 140,
                    141).</p>
                <p>It is the approximate equality in the size of the anterior and posterior adductor
                    muscles which has led to the name Isoyma for the group to which Anodon belongs.
                    The hinder adductor muscle may be considered as representing morphologically the
                    transverse fibres of the root of the foot of Nautilus by which it adheres to its
                    shell (fig. 91, <hi rend="italic">k),</hi> the annular muscular area of Patella
                    (fig. 2 7, c), and thecolumella muscle of the Gastropods generally. It is always
                    large in Lamellibranchs, but the.anterior adductor may be very small
                    (Heteromya), or absent altogether (Monomya). The anterior adductor muscle is in
                    front of the mouth and alimentary tract altogether, and must be regarded as a
                    special and peculiar development of the median anterior part of the mantle-flap
                    in Heteromya and Isomya. Amongst those Lamellibranchs which have only a
                    posterior adductor (Monomya), it is remarkable that the oyster has been found
                    (by Huxley) to possess, when the young shells and muscles first develop, a
                    well-marked anterior adductor as well as a posterior one. Accordingly there is
                    ground for supposing <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n714/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0714-0687"/> that the Monomya have been developed from
                    Isomya-like ancestors, and have lost by atrophy their anterior adductor. The
                    single adductor muscle of the Monomya is separated by a difference of fibre into
                    two portions, but neither of these can be regarded as possibly represent ing the
                    anterior adductor of the other Lamellibranchs. One of these portions is more
                    ligamentous, and serves to keep the two shells constantly attached to one
                    another, whilst the more fleshy por tion serves to close the shell rapidly when
                    it has been gaping.</p>
                <p>In removing the valves of the shell from an Anodon, it is necessary not only to
                    cut through the muscular attachments of the body-wall to the shell but to sever
                    also a strong elastic ligament, or spring resembling india-rubber, joining the
                    two shells about the umbonal area. The shell of Anodon does not present these
                    parts in the most strongly marked condition, and accordingly our figures (figs.
                    125, 126, 127) represent the valves of the Sinupalliate genus Cytherea. The
                    corresponding parts are recognizable in Anodon. Referring to the figures (125,
                    126) for an explanation of terms applicable to the parts of the valve and the
                    markings on its inner surface — corresponding to the muscular area which we have
                    already noted on the surface of the animal’s body—we must specially note here
                    the position of that denticulated thickening of the dorsal margin of the valve
                    which is called the hinge (fig. 127). By this hinge one valve is closely fitted
                    to the other. Below this hinge each shell becomes concave, above it each shell
                    rises a little to form the umbo, and it is into this ridge-like upgrowth of each
                    valve that the elastic ligament or spring is fixed (fig. 127). As shown in the
                    diagram (fig. 127*) representing a transverse section of the two valves of a
                    Lamellibranch, the two shells form a double lever, of which the toothed-hinged
                    is the fulcrum. The adductor muscles placed in the concavity of the shells act
                    upon the long arms of the lever at a mechanical advantage; their contraction
                    keeps the shells shut, and stretches the ligament or spring <hi rend="italic"
                    >h.</hi> On the other hand, the ligament <hi rend="italic">h</hi> acts upon the
                    short arm formed by the umbonal ridge of the shells; whenever the adductors
                    relax, the elastic substance of the ligament contracts, and the shells gape. It
                    is on this account that the valves of a dead Lamellibranch always gape; the
                    elastic ligament is no longer counteracted by the effort of the adductors. The
                    state of closure of the valves of the shell is not, therefore, one of rest; when
                    it is at rest—that is, when there is no muscular effort—the valves of a
                    Lamellibranch are slightly gaping, and are closed by the action of the adductors
                    when the animal is disturbed. The ligament is simple in Anodon; in many
                    Lamellibranchs it is separated into two layers, an outer and an inner (thicker
                    and denser). That the condition of gaping of the shell-valves is essential to
                    the life of the Lamellibranch appears from the fact that food to nourish it,
                    water to aerate its blood, and spermatozoa to fertilize its eggs, are all
                    introduced into this gaping chamber by currents of water, which are set going by
                    the highly-developed ctenidia. The current of water enters into the sub-pallial
                    space at the spot marked <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in fig. 124, (1), and, after
                    passingas far forward as the mouth <hi rend="italic">w</hi> in fig. 124, (5),
                    takes an outward course and leaves the sub-pallial space by the upper notch <hi
                    rend="italic">d.</hi> These notches are known in Anodon as the afferent and
                    efferent siphonal notches respectively, and correspond to the long tube-like
                    afferent inferior and efferent superior “siphons” formed by the mantle in many
                    other Lamellibranchs (fig. 130).</p>
                <p>Whilst the valves of the shell are equal in Anodon we find in many Lamellibranchs
                    (Ostraea, Chama, Corbula, &lt;fcc.) one valve larger, and the other smaller and
                    sometimes flat, whilst the larger shell may be fixed to rock or to stones
                    (Ostraea, &lt;kc.). A further variation consists in the development of
                    additional shelly plates upon the dorsal line between the two large valves
                    (Pholadidae). In <hi rend="italic">Pkolas dactylus</hi> we find a pair of
                    umbonal plates, a dors-umbonal plate and a dorsal plate. It is to be remembered
                    that the whole of the cuticular hard product produced on the dorsal surface and
                    on the mantle-flaps is to be regarded as the “shell,” of which a median
                    band-like area, the ligament, usually remains uncalcified, so as to result in
                    the production of two valves united by the elastic ligament. But the shelly
                    substance does not always in boring forms adhere to this form after its first
                    growth. In Aspergillum the whole of the tubular mantle area secretes a
                    continuous shelly tube, although in the young condition two valves were present.
                    These are seen (fig. 129) set in the firm substance of the adult tubular shell,
                    w <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> hich has even replaced the ligament, so that
                    the tube is complete. In Teredo a similar tube is formed as the animal elongates
                    (boring in wood), the original shellvalves not adhering to it but remaining
                    movable and provided with a special muscular apparatus in place of a
                    ligament.</p>
                <p>Let us now examine the organs which lie beneath the mantle-skirt of Anodon, and
                    are bathed by the current of water which cir culates through it. This can be
                    done by lifting up and throwing back the left half of the mantle-skirt as is
                    represented in fig. 124, (3). We thus expose the ploughlike foot (∕), the two
                    left labial tentacles, and the twσ left gill-plates or left ctenidium. In fig.
                    124, (5), one of the labial tentacles <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is also thrown
                    back so as to show <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n715/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0715-0688"/> the mouth <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> and the two
                    left gill-plates are reflected so as to show the gill-plates of the right side
                    (rr, <hi rend="italic">rq)</hi> projecting behind the foot, the inner or median
                    plate of each side being united by concrescence to its fellow of the opposite
                    side along a continuous line (αα). The left inner gill-plate is also snipped so
                    as to show the subjacent orifices of the left nephridium <hi rend="italic"
                    >x,</hi> and of the genital gland (testis or ovary) y. The foot thus exposed in
                    Anodon is a simple muscular tongue-like organ. It can be protruded between the
                    flaps of the mantle (fig. 124, (1), (2) ) so as to issue from the shell, and by
                    its action the Anodon can slowly crawl, or burrow in soft mud or sand. It has
                    been supposed that water is taken into the blood-vessels of the Anodon through
                    pores in the foot, and in spite of opposition this view is still maintained
                    (Griesbach, 47). In fig. 124, (2) the letters <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ac, ad,</hi> point to three pit-like depressions, supposed by
                    Griesbach to be pores leading into the blood-system. According to Carrière (48)
                    these pits are nothing but irregularities of the surface; in some cases they are
                    the entrances to ramified glands. Other Lamellibranchs may have a larger foot
                    relatively than has Anodon. In Area it has a sole-like surface. In Area too and
                    many others it carries a byssus-forming gland and a byssus-cementing gland. In
                    the Cockles, in Cardium, and in Trigonia, it is capable of a sudden stroke,
                    which causes the animal to jump when out of the water, in the latter genus to a
                    height of four feet. In Mytilus the foot is reduced to little more than a
                    tubercle carrying the apertures of these glands. In the Oyster it is absent
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>The labial tentacles of Anodon (η, o in fig. 124, (3), (5) ) are highly vascular
                    flat processes richly supplied with nerves. The left anterior tentacle (seen in
                    the figure) is joined at its base in front of the mouth (w) to the right
                    anterior tentacle, and similarly the left (o) and right posterior tentacles are
                    joined behind the mouth. Those of Area <hi rend="italic">(i, k</hi> in fig. 132)
                    show this relation to the mouth (a). These organs are characteristic of all
                    Lamellibranchs; they do not vary except in size, being sometimes drawn out to
                    streamer-like dimensions. Their appearance and position suggest that they are in
                    some way related morphologically to the gill-plates, the anterior labial
                    tentacle being a continuation of the outer gill-plate, and the posterior a
                    continuation of the inner gill-plate. There is no embryological evidence to
                    support this suggested connexion, and, as will appear immediately, the history
                    of the gill-plates in various forms of Lamellibranchs does not directly favour
                    it. Yet it is very probable that the labial tentacles and gill-plates are
                    modifications of a double horseshoe-shaped area of ciliated filamentous
                    processes which existed in ancestral Mollusca much as in Phoronis and the
                    Polyzoa, and is to be compared with the continuous prae-and post-oral ciliated
                    band of the Echinid larva Pluteus and of Tornaria (49).</p>
                <p>The gill-plates have a structure very different from that of the labial
                    tentacles, and one which in Anodon is singularly complicated as compared with
                    the condition presented by these organs in some other Lamellibranchs, and with
                    what must have been their original condition in the ancestors of the whole
                    series of living Lamellibranchia. The phenomenon of “concrescence” which we have
                    already had to note as showing itself so importantly in regard to the free edges
                    of the mantle-skirt and the formation of the siphons, is what, above all things,
                    has complicated the structure of the Lamellibranch ctenidium. Our present
                    knowledge of the interesting series of modifications through λvhich the
                    Lamellibranch gill-plates have developed to their most complicated form is due
                    to R. Holman Peck (50) and to Mitsukuri (51). The Molluscan ctenidium is
                    typically, as shown in fig. 2, a plume-like structure, consisting of a vascular
                    axis, on each side of which is set a row of numerous lamelliform or filamentous
                    processes. These processes are hollow, and receive the venous blood from, and
                    return it again aerated into, the hollow axis, in which an afferent and an
                    efferent blood-vessel may be differentiated. In the genus Nucula (fig. 134), one
                    of the Arcaceae, we have an example of a Lamellibranch retaining this plume-like
                    form of gill. In other Arcaceae <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Arca and
                    Pectunculus) the lateral processes which are set on the axis of the ctenidium
                    are not lamellae, but are slightly-flattened, very long tubes or hollow
                    filaments. These filaments are so fine and are set so closely together that they
                    appear to form a continuous membrane until examined with a lens. The microscope
                    shows that the neighbouring filaments are held together by patches of cilia,
                    called “ciliated junctions,” which interlock with one another just as two
                    brushes may be made to do. Jn fig. 133, A a portion of four filaments of a
                    ctenidium of the Sea-Mussel (Mytilus) is represented, having precisely the same
                    structure as those of Area. The filaments of the gill (ctenidium) of Mytilus and
                    Area thus form two closely set rows which depend from the axis of the gill like
                    two parallel plates. Further, their structure is profoundly modified by the
                    curious condition of the free ends of the depending filaments. These are
                    actually reflected at a sharp angle—</p>

                <p>doubled on themselves in fact—and thus form an additional row of filaments (see
                    fig. 133, B). Consequently, each primitive filament has a descending and an
                    ascending ramus, and instead of each row forming a simple plate, the plate is
                    double, consisting of a descending and an ascending lamella. As the axis of the
                    ctenidium lies by the side of the body, and is very frequently connate with the
                    body, as so often happens in Gastropods also, we find it convenient to speak of
                    the two plate-like structures formed on each ctenidial axis as the outer and the
                    inner gill-plate; each of these is composed of two lamellae, an outer (the
                    reflected) and an adaxial in the case of the outer gill-plate, and an adaxial
                    and an inner (the reflected) in the case of the inner gill-plate. This is the
                    condition seen in Area and Mytilus, the so-called plates dividing upon the
                    slightest touch into their constituent filaments, which are but loosely
                    conjoined by their “ciliated junctions.” Complications follow upon this in other
                    forms. Even in Mytilus and Area a connexion is here and there formed between the
                    ascending and descending rami of a filament by hollow extensible outgrowths
                    called “interlamellar junctions” <hi rend="italic">(il</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >J</hi> in B, fig. 133). Nevertheless the filament is a complete tube formed of
                    chitonous substance and clothed externally by ciliated epithelium, internally by
                    endothelium and lacunar tissue— a form of connective tissue—as shown in fig.
                    133, C. Now let us suppose, as happens in the genus Dreissena— a genus not far
                    removed from Mytilus—that the ciliated inter-filamentar junctions (fig. 136)
                    give place to solid permanent inter-filamentar junctions, so that the filaments
                    are converted, as it were, into a trellis-work. Then let us suppose that the
                    inter-lamellar junctions which we have already noted in Mytilus become very
                    numerous, large, and irregular; by them the two trellis-works of filaments would
                    be united so as to leave only a sponge-like set of spaces between them. Within
                    the trabeculae of the sponge-work blood circulates, and between the trabeculae
                    the water passes, having entered by the apertures left in the trellis-work
                    formed by the united gill-filaments (fig. 138, A, B). The larger the
                    intra-lamellar spongy growth becomes, the more do the original gill-filaments
                    lose the character of blood-holding tubes and tend to become dense elastic rods
                    for the simple purpose of supporting the spongy growth. This is seen both in the
                    section of Dreissena gill (fig. 136) and in those of Anodon (fig. 137, A, B, C).
                    In the drawing of Dreissena the individual filaments <hi rend="italic">f, f,
                    f</hi> are cut across in one lamella at the horizon of an inter-filamentar
                    junction, in the other (lower in the figure) at a point where they are free. The
                    chitonous substance <hi rend="italic">ch</hi> is observed to be greatly
                    thickened as compared with what it is in fig. 133, C, tending in fact to
                    obliterate altogether the lumen of the filament. And in Anodon (fig. 137, C)
                    this obliteration is effected. In Anodon, besides being thickened, the skeletal
                    substance of the filament develops a specially dense rod-like body on each side
                    of each filament. Although the structure of the ctenidium is thus highly
                    complicated in Anodon, it is yet more so in some of the Siphonate genera of
                    Lamellibranchs. The filaments take on a secondary grouping, the surface of the
                    lamella being thrown into a series of half-cylindrical ridges, each consisting
                    of ten or twenty filaments; a filament <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n717/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0717-0690"/> of much greater strength and thickness than the
                    others may be placed between each pair of groups. In Anodon, as in many other
                    Lamellibranchs, the ova and hatched embryos are carried for a time in the
                    ctenidia or gill apparatus, and in this particular case the space between the
                    two lamellae of the outer gill-plate is that which serves to receive the ova
                    (fig. 137, A). The young are nourished by a substance formed by the cells which
                    cover the spongy inter-lamellar outgrowths.</p>
                <p>There are certain other points in the modification of the typical ctenidium which
                    must be noted in order to understand the ctenidium of Anodon. The axis of each
                    ctenidium, right and left, starts from a point well forward near the labial
                    tentacles, but it is at first only a ridge, and does not project as a free
                    cylindrical axis until the back part of the foot is reached. This is difficult
                    to see at all in Anodon, but if the mantle-skirt be entirely cleared away, and
                    if the dependent lamellae which spring from the ctenidial axis be carefully
                    cropped away so as to leave the axis itself intact, we obtain the form shown in
                    fig. 131, where <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> are
                    respectively the left and the right ctenidial axes projecting freely beyond the
                    body. In Area this can be seen with far less trouble, for the filaments are more
                    easily removed than are the consolidated lamellae formed by the filaments of
                    Anodon, and in Area the free axes of the ctenidia are large and firm in texture
                    (fig. 132, c, &lt;7).</p>
                <p>If we were to make a vertical section across the long axis of a Lamellibranch
                    which had the axis of its ctenidium free from its origin onwards, we should find
                    such relations as are shown in the diagram fig. 135, A. The gill axis <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> is seen lying in the sub-pallial chamber between the foot δ
                    and the mantle <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> From it depend the gill-filaments or
                    lamellae—formed by united filaments—drawn as black lines <hi rend="italic"
                    >f.</hi> On the left side these lamellae are represented as having only a small
                    reflected growth, on the right side the reflected ramus or lamella is complete
                    (∕r and <hi rend="italic">er).</hi> The actual condition in Anodon at the region
                    where the gills commence anteriorly is shown in fig. 135, B. The axis of the
                    ctenidium is seen to be adherent to, or fused by concrescence with, the
                    body-wall, and moreover on each side the outer lamella of the outer gill-plate
                    is fused to the mantle, whilst the inner lamella of the inner gill-plate is
                    fused to the foot. If we pass a little backwards and take another section nearer
                    the hinder margin of the foot, we <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n718/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0718-0691"/> get the arrangement shown diagrammatically in
                    fig. 135, C, and more correctly in fig. 142. In this region the inner lamellae
                    of the inner gill-plates are no longer affixed to the foot. Passing still
                    further back behind the foot, we find in Anodon the condition shown in the
                    section D, fig. 135. The axes <hi rend="italic">i</hi> are now free; the outer
                    lamellae of the outer gill-plates (er) still adhere by concrescence to the
                    mantleskirt, whilst the inner lamellae of the inner gill-plates meet one another
                    and fuse by concrescence at <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> In the lateral view of the
                    animal with reflected mantleskirt and gill-plates, the line of concrescence of
                    the inner lamellae of the inner gill-plates is readily seen; it is marked <hi
                    rend="italic">aa</hi> in fig. 124, (5). In the same figure the free part of the
                    inner lamella of the inner gill-plate resting on the foot is marked <hi
                    rend="italic">z,</hi> whilst the attached part—the most anterior—has been
                    snipped with scissors so as to show the genital and nephridial apertures <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> The concrescence, then, of
                    the free edge of the reflected lamellae of the gill-plates of Anodon is very
                    extensive. It is important, because such a concrescence is by no means
                    universal, and does not occur, for example, in Mytilus or in Area; further,
                    because when its occurrence is once appreciated, the reduction of the
                    gill-plates of Anodon to the plume-type of the simplest ctenidium presents no
                    difficulty; and, lastly, it has importance in reference to its physiological
                    significance. The mechanical result of the concrescence of the outer lamellae to
                    the mantle-flap, and of the inner lamellae to one another as shown in section D,
                    fig. 135, is that the sub-palliai space is divided into two spaces by a
                    horizontal septum. The upper space (t) communicates with the outer world by the
                    excurrent or superior siphonal notch of the mantle (fig. 124, cZ); the lower
                    space communicates by the lower siphonal notch (e in fig. 124). The only
                    communication between the two spaces, excepting through the trelliswork of the
                    gill-plates, is by the slit <hi rend="italic">{z</hi> in fig. 124, (5)) left by
                    the non-concrescence of a part of the inner lamella of the inner gill-plate with
                    the foot. A probe (y) is introduced through this slit-like passage, and it is
                    seen to pass out by the excurrent siphonal notch. It is through this passage, or
                    indirectly through the pores of the gill-plates, that the water introduced into
                    the lower sub-pallial space must pass on its way to the excurrent siphonal
                    notch. Such a subdivision of the palliai chamber, and direction of the currents
                    set up within it do not exist in a number of Lamellibranchs which have the
                    gill-lamellae comparatively free (Mytilus, Arca, Trigonia, &lt;tc.), and it is
                    in these forms that there is least modification by concrescence of the primary
                    filamentous elements of the lamellae. Probably the gill-structure of
                    Lamellibranchs will ultimately furnish some classificatory characters of value
                    when they have been thoroughly investigated throughout the class.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal of Anodon is shown in fig. 124, (4). The mouth is placed
                    between the anterior adductor and the foot; the anus opens on a median papilla
                    overlying the posterior adductor, and discharges into the superior palliai
                    chamber along which the excurrent stream passes. The coil of the intestine in
                    Anodon is similar to that of other Lamellibranchs, but the crystalline style and
                    its diverticulum are not present here. The rectum traverses the pericardium, and
                    has the ventricle of the heart wrapped, as it were, around it. This is not an
                    unusual arrangement in Lamellibranchs, and a similar disposition occurs in some
                    Gastropoda (Haliotis). A pair of ducts (αi) lead from the first enlargement of
                    the alimentary tract called stomach into a pair of large digestive glands, the
                    so-called liver, the branches of which are closely packed in this region (a/).
                    The food of the Anodon, as of other Lamellibranchs, consists of microscopic
                    animal and vegetable organisms, which are brought to the mouth by the stream
                    which sets into the sub-pallial chamber at the lower siphonal notch (e in fig.
                    124). Probably a straining of water from solid <pb break="no"

                    ctenidia or gill-plates.</p>
                <p>The heart of Anodon consists of a median ventricle embracing the rectum (fig.
                    143, A), and giving off an anterior and a posterior artery, and of two auricles
                    which open into the ventricle by orifices protected by valves.</p>
                <p>The blood is colourless, and has colourless amoeboid corpuscles floating in it.
                    In two Lamellibranchs, <hi rend="italic">Solen (Ceratisolen)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">legumen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Area</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Noae,</hi> the blood is crimson, owing to the presence of corpuscles
                    impregnated with haemoglobin (Lankester, 31). In Anodon the blood is driven by
                    the ventricle through the arteries into vessellike spaces, which soon become
                    irregular lacunae surrounding the viscera, but in parts— <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> the labial tentacles and walls of the gut—very fine vessels with
                    endothelial celllining are found. The blood makes its way by large veins to a
                    venous sinus which lies in the middle line below the heart, having the paired
                    renal organs (nephridia) placed between it and that organ. Hence it passes
                    through the vessels of the glandular walls of the nephridia right and left into
                    the gill-lamellse, whence it returns through many openings into the
                    widely-stretched auricles. A great deal more precision has been given to
                    accounts of the structure of arteries, veins, and capillaries in Anodon than the
                    facts warrant.</p>
                <p>The course of the bloodstream can only be somewhat vaguely inferred except in its
                    largest outlines. Distinct arterial and venous channels cannot be distinguished
                    in the gill-lamelke, in spite of what Langer (52) has written on the subject,
                    though it is highly probable that there is some kind of circulation in the
                    gills. In the filaments of the gill of Mytilus the tubular cavity is divided by
                    a more or less complete fibrous septum into two channels, presumably for an
                    ascending and a descending blood-current. The ventricle and auricles of Anodon
                    lie in a pericardium which is clothed with a pavement endothelium (&lt;Z, fig.
                    143). Veins are said by Keber and others to open anteriorly into it, but this
                    appears to be an error. It does not contain blood or communicate directly with
                    the blood-system; this isolation of the pericardium we have noted already in
                    Gastropods and Cephalopods. A good case for the examination of the question as
                    to whether blood enters the pericardium of Lamellibranchs, or escapes from the
                    foot, or by the renal organs when the animal suddenly contracts, is furnished by
                    the <hi rend="italic">Solen</hi><hi rend="italic">legumen,</hi> which has red
                    blood-corpuscles. According to observations made by Penrose (53) on an uninjured
                    <hi rend="italic">Solen</hi><hi rend="italic">legumen,</hi> no red corpuscles
                    are to be seen in the pericardial space, although the heart is filled with them,
                    and no such corpuscles are ever discharged by the animal when it is
                    irritated.</p>
                <p>The pair of nephridia of Anodon, called in Lamellibranchs the organ of Bojanus,
                    lie below the membranous floor of the pericardium, and open into it by two
                    well-marked apertures (e and <hi rend="italic">f</hi> in fig. 143). Each
                    nephridium, after being bent upon itself as shown in fig. 143, C, D, opens to
                    the exterior by a pore placed at the point marked <hi rend="italic">X</hi> in
                    fig. 124, (5), (6). It is no doubt possible, as in the</p>
                <p>Gastropoda and Cephalopoda, for water to enter from the exterior by the nephridia
                    into the pericardium, but that it ever does so is as yet not proved. What is
                    certain from the set of the ciliary currents is that liquid generally passes out
                    of the pericardium by the nephridia. One half of each nephridium is of a
                    dark-green colour and glandular (Λ in fig. 143). This opens into the reflected
                    portion which overlies it as shown in the diagram fig. 143, D, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i</hi>; the latter has non-glandular walls, and opens by the pore <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> to the exterior. The nephridia may be more ramified in
                    other Lamellibranchs than they are in Anodon. In some they are difficult to
                    discover. That of the common oyster has recently (1882) been detected by Hoek
                    (54). Each nephridium in the oyster is a pyriform sac, which communicates by a
                    narrow canal with the urino-genital groove placed to the front of the great
                    adductor muscle; by a second narrow canal it communicates with the pericardium.
                    From all parts of the pyriform sac narrow stalk-like tubes are given off, ending
                    in abundant widely-spread branching glandular caeca, which form the essential
                    renal secreting apparatus. The genital duct opens by a pore into the
                    urino-genital groove of the oyster (the same arrangement being repeated on each
                    side of the body) close to but distinct from the aperture of the nephridial
                    canal. Hence, except for the formation of a urino-genital groove, the apertures
                    are placed as they are in Anodon. Previously to Hoek’s discovery a
                    brown-coloured investment of the auricles of the heart of the oyster had been
                    supposed to represent the nephridia in a rudimentary state. This investment,
                    which occurs also in Mytilus but not in Anodon, may possibly consist of
                    secreting cells, and may be comparable to the pericardial accessory glandular
                    growths of Cephalopoda.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nervous System and Sense-organs.—</hi> In Anodon there are
                    three well-developed pairs of nerve-ganglia (fig. 144, B and fig. 124, (6)). An

                    it by a commissure, are the representatives of the cerebral, pleural, and
                    visceral ganglia of the typical Mollusc, which are not here differentiated as
                    they are in Gastropods (compare, however, fig. 67). A pair placed close together
                    in the foot (fig. 144, B, ά, and fig. 124, (6), <hi rend="italic">ax)</hi> are
                    the typical pedal ganglia; they are joined to the cerebro-pleuro - visceral
                    ganglia by connectives.</p>
                <p>Posteriorly beneath the posterior adductors, and covered only by a thin layer of
                    elongated epidermal cells, are the olfactory ganglia, their epidermal clothing
                    constituting the* pair of osphradia, which are thus seen in Lamellibranchs to
                    occupy their typical position and to have the typical innervation, —the nerve to
                    each osphradium being given off by the visceral ganglion— that is to say, by the
                    undifferentiated cerebro-pleuro-visceral ganglion of its proper side. This
                    identification of the posterior ganglion-pair of Lamellibranchs is due to
                    Spengel (11). Other anatomists have considered this ganglion-pair as
                    corresponding to either the pleural or the visceral of Gastropoda, or to both,
                    and very usually it is termed “the parieto-splanchnic” (Huxley).</p>
                <p>The sense-organs of Anodon other than the osphradia consist of a pair of otocysts
                    attached to the pedal ganglia (fig. 124, (6), <hi rend="italic">ay).</hi> The
                    otocysts of Cyclas are peculiarly favourable for study on account of the
                    transparency of the small foot in which they lie, and may be taken as typical of
                    those of Lamellibranchs generally. The structure of one is exhibited in fig.
                    146. A single otolith is present as in the veliger embryos of Opisthobranchia.
                    In adult Gastropoda there are frequently a large number of rod-like otoliths
                    instead of one.</p>
                <p>Anodon has no eyes of any sort, and the tentacles on the mantle edge are limited
                    to its posterior border. This deficiency is very usual in the class; at the same
                    time, many Lamellibranchs have tentacles on the edge of the mantle supplied by a
                    pair of large well-developed nerves, which are given off from the
                    cerebro-pleuro-visceral ganglion-pair, and very frequently some of these
                    tentacles have undergone a special metamorphosis converting them into
                    highly-organized eyes. Such eyes on the mantle-edge are found in Pecten,
                    Spondylus, Lima, Ostrea (?), Pinna, Pectunculus, Modiola, Mytilus (Î), Cardium,
                    Tellina, Mactra, Venus, Solen, Pholas, and Galeomma. They are totally distinct
                    from the cephalic eyes of typical Mollusca, and have a different structure and
                    historical development. They have not originated as pits but as tentacles. They
                    agree with the dorsal eyes of Onchidium (Pulmonata) in the curious fact that the
                    optic nerve penetrates the capsule of the eye and passes in front of the retinal
                    body (fig. 145), so that its fibres join the anterior faces of the nerve-end
                    cells as in Vertebrates, instead of their posterior faces as in the cephalic
                    eyes of Mollusca and Arthropoda; moreover, the lens is not a cuticular product
                    but a cellular structure, which, again, is a feature of agreement with the
                    Vertebrate eye. It must, however, be distinctly borne in mind that there is a
                    fundamental difference between the eye of Vertebrates and of all other groups in
                    the fact that in the Vertebrata the retinal body is itself a part of the central
                    nervous system, and not a separate modification of the epidermis—myelonic as
                    opposed to epidermic. The structure of the reputed eyes of several of the
                    above-named genera has not been carefully examined. In Pecten and Spondylus,
                    however, they have been fully studied (see fig. 145, and explanation).</p>
                <p>The gonads of Anodon are placed in distinct male and female individuals. In some
                    Lamellibranchs—for instance, the European Oyster and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pisidium pusilium—</hi> the sexes are united in the same individual; but here,
                    as in most hermaphrodite animals, the two sexual elements are not ripe in the
                    same individual at the same moment. It has been conclusively shown that the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ostrea edulis</hi> does not fertilize itself. The American Oyster
                    (0. <hi rend="italic">υirginiana)</hi> and the Portuguese Oyster (0. <hi
                    rend="italic">angulata)</hi> have the sexes separate, and fertilization is
                    effected in the open water after the discharge of the ova and the spermatozoa
                    from the females and males respectively. In the <hi rend="italic">Ostrea
                    edulis</hi> fertilization of the eggs is effected at the moment of their escape
                    from the uro-genital groove, or even before, by means of spermatozoa drawn into
                    the sub-pallial chamber by the incurrent ciliary stream, and the embryos pass
                    through the early stages of development whilst entangled between the
                    gill-lamellae of the female parent (fig. 6). In Anodon the eggs pass into the
                    space between the two lamellae of the outer gill-plate, and are there
                    fertilized, and advance whilst still in this position to the glochidium phase of
                    development (fig. 147). They may be found here in thousands in the summer and
                    autumn months. The gonads themselves are extremely simple arborescent glands
                    which open to the exterior by two simple ducts, one right and one <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n721/mode/1up"

                    branches of the gland (fig. 124, (5), (6), <hi rend="italic">y).</hi> In no
                    Lamellibranch is there a divergence from this structure, excepting that in some
                    (Ostrea) the contiguous nephridial and the genital aperture are sunk in a
                    urino-genital groove, which in other cases (Spondylus ?) may partially close up
                    so as to constitute a single pore for the nephridial and genital ducts. No
                    accessory genital glands are present.</p>
                <p>The development of Anodon is remarkable for the curious larval form known as
                    Glochidium (fig. 147). The Glochidium quits the gill-pouch of its parent and
                    swims by alternate opening and shutting of the valves of its shell, as do adult
                    Pecten and Lima, trailing at the same time a long byssus thread. By this it is
                    brought into contact with the fin of a fish, such as Perch, Stickleback, or
                    others, and effects a hold thereon by means of the toothed edge of its shells.
                    Here it becomes encysted, and is nourished by the exudations of the fish. A
                    distinct development of its internal organs has been traced by the late
                    Professor Balfour, but no one has followed it to the moment at which it drops
                    from the fish’s fin and assumes the form of shell characteristic of the parent.
                    Other Lamellibranchs exhibit either a trochosphere larva which becomes a
                    Veliger, differing only from the Gastropod’s and Pteropod’s Veliger in having
                    bilateral shell-calcifications instead of a single central one; or, like Anodon,
                    they may develop within the gill-plates of the mother, though without presenting
                    such a specialized larva as the Glochidium. An example of the former is seen in
                    the development of the European Oyster, to the figure of which and its
                    explanation the reader is specially referred (fig. 6). An example of the latter
                    is seen in a common little fresh-water bivalve, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pisidium</hi><hi rend="italic">pusillum,</hi> which has been studied by
                    Lankester (12). The successive stages of the development of this Lamellibranch
                    are illustrated in the woodcuts figs. 148 to 153 inclusive. These should be
                    compared with the figures of Gastropod development (figs. 3, 4, 5, 7, and
                    72***). Fig. 148 shows the cleavage of the egg-cell into four (A), and at a
                    later stage the tucking in of some of the cells to form an invaginated series
                    (B).</p>

                <p>The embryonic cells continue to divide, and form an oval vesicle containing
                    liquid (fig. 149); within this, at one pole, is seen the mass of invaginated
                    cells (fig. 150, <hi rend="italic">hy).</hi> These invaginated cells are the
                    arch-enteron; they proliferate and give off branching cells, which apply
                    themselves (fig. 150, C) to the inner face of the vesicle, thus forming the
                    mesoblast or coelomic outgrowths. The outer single layer of cells which
                    constitutes the surface of the vesicle (fig. 147) is the ectoderm or epiblast or
                    deric cell-layer. The little mass of hypoblast or enteric cell-mass now
                    enlarges, but remains connected with the cicatrix of the blastopore or orifice
                    of invagination by a stalk, the rectal peduncle (fig. 151, A, <hi rend="italic"
                    >rp).</hi> The enteron itself becomes bilobed and is joined by a new
                    invagination, that of the mouth and stomodaeum, <hi rend="italic">ph.</hi> Fig.
                    151, B shows the origin of the mouth o, being a deeper view of the same specimen
                    in the same position which is drawn in fig. 151, A. The mesoblast multiplies its
                    cells, which become partly muscular and partly skeleto-trophic. Centro-dorsally
                    now appears the embryonic shell-gland (fig. 151, C, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >sä).</hi> The pharynx or stomodaeum is still small, the foot not yet prominent.
                    A later stage is seen in fig. 152, where the pharynx is widely open and the foot
                    prominent. No ciliated velum or prae-oral (cephalic) lobe ever develops. The
                    shell-gland disappears, the mantleskirt is raised as a ridge (fig. 151, E, <hi
                    rend="italic">mn),</hi> the paired shell-valves are secreted, the anus opens by
                    a proctodaeal ingrowth into the rectal peduncle, and the rudiments of the gills
                    (δr) and of the nephridia (B) appear (figs. 151, F, and 153, dorsal and lateral
                    views of same stage), and thus the chief organs and general form of the adult
                    are acquired. Later changes, not drawn here, consist in the growth of the
                    shell-valves over the whole area of the mantle-flaps, and in the multiplication
                    of the gill-filaments and their consolidation to form gill-plates. It is
                    important to note that the gill-filaments are formed one by one <hi
                    rend="italic">posteriorly.</hi> The labial tentacles are formed late. In the
                    allied genus Cyclas, a byssus gland is formed in the foot and subsequently
                    disappears, but no such gland occurs in Pisidium. The nerve-ganglia and the
                    otocysts probably form from thickenings of the epiblast, but detailed
                    observation on this and other points of histogenesis in the Lamellibranchia is
                    still wanting.</p>
