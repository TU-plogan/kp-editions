                    type="authorial"><p>Not to be confounded with “Moor-cock” or “Moor-fowl,” names
                    formerly in general use for the Red Grouse (vol. xi. 221).</p></note> the name
                    by which a bird, often called Water-hen and sometimes Gallinule, is most
                    commonly known in England. An earlier name was Moat-hen, which was appropriate
                    in the days when a moat was the ordinary adjunct of most considerable houses in
                    the country. It is the <hi rend="italic">Gallinula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chloropus</hi> of ornithologists, and almost too well known to need
                    description. About the size of a small Bantam-hen, but with the body much
                    compressed (as is usual with members of the Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rallidve,</hi> to which it belongs), its plumage above is of a deep
                    olive-brown, so dark as to appear black at a short distance, and beneath
                    iron-grey, relieved by some white stripes on the flanks, with the lower
                    tail-coverts of pure white,—these last being very conspicuous as. the bird
                    swims. A scarlet frontlet, especially bright in the spring of the year, and a
                    red garter on the tibia of the male render him very showy. Though often
                    frequenting the neighbourhood of man, the Moorhen seems unable to overcome the
                    inherént stealthy habits of the <hi rend="italic">Rallidae,</hi> and hastens to
                    hide itself on the least alarm; but under exceptional circumstances it may be
                    induced to feed, yet always suspiciously, with tame ducks and poultry. It
                    appears to take wing with difficulty, and may be often caught by an active dog;
                    but, in reality, it is capable of sustained flight, its longer excursions being
                    chiefly performed by night, when the peculiar call-note it utters is frequently
                    heard as the bird, itself invisible in the darkness, passes overhead. The nest
                    is a mass of flags, reeds, or other aquatic plants, often arranged with much
                    neatness, almost always near the water’s edge, where a clump of rushes is
                    generally chosen; but should a mill-dam, sluice-gate, or boat-house afford a
                    favourable site, advantage will be taken of it, and not unfrequently the bough
                    of a tree at some height from the ground will furnish the place for a cradle.
                    The eggs, from seven to eleven in number, resemble those of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Coot</hi> (vol. vi. p. 341), but are smaller, lighter, and
                    brighter in colour, with spots or blotches of reddish-brown. In winter, when the
                    inland waters are frozen, the majority of Moor-hens betake themselves to the
                    tidal rivers, and many must leave the country entirely, though a few seem always
                    able to maintain their existence however hard be the frost. The common Moor-hen
                    is extensively spread throughout the Old World, being found also at the Cape of
                    Good Hope, in India, and in Japan. In America it is represented by a very
                    closely-allied form, <hi rend="italic">G.</hi><hi rend="italic">galeata,</hi> so
                    called from its rather larger frontal helm, and in Australia by another, <hi
                    rend="italic">G. tenebrosa,</hi> which generally wants the white flank-markings.
                    Both closely resemble <hi rend="italic">G. chloropus</hi> in general habits, as
                    does also the <hi rend="italic">G. ρyrrhorrhoa</hi> of Madagascar, which has the
                    lower tail-coverts buff instead of white. Celebes and Amboyna possess a smaller
                    cognate species, <hi rend="italic">G. haematopus,</hi> with red legs; tropical
                    Africa has the smallest of all, <hi rend="italic">G. angulata</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and some more that have been recognized as distinct are
                    also found in other more or less isolated localities. One of the most remarkable
                    of these is the <hi rend="italic">G. nesiotis</hi> of Tristan da Cunha,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Proc. Zool.

                    of flight concomitantly with the shortening of its wings and a considerable
                    modification of its external apparatus, as well as a strengthening of its pelvic
                    girdle and legs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A
                    somewhat intermediate form seems to be presented by the Moor-hen of the island

                    >phoenicura,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Gallirex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cristata</hi> of India, as well as the South-American species classed in the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Porphyriops,</hi> there is not room to speak; but
                    mention should be made of the remarkable Australian genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tnbonyx,</hi> containing three species,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ann. Nat. History,</hi> ser. 3, xx. p.

                    and habits.</p>
                <p>Allied to all these is the genus <hi rend="italic">Porphyrio,</hi> including the
                    bird so named by classical writers, and perhaps a dozen other species often
                    called Sultanas and Purple Waterhens, for they all have a plumage of deep
                    blue,—some becoming violet, green, or black in parts, but preserving the white
                    lower tail-coverts, so generally characteristic <pb break="no"

                    their scarlet bill and legs. Two, <hi rend="italic">P. alleni</hi> of the
                    Ethiopian Region and the South-American <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">parva,</hi> are of small size. Of the larger species, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. caeruleus</hi> is the “Porphyrio” of the ancients, and inhabits
                    certain localities on both sides of the Mediterranean, while the rest are widely
                    dispersed within the tropics, and even beyond them, as in Australia and New
                    Zealand. But this last country has produced a more exaggerated form, <hi
                    rend="italic">Notomis,</hi> which has an interesting and perhaps unique history.
