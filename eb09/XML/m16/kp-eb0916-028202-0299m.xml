                    rationalism in the English Church of the 18th century, was the son of the rector
                    of Hinderwell near Whitby, and was born at Richmond in Yorkshire, on December 27
                    (or, according to another account, on August 3), 1683. He graduated at
                    Cambridge, took orders, and in 1706 obtained a fellowship, which he soon
                    resigned upon contracting an advantageous marriage. In 1717 a dispute with
                    Bentley, upon an extortionate demand of the latter on occasion of Middleton’s
                    being created D.D., involved him in an acrimonious controversy, which called
                    forth several pamphlets from his pen full of powerful invective, and among them
                    his first considerable literary performances, the <hi rend="italic">Remarks</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Further Remarks</hi> on Bentley’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proposals for a Few Edition of the Greek Testament</hi> (1721). “You have laid
                    Bentley flat upon his back,” wrote Colbatch. “I scorn to read what the rascal
                    has written,” wrote Bentley,—who, however, only resorted to this affected
                    disdain after a fruitless attempt to fix the authorship upon Colbatch, but who
                    might justly have commented upon the impropriety of Middleton’s endeavour to
                    visit his grievances upon the text of the New Testament. Private resentment and
                    uncurbed personality were throughout his life too frequently the motive and the
                    note of Middleton’s controversial publications. In 1723 he was involved in a
                    lawsuit by personalities against Bentley, which had found their way into his
                    otherwise judicious tract on library administration, written on occasion of his
                    appointment to the honourable office of university librarian. In 1726 he gave
                    great offence to the medical profession by a dissertation contending that the
                    healing art among the ancients was only exercised by slaves or freedmen. Between
                    the dates of these publications he visited Italy, and made those observations on
                    the pagan pedigree of Italian superstitions which he subsequently embodied in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Letter from Rome</hi> (1729). Tlιis cogent tract, while
                    establishing the author’s main proposition with abundant learning and wit, gave
                    at the same time the first clear indication of the anti-supernatural-istic bias
                    of his intellect, and probably contributed to prepare the storm which broke out
                    against him on his next publication (1731). In his remonstrance with Waterland
                    on occasion of the latter’s reply to Tindal’s <hi rend="italic">Christianity as
                    Old as the Creation,</hi> Middleton takes a line which in his day could hardly
                    fail to expose him to the reproach of infidelity. He gives up the literal truth
                    of the primeval Mosaic narratives; and, in professing to indicate a short and
                    easy method of confuting Tindal, lays principal stress on the indispensableness
                    of Christianity as a mainstay of social order. This was to resign nearly
                    everything that divines of the Waterland stamp thought worth defending.
                    Middleton was warmly assailed from many quarters, and retreated with some
                    difficulty under cover of a sheaf of apologetic pamphlets, and a more regular
                    attendance at church. A freethinker in the strict sense of the term he certainly
                    was; but how far freedom of thought was carried by him it is not easy to
                    ascertain. His adversaries—some of them men who gravely maintained that Egyptian
                    civilization originated in the age of Solomon—were unable to fix any serious
                    imputation upon him; on the other hand it is clear that the natural attitude of
                    his mind towards supernatural pretensions was one of suspicion, and that his
                    temperament was by no means devout. That he was nevertheless not incapable of a
                    disinterested hero-worship was evinced by his next important publication, the
                    elegant but partial <hi rend="italic">Life of Cicero</hi> (1741), a work which,
                    if far below the standard of modern exactness, may yet compare in spirit and
                    execution with the best productions of the Italian Renaissance. It is, indeed,
                    as remarked by Forsyth, “rather an historical composition, in which Cicero is
                    the principal figure, than the portrait of the man himself”; and Dr Parr has
                    pointed out Middleton’s unacknowledged obligations to the forgotten Bellendenus,
                    which, however, with the ardour of a discoverer, he seems to have considerably
                    overrated. The work was undertaken at the instance of Lord Hervey, in
                    correspondence with whom also originated his disquisition on <hi rend="italic"
                    >The Roman Senate,</hi> published in 1747. The same year and the following
                    produced the most important of all his writings, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Introductory Discourse</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Free Inquiry</hi>
                    concerning the miraculous powers then commonly deemed to have subsisted in the
                    church after the apostolic age. In combating this belief Middleton indirectly
                    established two propositions of capital importance. He showed that
                    ecclesiastical miracles must be accepted or rejected in the mass; and he
                    distinguished between the authority due to the early fathers’ testimony to the
                    beliefs and practices of their times and their very slender credibility as
                    witnesses to matters of fact. Some individual grudge seems to have prompted him
                    to expose, in 1750, Bishop Sherlock’s eccentric notions of antediluvian
                    prophecy, which had then been before the world for a quarter of a century. The
                    same year he died of a decline at his seat at Hildesham in Cambridgeshire,
                    leaving a widow, but no children.</p>
                <p>Middleton’s most ambitious work is obsolete from no fault of his, but his
                    controversial writings retain a permanent place in the history of opinion. In
                    his more restricted sphere he may not inappropriately be compared to Lessing.
                    Like Lessing’s, the character of his intellect was captious and iconoclastic,
                    but redeemed from mere negation by a passion for abstract truth, too apt to
                    slumber until called into activity by some merely personal stimulus. His diction
                    is generally masculine and harmonious. Pope thought him and Hooke the only prose
                    writers of the day who deserved to be cited as authorities on the language.
                    Parr, while exposing his plagiarisms, heaps encomiums on his style. But his best
                    qualities, his impatience of superstition and disdain of mere external
                    authority, are rather moral than literary. As a scholar he is rather elegant
                    than profound; as a controversialist he has more vigour than urbanity, and more
                    wit than humour. He has been unjustly attacked both as author and as man by De
                    Quincey, who strangely accuses his style of colloquialism, and taxes him with
                    eating the church’s bread while denying her doctrines. In fact Middleton’s
                    private means were ample, his ecclesiastical emoluments trifling, and his
                    candour obstructed his path to much more considerable preferment. The best
                    general view of his intellectual character and influence is to be found in
                    Leslie Stephen’s <hi rend="italic">English Thought in the Eighteenth
                    Century,</hi> chap. vi. A handsome edition of his works, containing several
                    posthumous tracts, but not including the <hi rend="italic">Life of Cicero,</hi>
                    appeared in 1752.</p>
