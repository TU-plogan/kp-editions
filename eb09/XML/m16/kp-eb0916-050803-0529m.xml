                    Latin Church. This name <hi rend="italic">(e.g.,</hi> Missale Gothicum,
                    Francorum, Gallicanum Vetus) began to supersede the older word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacramentary</hi> (Sacramentarium, Liber Sacramentorum) from about the middle
                    of the 8th century. At that period the books so designated contained merely the
                    fixed canon of the mass or consecration prayer (actionem, precem canonicam,
                    canonem actionis), and the variable collects, secretae or orationes super
                    oblata, prefaces, and post-communions for each fast, vigil, festival, or feria,
                    of the ecclesiastical year; for a due celebration of the Eucharist they required
                    accordingly to be supplemented by other books, such as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Antiphonarium,</hi> afterwards called the <hi rend="italic">Graduale,</hi>
                    containing the proper antiphons (introits), responsories (graduais), tracts,
                    sequences, offertories, communions, and other portions of the communion service
                    designed to be sung by the schola or choir, and the <hi rend="italic"

                    exclusive use throughout all the churches of the Latin obedience, owes its
                    present form to the council of Trent, which among its other tasks undertook the
                    preparation of a correct and uniform liturgy, and entrusted the work to a
                    committee of its members. This committee had not completed its labours when the
                    council rose, but the pope was instructed to receive its report when ready and
                    to act upon it. The “reformed missal” accordingly was promulgated by Pius V. on
                    July 14, 1570, and its universal use enjoined on all branches of the Catholic
                    Church, the only exceptions allowed being in the case of churches having local
                    and independent liturgies which had been kept in unbroken use for at least two
                    centuries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The English
                    missal consequently continued to be used by English Catholics until towards the
                    end of the 17th century, when it was superseded by the Roman through Jesuit
                    influence. The Gallican liturgy held its ground until much more recently, but
                    has now succumbed under the Ultramontanism of the bishops.</p></note> It has
                    subsequently undergone slight revisions under Clement VIII. (1604) and Urban
                    VIII. (1634); and various new masses, both obligatory and permissive, universal
                    and local, have been added by the competent authority. Although the Roman is
                    very much larger in bulk than any other liturgy, it need hardly be explained
                    that the communion office to which it relates is not in itself inordinately
                    long. By much the greater part of it is contained in the “ordinary” and “canon”
                    of the mass, usually placed about the middle of the missal, and occupies, though
                    in large type, only a few pages in any printed copy. The work owes its bulk and
                    complexity to two circumstances. On the one hand, in the celebration of the
                    sacrifice of the mass practically nothing is left to the impulse or discretion
                    of the officiating priest; everything—what he is to say, the tone and gestures
                    with which he is to say it, the cut and colour of the robe he is to wear—is
                    carefully prescribed either in the general rubrics prefixed to the text, or in
                    the running rubrics which accompany it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In all the older liturgies the comparative absence of
                    rubrics is conspicuous and sometimes perplexing. It is very noticeable in the
                    Roman <hi rend="italic">Sacramentaries,</hi> but the want is to some extent
                    supplied by the very detailed directions for a high pontifical mass in the
                    various texts of the <hi rend="italic">Ordo Romanus</hi> mentioned below. That
                    there was no absolutely fixed set of rubrics in use in France during the 8th
                    century is shown by the fact that each priest was required to write out an
                    account of his own practice (“libellum ordinis”) and present it for approbation
                    to the bishop in Lent (see Baluze, <hi rend="italic">Cap. Reg. Franc.,</hi> i.
                    824, quoted in Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Diet, of Chr. Antiq.,</hi> ii.
                    1521).</p></note> On the other hand, the Roman, like all the Western liturgies,
                    is distinguished <pb break="no"

                    flexibility. Partly by conscious effort, no doubt, but partly also by happy
                    accident, a well-marked distinctive character has been given in one or all of
                    the above-mentioned respects to the office for each ecclesiastical season, for
                    each fast or festival of the year, almost for each day of the week; and
                    provision has also been made of a suitable communion service for many of the
                    special and extraordinary occasions both of public and of private life. This
                    richness of variety is seen not only in the collects but also in the lessons and
                    antiphonal parts of the service, passages of Scripture in the selection and
                    collocation of which an exquisite delicacy of religious and aesthetic instinct
                    has been for the most part strikingly shown.</p>
                <p>The different parts of the Roman communion office are not all of the same
                    antiquity. Its essential and characteristic features are most easily caught, and
                    their rationale best understood, by reference to the earliest <hi rend="italic"

                    >Introit</hi> according to the time, whether for a festival or for a common day;
                    thereafter <hi rend="italic">Kyrie</hi><hi rend="italic">Eleison.</hi> (In

                    >Excelsis</hi><hi rend="italic">Deo</hi> is said if a bishop be [the celebrant],
                    though only on Sundays and festivals; but a priest is by no means to say it,
                    except only at Eastertide. When there is a litany (quando letania agitur)
                    neither <hi rend="italic">Gloria in</hi><hi rend="italic">Excelsis</hi> nor <hi
                    rend="italic">Alleluia</hi> is sung.) Afterwards the <hi rend="italic"

                    also the <hi rend="italic">Gradual</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Adleluia.</hi>
                    Afterwards the <hi rend="italic">Gospel</hi> is read. Then comes the <hi

                    type="authorial"><p>Some editions do not mention the Offertory here.</p></note>

                    rend="italic">oblata</hi> is said.” Then follow the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sursum</hi><hi rend="italic">Corda,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Preface,
                    Canon,</hi> Lord’s Prayer and “embolism” <hi rend="italic">(Ιρβόλισρα.</hi> or

                    given at full length precisely as they still occur in the Roman missal.</p>
                <p>In every liturgy of all the five groups a passage similar to this occurs,
                    beginning with <hi rend="italic">Sursum</hi><hi rend="italic">Corda,</hi>
                    followed by a <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> and the recitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sanctus</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi> Angelic Hymn. The “canon” or
                    consecration prayer, which in all of them comes immediately after, invariably
                    contains our Lord’s words of institution, and (except in the Nestorian liturgy)
                    concludes with the Lord’s Prayer and “embolism.” But within this framework there
                    are certain differences of arrangement, furnishing marks by which the various
                    groups of liturgies can be classified (see vol. xiv. p. 709 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.).</hi> Thus it is distinctive of the liturgy of Jerusalem that the “great
                    intercession” for the quick and the dead follows the words of institution and an
                    Epiklesis <hi rend="italic">(lπiκλησus τoυ πveυμaτoς</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >αγίου)</hi> OΓ petition for the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the gifts; in
                    the Alexandrian the “great intercession” has its place in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preface</hi>; in the East Syrian it comes between the words of restitution and
                    the Epiklesis; in the Ephesine it comes before the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Preface;</hi> while in the Roman it is divided into two, the commemoration of
                    the living being before, and that of the dead after, the words of institution.
                    Other distinctive features of the Roman liturgy are (1) the position of the
                    “Pax” after the consecration, and not as in all the other liturgies at a very
                    early stage of the service, before the <hi rend="italic">Preface</hi> even; and
                    (2) the absence of the Epiklesis common to all the others.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This was one of the points discussed at the
                    council of Florence, and Cardinal Bessarion for a time succeeded in persuading
                    the Greeks to give up the Epiklesis.</p></note></p>
                <p>The words of its “canonical prayer” are of unknown antiquity; they are found in
                    the extant manuscripts of the <hi rend="italic">Sacramentarium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Gelasianum,</hi> and were already old and of forgotten authorship
                    in the time of Gregory the Great, who, in a letter to John, bishop of Syracuse
                    <hi rend="italic">{Registr. Epist.,</hi> vii. 64), speaks of it as “the prayer
                    composed by a ‘scholastic’” (precem quam scholasticus composuerat). The same
                    letter is interesting as containing Gregory’s defence, on the ground of ancient
                    use, of certain parts of the Roman ritual to which the bishop of Syracuse had
                    taken exception as merely borrowed from Constantinople. Thus we learn that,
                    while at Constantinople the <hi rend="italic">Kyrie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eleison</hi> was said by all simultaneously, it was the Roman custom for the
                    clergy to repeat the words first and for the people to respond, <hi
                    rend="italic">Christe</hi><hi rend="italic">Eleison</hi> being also repeated an
                    equal number of times. Again, the Lord’s Prayer was said immediately after the
                    consecration aloud by all the people among the Greeks, but at Rome by the priest
                    alone.</p>
                <p>The somewhat meagre and imperfect liturgical details furnished by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Sacramentarium Gregorianum</hi> are supplemented in a very full
                    and interesting manner by the successive texts of the <hi rend="italic">Ordo
                    Romanus,</hi> the first of which dates from about the year 730. The ritual they
                    enjoin is that for a pontifical high mass in Rome itself; but the differences to
                    be observed by a priest “quando in statione facit missas” are comparatively
                    slight. Subjoined is a précis of <hi rend="italic">0rdo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romanus</hi><hi rend="italic">I.</hi></p>
                <p>It is first of all explained, that Rome has seven ecclesiastical regions, each
                    with its proper deacons, subdeacons, and acolytes. Each region has its own day
                    of the week for high ecclesiastical functions, which are celebrated by each in
                    rotation. [This accounts for the Statio ad S. Mariam Majorem, ad S. Crucem in
                    Jerusalem, ad S. Petrum, &amp;c., prefixed to most of the masses in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gregorian Sacramentary</hi>, and still retained in the “Proprium
                    de Tempore” of the Roman missal.] The regulations for the assembling and
                    marshalling of the procession by which the pontiff is met and then escorted to
                    the appointed station are minutely given, as well as for the adjustment of his
                    vestments “ut bene sedeant,” when the sacristy has been reached. He does not
                    leave the sacristy until the <hi rend="italic">Introit</hi> has been begun by
                    the choir in the church. Before the <hi rend="italic">Gloria</hi> he takes his
                    stand at the altar, and after the <hi rend="italic">Kyrie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Eleison</hi> has been sung (the number of times is left to his discretion) he
                    begins the <hi rend="italic">Gloria in</hi><hi rend="italic">Excelsis,</hi>
                    which is taken up by the choir. During the singing he faces eastward; at its
                    close he turns round for a moment to say “Pax vobis,” and forthwith proceeds to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Quam collectam dicunt, <hi rend="italic">Ord.</hi><hi

                    The deacon then silently kisses the feet of the pontiff and receives his
                    blessing in the words “Dominus sit in corde tuo et in labiis tuis.” Preceded by
                    acolytes with lighted candles and subdeacons burning incense, he ascends the

                    the “senatorium” accompanied by certain of the inferior clergy, and receives in
                    order the oblations of the rulers (oblationes principum), the archdeacon who
                    follows taking their “amulas” of wine and pouring them into a larger vessel;
                    similar offerings are received from the other ranks and classes present,
                    including the women. This concluded, the pontiff and archdeacon wash their,

                    and water, supplied by the leader of the choir (archiparaphonista), being
                    mingled with the wine. During this ceremony the schola have been engaged in

                    >{Sanctus}</hi> all kneel and continue kneeling, except the pontiff, who rises
                    alone and begins the <hi rend="italic">Canon.</hi> At the words “per quem haec

                    semper vobiscum” he gives the peace to the clergy in their order, and to the
                    laity. The pontiff then breaks off a particle from the consecrated bread and
                    lays it upon the altar; the rest he places on the paten held by the deacon. It
                    is then distributed while <hi rend="italic">Agnus Dei</hi> is sung. The pontiff
                    in communicating puts the particle into the cup, saying, “Fiat commixtio et
                    consecratio corporis et sanguinis Domini nostri Jesu Christi accipientibus nobis
                    in vitam aeternam.” Those present communicate in their order under this species
                    also.</p>

                <p>As the pontiff descends into the senatorium to give the communion, the schola
                    begins the communion <hi rend="italic">Antiphon,</hi> and continues singing the
                    <hi rend="italic">Psalm</hi> until, all the people having communicated, they
                    receive the sign to begin the <hi rend="italic">Gloria,</hi> after which, the
                    verse having been again repeated, they stop. The celebrant, then, facing
                    eastward, offers the <hi rend="italic">Oratio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi

                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">circulum anni,</hi> which as its name
                    implies contains those variable portions of the mass which were intended to be
                    sung by the schola or choir. It gives for each day for which a proper mass is
                    provided—(1) the <hi rend="italic">Antiphona</hi> (Antiphona ad Introitum) and
                    <hi rend="italic">Psalmus</hi>; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Responsorium</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Versus,</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Alleluia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Versus</hi>; (3) the <hi rend="italic">Offertorium</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Versus</hi>; (4) the <hi rend="italic">Communio</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalmus.</hi> Some explanation of each of these terms is
                    necessary. (1) The word <hi rend="italic">Antiphon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(αντίφωναν,</hi> Old English <hi rend="italic">Antefn,</hi> English <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthem)</hi> in its ecclesiastical use has reference to the very
                    ancient practice of relieving the voices of the singers by dividing the work
                    between alternate choirs. In one of its most usual meanings it has the special
                    signification of a sentence (usually scriptural) constantly sung by one choir
                    between the verses of a psalm or hymn sung by another. According to the Roman
                    liturgiologists it was Pope Celestine who enjoined that the Psalms of David
                    should be sung (in rotation, one presumes) antiphonally before mass; in process
                    of time the antiphon came to be sung at the beginning and end only, and the
                    psalm itself was reduced to a single verse. In the days of Gregory the Great the
                    introit appears to have been sung precisely as at present,—that is to say, after
                    the antiphon (proper and <hi rend="italic">par excellence),</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Psalmus</hi> with its <hi rend="italic">Gloria,</hi> then the
                    antiphon again. (2) The <hi rend="italic">Responsorium,</hi> like the Greek
                    antiphon, derives its name from the responsive manner of singing. As introduced
                    between the epistle and gospel it was probably at first a comparatively long
                    passage, usually an entire psalm or canticle, originally given out by the cantor
                    from the steps from which the epistle had been read (hence the later name <hi
                    rend="italic">Graduale),</hi> the response being taken up by the whole choir.
                    (3) The <hi rend="italic">Offertorium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Communio</hi>
                    correspond to the “hymn from the book of Psalms” mentioned by early authorities
                    (see, for example, Augustine, <hi rend="italic">Retr.,</hi> ii. 11; <hi
                    rend="italic">Ap. Const.,</hi> viii. 13) as sung before the oblation and also
                    while that which had been offered was being distributed to the people. A very
                    intimate connexion between these four parts of the choral service can generally
                    be observed; thus, taking the first Sunday in the ecclesiastical year, we find
                    both in the <hi rend="italic">Antiph&lt;mary</hi> and in the modern <hi
                    rend="italic">Missal</hi> that the antiphon is Ps. XXV. 1-3, the psalmus Ps.
                    xxv. 4, the responsorium (graduale) and versus Ps. xxv. 3 and xxv. 4, the
                    offertorium and versus Ps. xxv. 1-3 and Ps. xxv. <hi rend="italic">5.</hi> The
                    communio is Ps. lxxxv. 12, one of the verses of the responsorium being Ps.
                    lxxxv. 7. In the selection of the introits there are also traces of a certain
                    rotation of the psalms in the Psalter having been observed.</p>
                <p>The first pages of the modern Roman missal are occupied with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Calendar</hi> and a variety of explanations relating to the year
                    and its parts, and the manner of determining the movable feasts. The general
                    rubrics <hi rend="italic">(Rubricae</hi><hi rend="italic">Generales
                    Missalis)</hi> follow, explaining what are the various kinds of mass which may
                    be celebrated, prescribing the hours of celebration, the kind and colour of
                    vestments to be used, and the ritual to be followed (ritus celebrandi missam),
                    and giving directions as to what is to be done in case of various defects or
                    imperfections which may arise. The <hi rend="italic">Praeparatio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">Missam,</hi> which comes next, is a short
                    manual of devotion containing psalms, hymns, and prayers to be used as
                    opportunity may occur before and after celebration. Next comes the proper of the
                    season <hi rend="italic">(Proprium Missarum</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Tempore),</hi> occupying more than half of the entire volume. It contains the
                    proper introit, collect (one or more), epistle, gradual (tract or sequence),
                    gospel, offertory, secreta (one or more), communion, and post-communion for
                    every Sunday of the year, and also for the festivals and ferias connected with
                    the ecclesiastical seasons, as well as the offices peculiar to the ember days,
                    Holy Week, Easter, and Whitsuntide. Between the office for Holy Saturday and
                    that for Easter Sunday the ordinary of the mass <hi rend="italic">(Ordo</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Missae),</hi> with the solemn and proper prefaces for the year,
                    and the canon of the mass are inserted. The proper of the season is followed by
                    the proper of the saints <hi rend="italic">(Proprium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sanctorum),</hi> containing what is special to each saint’s day in the order of
                    the calendar, and by the <hi rend="italic">Commune Sanctorum,</hi> containing
                    such offices as the common of one martyr and bishop, the common of one martyr
                    not a bishop, the common of many martyrs in paschal time, the common of many
                    martyrs out of paschal time, and the like. A variety of masses to be used at the
                    feast of the dedication of a church, of masses for the dead, and of votive
                    masses (as for the sick, for persons journeying, for bridegroom and bride)
                    follow, and also certain benedictions. Most missals have an appendix also
                    containing certain local masses of saints to be celebrated “ex induito
                    apostolico.”</p>
                <p>Masses fall into two great subdivisions :—(1) ordinary or regular (secundum
                    ordinem officii), celebrated according to the regular rotation of fast and
                    feast, vigil and feria, in the calendar; (2) extraordinary or occasional (extra
                    ordinem officii), being either “votive” or “for the dead,” and from the nature
                    of the case having no definite time prescribed for them. Festival masses are
                    either double, half-double, or simple, an ordinary Sunday mass being a
                    half-double. The difference depends on the number of collects and secretae; on a
                    double only one of each is offered, on a halfdouble there are two or three, and
                    on a simple there may be as many as five, or even seven, of each. Any mass may
                    be either high (missa solennis) or low (missa privata). The distinction depends
                    upon the number of officiating clergy, certain differences of practice as to
                    what is pronounced aloud and what inaudibly, the use or absence of incense,
                    certain gestures, and the like. Solitary masses are forbidden; there must be at
                    least an acolyte to give the responses. The vestments prescribed for the priest
                    are the amice, alb, cingulum or girdle, maniple, stole, and chasuble (planeta);
                    see <hi rend="smallcaps">Costume,</hi> vol. vi. p. 462. There are certain
                    distinctions of course for a bishop or abbot. The colour of the vestments and of
                    the drapery of the altar varies according to the day, being either white, red,
                    green, violet, or black. This last custom does not go much further back than
                    Innocent III., who explains the symbolism intended.</p>
                <p>Subjoined is an account of the manner of celebrating high mass according to the
                    rite at present in force.</p>
                <p>1. The priest who is to celebrate, having previously confessed (if necessary) and
                    having finished matins and lauds, is to seek leisure for private prayer
                    (fasting) and to use as he has opportunity the ‘ ‘ prayers before mass” already
                    referred to. How the robing in the sacristy is next to be gone about is minutely
                    prescribed, and prayers are given to be used as each article is put on. The
                    sacramental elements having previously been placed on the altar or on a credence
                    table, the celebrant enters the church and takes his stand before the lowest
                    step of the altar, having the deacon on his right and the subdeacon on his left.
                    After invoking the Trinity (In nomine Patris, &amp;c. ) he repeats alternately
                    with those who are with him the psalm “Judica me, Deus,” which is preceded in
                    the usual way by an antiphon (Introibo ad altare Dei), and followed also by the
                    Gloria and Antiphon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>This antiphon is not to be confounded with the Antiphona ad Introitum
                    further on. This use of the 43d Psalm goes as far back at least as the end of
                    the 11th century, being mentioned by Micrologus (1080). It is omitted in masses
                    for the dead and during Holy Week.</p></note> The versicle “Adjutorium nostrum,”

                    priest and by the attendants, who in turn respond with the prayer for divine
                    forgiveness, “Misereatur.” The priest then gives the absolution (“Indulgentiam
                    ”), and after the versicles and responses beginning “Deus, tu conversus” he
                    audibly says, “Oremus,” and ascending to the altar silently offers two short
                    prayers, one asking for forgiveness and liberty of access through Christ, and
                    another indulgence for himself “through the merits of thy saints whose relics
                    are here.” Receiving the thurible from the deacon he incenses the altar, and is
                    thereafter himself incensed by the deacon. He then reads the Introit, which is
                    also sung by the choir; the “Kyrie Eleison” is then said, after which the words
                    “Gloria in Excelsis”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    completed by the choir.</p>
                <p>2. Kissing the altar, and turning to the people with the formula “Dominus
                    vobiscum,” the celebrant proceeds with the collect or collects proper to the
                    season or day, which are read secretly. The epistle for the day is then read by
                    the subdeacon, and is followed by the gradual, tract, alleluia, or sequence,
                    according to the time.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The tract is peculiar to certain occasions, especially of a mournful nature,
                    and is sung by a single voice. By a sequence is understood a more or less
                    metrical composition, not in the words of Scripture, having a special bearing on
                    the festival of the day. See, for example, the sequence, “Lauda Sion
                    Salvatorem,” on Corpus Christi day.</p></note> This finished, the deacon places
                    the book of the gospels on the altar, and the celebrant blesses the incense. The
                    deacon kneels before the altar and offers the prayer “Munda cor meum,”
                    afterwards takes the book from the altar, and kneeling before the celebrant asks
                    his blessing, which he receives with the words “Dominus sit in corde tuo.”
                    Having kissed the hand of the priest, he goes accompanied by acolytes with
                    incense and lighted candles to the pulpit, and with a “Dominus vobiscum” and
                    minutely prescribed crossings and incensings gives out and reads the gospel for
                    the day, at the close of which “Laus tibi, Christe” is said, and the book is
                    brought to the celebrant and kissed with the words ‘ ‘ Per evangelica dicta
                    deleantur nostra delicta.” The celebrant then standing at the middle of the
                    altar sings the words “Credo in unum Deum,” and the rest of the Nicene creed is
                    sung by the choir.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On
                    certain days the <hi rend="italic">Credo</hi> is omitted.</p></note></p>
                <p>3. With “Dominus vobiscum” and “Oremus” the celebrant proceeds to read the
                    Offertory, which is also sung by the choir. This finished he receives the paten
                    with the host from the deacon, and after offering the host with the prayer
                    beginning ‘ ’ Suscipe, Sancte Pater” places it upon the corporal. The deacon
                    then ministers wine and the subdeacon water, and before the celebrant mixes the
                    water with the wine he blesses it in the prayer “Deus qui humanae.” He then
                    takes the chalice, and having offered it ( ‘ ‘ Offerimus tibi, Domine ”) places
                    it upon the corporal and covers it with the pall. Slightly bowing over the
                    altar, he then offers the prayer “In spiritu humilitatis,” and, lifting up his
                    eyes and stretching out his hands, proceeds with “Veni sanctificator.” After
                    blessing the incense (“Per intercessionem beati Michaelis archangeli ”) he takes
                    the thurible from the deacon and incenses the bread and wine and altar, and is
                    afterwards himself incensed as well as the others in their order. Next going to
                    the epistle side of the altar he washes his fingers as he recites the verses of
                    the 26th Psalm beginning “Lavabo.” Returning and bowing before the middle of the
                    altar, with joined hands he says, “Suscipe, sancta Trinitas,” then turning
                    himself towards the people he raises his voice a little and says, “Orate,
                    fratres” (“that my sacrifice and yours may be acceptable to God the Father
                    Almighty”), the response to which is “Suscipiat Dominus sacrificium de manibus
                    tuis," &amp;c. He then recites the secret prayer or prayers, and at the end
                    says, with an audible voice, “Per omnia saecula saeculorum” (A ’. “Amen”).</p>
                <p>4. Again saluting with a “Dominus vobiscum,” he lifts up his hands and goes on to
                    the “Sursum Corda” and the rest of the Preface. A different intonation is given
                    for each of the prefaces.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    Sanctus the handbell is rung. If there is a choir the Sanctus is sung while the
                    celebrant goes on with the Canon.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The approved usage appears to be in that case that it is
                    sung as far as “Hosanna in Excelsis” before the elevation, and “Benedictus qui
                    venit” is reserved till afterwards. In France it was a very common custom, made
                    general*for a time at the request of Louis XII., to sing “0 salutaris hostia "
                    at the elevation.</p></note> After the words of consecration of the wafer, which
                    are said “secretly, distinctly, and attentively,” the celebrant kneels and
                    adores the host, rising elevates it, and replacing it on the corporal again
                    adores it (the bell meanwhile being rung).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The history of the practice of elevating the host is
                    somewhat obscure. It seems to have arisen out of the custom of holding up the
                    oblations, as mentioned in the <hi rend="italic">Ordo Romanus</hi> (see above).
                    The elevation of the host, as at present practised, was first enjoined by Pope
                    Honorius III. The use of the handbell at the elevation is still later, and was
                    first made general by Gregory XI.</p></note> The same rite is observed when the
                    chalice is consecrated. Immediately before the Lord’s Prayer, at the words “per
                    ipsum et cum ipso et in ipso,” the sign of the cross is made three times over
                    the chalice with the host, and towards the close of the “embolism” the fraction
                    of the host takes place. After the words “Pax Domini sit semper vobiscum” the
                    emission of the particle into the cup takes place with the words “Haec commixtio
                    et consecratio,” &amp;c. The celebrant then says the Agnus Dei three times.</p>
                <p>5. While the choir sings the Agnus Dei and the Communion, the celebrant proceeds,
                    still “secrete,” with the remainder of the office, which though printed as part
                    of the canon is more conveniently called the Communion and Post-communion. After
                    the prayer for the peace and unity of the church (“Domine Jesu Christe, qui
                    dixisti ”) he salutes the deacon with the kiss of peace, saying, “Pax tecum”;
                    the subdeacon is saluted in like manner, and then conveys the “pax” to the rest
                    of the clergy who may be assisting. The celebrant then communicates under both
                    species with suitable prayers and actions, and afterwards administers the
                    sacrament to the other communicants if there be any. Then while the wine is
                    poured into the cup for the first ablution he says, “Quod ore sumpsimus”; having
                    taken it he says, “Corpus tuum, Domine.” After the second ablution he goes to
                    the book and reads the Communion. Then turning to the people with “Dominus
                    vobiscum” he reads the Postcommunion (one or more); turning once more to the
                    congregation he uses the old dismissal formula “Dominus vobiscum” (A. Et cum
                    spiritutuo), and “Ite, missa est” [or “Benedicamus Domino,” in those masses from
                    which “Gloria in Excelsis” has been omitted] (Ä. Deo Gratias). Bowing down
                    before the altar he offers the prayer “Placeat tibi, sancta Trinitas,” then
                    turning round he makes the sign of the cross over the congregation with the
                    words of the benediction (“Benedicat”).<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The benediction is omitted in masses for the

                    with “In principio erat Verbum,” or else the proper gospel of the day.<note
