                    at Brasenose College, Oxford; his university career was brilliant, and among
                    other distinctions he gained the Newdigate prize with a poem on the Apollo
                    Belvedere. In 1816 he was ordained, and was soon afterwards presented to the
                    living of St Mary’s, Reading. He had already made his appearance as a dramatic
                    writer, his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Fazio,</hi> founded on a narrative in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Annual Register</hi> for 1795, having been brought on the
                    stage without his knowledge under the title of <hi rend="italic">The Italian
                    Wife.</hi> It was subsequently produced at Covent Garden, and obtained great
                    success from the acting of Miss O’Neill as Bianca. The merit of the play
                    consists chiefly in the powerful situation; the diction is florid and ornate.
                    The same criticism, by the author’s own confession, applies to his epic, <hi
                    rend="italic">Samor, the Lord of the Bright City</hi> (Gloucester), a poem
                    written in early youth. The subject is taken from British legend, and Milman has
                    failed to invest it with serious interest. He was more successful in his next
                    attempts, where the subjects were well adapted to an imagination easily kindled
                    by the historical or the moral picturesque. The death struggle of an expiring
                    nation in the <hi rend="italic">Fall of Jerusalem</hi> (1820), the conflict of
                    new truth and old order, of religious enthusiasm and earthly affection, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Martyr of Antioch</hi> (1822), are depicted with great
                    eloquence and real insight into human nature. Milman’s characters, however, are
                    personified tendencies rather than personages, and in poetical style he was
                    unable to free himself from the influence of Byron. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Belshazzar</hi> (1822) is in general a pale copy of Byron’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sardanapalus,</hi> but contains some fine lyrics. Mil man’s lyrics, indeed,
                    especially his hymns, have frequently a fine ring and sweep, though the thought
                    is generally commonplace. His tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Anne Boleyn</hi>
                    (1826) is a poor performance. With the exception of admirable versions of the
                    Sanskrit episode of Nala and Damayanti, and of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agamemnon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bacchae,</hi> this was Milman’s last
                    poetical work. He was elected professor of poetry at Oxford, and in 1827
                    delivered the Bamρton lectures, selecting as his subject the conduct and
                    character of the apostles as an evidence of Christianity. In 1830 his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Jews</hi> appeared in the Family Library. The
                    contracted limits of this series forbade any adequate treatment of the subject;
                    the work is nevertheless memorable as the first by an English clergyman which
                    treated the Jews as an Oriental tribe, recognized sheikhs and emirs in the Old
                    Testament, sifted and classified documentary evidence, and evaded or minimized
                    the miraculous. Milman was violently attacked, especially by Dr Faussett and
                    Bishop Mant, and the odium thus occasioned stopped the publication of the Family
                    Library, and long impeded the preferment of the writer. In 1835, however, Sir
                    Robert Peel made him rector of St Margaret’s and canon of Westminster, and in
                    1849 he became dean of St Paul’s. The unpopularity attaching to him had by this
                    time nearly died away; and now, generally revered and beloved, intimate with men
                    of all pursuits, politics, and persuasions, counted among the chief ornaments of
                    the most polished society of the metropolis, he occupied a singularly dignified
                    and enviable position, which he constantly employed for the promotion of culture
                    and enlightenment, and in particular for the relaxation of subscription to
                    ecclesiastical formularies. His <hi rend="italic">History of Christianity under
                    the Empire</hi> had appeared in 1840, but had been as completely ignored as if,
                    said Lord Melbourne, the clergy had taken a universal oath never to mention it
                    to any one. Widely different was the reception of the continuation, his great
                    <hi rend="italic">History of Latin Christianity</hi> to the death of Pope
                    Nicholas V., which appeared in 1855. He also edited Gibbon and Horace, and at
                    his death in 1868 left behind him almost finished a delightful history of his
                    own cathedral, which was completed and published by his son.</p>
                <p>Milman possessed a large share of the imagination which enters into and calls up
                    the past, and of that which interprets actions and apprehends opinions by the
                    power of sympathy. In creative imagination he was deficient, a defect which
                    alone prevented him from attaining the first rank as an historian. His pages are
                    crowded with splendid names rather than with living personages; the springs of
                    action are disclosed with remarkable penetration, but the actor himself is
                    rather heard than seen. There are, however, exceptions, such as his portrait of
                    Sir Christopher Wren; and he possessed a peculiar power of investing mere
                    intellectual tendencies with personality and life. His parallel of Latin and
                    Teutonic Christianity, for example, is a piece of finished historical character
                    painting. His power of sympathy rendered him in effect, as his natural equity
                    and benignity made him in intention, a model of historical candour, only
                    chargeable, perhaps, with too much gentleness. It will be long ere his great
                    woιk is superseded; but he will perhaps be remembered even longer as an
                    embodiment of all the qualities which the higher ecclesiastical preferment can
                    be supposed capable of encouraging or rewarding among the clergy of a great
                    historical church. (R. G. )</p>
