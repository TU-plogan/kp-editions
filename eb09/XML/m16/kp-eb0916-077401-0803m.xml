                <p>In this article an account will be given of the general significance of Montanism
                    in relation to the history of the church in the 2d century, followed by a sketch
                    of its origin, development, and decline.</p>
                <p>1. From the middle of the 2d century a change began to take place in the outward
                    circumstances of Christianity. The Christian faith had hitherto been maintained
                    in a few small congregations scattered over the Roman empire. These
                    congregations were provided with only the most indispensable constitutional
                    forms, neither stricter nor more numerous than were required by a religious bond
                    resting on supernatural expectations, strict discipline, and brotherly love
                    (“Corpus sumus de conscientia religionis, de unitate disciplinae, de spei
                    foedere”). This state of things passed away. The churches soon found numbers
                    within their pale who stood in need of supervision, instruction, and regular
                    control. The enthusiasm for a life of holiness and separation from the world,
                    the eager outlook for the end of the world, the glad surrender to the gospel
                    message, were no longer the influences by which all minds were swayed. In many
                    cases sober convictions or submissive assent supplied the want of spontaneous
                    enthusiasm. There were many who did not <hi rend="italic">become,</hi> but who
                    <hi rend="italic">were,</hi> and therefore remained, Christians,—too powerfully
                    attracted by Christianity to abandon it, and yet not powerfully enough to have
                    adopted it for themselves. Then, in addition to this, social distinctions
                    asserted themselves amongst the brethren. Christians were already found in all
                    ranks and occupations—in the imperial palace, among the officials, in the abodes
                    of labour and the halls of learning, amongst slaves and freemen. Were all these
                    to be left in their callings? Should the church take the decisive step into the
                    world, consent to its arrangements, conform to its customs, acknowledge as far
                    as possible its authorities, and satisfy its requirements? <hi rend="italic"
                    >Or</hi> ought she, on the other hand, to remain, as she had been at first, a
                    society of religious devotees, separated and shut out from the world by a
                    rigorous discipline and working on it only through a direct propaganda? This was
                    the dilemma that the church had to face in the second half of the 2d century:
                    either she must commence a world-wide mission in the comprehensive sense by an
                    effective entrance into Roman society—renouncing, of course, her original
                    peculiarities and exclusiveness; or, retaining these peculiarities and clinging
                    to the old modes of life, she must remain a small ' insignificant sect, barely
                    intelligible to one man in a thousand, and utterly incapable of saving and
                    educating nations. That this was the question at issue ought to be obvious
                    enough to us now, although it could not be clearly perceived at the time. It was
                    natural that warning voices should then be raised in the church against secular
                    tendencies, that the well-known counsels about the imitation of Christ should be
                    held up in their literal strictness before worldly Christians, that demands
                    should be made for a restoration of the old discipline and severity, and for a
                    return to apostolic simplicity and purity. The church as a whole, however, under
                    pressure of circumstances rather than by a spontaneous impulse, decided
                    otherwise. She marched through the open door into the Roman state, and settled
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n804/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0804-0775"/> &lt;lown there for a long career of activity, to
                    Christianize the state along all its thoroughfares by imparting to it the word
                    of the gospel, but at the same time leaving it everything ex- ∙cept its gods. On
                    the other hand, she furnished herself with •everything of value that could be
                    taken over from the world without overstraining the elastic structure of the
                    organization which she now adopted. With the aid of its philosophy she created
                    her new Christian theology; its polity furnished her with the most exact
                    constitutional forms; its jurisprudence, its trade and commerce, its art and
                    industry, were all taken into her service; and she contrived to borrow some
                    hints even from its religious worship. Thus we find the church in the 3d century
                    endowed with all the resources which the state and its culture had to offer,
                    entering into all the relationships of life, and ready for any compromise which
                    did not affect the confession of her faith. With this equipment she undertook,
                    and carried through, a worldmission on a grand scale. But what of those
                    believers of the old school who protested in the name of the gospel against this
                    secular church, and who wished to gather together a people prepared for their
                    God regardless alike Of numbers and circumstances? Why, they joihed an
                    •enthusiastic movement which had originated amongst a small circle in a remote
                    province, and had at first a merely local importance. There, in Phrygia, the cry
                    for a strict Christian life was reinforced by the belief in a new and final
                    outpouring of the Spirit,—a coincidence which has been observed elsewhere in
                    church history, as, for instance, in the Irvingite movement. The wish was, as
                    usual, father to the thought; and thus societies of “spiritual” Christians were
                    formed, which served, especially in times of persecution, as rallying-points for
                    all those, far and near, who sighed for the end of the world and the <hi
                    rend="italic">excessus</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >saeculo,</hi> and who wished in these last days to lead a holy life. These
                    zealots hailed the appearance of the Paraclete in Phrygia, and surrendered
                    themselves to his guidance. In so doing, however, they had to withdraw from the
                    church, to be known as “Montanists,” or “Kataphrygians,” and thus to assume the
                    character of a sect. Their enthusiasm and their prophesyings were denounced as
                    demoniacal; their expectation of a glorious earthly kingdom of Christ was
                    stigmatized as Jewish, their passion for martyrdom as vainglorious, and their
                    whole conduct as hypocritical. Nor did they escape the more serious imputation
                    of heresy on important articles of faith; indeed, there was a disposition to put
                    them on the same level with the Gnostics. The effect on themselves was what
                    usually follows in such circumstances. After their separation from the church,
                    they became narrower and pettier in their conception of Christianity. The strict
                    rules of conduct which in a former -age had been the genuine issue of
                    high-strung religious emotion were now relied on as its source. Their asceticism
                    degenerated into legalism, their claim to a monopoly of pure Christianity made
                    them arrogant. As for the popular religion of the larger church, they scorned it
                    as an adulterated, manipulated Christianity. But these views found very little
                    acceptance in the 3d century, and in the course of the 4th they died out.
                    Regardless of the scruples of her most conscientious members, and driving the
                    most earnest Christians into secession and the conventicle, the church went on
                    to prosecute her great mission in the world. And before she was able, as church
                    of the state and of the empire, to call in the aid of the civil power to
                    suppress her adversaries the Montanistic conventicles were almost extinct.</p>
                <p>2. Such is, in brief, the position occupied by Montanism in the history of the
                    ancient church. The rise and progress of the movement were' as follows.</p>
                <p>At the close of the reign of Antoninus Pius—probably in the year 156
                    (Epiphanius)—Montanus appeared at Ardaban in Phrygia, bringing revelations of
                    the “Spirit” to Christendom. It is unnecessary to seek an explanation of his
                    appearance in the peculiarities of the Phrygian temperament. The Christian
                    churches had always held that prophecy was to be continued till the return of
                    Christ, although, as a matter of fact, prophets had not been particularly
                    numerous. Montanus claimed to have a prophetic calling in the very same sense as
                    Agabus, Judas, Silas, the daughters of Philip, Quadratus, and Ammia, or as
                    Hermas at Rome. At a later time, when the validity of the Montanistic prophecy
                    was called in question in the interest of the church, the adherents of the new
                    movement appealed explicitly to a sort of prophetic succession, in which their
                    prophets had received the same gift which the daughters of Philip, for example,
                    had exercised in that very country of Phrygia. The burden of the new prophecy
                    was a more exacting standard of moral obligations, especially with regard to
                    marriage, fasting, and martyrdom. But Montanus had larger schemes in view. He
                    wished to organize a special community of true Christians to wait for the coming
                    of their Lord. The small Phrygian towns of Pepuza and Tymion were selected as
                    the headquarters —the Jerusalem, as the prophet called them—of his church. He
                    spared no effort to accomplish this union of believers. Funds were raised for
                    the new organization, and from these the leaders and missionaries, who were to
                    have nothing to do with worldly life, drew their pay. But the ecstasy of the
                    prophet did not prove so contagious as his preaching. Only two women, Prisca and
                    Maximilia, were moved by the Spirit; like Montanus, they uttered in a state of
                    frenzy the commands of the Spirit, which spoke through them sometimes as God the
                    Father, sometimes as the Son, and urged men to a strict and holy life. This does
                    not mean that visions and significant dreams may not have been of frequent
                    occurrence in Montanistic circles. But, as chosen and permanent organs of the
                    Paraclete, only three persons were recognized—Montanus, Prisca, and Maximilia;
                    by their side, however, Alcibiades and Theodotus, from a very early date, played
                    an active part as missionaries and organizers.</p>
                <p>For twenty years this agitation appears to have been confined to Phrygia and the
                    neighbouring provinces. How could it be otherwise? To assemble the whole of
                    Christendom at Pepuza was a rather impracticable proposal. But after the year
                    177 a persecution of Christians, from some unexplained causes, broke out
                    simultaneously in many provinces of the empire. Now in these days every
                    persecution was regarded as the beginning of the end. It quickened the
                    conscience, and gave more strength to eschatological hopes; it was a call to
                    observe the signs of the times and the intimations of God’s presence. It would
                    seem that before this time Montanus had disappeared from the scene; but
                    Maximilia, and probably also Prisca, were working with redoubled energy. And
                    now, throughout the provinces of Asia Minor, in Rome, and even in Gaul, amidst
                    the raging of persecution, attention was attracted to this remarkable movement.
                    The desire for a sharper exercise of discipline, and a more decided renunciation
                    of the world, combined with a craving for some plain indication of God’s will in
                    these last critical times, had prepared many minds for an eager acceptance of
                    the tidings from Phrygia. There the Spirit, whom Christ had promised to His
                    disciples, had begun His work; there, at least, there were holy Christians and
                    joyful martyrs. The oracles of the Phrygian prophets became household words in
                    distant churches, and it was always the more serious-minded who received them
                    with undisguised sympathy. And thus, within the large congregations where there
                    was so much that was open to censure in doctrine and constitution and morals,
                    conventicles were formed in order <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n805/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0805-0776"/> that Christians might prepare themselves by
                    strict discipline for the day of the Lord.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile in Phrygia and its neighbourhood—especially in Galatia, and also in
                    Thrace—a controversy was raging between the adherents and the opponents of the
                    new prophecy. Between 150 and 176 the authority of the episcopate had been
                    immensely strengthened, and along with it a settled order had been introduced
                    into the churches. It need hardly be said that, as a rule, the bishops were the
                    most resolute enemies of the Montanistic enthusiasm. It disturbed the peace and
                    order of the congregations, and threatened their safety. Moreover, it made
                    demands on individual Christians such as very few could comply with. But the
                    disputation which Bishops Zoticus of Cumana and Julian of Apamea arranged with
                    Maximilia and her following turned out most disastrously for its promoters. The
                    “spirit” of Maximilia gained a signal victory, a certain Themison in particular
                    having reduced the bishops to silence. Sotas bishop of Anchialus attempted to
                    refute Prisca, but with no better success; he too had to retire from the field
                    in disgrace. These proceedings were never forgotten in Asia Minor, and the
                    report of them spread far and wide. In after times the only way in which the
                    discomfiture of the bishops could be explained was by asserting that they had
                    been silenced by fraud or violence. This was the commencement of the
                    excommunication or secession, whichever it may have been, of the Montanists in
                    Asia Minor. “I am pursued like a wolf,” exclaimed the spirit that spoke through
                    Maximilia; and her admonitions about the end became more emphatic than ever
                    :—“After me there will come no other prophetess, but the end.” Not only did an
                    extreme party arise in Asia Minor rejecting all prophecy and the Apocalypse of
                    John along with it, but the majority of the churches and bishops in that
                    district appear (c. 178) to have broken off all fellowship with the new
                    prophets, while books were written to show that the very form of the Montanistic
                    prophecy was sufficient proof of its spuriousness.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Miltiades, <hi rend="italic">πeρl</hi><hi

                    Miltiades, if not earlier, Apollinaris of Hierapolis also wrote against the
                    Montanists.</p></note></p>
                <p>In Gaul and Rome the prospects of Montanism seemed for a while more favourable.
                    The confessors of the Gallican Church were of opinion that communion ought to be
                    maintained with the zealots of Asia and Phrygia; and they addressed a letter to
                    this effect to the Roman bishop, Eleutherus. Whether this is the bishop of whom
                    Tertullian <hi rend="italic">(Adv. Prax.,</hi> 1) relates that he was on the
                    point of making peace with the churches of Asia and Phrygia— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the Montanistic communities—is not certain; it was either he or his
                    successor Victor. It is certain, at anyrate, that there was a momentary
                    vacillation, even in Rome. Nor is this to be wondered at. The events in Phrygia
                    could not appear new and unprecedented to the Roman Church. If we may believe
                    Tertullian, it was Praxeas of Asia Minor, the relentless foe of Montanism, who
                    succeeded in persuading the Roman bishop to withhold his letters of
                    conciliation.</p>
                <p>Early in the last decade of the 2d century two considerable works appeared in
                    Asia Minor against the Kataphrygians. The first, by a bishop or presbyter whose
                    name is not known, is addressed to Abircius bishop of Hierapolis, and was
                    written in the fourteenth year after the death of Maximilia, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> apparently about the year 193. The other was written by a certain
                    Apollonius forty years after the appearance of Montanus, consequently about 196.
                    From these treatises we learn that the adherents of the new prophecy were very
                    numerous in Phrygia, Asia, and Galatia (Ancyra), that they had tried to defend
                    them selves in writing from the charges brought against them (by Miltiades),
                    that they possessed a fully-developed independent organization, that they could
                    boast of many martyrs, and that they were still formidable to the church in Asia
                    Minor. Many of the small congregations had gone completely over to Montanism,
                    although in large towns, like Ephesus, the opposite party maintained the
                    ascendency. Every bond of intercourse was broken, and in the Catholic churches
                    the worst calumnies were retailed about the deceased prophets and the leaders of
                    the societies they had founded.</p>
                <p>In many churches outside of Asia Minor a different state of matters prevailed.
                    Those who accepted the message of the new prophecy did not at once leave the
                    Catholic Church in a body. They simply formed small conventicles within the
                    clψrch; in many instances, indeed, their belief in the new prophecy may have
                    remained a private opinion which did not affect their position as members of the
                    larger congregation. Such, for example, appears to have been the case in
                    Carthage (if we may judge from the Acts of the martyrs Perpetua and Felicitas)
                    at the commencement of the persecution of Septimius Severus about the year 202.
                    But even here it was impossible that an open rupture should be indefinitely
                    postponed. The bishops and their flocks gave offence to the spiritualists on so
                    many points that at last it could be endured no longer. The latter wished for
                    more fasting, the prohibition of second marriages, a frank, courageous
                    profession of Christianity in daily life, and entire separation from the world;
                    the bishops, on the other hand, sought in every way to make it as easy as
                    possible to be a Christian, lest they should lose the greater part of their
                    congregations. The spiritualists would have excluded from the church every one
                    who had been guilty of mortal sin; the bishops were at that time specially
                    anxious to relax the stringency of the old disciplinary laws. And lastly, the
                    bishops were compelled more and more to take the control of discipline into
                    their own hands, while the spiritualists, appealing to the old principle that
                    God alone can remit or retain sins, insisted that God Himself— <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> the Spirit—was the sole judge in the congregation, and that
                    therefore all proceedings must be conducted according to the directions of the
                    prophets. On this point especially a conflict was inevitable. It is true that
                    there was no rivalry between the new organization and the old, as in Asia and
                    Phrygia, for the Western Montanists recognized in its main features the Catholic
                    organization as it had been developed in the contest with Gnosticism; but the
                    demand that the “organs of the Spirit” should direct the whole discipline of the
                    congregation contained implicitly a protest against the actual constitution of
                    the church. Even before this latent antagonism was made plain, there were many
                    minor matters which were sufficient to precipitate a rupture in particular
                    congregations. In Carthage, for example, it would appear that the breach between
                    the Catholic Church and the Montanistic conventicle was caused by a disagreement
                    on the question whether or not virgins ought to be veiled. For nearly five years
                    (202-207) the Carthaginian Montanists strove to remain within the church, which
                    was as dear to them as it was to their opponents. But at length they quitted it,
                    and formed a congregation of their own, declaring that the Catholic Church was
                    henceforth only a body of “psychic” Christians, because she would not
                    acknowledge the Spirit whom God had at last poured out on His people.</p>
                <p>It was at this juncture that Tertullian, the most famous theologian of the West,
                    left the church of which he had been the most loyal son and the most powerful
                    supporter, and whose cause he had so manfully upheld against pagans and
                    heretics. He too had come to the conviction that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n806/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0806-0777"/> church at large was given over to worldliness,
                    that she had forsaken the old paths and entered on a way that must lead to
                    destruction. The writings of Tertullian afford the clearest demonstration that
                    what is called Montanism was a reaction against secularism in the church, and an
                    effort to conserve the privileges of primitive Christ ianity. At the same time,
                    they show no less clearly that Montanism in Carthage was a very different thing
                    from the Montanism of Montanus. Western Montanism, at the beginning of the 3d
                    century, admitted the legitimacy of almost every point of the Catholic system.
                    It allowed that the bishops were the successors of the apostles, that the
                    Catholic rule of faith was a complete and authoritative exposition of
                    Christianity, and that the New Testament was the supreme rule of the Christian
                    life. How, then, one may well ask, was it possible to separate from the Catholic
                    Church? On what ground could the separation be justified? How could it be said
                    that a new era of the Spirit had come in when the Spirit had already given all
                    necessary instructions in the Scriptures of the New Testament? And what claim
                    could be thought to exceed the legitimate rights of the successors of the
                    apostles? Montanus himself and his first disciples had been in quite a different
                    position. In his time there was no fixed, divinely-instituted congregational
                    organization, no canon of New Testament Scriptures, no anti-Gnostic theology,
                    and no Catholic Church. There were simply certain communities of believers bound
                    together by a common hope, and by a free organization, λvhich might be modified
                    to any required extent. When Montanus proposed to summon all true Christians to
                    Pepuza, in order to live a holy life and prepare for the day of the Lord, there
                    was nothing whatever to prevent the execution of his plan except the inertia and
                    lukewarmness of Christendom. But this was not the case in the West at the
                    beginning of the 3d century. At Rome and Carthage, and in all other places where
                    sincere Montanists were found, they were confronted by the imposing edifice of
                    the Catholic Church, and they had neither the courage nor the inclination to
                    undermine her sacred foundations. This explains how the later Montanism never
                    attained a position of influence. In accepting, with slight reservations, the
                    results of the development which the church had undergone during the fifty years
                    from 160 to 210 it reduced itself to the level of a sect. For, if the standpoint
                    of the Catholic Church is once acknowledged, then Montanism is an innovation;
                    and if the canon of the New Testament is accepted the doctrine of a new era of
                    the Spirit is heresy. Tertullian exhausted the resources of dialectic in the
                    endeavour to define and vindicate the relation of the spiritualists to the
                    “psychic” Christians; but no one will say he has succeeded in clearing the
                    Montanistic position of its fundamental inconsistency.</p>
                <p>Of the later history of Montanism very little is known. But it is at least a
                    significant fact that prophecy could not be resuscitated. Montanus, Prisca, and
                    Maximilia were always recognized as the inspired authorities. At rare intervals
                    a vision might perhaps be vouchsafed to some Montanistic old woman, or a brother
                    might now and then have a dream that seemed to be of supernatural origin; but
                    the overmastering power of religious enthusiasm was a thing of which the
                    Montanists knew as little as the Catholics. Their discipline was attended with
                    equally disappointing results. In place of an intense moral earnestness binding
                    itself by its own strict laws, we find in Tertullian a legal casuistry, a
                    finical morality, from which no good could ever come. It was only in the land of
                    its nativity that Montanism held its ground till the 4th century. It maintained
                    itself there in a number of close communities, probably in places where no
                    Catholic congregation had been formed: and to these the Novatians at a later
                    period attached themselves. In Carthage there existed down to the year 400 a
                    sect called Tertullianists; and in their comparatively late survival we have a
                    striking testimony to the influence of the great Carthaginian teacher. On
                    doctrinal questions there was no real difference between the Catholics and the
                    Montanists. The early Montanists (the prophets themselves) used expressions
                    which seem to indicate a Monarchian conception of the person of Christ. After
                    the close of the 2d century we find two sections amongst the Western Montanists,
                    just as amongst the Western Catholics,—there were some who adopted the
                    Logos-Christology, and others who remained Monarchians.</p>

                    although plentiful, are fragmentary, and require a good deal of critical
                    sifting. They may be divided into four groups. (1) The utterances of Montanus,
                    Prisca, and Maximilia<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    are our most important sources, but unfortunately they consist of only
                    twenty-one short sayings. (2) The works written by Tertullian after he became a
                    Montanist furnish the most copious information,—not, however, about the first
                    stages of the movement, but only about its later phase, after the Catholic
                    Church was established. (3) The oldest polemical works of the 2d century,
                    extracts from which have been preserved, especially by Eusebius <hi
                    rend="italic">[Hist. Eccles.,</hi> bk. v.), form the next group. These must be
                    used with the utmost caution, because even the earliest orthodox writers give
                    currency to many misconceptions and calumnies. (4) The later lists of heretics,
                    and the casual notices of church fathers from the 3d to the 5th century, though
                    not containing much that is of value, yet contain a little.<note anchored="true"
