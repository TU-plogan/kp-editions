                    >b.c.</hi> “the country of two rivers” is mentioned on the Egyptian monuments
                    under the name Naharina, but no such designation appears in the cuneiform
                    inscriptions (though the territory formed part of the Assyrian as it afterwards
                    did of the Persian empire). The most settled period in the history of
                    Mesopotamia was probably under Persian-Greek rule. Xenophon applies the name
                    Syria to the extremely fertile district which he traversed after having crossed
                    the Euphrates at Thapsacus. The country beyond the Araxes (Chaboras ?) he calls
                    Arabia, —a desert region in which his army had to suffer great hardships until
                    it reached the “gates of Arabia.” Even in later times Mesopotamia was included
                    under the name Assyria, or was reckoned part of Babylonia.</p>
                <p>These statements of Xenophon already indicate a demarcation of the territory
                    afterwards called Mesopotamia, as well as its division into two sections. The
                    fertile portion, inhabited by agricultural Aramaeans, stretched from the
                    Euphrates to the Chaboras; the desert portion, the home of wandering tribes,
                    extended to the Tigris. It would be rash, however, to conclude from this that
                    Mesopotamia designated the whole territory between the Euphrates and Tigris;
                    indeed it is possible that <hi rend="italic">Aram, Naharayim,</hi> the Aram of
                    the country of the two rivers, originally meant only the main portion of the
                    fertile country inhabited by Syrians. In this case the two boundary rivers must
                    have been, not the Euphrates and the Tigris, but the Euphrates and the Chaboras.
                    After the final occupation of the country by the Romans (156 A.D.), the
                    political province of Mesopotamia was practically confined to this more limited
                    district. Though in ordinary usage the Euphrates and Tigris are considered as
                    the two rivers which bound Mesopotamia, the one bank of the river cannot be
                    geographically separated from the other, and consequently narrow strips of
                    country on the right bank of the Euphrates and on the left bank of the Tigris
                    must be reckoned to the country “between” the rivers. On the other hand, the
                    country between the sources of the Euphrates and the Tigris has from early times
                    been reckoned not to Mesopotamia but to Armenia. In this direction the Masius
                    range forms the proper boundary, and it is only on rare occasions that
                    theoretical geographers extend the name Mesopotamia over the more northern
                    districts, Sophene, &amp;c. Purely theoretical too, and not to be approved, is
                    the extension of the definition so as to include the land of Babylonia ('Irâk
                    <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Arabi), that is, the country as far south as the
                    confluence of the Euphrates and Tigris, or even as far as their embouchure in
                    the Persian Gulf.</p>
                <p>From what has been said it appears that Mesopotamia reaches its northern limits
                    at the points where the <hi rend="smallcaps">Euphrates</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.υ.)</hi> and the Tigris break through the mountain range and enter the
                    lowlands. In the case of the Euphrates this takes place at Sumeisât (Samosata),
                    in that of the Tigris near Jeziret ibn 'Omar (Bezabdâ) and Mosul (Nineveh).
                    Consequently the irregular northern boundaries are marked by the lowland limits
                    of those spurs of the Taurus mountains known in antiquity as Mons Masius and now
                    as Karaje Dâgh and Tur 'Abdin. Towards the south the ancient boundary was the
                    so-called Median Wall, which, near Pirux Shapur, not much to the south of Hit
                    (the ancient Is), crossed from the Euphrates in the direction of Kadisiya (Opis)
                    to the Tigris. There the two rivers approach each other, to diverge again lower
                    down. At the same place begins the network of canals connecting the two rivers
                    which rendered the country of Babylonia one of the richest in the world; there
                    too, in a geological sense, the higher portion of the plain, consisting of
                    strata of gypsum and marl, comes to an end; there at one time ran the line of
                    the sea-coast; and there begin those alluvial formations with which the mighty
                    rivers in the course of long ages have filled up this depressed area.
                    Mesopotamia thus forms a triangle lying in the north-west and south-east
                    direction, with its long sides towards the north and southwest. It extends from
                    37° 30' to about 33° N. lat. and from 38° to 46° E. long., and has an area of
                    some 55,200 square miles. The points at which the rivers issue from among the
                    mountains have an absolute altitude of between 1000 and 1150 feet, and the plain
                    sinks rapidly towards the southern extremity of Mesopotamia, where it is not
                    more than about 165 feet above the sea. As a whole the entire country consists
                    of a single open stretch, save that in the north there are some branches of the
                    Taurus—the Nimrιid Dâgh near Orfâ, the long limestone range of'Abd-el'Aziz,
                    running north-north-west, and farther to the east the Sinjar range, also of
                    limestone, 7 miles broad and 50 miles long, running north-north-east. Between
                    these two ranges—near the isolated basaltic hill of Tell Kôkab (Hill of
                    Stars)—runs the defile by which the waters of the Chaboras, swollen by the
                    Jaghjagha and other affluents from the Masius, find their way into the heart of
                    Mesopotamia. The Khâbùr proper, the ancient Chaboras, which rises in the
                    three-hundred copious fountains of Râs-ain (the ancient Rhesaena), and
                    ultimately falls into the Euphrates near Karkisiyâ (Circesium), forms the
                    boundary between the two, or more correctly the three, great divisions of
                    Mesopotamia. These divisions are (1) the northern country to the west of the
                    Khâbùr, (2) the northern country to the east, and (3) the steppe-land. In the
                    country to the north-west of the Khâbùr we must probably, as already mentioned,
                    recognize the true ancient <hi rend="italic">Aram Naharayim.</hi> Under the
                    dominion of the Seleucids it bore the name of Osrhoene, or better Orrhoene, and
                    was for a time the seat of a special dynasty which at a later date at any rate
                    was Arabian (Abgar). The capital of this kingdom was Orfa (Roha), the Edessa of
                    the Greeks and Romans, the Orrhoi of the Syrians; it was at a later date a Roman
                    colony, and bore also the name of Justinopolis. This once flourishing city lies
                    on the small river Daisan (the ancient Scirtus). South of Edessa lie <pb

                    (see vol. xi. p. 454). In the Mongolian period Harran fell into decay, and at
                    present it is a mere heap of ruins. A third town of this region is Serug (Gen.
                    xi. 20); in the Greek period it was called Batne, but the Syrians retained the
                    name Serug, which is still in use (Serùj). The town lies between Harran and the
                    Euphrates, in a plain to which it gives its name. On the left bank of the
                    Euphrates lay Apamea (the modern Birejik), connected with Zeugma on the other
                    side by a bridge, and farther south, at the mouth of the Bilechas (modern
                    Belik), was the trading town and fortress Nicephorium, founded by command of
                    Alexander, and completed by Seleucus Nicator, in memory of whose victory it was
                    named. From the emperor Leo it received the designation Leontopolis. The spot is
                    now known as Rakka (see below). Farther up the fruitful valley of the Belik lay
                    the town of Ichnae (Chne). Farther south lay Circesium <hi rend="italic"
                    >(C</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">haboras</hi> of
                    Ptolemy, <hi rend="italic">Phaleg</hi> of Isidor), not to be identified, as is
                    usually assumed, with Carchemish; from the time of Diocletian it was strongly
                    fortified. The site is at present occupied by a wretched place of the name
                    Karkisiyâ. Carchemish probably lay near the bridge of Membij, the present Kalat
                    el-Nejm.</p>
                <p>In ancient times a highly flourishing district must have stretched along the
                    river Chaboras (Khâbür) to its principal source at Râs-ain (“Fountain-head,”
                    Syr. <hi rend="italic">RisKaina,</hi> the Rhesaena of Ptolemy), a town which was
                    for some time called Theodosiopolis, because after 380 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> it was extended and embellished by Theodosius. Justinian fortified
                    it. The strip of completely desert country which now stretches along the lower
                    course of the Khâbür was called in antiquity Gauzanitis, and corresponds to the
                    Gozan of 2 Kings xviii. 6 (Guzana or Guzanu in the cuneiform inscriptions).</p>
                <p>The country to the east of the upper Khâbür is in many respects similar to that
                    which has just been described. As the watershed of the Tigris is not far
                    distant, the Masius range sends down into Mesopotamia only insignificant
                    streams, the most important being the Hermas, the Mygdonius of the Greeks. On
                    its banks was situated Nisibis, the chief city of the district, which commanded
                    the great road at the foot of the mountains leading through the steppe, which
                    here from the scarcity of water comes close up to the edge of the hills. In the
                    old Assyrian empire Nasibina was the seat of one of the four great
                    administrative officials. In the time of the Seleucids the site was occupied by
                    the flourishing Greek colony of Antiochia Mygdonia; but the new designation,
                    transferred to the river and the vicinity of Nisibis from the Macedonian
                    district of Mygdonia, afterwards passed out of use. Nisibis was an important
                    trading city, and played a great part in the wars of the Romans against the
                    Persians. Captured by Lucullus, surrendered by Tigranes, recovered by Trajan,
                    again abandoned by Hadrian, once more occupied under Lucius Verus, and strongly
                    fortified by Severus, it was at length raised to be the capital of the province,
                    and remained the frontier fortress of the Romans till in the time of Jovian it
                    was ceded to the Persians. After the loss of Nisibis the emperor Anastasius in
                    507 founded to the north-west the fortress of Darae or Daras (the modern Dârâ),
                    also called Anastasiopolis, which from the reign of Justinian, who increased its
                    strength, remained for a time the residence of the <hi rend="italic">dux
                    Mesopotamia.</hi> Besides these strongholds, many fortified posts were
                    established by the Byzantine empire in this district. Antoninopolis must be
                    mentioned as an important town; this was refortified by Constantine under the
                    name of Constantia, and has left its ruins near Tela between Harran and Nisibis.
                    Mardin too was a fortress of a similar kind, and the town of Singara, at the
                    southern foot of the mountain of the same name, was an advanced post of the
                    Roman power.</p>
                <p>The south or steppe portion of Mesopotamia was from early times the
                    roaming-ground of Arabic tribes; for Xenophon gives the name of Arabia to the
                    district on the left bank of the Euphrates to the west of the Khâbür; and
                    elsewhere it is frequently stated that the interior at a distance from the
                    rivers was a steppe inhabited by Arabes Scenitae (Tent Arabs). Along the bank of
                    the two great rivers ran a belt of cultivated country, and the rocky islands of
                    the Euphrates were also occupied by a settled population. On the Euphrates,
                    beginning towards the north, we must mention first Zaitah or Zautha, south-east
                    of Circesium; next Corsothe, at the mouth of the Mascash; then Anatho or
                    Anathan, the modern Ana; and finally Is (Hit). On the Tigris the point of most
                    importance is Carnae '(Kαιvαi of the <hi rend="italic">Anabasis),</hi> south
                    from the mouth of the Great Zab near the present KaΓat Sherkât; and not far
                    distant towards the interior was Atrae or Hatrae, also called Hatra, the chief
                    town of the Arab tribe of the Atreni. It was besieged without success by Trajan
                    and Severus; by the 4th century it was already destroyed; but the interesting
                    ruins, which can scarcely be visited owing to the plundering habits of the
                    Bedouins, still bear the name of El-Hadhr. They lie in the heart of the steppe,
                    and were formerly well supplied with water.</p>
                <p>All these districts came in 640 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> or perhaps a
                    little earlier, into the power of the Arabs, who named them Jezira (island) or
                    Jeziret Akιιr,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Philostratus (c. 200 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> already reports that
                    the Arabs called Mesopotamia <hi rend="italic">vησos.</hi></p></note> and
                    divided them according to tribes into three portions, the land of Bekr, of
                    Rebi'a, and of Modhar. The district of Modhar ran along the side of the
                    Euphrates, and its chief towns were Orfa and Rakka; the district of Rebfa
                    comprised the plain of Mosul as far as the country on the Khâbür (chief towns
                    Mosul and Nisibis), and the district of Bekr (Diyâr Bekr) the more mountainous
                    country to the west of the upper Tigris (chief town Amid or Diarbekr). In
                    general the Arabs consider a part of the mountain territories which lie between
                    the two rivers to belong to Jezira, as is best seen from the following notice
                    given by Abulfeda:—</p>
                <p>“El-Jezira is the land between the Tigris and the Euphrates, yet many places on
                    the other side of the Euphrates, which-properly belong to Syria, are also
                    included, as well as places and even districts on the east side of the Tigris.
                    The exact boundary line thus runs from Malatia by Sumeisat, KaΓat er-Rüm
                    (Rum-Kala of the maps), and Bire (Birejik) to the point opposite Membij, and
                    then by Balis, Er-Rakka, Karkisiyâ, Er-Rahaba (on right bank), and Hit to Anbar.
                    Mere the Euphrates ceases to form the boundary, which runs across to the Tigris
                    in the direction of Tekrit, anti ascends the Tigris as far as Es-Sinn (Senna) to
                    El-Haditha and Mosul, thence to Jeziret ibn Omar, then to Diarbekr, and so back
                    to Malatia.”</p>
                <p>From the Arabic geographers and travellers we gain the impression that a great
                    part of Mesopotamia, with the exception of the southern steppe of course, must
                    at that time have been in a very flourishing condition; the neighbourhood of
                    Nisibis especially is celebrated as a very paradise. In fact it is only since
                    the Turkish conquest of the country under Sultan Selim in 1515 that it has
                    turned into a desert and gradually lost its fertility. As the nomadic Arabs have
                    continually extended their encroachments, agriculture has been forced to
                    withdraw into the mountains; and this is especially true of the western portions
                    of Mesopotamia, the district of Râs-ain, and the plain of Harran and Serüj,
                    where huge mounds give evidence that the whole country was once covered with
                    towns and villages. Under the Turks El-Jezira does not form a political unity,
                    but belongs to different pashaliks.</p>
                <p>From this brief survey it appears that Mesopotamia, like Syria, constitutes an
                    intermediate territory between the great eastern and western monarchies,—Syria

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0058-0049"/> more to the west, and Mesopotamia to the east. In
                    virtue of its position it frequently formed both the object and the scene of
                    contest between the armies of those mighty monarchies, and it is wonderful how a
                    country so often devastated almost always recovered. The roads, it is true,
                    which traversed the territory were not mere military highways, but the main
                    routes of traffic for Central Asia, Western Asia, and Europe. It is only in
                    modern times, and since these lines of commercial intercourse have ceased to be
                    followed, that the general condition of things has been so entirely altered.</p>
                <p>The number of roads which in ancient times traversed the country was very
                    considerable; the Euphrates formed not a barrier but a bond between the nations
                    on either side; at many places there were at least boat-bridges (zeugma) across.
                    One of the most important of the ancient crossing-places must be sought, where
                    in fact it still exists, at Birejik, the ancient Apamea-Zeugma. From this point
                    a great road led across to Edessa (Orfa); there it divided into two branches,
                    the northern going by Amid (Diarbekr) and the other by Mardin and Nisibis to
                    Mosul (Nineveh). In quite recent times, in order to avoid the direct route
                    across the desert and through the midst of the Bedouins, the post-road makes a
                    great circuit from Nisibis by Jeziret ibn <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> 0mar to
                    Mosul. A second route crossed the Euphrates somewhat more to the south, and
                    joined the other <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Harran and Rhesaena. The principal
                    crossing of the earlier times (Xenophon) was at Thapsacus, almost opposite
                    Rakka; and it will be remembered also how important a part Thapsacus (Tiphsah)
                    plays in the Old Testament. Sometimes a route along the Euphrates to Babylonia
                    was followed, as is still frequently done by caravans at the present day; but
                    even in ancient times this course was attended by more or less difficulty, the
                    country being occupied by the chiefs of independent Arab tribes, with whom the
                    travellers had to come to terms.</p>
                <p>The ancient condition of things must consequently be considered as essentially
                    analogous to that of the present day; the central districts away from the rivers
                    were occupied at certain seasons, according as they yielded pasture, by nomadic
                    cattle-grazing tribes, the physical character of the country being then and now
                    the same on the whole as that of the Syrian desert, which belongs not to Syria
                    but properly to Arabia. On the banks of the rivers were settled half-nomadic
                    Arab tribes,—tribes, that is, which were more or less on the way to the
                    agricultural stage, or which, having become altogether agricultural, had
                    nevertheless, owing to frequent intercourse with the Bedouins, lost little of
                    their original character, and even maintained their independence. The same
                    movement takes place over and over again: Arab tribes migrating from Arabia,
                    that <hi rend="italic">officina</hi><hi rend="italic">gentium,</hi> gradually
                    settle down wherever circumstances prove favourable, and by this very change in
                    their mode of life make their first step towards civilization. In this way a
                    continual stream of Arabs has flowed into the civilized countries of
                    Mesopotamia. On the Assyrian monuments are figures of Arabs riding on camels;
                    evidently the Assyrians had carried on war against the Bedouins settled in their
                    territory. At an early period the Tai Arabs were the neighbours of the
                    Aramaeans, and consequently all Arabs bear in Syriac the name of Tayôyé. The
                    district between Mosul and Nisibis received the name Béth ‘ Arbâyé from its
                    being occupied by Arabs. These Tai Arabs, whose original home was Central
                    Arabia, are still settled partly near Nisibis and partly east of Mosul; but they
                    have to some extent lost their old noble Bedouin manners. The wandering Arab
                    tribe which at the present time is dominant in Mesopotamia is the Shammar; they
                    have driven back the Aneze, the most powerful tribe of the</p>
                <p>Syrian desert. It is only two or three generations ago that the Shammar came from
                    Nejd; but they have already broken up into two great parties. The head of the
                    one division is Ferhân, who has more or less completely submitted to the Turks,
                    and has consequently obtained the title of pasha; to him adhere the Shammar
                    tribes between Mosul and Baghdad, and those also to the east of the Tigris. The
                    head of the tribes who roam over the greater part of Mesopotamia—pasturing their
                    camels and sheep to the east of the Chaboras in the colder season and to the
                    north in the hotter—is the chivalrous Fâris. These western tribes are totally
                    independent of the Turkish Government, and have offered determined opposition to
                    the attempts of the authorities at Dér to force them to a settled way of life;
                    they still lay the peasants of Mesopotamia under contribution by exacting
                    Khuwwe, “brother-money,” or a portion of grain. The Shammar live in almost
                    perpetual feud with their relations to the east, and especially with the Aneze
                    on the Syrian bank of the Euphrates, the so-called Shâmiye. Many other Bedouin
                    tribes might here be mentioned; but it may be enough to name the Delém on the
                    Euphrates as an example of a tribe just in process of becoming agricultural. In
                    the northern parts of Mesopotamia there are a number of tribes of mingled Kurds
                    and Arabs which have to a greater or less degree abandoned their tents for fixed
                    habitations and the tillage of the ground; such are the Beraziye near Orfa, the
                    Milliye between Orfa and Mardin, and the Kikiye nearer Mardin and also in the
                    neighbourhood of Mosul. It is extremely hard to obtain trustworthy statistical
                    information about the number of the Bedouins; the Shammar may have a total
                    strength of some 3500 tents. In the difficult contests which it has to carry on
                    with those independence-loving tribes, the Turkish Government acts in general on
                    the principle <hi rend="italic">divide</hi><hi rend="italic">et impera.</hi></p>
                <p>The Kurdish element only appears sporadically in the true Mesopotamian plain; but
                    the Yezidis, who form the population of the Sinjar range, may be referred to
                    this stock. He who encounters the uncanny figure of one of these people will
                    hardly be able to restrain a slight shudder, especially if he remembers the
                    graphic descriptions of the Yezidi robbers in Morier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ayesha.</hi> Of the old Aramaean peasantry there are no longer any important
                    remains in the plain, the Aramaeans having withdrawn farther into the Kurdish
                    highlands, where, in spite of their wild Kurdish neighbours, they are more
                    secure from exactions of every kind. The plain of the northern country of the
                    two rivers was at one time richly cultivated, and owed its prosperity to this
                    industrious people, who formerly played so distinguished a part as a connecting
                    link between the Persians and the Roman empire and afterwards between the
                    Western and the Arabian world, and whose highest culture was developed in this
                    very region. Quite otherwise is it now. In the plain there are almost no remains
                    of the common Aramaean tongue. Apart from the scattered areas in which Kurdish
                    prevails, the ordinary language is a vulgar Arabic dialect; but both Kurdish and
                    Aramaean (Syriac) have exercised an influence on the speech of the Arab peasant.
                    Finally it must be mentioned that certain Turcoman hordes roam about the
                    Mesopotamian territory.</p>
                <p>In climate and in the character of its soil, as well as in its ethnographic
                    history, Mesopotamia holds an intermediate position. In this aspect also” we
                    must maintain the division into two quite distinct zones. The southern half
                    consists mainly of grey, dreary flats covered with selenite; and gypsum
                    everywhere makes its appearance a little below the surface; bitumen is not
                    unfrequent, and here and there it rises in petroleum wells. In the solid strata
                    of gypsum and marl the rivers have carved out valleys, from a quarter to half a
                    mile broad and from 40 to 50 or even 100 feet deep, which with their arable soil
                    contrast with the barren surface of the more elevated desert (chôl). Especially
                    below Balis there are marl-hills capped with gypsum, and alluvial plains
                    (so-called <hi rend="italic">hdvAs)</hi> of considerable extent <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n59/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0059-0050"/> have been formed. The banks of the rivers are
                    there lined with a luxuriant growth of tamarisks. Occasional swamps and small
                    lagoons occur; and the marl shows a more or less marked efflorescence of salt.
                    In this part of the country frost is rare even in winter; in summer the heat is
                    of extraordinary intensity, and during the whole season from May to the close of
                    October it is but slightly modified by the night-dews. During the sand storms
                    which frequently blow from the West Arabian desert, the temperature may rise to
                    50° C. (122° Fahr.), and this same excess of heat will then prevail through
                    seven degrees of latitude in the whole valley of the Euphrates and Tigris from
                    the Persian Gulf to the foot of the mountains. For, considering the strong
                    radiation which takes place over what is now the uniform surface of the
                    Mesopotamian soil with its almost complete absence of evaporation, there is
                    nothing to hinder this warm zone extending in summer to the upper half of the
                    country. In winter, on the other hand, this latter region has quite a different
                    climate. From the mild coasts of the Mediterranean the cold increases from west
                    to east. In the spurs of the Taurus, consequently, the winter cold extends far
                    to the south, and the influence of the snow-covered ridges spreads far into the
                    Mesopotamian plain. Snow and ice are thus not unfrequent in the higher part of
                    the plain, and the temperature may fall as low as - 10° C. (14° Fahr.),
                    especially if the cold north winds are blowing. That inland region too is cut
                    off from the influence of the mild air of the Mediterranean by the coast ranges.
                    For this reason the vegetation is of a less southern character than that of the
                    Mediterranean countries in the same latitude. In the spring the green is soon
                    parched out of existence. In this way the northern district of Mesopotamia
                    combines strong contrasts, and is a connecting link between the mountain region
                    of western Asia and the desert of Arabia. On the other hand the country to the
                    south of Mesopotamia, or 'Irak, has a warm climate, and towards the Persian Gulf
                    indeed the heat reaches the greatest extremes.</p>
                <p>In Upp⅛r Mesopotamia, strictly so called, agriculture has suffered an
                    extraordinary decline; in spite of excellent soil, very little of the land is
                    turned to account. In the western district the fertile red-brown humus of the
                    Orfa plain, derived from the lime of Nimπid Dagh, extends to about 12 miles
                    south of Harran. With a greater rainfall, and an artificial distribution of the
                    water such as existed in olden times, agriculture would flourish. If spring
                    rains are only moderately abundant, wheat and barley <hi rend="italic">grow
                    to</hi> a great height, and yield from thirty to forty fold. Rice is also grown
                    in the richly watered hill-encircled district of Senij and on the banks of the
                    Khâbûr. Next, millet and sesamum are the chief crops,—the latter being grown for
                    the sake of its oil, as the olive does not succeed in this region. The abundance
                    of wheat may be estimated from the fact that during Layard’s residence in Mosul
                    a camel-load of 480 tt&gt; was worth four shillings. Durra <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Holcus</hi><hi rend="italic">Sorghum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">H.
                    bicolor),</hi> lentils, pease, beans, and vetches are also grown, as well as
                    cotton, safflower, hemp, and tobacco. <hi rend="italic">Medicago</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sativa</hi> furnishes fodder for horses. Among the fruits the most
                    noteworthy are the cucumbers, melons, and water-melons planted in great
                    abundance on the banks of the smaller streams. The figs of the Sinjar mountains
                    are celebrated for their exceptional sweetness. Timber trees are few; plane
                    trees and white poplars are planted along the streams, and a kind of willow and
                    a sumach flourish on the banks of the Euphrates. The palm-trees which appear on
                    the banks of both the rivers farther south do not come so far north. On account
                    of the hot dry summer the orange does not succeed. Of the great forest which
                    existed (?) near Nisibis in the time of Trajan no trace remains; but the slopes
                    both of the Masius mountains and of the Jebel 'Abd-el 'Aziz, as well as, more
                    especially, those of the Sinjar range, are still covered with wood.</p>
                <p>The wide treeless tracts of the low country of Mesopotamia are covered with the
                    same steppe vegetation which prevails from Central Asia to Algeria, but there is
                    an absence of a great many of the arborescent plants that grow in the rockier
                    and more irregular plateaus of western Asia and especially of Persia. This
                    comparative poverty and monotony of the flora is partly due to the surface being
                    mainly composed of detritus, and partly to the cultivation of the country in
                    remote antiquity having ousted the original vegetation and left behind it what
                    is really only fallow ground untouched for thousands of years. Endless masses of
                    tall weeds, belonging to a few species, cover the face of the country,—large <hi
                    rend="italic">Cruciferae, Cynareae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Umbelliferae</hi>
                    disputing the possession of the soil in company with extraordinary quantities of
                    liquorice <hi rend="italic">(Glycyrrhiza glabra</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >echinata)</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">Lagonychium</hi> and the white ears
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Imperata.</hi> In autumn the withered weeds are torn up
                    by the wind and driven immense distances. Among the aromatic plants, which even
                    Xenophon mentions in Mesopotamia, the first place belongs to the species of
                    wormwood <hi rend="italic">(Artemisia),</hi> which cover wide areas, and the
                    second to <hi rend="italic">Ldbiatae,</hi> such as species of thyme and <hi
                    rend="italic">Salvia,</hi> which, however, become rarer in the low country. With
                    few exceptions there are none but cultivated trees, and these are confined to
                    the irrigated districts on the Euphrates and the Shatt; a few willows, a <hi
                    rend="italic">Pyrus,</hi> tamarisks, a <hi rend="italic">Rhus,</hi> a <hi
                    rend="italic">Rubus,</hi> on the banks of the rivers, and the willow-like <hi
                    rend="italic">Populus euphralica,</hi> which grows from Dzungaria to Morocco,
                    make up the list of the indigenous kinds. In the wide belt of swamp which lines
                    the Shatt el-'Arab in the low country of 'Irak 'Arabi there are boundless
                    reaches of gigantic sedge inhabited by a rich fauna, especially of birds such as
                    pelicans and flamingoes. From the south, or in other words from the true desert
                    and oasis country of Arabia, the date-palm spreads up the valley to some little
                    distance above Baghdad; and especially along the Shatt it yields rich crops of
                    fruit, which are exported to India. With the exception of a few truffles,
                    capers, liquorice, and such like, there are few wild food-plants. The cycle of
                    vegetation begins in November. The first winter rains clothe the plain with
                    verdure, and by the beginning of the year a number of bulbous plants are in
                    bloom— <hi rend="italic">Amaryllidae, Liliaceae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Colchicum.</hi> The full summer development is reached in June; and by the end
                    of August everything is burnt up.</p>
                <p>The lion is said to roam as far as the Khâbûr; but in any case it is at least
                    much less frequent than in the time of the Assyrians, when the lion-hunt was a
                    recognized form of sport. The wild ass too is very rare; but on the other hand
                    wild swine, hyaenas, jackals, cheetahs, and foxes are extremely abundant. Wolves
                    are said to exist in the plain, and among others a variety of black wolf <hi
                    rend="italic">(Canis</hi><hi rend="italic">lycaon).</hi> Particularly numerous
                    in the steppe are the antelope species; and herds of gazelles are frequently met
                    with. Beavers are said to have been observed on the Euphrates. Jerboas, moles,
                    porcupines, and especially the common European rat, abound in the desert; bats
                    are numerous; and the long-haired desert hare is also found. Among the domestic
                    animals in this steppe country the camel holds the first place; and next come
                    goats and sheep; but the Bedouin sheep is not the ordinary fat-tailed variety.
                    The common buffalo is often kept by the Arabs an&lt;i Turcomans on the Euphrates
                    and the Tigris; and on the Euphrates we also find the Indian zebu, which is
                    still more frequent in the districts farther to the south. Bird-life is very
                    rare in the southern parts of the plain; though on the Euphrates there are
                    vultures, owls, ravens, &amp;c., as well as falcons (? <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tinnunculus</hi><hi rend="italic">alaudarius)</hi> which are trained to hunt.
                    Among game-birds are some kinds of doves, francolins, partridges, wild ducks and
                    geese, and in the steppe bustards. The ostrich seems almost to have disappeared.

                <p>In conclusion it is necessary in supplement to the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Irak</hi> to say something of the district of Babylonia, often (though wrongly)
                    included under the name Mesopotamia. Here we have to do with a fundamentally
                    different region, for it consists in the main of alluvial formations, a few
                    scattered reaches of sand only now and then appearing in the level depression
                    not filled up by the alluvium. The mass of solid matter which the rivers bring
                    down and deposit is very considerable; it has been ascertained that the maximum
                    proportion for the Euphrates in the month of January is ∙ <hi rend="subscript">
                    s</hi> ⅛-, and at other times <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi>; for the Tigris the maximum is <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi>-⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi>. As regards the physical character of the
                    alluvia, in the most northerly portion the soil is pebbly, the pebbles
                    consisting almost solely of variously coloured flints and occasional small
                    fragments of gypsum. This is succeeded by a continuous formation of clayey soil,
                    in part argillaceous and argillo-calcareous, but covered with mould and sand, or
                    the more tenacious clay of frequent inundations.</p>
                <p>In general, the northern plains of the interior have a slight but well-defined
                    southerly inclination with local depressions. The territory undulates in the
                    central districts, and then sinks away into mere marshes and lakes. The clay, of
                    a deep blue colour, abounds with marine shells, and shows a strong efflorescence
                    of natron and sea-salt, the latter derived from the decomposition of vegetable
                    matter. When the soil is parched up the appearance of the mirage (serâb) is very
                    common. As extensive inundations in spring are caused by both the rivers,
                    especially the Tigris, great alterations must have taken place in this part of
                    the country in the course of thousands of years. It has been asserted that in
                    former times the alluvial area at the mouth of the river increased one mile in
                    the space of thirty years; and from this it has been assumed that about the 6th
                    century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> the Persian Gulf must have stretched from
                    45 to 55 miles farther inland than at present. The actual rate of increase at
                    the present time is about 72 feet per annum. For this reason we cannot decide
                    much in regard to the former physical configuration of southern Babylonia; but
                    it is at least certain that the Euphrates and the Tigris reached the sea as
                    independent rivers. Ritter estimates that in the time of Alexander the Great the
                    embouchures were still separated by a good day’s journey; and, though they
                    cannot now be traced, great alterations have probably taken place in the upper
                    portions of the rivers as well as in the country near the mouths. Assyriologists
                    tell us that more than thirty-five canals are known by name from the Babylonian
                    period; but it is extremely difficult, or rather it has proved hitherto
                    impossible, to identify them either with those actually existing or with those
                    mentioned in classical authors, in the Babylonian Talmud, or in Arabian writers.
                    To the west of the Euphrates was to be found the Pallacopas channel, and we
                    still have the Hindiye channel in the same quarter. The country between the
                    rivers more particularly was traversed by such secondary branches. Beginning <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0060-0051"/> from the Euphrates we must mention theSaklawiye
                    channel (Nahr 'Isa), the Nahr Melik, the Nahr Zemberâniÿe, and especially the
                    Nahr-en-Nil, constructed by the famous Omayyad governor Ilajjâj. Eastwards from
                    the Tigris strikes the great Nahrawan channel; and right through the country of
                    the two rivers runs the Shatt-el Hai from Kut-el-'Amâra, almost due south to the
                    Euphrates, parallel with the Shatt-el-Kehr. Many of these have been silted up;
                    from those, however, which are still maintained there is derived a considerable
                    revenue, and by the restoration of many of the old channels, traces of which are
                    met with at every step, the country might be again raised to that condition of
                    high civilization which it enjoyed not only in antiquity but partly even in the
                    time of the later caliphs. The classical writers are unanimous in their
                    admiration of this country; and it is at least certain that nowhere else in the
                    whole world was the principle of the application of canals to the exigencies of
                    agriculture worked out so successfully. The most luxuriant vegetation was
                    diffused over the whole country; and three crops were obtainable in the year. It
                    is this alone which makes it intelligible how this region in the most remote
                    antiquity attained a high civilization, and for centuries played, it may be
                    said, one of the principal parts in the history of the world. In the matter of
                    civilization, indeed, no country of the ancient world was its equal; a multitude
                    of great cities once flourished within its borders. Even the Arabic writers are
                    unanimous in regard to the extremely favourable influence which the character of
                    the country exercised on the intellectual activity, spirit, and capacity of its
                    inhabitants. We need not here discuss the question recently started as to
                    whether the Biblical garden of Eden is to be sought in this locality, two canals
                    of the Euphrates and Tigris being identified with the Gihon and Pison of Gen.
                    ii.; but it is certain at least that this lower country of the two rivers might
                    well pass in antiquity for the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi rend="italic">plus
                    ultra</hi> of civilization, and exercised the most powerful political and
                    intellectual influence on the surrounding regions. The question often raised as
                    to whether the Semites were derived from this district may also be left
                    untouched. From the Bible we know that an ancient name of the district was
                    Shinar, though this has not hitherto been discovered in the cuneiform
                    inscriptions. The name Kush is applied in the Bible to its oldest non-Semitic
                    inhabitants. The northern half of the country was called Akkad, the southern
                    Sumer. But it must not be forgotten that the rivers never formed ethnographic
                    and political boundaries; and thus Sumer extended to the coast of the Persian
                    Gulf and Akkad as far as the Lower Zab, the eastern affluent of the Tigris. As a
                    less ancient designation of the whole country may be reckoned <hi rend="italic"
                    >mat Kaida,</hi> the country of the Chaldaeans (Hebr., <hi rend="italic">erets
                    Kasdtm)</hi>; originally Kaida is said to have designated central Babylonia. Of
                    still later date is the name derived from the capital, the country of Babel <hi
                    rend="italic">(erets Bdbel),</hi> as an equivalent of which <hi rend="italic"
                    >mât Bâbîlû</hi> appears in the cuneiform inscriptions (in the Darius lists <hi
                    rend="italic">Babtτu).</hi> From this was developed the Greek designation
                    Babylonia, <hi rend="italic">^Raβυ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ωv'ιa</hi> (as early as Xenophon). That the country was densely peopled may be
                    gathered from the fact that about 704 B.o. eighty-nine fortified towns and eight
                    hundred and twenty smaller places in the Chaldaean country were captured during
                    one military expedition. Of separate districts of the country we may mention
                    Karduniash, the district in the vicinity and especially to the north of Babylon;
                    and southward by the sea-coast the important country of Bit Yakin, governed by
                    kings of its own. At a later date we find on the coast and at the mouth of the
                    Pallacopas canal the maritime town of Teredon, which is also mentioned by the
                    classical writers. Besides Babylon and Borsippa, the larger cities were the
                    double city of Sippar (Sefarvayim, 2 Kings xvii. 24, 31) and Akkad on the left
                    bank of the Euphrates on the present Nahr 'Isa; Erech, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Warka, on the left bank of the Euphrates; Ur on the Pallacopas, not
                    far from the. place where the Shatt-el-Hai falls into the Tigris; Nippur, <hi
                    rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Tell Niffer; Kutha (2 Kings xvii. 24), Kalne (Gen. X.
                    10), in the north, Opis at the junction of the Adhem (Physcus) with the Tigris.
                    Huge mounds give evidence of the extent of these cities. A number of the canals
                    were navigable, and at the same time, when the bridges were destroyed, they
                    formed defensive moats against the incursion of enemies from the north. And the
                    same purpose was served by the great wall (afterwards the Median Wall of the
                    Greeks) which ran across the country from river to river between the points of
                    their nearest approach.</p>
                <p>During the period of Greek domination a Greek city, Seleucia, which afterwards
                    attained great prosperity, was founded by Seleucus I. in an extremely favourable
                    situation on the right bank of the Tigris. In the south of the country, too,
                    there was a Greek seaport town first called Alexandria on the Tigris and
                    afterwards Antiochia. After the conquest of Babylonia by the Parthians (130 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>) a small Arabian kingdom grew up in those parts
                    called Characene or Mesene, after the town of Charae or Maisan. It was under
                    Parthian and for a time under Roman supremacy. The city of Vologesia, founded by
                    Vologeses to the south-west of Babylon, near Ullais, in the neighbourhood of the
                    later Kιifa, was one of the capitals of the Parthian power. In the time of the
                    Sasanids, too, as well as in that of the Parthians, the country of the lower
                    Euphrates and Tigris played a leading part; it formed in fact the main centre of
                    the Persian kingdom. The city of Ctesiphon, founded by the Greeks on the east
                    side of the Tigris opposite Seleucia, was the winter residence of the Parthian
                    kings, and the imperial capital of the Sasanids. Under the name of Madâin (The
                    Cities) it continued to flourish till the rise of Baghdad in the 9th century.
                    The neighbourhood of Ctesiphon was called in the time of the Sasanids Suristan,
                    a translation of the Aramaean designation Bêth-Arâmâyê, “country of the
                    Syrians,” for the land was mainly occupied by Aramaeans. By a notable
                    substitution the Arabs afterwards gave the name Nabat, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i.e.,</hi> Nabataeans, to these Aramaean peasantry, who, it may be added, were
                    already found in these parts at the time of the Babylonian empire.</p>
                <p>On the west side of the Tigris the Arab kingdom of Hira formed the bulwark of the
                    Sasanid power. As the result mainly of the battle of Kadisiya (east of Hira) in
                    635 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the whole of this wealthy country fell into
                    the hands of the Moslems, and it soon constituted the centre of their power,
                    especially when the Abbasids, with true political insight, transferred thither
                    the capital of the empire and founded Baghdad. The chief cities of the older
                    Arabic period were Kιifa (in the neighbourhood of the earlier Hira to the south
                    of ancient Babylon) and Basra (or <hi rend="smallcaps">Bussorah,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> in the neighbourhood of the earlier Maisan. After these
                    two cities the country was divided into the Sawâd, “rich arable district,” of
                    Basra and that of Kûfa. Sawâd was also employed as a name for the whole country;
                    and more or less identical with this designation is the name 'Irak still in use.
                    Sometimes also the term Sawâd-el-'Irâk is employed; but at a later date the
                    country is distinguished as ’Irait 'Arabi (Arabian 'Irak) from the Persian ’Irak
                    'Ajemi to the east, the ancient Media. The Arabian geographer Yâkût makes the
                    distinction that the country called Sawâd reaches farther to the north (viz., to
                    the district of the Upper Zâb).</p>
                <p>Abulfeda gives the boundaries or Irak as follows:—“In the west of the country lie
                    El-Jezira and the desert, in the south the desert, the Persian Gulf, and
                    Khuzistân, in the east the mountain country as far as Holwân (near the principal
                    pass through the Zagrus range). Thence the boundary runs again towards
                    Mesopotamia. Thus the greatest breadth of 'Irâk is in the north, and its narrow
                    extremity is formed by the island 'Abbâdân in the Shatt-el-'Arab (the united
                    Euphrates and Tigris) to the south of Basra.’’ From what has been said it
                    appears that 'Irâk extended far beyond the country between Euphrates and Tigris.
                    Abulfeda says clearly that 'Irâk lies on the Tigris as Egypt on the Nile; for
                    according to this view the Tigris flows through the middle of the country. 'Irâk
                    consequently lies between 30° and 34° 30' N. lat. and between 44 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> δ</hi> and 48° 30' E. long.; of its area it is impossible to
                    form an estimate under such varying conditions. For some details see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Baghdad.</hi></p>
                <p>From the union of the rivers upwards, in the case of the Euphrates as far as 26°
                    N. lat. (above Rakka), in that of the Tigris to 35° N. lat., the valleys are
                    known as <hi rend="italic">ez-≈6r,</hi> the depression, in opposition to the
                    more elevated desert-plateau. It has been surmised that in this name is to be
                    recognized the Dùra of the Old Testament (Daniel iii. 1).</p>
                <p>Very little of the ancient condition of the country has been preserved; and there
                    are now but few remains of ancient buildings, scarcity of stone having all along
                    led to the use of bricks. 'Irâk has played its part. It is only by the
                    expenditure of immense sums, far beyond the financial capacity of the Turkish
                    Government, that the ancient canals could be restored and the swamps formed by
                    them drained. The whole land falls into two unequal portions,—an extensive dry
                    steppe with at any rate a healthy desert climate, and an unhealthy region of
                    swamps. There is a good deal more agriculture along the Euphrates than along the
                    Tigris; but swamps, with almost impenetrable reed thickets, composed of a kind
                    of <hi rend="italic">Agrostis,</hi> are at the same time much more extensive.
                    The slightly more elevated districts are the special habitat of the date palm,
                    which by itself forms dense groves bordering the banks particularly on the lower
                    Euphrates, for a distance of several days’ journey. This part of the country
                    consequently has a somewhat monotonous but in its own way imposing aspect. A
                    luxuriant vegetation of water-plants is to be found in the swamps, which are the
                    haunt of numerous wild beasts—wild swine, lions, different kinds of aquatic
                    animals and birds. The swamps are inhabited by a wild race of men, dark of hue,
                    with many negroes amongst them. They live in reed huts, and cultivate rice; and
                    they weave straw mats. In the main they keep pretty free both of the Turkish
                    Government and of the semi-Bedouins and Bedouins of 'Irâk. The Khazael
                    especially who dwell to the south of ancient Babylon often give the Government
                    trouble, through their passion for independence. Less turbulent are the Bedouins
                    in the interior of the country—the Zobeid, the Afaij, and the Abu Muhammed; but
                    on the other hand the Beni Lâm (7500 tents strong), who occupy the great tract
                    of country east of the Tigris to the south of Baghdad, have often been a source
                    of great annoyance to the pashas of that city. A still more difficult task is
                    the management of the Shammar, who come and pitch their tents to the south-east
                    of Baghdad; and also the Muntefitch on the southern Euphrates put the whole

                    the test. The Turkish influence has here made at one time great advance and at
                    another lost all the ground it had gained,—the rich and powerful sheikhs of the
                    Muntefitch sometimes becoming for a season rulers over the whole of Southern
                    'Irak and even over the town of Basra. The present writer once visited the great
                    sheikh Nasir in his camp near Sûk-esh-Shiyùkh; and he received the impression of
                    having to do with a very remarkable and astute personage.</p>
                <p>The old Syrian population of 'Irak has almost entirely disappeared; the few
                    remnants left are distinguished by a special religion, in regard to which see
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mandaeans.</hi> Ethnographically the country is
                    subject to a double influence. On the one hand the connexion with Nejd, the
                    central plateau of Arabia, continues uninterrupted; the emigration from that
                    region being mainly directed towards 'Irak and Jezira. In Baghdad even, the
                    'Agél-Bedouins from Central Arabia have a quarter of their own. With the
                    earnings obtained in these rich districts the emigrants return to their homes.
                    But quite as strong at least is the influence of Persia. Persian customs are in
                    fashion; in Baghdad there is an important Persian quarter; and Kerbela and
                    Meshed ’ Ali to the west of the Euphrates may be considered regular Persian
                    “enclaves.” In these places are buried the son-in-law of Mohammed, the caliph
                    Ali, and his son Hosein (in Kerbela), the chief saints of the Shiite sect; and
                    their tombs are not only shrines of pilgrimage to the living, but the dead are
                    brought by countless caravans from Persia to be buried in ground which they have
                    made holy. The neighbourhood of Kerbela reeks with the odour of corpses; and
                    from the midst of them pestilence has often begun its march. Throughout the
                    whole of 'Irak the Shiites have many adherents,—for example, the Khazael already
                    mentioned. Persian influence prevails on the Arab population of 'Irak, and the
                    intermingling of the races can still be very clearly traced; in this distant
                    corner of the Turkish empire a more international tone prevails than in any
                    other district. And, however small when compared with former times the
                    commercial and intellectual intercourse of various nations in these regions may
                    be at the present day, the attentive observer must notice that such intercourse
                    does still exist, though within restricted limits. No trace, indeed, is to be
                    found of that rich intellectual development which was produced in the time of
                    the caliphs through the reciprocal action of Persian and Arabic elements. Still
                    the quickwittedness of the inhabitants of 'Irak makes a decided impression on
                    the traveller passing through Asiatic Turkey; and one might venture to prophesy
                    that the country might to some extent recover its former position in the world,
                    especially if English influence from India were more widely extended, and should
                    lead to the construction of a railway. The trade which passes through 'Irak is
                    even now not unimportant; horses, for example, are exported in considerable
                    numbers from southern 'Irdk to India. But it might be very much improved, as the
                    country, it is said, could support five hundred times as many inhabitants as it
                    actually contains. There is also a considerable export of dates, a fruit which
                    forms the chief sustenance of a great number of the inhabitants; and the
                    breeding of cattle (especially buffaloes) is extensively carried on. Ohly a few
                    steamboats as yet navigate the majestic rivers. Communication by water is
                    carried on by means of the most primitive craft. Goods are transported in the
                    so-called “terrades,” moderately big high-built vessels, which also venture out
                    into the Persian Gulf as far as Kuwét. Passengers are conveyed, especially on
                    the Euphrates, in the <hi rend="italic">meshhûf,</hi> a very long and narrow
                    boat, mostly pushed along the river bank with poles. The Mesopotamian
                    “kelleks”—rafts laid on goatskin bladders—come down as far as Baghdad, where
                    round boats made of plaited reeds pitched with asphalt are in use. At Basra, on
                    the other hand, we see the “belem,” boats of a large size, having the appearance
                    of being hollowed out of tree trunks, and partly in fact so constructed.
                    Throughout 'Irak in general Indian influence is partially at work; in the hot
                    summer months, for instance, when the natives live in underground apartments
                    (serdâb), the Indian punkah is used in the houses of the rich. As regards
                    language, the local Arabic dialect has evidently been affected on the one hand
                    by Persian, on the other by the Bedouin forms of speech.</p>
