                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Wesleyan Methodism.</hi></p>
                <p>THE history of Wesleyan Methodism embraces—(1) the Methodism of Oxford, which was
                    strictly Anglican and rigidly rubrical, though it was also more than rubrical;
                    (2) the evangelical Methodism of the Wesleys after their conversion (in 1738),
                    of which the Wesleyan doctrines of conversion and sanctification were the
                    manifesto and inspiration, while preaching and the class-meeting were the great
                    motive and organizing forces,—a movement which before Wesley’s death had
                    developed into a form containing, at least in embryo, all the elements of a
                    distinct church organization, although in its general designation and deliberate
                    claims it purported to be only an unattached spiritual society; and (3) Wesleyan
                    Methodism since the death of Wesley, which, by steps at first rapid and
                    afterwards, though leisurely, distinct and consecutive, assumed an independent
                    position, and has grown into complete development as a church.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Oxford Methodism.—</hi> This began in November 1729, when
                    John Wesley, returning to Oxford from Lincolnshire, where he had been serving
                    his father as curate, found that his brother Charles, then at Christ Church, had
                    induced a few other students to join him in observing weekly communion. John
                    Wesley’s accession lent weight and character to the infant association. Their
                    first bond of association, besides the weekly communion, was the common study of
                    the Greek Testament, with which they joined regular fasting, the observance of
                    stated hours for private devotion, the visitation of the sick, of the poor, and
                    of prisoners, and the instruction of neglected children. They never themselves
                    adopted any common designation, but of the variety of derisive names they
                    received from outsiders that of “Methodists” prevailed,—a sobriquet the fitness
                    of which, indeed, as descriptive of one unchanging and inseparable feature of
                    Wesley’s character (which he impressed also on his followers), was
                    undeniable.</p>
                <p>This first Oxford Methodism was very churchly. Between 1733 and 1735, however, a
                    new phase was developed. Its adherents became increasingly patristic in their
                    sympathies and tendencies, and Wesley came much under the influence of William
                    Law. In regard to this period of his history, Wesley himself says that he</p>
                <p>“Bent the bow too far, by making antiquity a coordinate, rather than a
                    subordinate, rule with Scripture, by admitting several doubtful writings, by
                    extending antiquity too far, by believing more practices to have been universal
                    in the ancient church than ever were so, by not considering that the decrees of
                    a provincial synod could bind only that province, and the decrees of a general
                    synod only those provinces, whose representatives met therein, that most of
                    those decrees were adapted to particular times and occasions, and, consequently,
                    when those occasions ceased, must cease to bind even those provinces.”</p>
                <p>It was in 1736, during his residence in Georgia, whither he had gone as a
                    missionary of the Propagation Society, that he learnt those lessons.
                    Notwithstanding his ascetic severity and his rubrical punctilios, the
                    foundations of his High-Churchmanship were gradually giving way. When he
                    returned to England he had already accepted the doctrine of “salvation by
                    faith,” although he had not as yet learned that view of the nature of faith
                    which he was afterwards to teach for half a century. He had, however, as in the
                    journal of his homeward voyage he tells us, learned, “in the ends of the earth,”
                    that he “who went to America to convert others was never himself converted to
                    God.” In this result his Oxford Methodism came to an end.</p>
                <p>The original Methodism of Oxford never at any one time seems to have numbered as
                    many as thirty adherents.</p>
                <p>There was a set called “Methodists,” but there was no organization, no common
                    bond of special doctrine or of discipline; there were habits and usages mutually
                    agreed upon, but there was no official authority, only personal influence. The
                    general features of the fraternity, if fraternity it may be called, seem to
                    suggest closer analogies with the “Tractarian” school in its earlier stages than
                    with anything else in modern history, and the personal ascendency of John Wesley
                    may remind us in some measure of the influence exercised a century later by J.
                    H. Newman. There was no more any germ of permanent organization in the Oxford
                    Methodism of 1735 than in the patristic and “Tractarian” school of Oxford of
                    1833.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>One evidence of
                    this is to be found in the early and wide divergence of the various members of
                    the Oxford Methodist company, after their brief association at the university
                    came to an end. We know which way the Wesleys went; we know also the separate
                    path that their·friend Whitefield made for himself. John Clayton, the Jacobite
                    churchman, settled at Manchester, renounced the Wesleys after they began their
                    evangelical movement, and remained an unbending High-Churchman to the end.
                    Benjamin Ingham became a great evangelist in Yorkshire, founded societies, and,
                    with his societies or churches, took the decisive step of leaving the Church of
                    England and embracing the position of avowed Dissent. The saintly Gambold, a
                    poet as well as a theologian and preacher, became a Moravian bishop. James
                    Hervey was in after life a famous evangelical clergyman, holding “Low” and
                    Calvinistic views. These were the chief of the Methodists of
                    Oxford.</p></note></p>

                    with his two years in Georgia, makes it evident that he passed at this time into
                    a new spiritual region.” “By Peter Böhler,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>A disciple of Zinzendorf, who had settled in
                    London.</p></note> in the hands of the great God,” he writes in his journal, “I
                    was, on March 5, fully convinced of the want of that faith whereby we are
                    saved.” This “conviction” was followed on March 24 of the same year (1738) by
                    his “conversion.”</p>
                <p>Like most good men of that age in England, Wesley, before he came under the
                    influence of his Moravian teacher, had regarded faith as a union of intellectual
                    belief and of voluntary self-submission—the belief of the creeds and submission
                    to the laws of Christ and to the rules and services of the church, acted out day
                    by day and hour by hour, in all the prescribed means and services of the church
                    and in the general duties of life. From this conception of faith the element of
                    the supernatural was wanting, and equally that of personal trust for salvation
                    on the atonement of Christ. The work of Böhler was to convince Wesley that such
                    faith as this, even though there might be more or less of divine influence
                    unconsciously mingling with its attainment and exercise, was essentially nothing
                    else than an intellectual and moral act or habit, a natural operation and result
                    altogether different from the true spiritual faith of a Christian. This
                    conviction led him a few days afterwards to stand up at the house of the Rev. Mr
                    Hutton, College Street, Westminster, and declare that five days before he had
                    not been a Christian. When warned not thus to despise the benefits of
                    sacramental grace, he rejoined, “When we renounce everything but faith and get
                    into Christ, then, and not till then, have we reason to believe that we are
                    Christians.” It is true that for several years after this he remained
                    High-Church in <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n195/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0195-0186"/> some of his principles and opinions, but
                    nevertheless his ritualism was dead at its roots.</p>
                <p>This experience also made Wesley an evangelist. He had a forgotten gospel to
                    preach,—the gospel by which men were to be converted, as he had been, and to be
                    made “new creatures.” And this result, this new birth, was not dependent on any
                    churchly form or ordinance, on any priestly prerogative or service, or on any
                    sacramental grace or influence. To raise up, accordingly, by his preaching and
                    personal influence, a body of converted men, who should themselves become
                    witnesses of the same truth by which he had been saved, was henceforth to be
                    Wesley’s life-work. This was the inspiration under which he became a great
                    preacher; this also made him an organizer of his living witnesses into classes
                    and societies. In the pulpit was the preaching power; in the class-room was the
                    private and personal influence. The vital link between the pulpit and the class
                    meeting was the doctrine and experience of “conversion.” Thus Wesleyan Methodism
                    is derived, not from Wesley the ritualist, but from Wesley the evangelist.</p>
                <p>Wesley’s doctrines offended the clergy. His popularity as a preacher alarmed
                    them. The churches were soon shut against him. He attended the religious
                    meetings— on a Church of England basis—which had existed in London and elsewhere
                    for fifty years, so far as these were still open to him, the Moravian meetings,
                    and meetings in the rooms of private friends, but these were quite insufficient
                    for the zeal and energy of himself and his brother, who had been “converted” a
                    few days before himself. Accordingly, in 1739, he followed the example set by
                    Whitefield, and preached in the open air to immense crowds. In the same year
                    also he yielded to the urgency of his followers and to the pressure of
                    circumstances, and, becoming possessed of an old building called “the Foundery,”
                    in Moorfields, transformed it into a meetinghouse. Here large congregations came
                    together to hear the brothers. About the same time, in Bristol and the
                    neighbouring colliery district of Kingswood, he found himself obliged, not a
                    little against his will, to become the owner of premises for the purpose of
                    public preaching and religious meetings. Here was the beginning of that vast
                    growth of preaching-houses and meeting-rooms, all of them for nearly fifty years
                    settled on Wesley himself, which, never having in any way belonged to the Church
                    of England, became, through Wesley, the possession of the Methodist
                    Connexion.</p>
                <p>The religious societies through which the Wesleys, after their conversion,
                    exercised at first their spiritual influence were in part, as has been
                    intimated, Moravian,—that in Fetter Lane, of which the rules were drawn up by
                    Wesley himself in 1738 (May 1), being the chief of these,—and in part societies
                    in connexion with the Church of England, the successors of those which sprang up
                    in the last years of the Stuarts, as if to compensate for the decay of
                    Puritanism within the church. In 1739, however, a strong leaven of antinomian
                    quietism gained entrance among the Moravians of England (Böhler himself having
                    left for America in the spring of 1738); and Wesley, after vainly contending for
                    a time against this corruption, found it necessary formally to separate from
                    them, and to establish a society of his own, for which a place of meeting was
                    already provided at the Foundery. This was the first society under the direct
                    control of Wesley, and herein was the actual and vital beginning of the Wesleyan
                    Methodist Society, that is, of Wesleyan Methodism. Hence the Wesleyans
                    celebrated their centenary in 1839. It was not, however, till 1743 that Wesley
                    published the Rules of his Society .By that time not a few other local societies
                    had bθ2∩ addd to that at the Foundery, the three chief centres being London,
                    Bristol, and Newcastle. Hence Wesley called his Society, when he published the
                    “Rules” in 1743, the “United Societies.” His brother’s name was joined with his
                    own at the foot of these Rules, in their second edition, dated May 1, 1743, and
                    so remained in all later editions while Charles Wesley lived. Those Rules are
                    still the rules of Wesleyan Methodism. Since Wesley’s death they have not been
                    altered. During his life only one change was made of any importance. In 1743 the
                    offerings given weekly in the classes were for the poor, there being at that
                    time no Conference and no itinerant preachers except the two brothers; after a
                    few years the rules prescribed that the weekly contributions were to go “towards
                    the support of the gospel.” The Society is described as “a company of men having
                    the form, and seeking the power, of godliness, united in order to pray together,
                    to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that
                    they may help each other to work out their salvation.” “The only condition
                    previously required of those who desire admission into these societies” is “a
                    desire to flee from the wrath to come, and to be saved from their sins.” The
                    customary contribution was a minimum of a penny a week or a shilling a
                    quarter.</p>
                <p>In 1739 these societies were not divided into “classes.” But in 1742 this further
                    step in organization was taken, and the change is recognized in the rules of
                    1743. Leaders were appointed to these classes, and became an order of spiritual
                    helpers and subpastors, not ordained like lay elders in the Presbyterian
                    churches, but, like them, filling up the interval between the pastors that
                    “labour in the word and doctrine” and the members generally, and furnishing the
                    main elements of a council which, in after years, grew up to be the disciplinary
                    authority in every “society.” In every society there was from the beginning a
                    “steward” to take and give account of moneys received and expended. After a few
                    years there were two distinct stewards, one being specially appointed to take
                    cafe of the poor and the “poor’s money,” the other being, in general, the
                    “society steward.” And, finally,—though hardly, perhaps, during Wesley’s
                    lifetime,—in the larger societies there came to be two stewards of each
                    description. The leaders and stewards together constituted “the leaders’
                    meeting,” of which, however, the complete circle of functions grew into use and
                    into recognition only by degrees. The Rules of the Society, which are strict and
                    searching, relate to worship, to conduct, and to the religious life, but do not
                    once mention or refer to the Church of England, the parish church, or the parish
                    clergy. The only authority at first was the personal authority of the two
                    brothers, exercised either directly or by their official delegates. After years
                    had passed away the leaders’ meeting came to have an important jurisdiction and
                    authority, but its rights and powers were neither defined nor recognized until
                    after Wesley’s death. From first to last there is no trace or colour of any
                    Anglican character in the organization. Moravians or Dissenters might have
                    entered the fellowship, and before long many did enter it who had either been
                    Dissenters or, at any rate, had seldom or never entered a church. What would
                    to-day be called the “unsectarian” character of his society was, indeed, in
                    Wesley’s view, one of its chief glories. All the time, however, this
                    “unsectarian” society was only another “sect” in process of formation. Wesley
                    for many years before his death had seen that, unless the rulers of the church
                    should come to adopt in regard to his society a policy of liberal recognition,
                    this might be the outcome of his life-work. And it would seem as if in his
                    private confidences with himself he had come in the end at times to acquiesce in

                    only excluded the Wesleys from their pulpits, but often repelled them and their
                    converts from the Lord’s Supper. This was first done on a large scale, and with
                    a systematic harshness and persistency, at Bristol in 1740. Under these
                    circumstances the brothers took thecdecisive step of administering the sacrament
                    to their societies themselves, in their own meeting-rooms, both at Bristol and
                    at Kingswood. This practice having thus been established at Bristol, it was not
                    likely that the original society at the Foundery would rest content without the
                    like privilege, especially as some of the clergy in London acted in the same
                    manner as those at Bristol. There were therefore at the Foundery also separate
                    administrations. Here then, in 1740, were two—if we include Kingswood,
                    three—separate local churches, formed, it is true, and both served and governed
                    by ordained clergymen of the Church of England, but not belonging to that church
                    or in any respect within its government. As thereafter during Wesley’s life one
                    of the brothers, or some cooperative or friendly clergyman, was almost always
                    present in London and in Bristol for the administration of the sacraments, these
                    communions, when once begun, were afterwards steadily maintained, the Lord’s
                    Supper being, as a rule, administered weekly. Both on Sundays and on week days
                    full provision was made for all the spiritual wants of these “societies,” apart
                    altogether from the services of the Church of England. The only link by which
                    the societies Were connected with that church—and this was a link of sentiment,
                    not an organic one—was that the ministers who served them were numbered among
                    its “priests.”</p>
                <p>In 1741 Wesley entered upon his course of calling out lay preachers, who
                    itinerated under his directions. To the societies founded and sustained with the
                    aid of these preachers, who were entirely and absolutely under Wesley’s personal
                    control, the two brothers, in their extensive journeys, administered the
                    sacraments as they were able. The helpers only ranked as laymen, many of them,
                    indeed, being men of humble attainments and of unpolished ways. For the ordinary
                    reception of the sacraments the societies in general were dependent on the
                    parish clergy, who, however, not seldom repelled them from the Lord’s table. So
                    also for the ordinary opportunities of public worship they often had no resource
                    but the parish church. The simple service in their preaching-room was, as Wesley
                    himself insisted, defective, as a service of public worship, in some important
                    particulars: besides which, the visits of the itinerants were usually, at least
                    at first, few and far between. Wesley accordingly was urgent in his advices and
                    injunctions that his societies generally should keep to their parish churches;
                    but long before his death, especially as the itinerant preachers improved in
                    quality and increased in number, there was a growing desire among the societies
                    to have their own full Sunday services, and to have the sacraments administered
                    by their own preachers. The development of these preachers into ministers, and
                    of the societies into fully organized churches, was, if not the inevitable, at
                    any rate the natural, result of the steps which Wesley took in order to carry on
                    the work that was continually opening up before him.</p>
                <p>In 1744 Wesley held his first Conference. The early Conferences were chiefly
                    useful for the settlement of points of doctrine and discipline and for the
                    examination and accrediting of fellowlabourers. They met yearly. Conferences
                    were a necessity for Wesley, and became increasingly so as his work continued to
                    grow upon him. It was inevitable also that the powers of the Conference,
                    although for many years the Conference itself only existed as it were on
                    sufferance, and only exercised any authority by the permission of its creator
                    and head, should continually increase. The result was that in 1784 Wesley could
                    no longer delay the legal constitution of the Conference, and that he was
                    compelled, if he would provide for the-perpetuation of his work, to take
                    measures for vesting in trustees, for the use of “the people called Methodists,”
                    under the jurisdiction of the Conference as to the appointment of ministers and
                    preachers, all the preaching places and trust property ol the Connexion. The
                    legal Conference was defined as consisting of one hundred itinerant preachers
                    named by Wesley, and power was given to the “legal hundred " continually from
                    the first to fill up the vacancies in their own number, to admit and expel
                    preachers, and to station them from year to year, no preacher being allowed to
                    remain more than three years in one station.</p>
                <p>By this measure Wesley’s work was consolidated into a distinct religious
                    organization, having a legally corporate character and large property rights.
                    And yet Wesley would not allow this great organization to be styled a “church.”
                    It was only a “society” —the “United Society ”—the Society of “the people called
                    Methodists”—the “Methodist Society.” And of its members all who were not
                    professed Dissenters were by him reckoned as belonging to the Church of England,
                    although a large and increasing proportion of them seldom or never attended the
                    services of that church. The explanation of this apparent inconsistency is that
                    Wesley admitted none to be Dissenters except such as were so in the eye of the
                    law—those who, “for conscience sake, refused to join in the services of the
                    church or partake of the sacraments administered therein”—and that he
                    interpreted “the Church of England” to mean, as he wrote to his brother Charles,
                    “all the believers in England, except Papists and Dissenters, who have the word
                    of God and the sacraments administered among them.”</p>
                <p>But Wesley was to carry his Society to a yet higher pitch of development, and one
                    which made it still more difficult to distinguish its character from that of a
                    distinct and separate church. In 1738 Wesley had been theoretically a
                    High-Churchman. For some time even after he had entered upon his course of
                    irregular and independent evangelism he continued to hold, in the abstract,
                    High-Church views. But in 1746 he abandoned once for all his ecclesiastical
                    High-Churchmanship, although he never became either a political or a
                    latitudinarian Low-Churchman after the standard and manner of the 18th century.
                    He relates in his journal under date January 20, 1746, how his views were
                    revolutionized by reading Lord (Chancellor) King’s account of the primitive
                    church. From this time forward he consistently maintained that the
                    “uninterrupted succession was a fable which no man ever did or could prove.” One
                    of the things taught him by Lord King’s book was that the office of bishop was
                    originally one and the same with that of presbyter; and the practical inference
                    which Wesley drew was that he himself was a “Scriptural Episcopos,” and that he
                    had as much right as any primitive or missionary bishop to ordain ministers, as
                    his representatives and helpers, who should administer the sacraments, instead
                    of himself, to the societies which had placed themselves under his spiritual
                    charge. This right, as he conceived it to be, he held in abeyance for nearly
                    forty years, but at length he was constrained to exercise it, and, by so doing,
                    in effect led the way towards making his Society a distinct and independent
                    church.</p>
                <p>In 1784, the American colonies having won their independence, it became necessary
                    to organize a separate Methodism for America, where Methodist societies had
                    existed for many years. Wesley gave formal ordination and letters of ordination
                    to Dr Coke, already a presbyter of the Church of England, as superintendent (or
                    bishop) for America, where Coke ordained Francis Asbury as presbyter and
                    superintendent (or bishop), and Coke and Asbury together ordained the American
                    preachers as presbyters. From that ordination dates the ecclesiastical
                    commencement of American Episcopal Methodism—in which the bishops are only chief
                    among the presbyters whom they superintend, superior in office but of the same
                    order. The Episcopal Methodism of America represents today the largest aggregate
                    of Protestant communicants and worshippers of the same ecclesiastical name to be
                    found in any one nation in the world.</p>
                <p>The following year (1785) Wesley ordained ministers for Scotland. There his
                    societies were quite outside of the established Presbyterianism of the day, with
                    its lukewarm “moderatism while the fervid sects which had seceded from the state
                    church would hold no terms with Arminians like Wesley and his followers. Hence
                    Wesley was compelled to make special provision for the administration of the
                    sacraments in Scotland. He therefore ordained some of his ablest and most
                    dignified preachers, was careful to give them formally in his correspondence the
                    style and title of “Reverend,” and appointed them to administer the sacraments
                    north of the Tweed.</p>
                <p>At length, in 1788, Wesley ordained a number of preachers (Mr Tyerman°says seven)
                    to assist him in administering the sacraments to the societies in England; and
                    of these he ordained one (Alexander Mather) to be superintendent (or bishop),
                    his brother Charles being now dead, and Dr Coke sometimes absent for long
                    periods in America. The number of societies which demanded to have the
                    sacraments administered to them in their own places of worship continually
                    increased, and their claims were often too strong to be resisted, especially
                    when the parish priest was either a public <pb break="no"

                    disreputable conduct. Before Wesley’s death (in 1791) it would seem that there
                    were more than a dozen of his preachers who had at different times, in Scotland
                    or in England, been ordained to administer the sacraments.</p>
                <p>The foregoing view of the development of Methodism as an organization, during the
                    lifetime of its founder, will have conveyed a general idea of its structure and
                    polity. There is one cardinal, though variable, element in its organization,
                    however, of which there has as yet been no occasion to speak. The societies of
                    Methodism—each of these consisting of one or more ‘ ‘ classes ”— were themselves
                    grouped into circuits, each of which was placed under the care of one or more of
                    Wesley’s Conference preachers, who were called his “assistants” or “helpers,”
                    the assistant being the chief preacher of a circuit, and the helper being a
                    colleague and subordinate. The “assistants” were directly responsible to Wesley,
                    who had absolute power over them, and exercised it between the Conferences. The
                    same power he equally possessed in the Conference, at the yearly meetings, but
                    he made it a rule, during his later life, to take counsel with the Conference as
                    to all matters of importance affecting the permanent status of the preachers
                    personally, or relating to the societies and their government. He thus prepared
                    the Connexion, both preachers and people, to accept the government and the
                    legislative control of the Conference after his death.</p>
                <p>At the time of Wesley’s death there were in Great Britain, the Isle of Man, and
                    the Channel Islands, 19 circuits, 227 preachers, and 57,562 members. In Ireland
                    there were 29 circuits, 67 preachers, and 14,006 members. There were also 11
                    mission circuits in the West Indies and British America, 19 preachers, and 5300
                    members. The number of members in the United States was returned as 43,265.</p>
                <p>It has already been explained that in connexion with each society there was a
                    leaders’ meeting, of which society stewards and poor stewards as well as leaders
                    were members. It must here be added that each circuit had its quarterly meeting,
                    of which, at first, only the society stewards and the general steward (or
                    treasurer) for the circuit, in conjunction with the itinerant preachers, were
                    necessary members. Leaders, however, in some circuits were very early, if not
                    from the first, associated with the stewards in the quarterly meeting, or at
                    least had liberty to attend. The quarterly meeting was not defined in Wesleyan
                    Methodism until the year 1852. The leader's’ meeting had no defined authority
                    until some years after Wesley’s death. Discipline, including the admission and
                    expulsion of members, lay absolutely with the “assistant,” subject only to
                    appeal to Mr Wesley. Many years, however, before Wesley’s death it had become
                    the usage for the “assistant,” or, in his absence, the “helper,” his colleague,
                    to consult the leaders’ meeting as to important questions either of appointment
                    to office or of discipline. As the consolidated “society” approached towards the
                    character of a “church,” the leaders’ meeting began to acquire the character and
                    functions of a church court, and private members to be treated, in regard to
                    matters of discipline, as having a status and rights which might be pleaded
                    before such a “court.” The rights, indeed, which, soon after Wesley’s death,
                    were guaranteed to leaders’ meetings and members of society had, there can be no
                    doubt, so far grown up, before his death, as to be generally recognized as
                    undeniable.</p>
                <p>“Bands” were a marked feature in early Methodism, but in later years were
                    allowed, at least in their original form, to fall out of use. There is no
                    reference to them in the “Minutes of Conference” after 1768, although till after
                    Wesley’s death they held a place in the oldest and largest societies. Originally
                    there were usually in each considerable society four bands, the members of which
                    were collected from the various society classes—one band composed of married and
                    another of unmarried men, one of married and another of unmarried women. All the
                    members of society, however, were not of necessity members of bands. Some
                    maturity of experience was expected, and it was the responsibility of the
                    “assistant” to admit into band or to exclude from band. After Mr Wesley’s death,
                    where “bands” so called were kept up, they lost their private character, and
                    became weekly fellowship meetings for the society.</p>
                <p>The “love-feast” was a meeting the idea of which was borrowed from the Moravians,
                    but which was also regarded as reviving the primitive institute of the <hi
                    rend="italic">agape.</hi> In the love-feast the members of different societies
                    come together for a collective fellowship meeting. One feature of the meeting—a
                    memory of the primitive <hi rend="italic">agape—</hi> is that all present eat a
                    small portion of bread or cake and drink of water in common.</p>
                <p>It may be supposed that in such a system as Methodism a large number of preachers
                    and exhorters, from all the social grades included within the societies, could
                    not but be continually raised up. These, during Wesley’s life, acted entirely
                    under the directions of the assistant, and were by him admitted or excluded,
                    subject to an appeal to Wesley. Once a quarter—often in conjunction with the
                    circuit quarterly meeting—a meeting of these local lay helpers, called “local
                    preachers,” was held for mutual consultation and arrangement, and to examine and
                    accredit candidates for the office.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodism after Wesley’s Death</hi> (1791). —When
                    Wesley died the Conference remained as the bond of union and fountain of
                    authority for the Connexion. But between the meetings of Conference Wesley had
                    acted as patriarch and visitor with summary and supreme jurisdiction. The first
                    need to be supplied after his death was an authority for the discharge of this
                    particular function. In America Wesley had organized a system of bishops
                    (presbyter-bishops), presbyters or elders, and deacons or ministers on
                    probation. Among some of those preachers who had been most intimate with Wesley
                    there was a conviction that his own judgment would have approved such a plan for
                    England. No document, however, remains to show that such was his desire. The
                    only request he left behind him for the Conference to respect was one which
                    rather looked in another direction—the well-known letter produced before the
                    Conference on its first meeting after his death by his friend and personal
                    attendant, Mr Bradford, in which he begged the members of the legal hundred to
                    assume no advantage over the other preachers in any respect. The preachers,
                    accordingly, in their first Conference after Wesley’s death, instead of
                    appointing bishops, each with his diocese or province, divided the country into
                    districts, and appointed district committees to have all power of discipline and
                    direction within the districts, subject only to an appeal to the Conference, all
                    the preachers exercising equal rights also in the Conference, the “legal
                    hundred” merely confirming and validating <hi rend="italic">pro forma</hi> the
                    resolutions and decisions of the whole assembly.</p>
                <p>At first the preachers stationed in the districts were instructed to elect their
                    own chairmen, one for each district. But the plan was speedily changed, and the
                    chairmen were elected each year by the whole Conference; and this method has
                    been maintained ever since. The “district meetings”—as they are generally
                    called—are still “committees” of the Conference, and have <hi rend="italic">ad
                    interim</hi> its power and responsibilities as to discipline and administration.
                    Originally they were composed exclusively of preachers, but before many years
                    had passed circuit stewards and district lay officers came to be associated with
                    the preachers during the transaction of all the business except such as was
                    regarded as properly pastoral.</p>
                <p>The relation of the Conference to the government of the Connexion having thus
                    been determined, the question which next arose, and which occupied and indeed
                    convulsed the Connexion for several years (1792-95), was that of the
                    administration of the sacraments, especially of the Lord’s Supper, to the
                    societies. The societies generally insisted on their right to have the
                    sacraments from their own preachers. Many of the wealthier members, however, and
                    in particular a large number of the trustees of chapels, opposed these demands.
                    At length, between 1794 and 1795, after more than one attempt at compromise had
                    been made by the Conference, the feeling of the societies as against the
                    trustees became too strong to be longer resisted, and accordingly at the
                    Conference of 1795 the “plan of pacification” was adopted, the leading provision
                    being that, wherever the majority of the trustees of any chapel, on the one
                    hand, and the majority of the stewards and leaders, on the other, consented to
                    the administration of the sacraments, they should be administered, but not in
                    opposition to either the one or the other of these authorities. In England the
                    Lord’s Supper was always to be administered after the Episcopal form; in
                    Scotland it might still, if necessary, be administered, as it had commonly been
                    before, after the Presbyterian form. In any case, however, “full liberty was to
                    be left to give out hymns and to use exhortation and extemporary prayer.” The
                    result was that within a generation the administration of the sacraments <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n198/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0198-0189"/> to the societies came to be the universal rule.
                    By this legislation the preachers assumed the powers of pastors, in accordance,
                    however, only and always with the desire and choice of their flocks. No formal
                    service or act of ordination was brought into use till forty years afterwards.
                    All preachers on probation for the ministry, after the completion of their
                    probation, were “received into full connexion” with the Conference, this
                    reception implying investment with all pastoral prerogatives. Modern Methodism
                    has developed more fully and conspicuously the pastoral idea.</p>
                <p>No sooner was the sacramental controversy settled than the further question as to
                    the position and rights of the laity came to the front in great force. A
                    comparatively small party, led by Alexander Kilham, imported into the discussion
                    ideas of a republican complexion, and demanded that the members in their
                    individual capacity should be recognized as the direct basis of all power, that
                    they should freely elect the leaders and stewards, that all distinction in
                    Conference between ministers and laymen should be done away (elected laymen
                    being sent as delegates from the circuits in equal number with the ministers),
                    that the ministry should possess no official authority or pastoral prerogative,
                    but should merely carry into effect the decisions of majorities in the different
                    meetings. In the course of a very violent controversy which ensued, pamphlets
                    and broadsheets, chiefly anonymous, from Kilham’s pen, advocating his views and
                    containing gross imputations on the ministers generally, and in particular on
                    some not named but distinctly indicated, were disseminated through the
                    societies. The writer was tried at the Conference of 1796, condemned for the
                    publication of injurious and unjustifiable charges against his brethren, and by
                    a unanimous vote expelled from the Conference. In the following year he founded
                    the “New Connexion,” the earliest of the organized secessions from Wesleyan
                    Methodism.</p>
                <p>Views much more moderate than Kilham’s prevailed in the Connexion at large. At
                    the Leeds Conference of 1797 the basis was laid of that system of balance
                    between the prerogatives of the ministers and the rights of the laity which has
                    been maintained in its principles ever since, and which, in reality, has
                    governed the recent provisions (1877-78) for the admission of
                    lay-representatives into the Conference not less than the former developments of
                    Wesleyan Methodism. The admission of members into the society had, up to 1797,
                    been entirely in the hands of the itinerant preachers,—that is, the “assistant,”
                    henceforth to be styled the “superintendent,” and his “helpers.” The new
                    regulations, without interfering with the power of the ministers to admit
                    members on trial, declared that “the leaders’ meeting shall have a right to
                    declare any person on trial improper to be received into society, and after such
                    declaration the superintendent shall not admit such person into society”; also
                    that “no person shall be expelled from the society for immorality till such
                    immorality be proved at a leaders’ meeting.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>In this regulation it was assumed that the old rule of
                    society by which a member disqualifies and vritually expels himself by continued
                    absence from class, without reason for such absence, still held good. The case
                    provides only for expulsions for ‘ ‘ immorality.” Subsequent legislation has
                    introduced a provision which ensures to any member before he ceases to be
                    recognized on account of non-attendance the right of having his case brought
                    before a leaders’ meeting if he desires it. This rule of 1797 has always been
                    understood by the Conference as constituting the leaders’ meeting in effect a
                    jury, leaving the superintendent with his colleague or colleagues as advisers to
                    act as judge. Appeal has always lain from the leaders’ meeting to the district
                    meeting, and, finally, to the Conference.</p></note> For the appointment of
                    church officers (leaders and stewards) the following regulations were made, the
                    second based on recognized usage, the first on general but not invariable
                    practice :—</p>
                <p>“1. No person shall be appointed a leader or steward, or be removed from his
                    office, but in conjunction with the leaders’ meeting, the nomination to be in
                    the superintendent, and the approbation or disapprobation in the leaders’
                    meeting.</p>
                <p>“2. The former rule concerning local preachers is confirmed,— viz., that no man
                    shall receive a plan as a local preacher, without the approbation of a local
                    preachers’ meeting."</p>
                <p>The Conference at the same time made several provisions for carrying out the
                    process, which had been going on for some years, of denuding itself of direct
                    responsibility in regard to the disbursement of the Connexional funds. The
                    principle was established that such matters were to be administered by the
                    district committees acting in correspondence with the quarterly meetings of the
                    circuits. It was also provided that circuits were not to be divided without the
                    consent of the respective quarterly meetings; and, finally, it was resolved
                    that, in the case of any new rule made by the Conference for the Connexion, its
                    action within a circuit might be suspended for a year by the quarterly meeting,
                    if it disapproved of the rule. If, however, the Conference, after twelve months’
                    interval, still adhered to the new rule, it was to be binding on the whole
                    Connexion.</p>
                <p>The powers of district committees, as defined by former Conferences, were in 1797
                    confirmed and enhanced, special powers being given to special meetings of these
                    committees convened when necessary to settle the affairs of a distracted
                    circuit. In the same Conference all the principal rules of Methodism, in regard
                    both to the ministers and the laity, were collected and (in a sense) codified,
                    including the new regulations adopted that same year; and the whole, under the
                    title “Large Minutes,” was accepted as binding by the Conference, each minister
                    being required to sign his acceptance individually. This compendium, itself
                    based on one which had been prepared by Wesley, is still accepted by every
                    Wesleyan minister on his ordination as containing the rules and principles to
                    which he subscribes. During the sitting of this critical Conference at Leeds an
                    assembly of delegates from bodies of trustees throughout the kingdom was
                    simultaneously held. The form of the regulations enacted by the Conference was,
                    to a considerable extent, determined by the nature and form of the requests made
                    by this body of trustees. There was one request, however, which the Conference
                    distinctly declined to grant—namely, that for lay delegation to the Conference.
                    The Conference replied that they could not admit any but regular travelling
                    preachers into their body, and preserve the system of Methodism entire,
                    particularly the “itinerant plan.” It was not until many years afterwards that
                    anything was heard again as to this matter.</p>
                <p>By the settlement now described the outlines of Methodism as an organized church
                    were fairly completed. Many details have since been filled in, and many changes
                    have been made in secondary arrangements, but the principles of development have
                    remained unchanged. The Connexion after 1797 had a long unbroken period of
                    peaceful progress. The effect of the “Kilhamite” separation, indeed, was after
                    1797 not greatly felt by the parent body. The number of Methodists in the United
                    Kingdom in 1796, the year of Kilham’s expulsion, was 95,226; in 1797 it was
                    99,519; in 1798 the New Connexion held its first Conference, and reported 5037
                    members, the number of the parent body being 101,682. Nor was it till 1806 that
                    the New Connexion reached 6000.</p>
                <p>During the period of quiet growth and development which followed 1797 the
                    influence of one superior mind (Dr Jabez Bunting, 1779-1858) was to prevail with
                    increasing sway. This was to be the period of the gradual development of lay
                    co-operation in the administration of the various departments of Connexional
                    extension and enterprise—a development which prepared the way for the important
                    legislation of 1852 and following years, and for the ultimate settlement of the
                    respective provinces and powers <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n199/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0199-0190"/> of the ministers and laity which was made in
                    1877-78. It was also to be the period of the gradual completion of the pastoral
                    idea, in its practical application to the ministers of the body. This period may
                    be defined as extending from the revolutionary epoch of 1791-97 to the epoch of
                    political and municipal reform agitation, 1828-35, which coincides with a second
                    period of politico-ecclesiastical agitation in Wesleyan Methodism.</p>
                <p>In 1797 the Conference, as already mentioned, had refused to allow elected
                    laymen—or lay delegates—any place either in the Conference or in district
                    committees. Within a few years after 1800, however, the practice grew up for the
                    circuit stewards to attend the district committees during the transaction of
                    financial business, and in 1815 this usage was recognized in the Minutes of
                    Conference as an established “rule,” and it was enacted that no general increase
                    of the income of the ministers should be sanctioned by the Conference until
                    approved by a majority of the district committees during the attendance of the
                    circuit stewards. Since the adoption of this rule the lay element in the
                    district committees has steadily increased and developed. Another characteristic
                    and important feature in the organization of Wesleyan Methodism, which grew into
                    distinct form and prominence during the period now under review, was that of the
                    administration of all the Connexional departments, except such as λvere regarded
                    as properly pastoral, by means of mixed departmental committees, appointed at
                    each successive Conference. These committees made recommendations to the
                    Conference in regard to such new legislation as they thought desirable and to
                    the appointment of the members of committee; and, for each department, a large
                    committee of review, of which the members of the ordinary committee of
                    management formed the nucleus, came to be held each year immediately before the
                    Conference. In these committees the numbers of ministers and of laymen were
                    equal. On this principle, between 1811 and 1835, provision had been made for the
                    management of all the funds of the Connexion and their corresponding departments
                    of administration. The first mixed committee appointed by the Conference was the
                    committee of privileges in 1803.</p>
                <p>The development of the pastoral position and character of the ministers of the
                    body after 1797 could not but advance on a line parallel to the development of
                    the position and claims of the laity. In 1818 the usage of the Conference was
                    conformed to what had long been the ordinary unofficial custom, and the
                    preachers began to be styled in the <hi rend="italic">Wesleyan Methodist
                    Magazine</hi> and in other official publications “Reverend,” a fact which may
                    seem trivial, but which in reality was of important significance.</p>
                <p>In 1834, after the idea had been long entertained and the project had been
                    repeatedly discussed, it was determined to establish a theological institution
                    for the training of ministerial candidates. There are now four colleges, with
                    two hundred and fifty students. In 1836 the practice of ordination by imposition
                    of hands was adopted.</p>
                <p>Such advances, however, as these in the general organization and development of
                    the Connexion, and especially in the status and professional training of the
                    ministers, could not be made in such a body without offence being given to some,
                    whose tendencies were to disallow any official distinction between the ministry
                    and the laity, and who also objected to the use of the organ. ~ This levelling
                    element was strong in the West Riding of Yorkshire, and in 1828, on the placing
                    of an organ in Brunswick Chapel, Leeds, by the trustees, with the consent of the
                    Conference, a violent agitation broke out. The consequence was a disruption, the
                    first since 1798, under the title “Protestant Methodists.” But this was
                    absorbed, some years later, in a more considerable secession.</p>
                <p>In fact, the Connexion was in 1828 entering on a period of agitation. The current
                    of political affairs was approaching the rapids of which the Reform Act marked
                    the centre and the point of maximum movement. A body like Wesleyan Methodism
                    could not but feel in great force the sweep of this movement. It is true that
                    Wesleyan Methodism as such has never been political, that few of its numbers
                    cultivated extreme politics, and that the ministers and the better classes of
                    the “Society” were strongly Conservative in their general tone. Nevertheless the
                    mass of the community shared in the general movement of the times, and the
                    Conservative tone of the ministers and of most of the well-to-do laity was not
                    in full harmony with the sympathies of the people generally. Accordingly the
                    elements of disturbance, which only partially exploded in the “Protestant
                    Methodist” secession, continued to make themselves felt, in different parts of
                    the Connexion, during the following years of political controversy. The decision
                    of the Conference in 1834 to provide a college for the training of ministerial
                    candidates gave special offence to the malcontents. Such an occasion was all
                    that was wanting for the various discontents of the Connexion to gather to a
                    head. The demands made by the agitators proceeded on a basis of democratic
                    ecclesiasticism such as it is very difficult to apply successfully to a system
                    of associated churches. The result was a third secession, based on the same
                    general ground of ecclesiastical principles as the two preceding, which was
                    organized in 1836, and with which the “Protestant Methodists” eventually
                    coalesced. This new secession was known first as the “Wesleyan Methodist
                    Association”; but for a number of years past it has been merged in a still
                    larger body of seceders designated “The Methodist Free Churches.” Its leader at
                    the first was the Rev. Dr Warren, who left it, however, not many months after it
                    was formed, and took orders in the Church of England.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The controversies of 1835-36 left their mark on the legislation and official
                    documents of the Connexion. The principles of 1797 remained intact, some farther
                    guards only being added to prevent any danger of hasty or irresponsible action
                    on the part of superintendents, and at the same time “minor district meetings”
                    being organized in order to facilitate appeals. One error was, however,
                    committed by the Conference. In 1797 no provision had been made for bringing the
                    circuit, through its quarterly meeting, into direct relations with the
                    Conference. In 1836 a right of direct memorial to the Conference was given to
                    the circuit quarterly meeting; but it was so fenced round with conditions and
                    limitations as to make it practically inoperative, and at the same time
                    provocative of suspicion and irritation.</p>
                <p>The effect of the secession of 1836 on the general progress of the Connexion was
                    not great. The number of members reported in 1835 in Great Britain and Ireland
                    was 371,251 (there being a decrease in England of 951), in 1836 381,369, in 1837
                    384,723. For the next ten years the advance of the Connexion in numbers and in
                    general prosperity was apparently unprecedented. The Centenary Fund of 1839-40
                    amounted to £221,000. In the midst, however, of all the outward prosperity of
                    Methodism—partly perhaps in consequence of it—very perilous elements were at
                    work. The revolutionary ideas of the Chartist period (1840-48) and of
                    Continental politics (1848-49) reacted on Wesleyan Methodism as the political
                    ideas of 1791 and of 1831 had done at those epochs. The embers of old
                    controversies—ecclesiastical, quasi-political, and personal— still smouldered,
                    and at length burst into fresh flame. From 1844 a strong spirit of opposition to
                    the leaders of the Connexion, and especially to Dr Bunting, was fanned by the
                    circulation of anonymous “fly leaves” of a very scurrilous character. At the
                    same time the policy of the Conference and of the ministers in their circuits
                    had proceeded more than was wise on the old lines. The general administration
                    relied too much on the footing of implicit confidence on the part of the people
                    and on the power of official prerogative in the hands of tfie minister. The
                    memorial law of 1836 was indicative of the too exclusive spirit of pastoral
                    government which had prevailed. The wisdom of Dr Bunting had for five and twenty
                    years led the way in gradually liberalizing both the polity and the policy of
                    Methodism, and adapting them to the changing conditions of the times. But this
                    wisdom seems to have found its limits before 1849, when the internal dissensions
                    reached their climax. In that year James Everett, the chief author of the fly
                    sheets, and two other ministers, Samuel Dunn and/William Griffith, who had
                    identified themselves with him, were expelled. A disastrous agitation followed.
                    No distinct secession took place till after the Conference of 1850. The union of
                    the “Methodist Free Churches,” in which was incorporated the “Wesleyan
                    Association” (of 1836), was formed by the seceders. The “New Connexion” also
                    received some thousands of the seceders into its ranks. But by far the greatest
                    part of those who left went with neither of these bodies.</p>
                <p>Between 1850 and 1855 the Connexion in Great Britain and Ireland lost 100,000
                    members, and not till 1856 did it begin to recover. In that year the numbers
                    were returned as 282,787, showing a small increase over the preceding year.
                    Since then peace and ιmity have prevailed unbroken.</p>
                <p>The convulsion of 1849-52 taught the Connexion, and in particular the Conference,
                    lessons of the highest importance. In 1852 the quarterly meeting was so defined
                    as to make it the great representative meeting of the circuit, including
                    stewards, leaders, local preachers, and trustees. The right of memorial to the
                    Conference was given to it in the widest and freest sense. These powerful bodies
                    invite ministers to the circuits, or decline so to do, determine and pay their
                    “allowances,” as salaries to ministers are still called in the Connexion, and
                    review all the interests of the circuits, spiritual or financial. They had also
                    conferred upon them in 1852 the right to appoint a circuit jury of appeal from
                    the verdict and findings of a leaders’ meeting in certain cases of discipline.
                    Since 1852 Conference legislation has still proceeded in the direction of
                    recognizing and enlarging the functions and rights of the laity. The committee
                    of review system, already spoken of, had been considerably developed between
                    1835 and 1849, and included every department of ordinary administration. In
                    1861, however, whilst a representation of the departmental executive committees
                    formed still the leading element in each committee of review, a great
                    improvement was made in their constitution by giving to each of the districts of
                    British Methodism the right to send a lay representative <pb break="no"

                    committees. In 1877 and 1878 the final and natural consummation of the whole
                    course of advance since 1791 was effected in the constitution of the united
                    Conference of ministers and lay representatives. The ministers meet by
                    themselves to discharge the functions which belong to them as the common
                    pastorate of the Connexion. As to all the points involved in their specific
                    character and common responsibility, as the mutually exchanging and itinerating
                    pastors in common of a vast common flock, they take mutual counsel in a separate
                    assembly. The Conference, in its ministerial-and-lay or representative session,
                    meets after the pastoral business is completed, and occupies a full week between
                    Sundays in discussing and settling the business of all the funds and the general
                    administrative departments of the body. The Conference in its pastoral session
                    assembles on the last Tuesday in July, that session closing on the Friday or
                    Saturday week following; the representative session occupies the following week.
                    It is legally necessary that the decisions of the Conference in both its
                    sessions should be confirmed and validated by the vote of the “legal hundred.”
                    This confirmation is, however, given as a matter of course.</p>
                <p>The Conference in its pastoral session is not formally representative. To each
                    district is assigned by the preceding Conference a certain amount of
                    representation, there being at present thirty-five districts. The numbers
                    allocated to the districts vary according to circumstances. The total number of
                    ministers and laymen com posing the Conference in its representative session is
                    480, or 240 ministers and 240 laymen. The basis of the lay representation in the
                    Conference is the constituency of lay officials in the district committees. The
                    Connexion at large is represented by the lay officials of the general
                    Connexional departments. The business transacted in the Conference during its
                    representative session relates to all the Connexional departments of general
                    administration, viz., the committee of privileges, foreign missions, the
                    maintenance and education fund (and the schools) for ministers’ children, chapel
                    affairs (general, metropolitan, and provincial), the home mission and contingent
                    fund, district sustentation funds, army and navy evangelization, lay mission
                    work, the worn-out ministers’ and ministers’ widows’ fund, the theological
                    institution with its four colleges, Sunday and day schools and the children’s
                    home and orphanage, higher education, the extension fund of Methodism,
                    alterations and divisions of circuits and districts, and the Lord’s Day
                    observance and temperance questions.</p>
                <p>The president of the Conference is chosen by the ministers by ballot on the
                    opening of the pastoral session. After the election of president follows that of
                    secretary. These elections, however, cannot take place until the vacancies in
                    the hundred have been filled up. Such vacancies are caused by death, by absence
                    for two years together without a dispensation, by expulsion, or by
                    superannuation, which takes place ordinarily after two years’ retirement from
                    the full work of the ministry.</p>

                    Conference Deed Poll, made valid by the concurrence with them of a delegate from
                    the British Conference, who is to the Irish Conference what the legal Conference
                    is to the British Conference. Ten ministers of the Irish Conference are members
                    of the “legal hundred” of the British Conference. The ‘ ‘ plan of pacification”
                    of 1795 was not carried out at the time by the Irish Conference. In the year
                    1816, however, it was adopted in Ireland. The result was a secession which
                    assumed the designation “Primitive Wesleyans,” a very different body from the
                    Primitive Methodists of England. In 1878 the Primitive Wesleyans were reunited
                    to the parent Connexion. The number of members in Ireland has, owing to

                    to a considerable extent on pecuniary aid fur nished by the Wesleyan Missionary

                    Australasian Conference has been independent. The General Conference meets once
                    in three years, having under it our annual Conferences—one for New South Wales
                    and Queensland, another for Victoria and Tasmania, a third for South Australia,
                    and a fourth for New Zealand. These Conferences—the general and the annual— are
                    all mixed and representative after the same general pattern as the British
                    Conference. They have also under their charge, and as part of their Connexion,
                    the Wesleyan missions in Tonga and Fiji, which were begun by the parent body
                    before the original affiliated yearly Conference for Australasia was organized.
                    The numbers in 1881 were for the Methodism of Australia 28,310 members with 362
                    ministers, and for the South Sea missions 33,411 members with 16 missionaries of
                    European blood and a very large number of native ministers and assistant

                    is mixed and representative; the annual Conferences are purely ministerial.
                    Canadian Methodism occupies a powerful position in the Dominion. It numbers as

                    system of evangelical Arminianism. In particular, Wesleyan divines insist on the
                    doctrines of original sin, general redemption, repentance, justification by
                    faith, the witness of the Spirit, and Christian perfection,—or, as it has been
                    customary for Methodists to say, the doctrines of a “present, free, and full
                    salvation.” By the witness of the Spirit is meant a consciousness of the Divine
                    favour through the atonement of Jesus Christ. Wesleyans have often been
                    represented as holding the Calvinistic doctrine of “assurance.” The word,
                    however, is not a Wesleyan phrase, and assurance, so far as it may be said to be
                    taught by Methodists, signifies, not any certainty of final salvation, but
                    merely a “sense of sin forgiven.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>II. American Episcopal Methodism.</p>
                <p>The beginnings of American Methodism are traceable to the year 1766, when a few
                    pious emigrants from Ireland introduced Methodism into New York. On receiving an
                    appeal in 1768 from the New York Methodists, who were engaged in building a
                    preaching-house, Wesley laid the case of America before the Conference at Leeds
                    in 1769, and two preachers, Boardman and Pilmoor, volunteered to go to the
                    colonies. Boardman went to New York, Pilmoor to Philadelphia. In 1771 two other
                    Methodist itinerants, Francis Asbury—the most famous name in American
                    Methodism—and Richard Wright, went out to America. In 1773 Thomas Rankin, a
                    preacher of experience sent out <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0201-0192"/> by Wesley, held the first Conference in
                    Philadelphia, when there were 10 itinerant preachers and 1160 members. After the
                    breaking out of the War of Independence the English Methodist preachers were
                    unpopular, and all but Francis Asbury went back to England. At the end of the
                    war, however, in 1784, Wesley sent out Dr Coke, and American Methodism was
                    organized as an independent church, with Dr Coke and Francis Asbury as its
                    presbyterbishops. The history of American Methodism since that period is too
                    vast and complicated for any attempt to be made to summarize it here. Methodism
                    is more properly national in its character as an American church than any church
                    in the States. In Massachusetts and some other of the New England States it is
                    less powerful than Congregationalism, which still retains there much of its
                    ancient predominance; in the city of New York it is less powerful than
                    Presbyterianism, and, indeed, occupies a position less generally influential
                    than might have been expected. But in Philadelphia it is very powerful; so also
                    in Baltimore and in Cincinnati; if not strong in New York city, it is very
                    strong in the State; and generally throughout the western and mid-western States
                    it is the prevalent form of faith and worship. In the south, also, it is more
                    powerful than any other church.</p>
                <p>American Methodism is Episcopal. But its Episcopacy is neither prelatical nor
                    diocesan. The bishops are superintending presbyters, and they visit the whole
                    territory of Methodism in rotation, holding (presiding over) the annual
                    Conferences. These Conferences are purely ministerial. But the General
                    Conference, which meets once in four years, and which is the Conference of
                    legislation and final appeal, is mixed and representative. The first General
                    Conference was held in 1792, the first delegated or representative Conference in
                    1812, the first mixed or ministerial-and-lay General Conference in 1872. There
                    were till lately no district assemblies in the Episcopal Methodism of America,
                    and now there are but few. The bishops maintain the unity of the Connexion in
                    the interval between the General Conferences, by their visitation and by their
                    conjoint council. A sub-episcopal class of ministers also, called presiding
                    elders, supplement the action and superintendency of the bishops. These preside
                    over districts, holding all the circuit quarterly meetings, and holding the
                    district meetings, if any such meetings have been organized.</p>
                <p>American Episcopal Methodism is distributed into five distinct sections or
                    churches, which, however, differ from each other in no points of any importance
                    as respects organization or discipline, still less doctrine. The American
                    Methodist Episcopal Church South became a separate organization in 1847 by
                    reason of the slavery controversy. The coloured churches, of which there are
                    three, sprang up distinctly from local causes. The following are the latest
                    available statistics:—</p>

                <p>In the Methodist Episcopal Church alone there are one hundred annual Conferences,
                    visited by twelve bishops. This church has more than twenty universities, of
                    which some are distinguished schools of learning. Boston University is one of
                    the most recent and one of the chief. The principal foreign missions are in
                    India, China, and Japan. The Methodist Church South also has some influential
                    universities, particularly that at Nashville, and has missions, in particular in
                    Japan and China.</p>
                <p>Besides these Methodist Episcopal churches, with their total of 3,358,000 church
                    members, there are two other churches which do not assume the name at all, but
                    are yet essentially Methodist in doctrine and discipline, not varying in any
                    important particulars from the Episcopal Methodism of America. Of these one is
                    called the United Brethren, with 157,000 members, the other the Evangelical
                    Association, with 113,000 members.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    English Methodist secessions. The only considerable body, however, is the
                    Methodist Protestant Church, with 125,000 members. The minor bodies, four in

                    class-meetings and love-feasts, have leaders’ meetings and quarterly meetings,

                    original form must be identified with the Wesleyan Methodist Association of
                    1836. That body first absorbed into itself, in great part, the “Protestant
                    Methodists” of 1828. It was afterwards greatly increased, and its organization
                    in some points modified, when a large number of the seceders from the parent
                    Connexion in 1850-52 joined its ranks. The main body of its Conference does not
                    consist, like that of the New Connexion, of an equal number of circuit ministers
                    and elected circuit lay delegates, but of circuit delegates, whether ministerial
                    or lay, elected without any respect to office, ministerial or other. Its
                    circuits also are independent of the control of the Conference. The Connexional
                    bond, accordingly, in this denomination is weak, and the itinerancy is not
                    universal or uniform in its rules or its operation. The amalgamation between the
                    Wesleyan Methodist Association and the “Wesleyan Methodist Reformers” of 1850
                    took place in 1857. At that time the combined churches numbered 41,000. At
                    present (1881-82) they number 72,839, including 7772 members on the mission
                    stations, besides 7824 on trial. The number of ministers is 392, with 40 retired
                    or ’ ‘ supernumerary” ministers. The number of Sunday scholars is 190,957.<note

                    and hard-working denomination the ministers, of whom some are women, are very
                    literally “the servants of all.” The Conference is composed, in addition to
                    twelve permanent members, of four members appointed by the preceding Conference,
                    and of delegates from district’meetings. The principle of proportion is that
                    there should be two laymen to one minister or “travelling preacher,” and the
                    “travelling preachers” have no pastoral prerogative whatever. The Conference is
                    supreme, and the Connexional bond is strong. This body was founded by Hugh
                    Bourne and William Clowes, local preachers who were separated from the Wesleyan
                    Connexion, the former in 1808, the latter in 1810, because of their violation of
                    Conference regulations as to camp meetings and other questions of order. The
                    Conference had, in 1807, pronounced its judgment against camp meetings, which
                    had been introduced into the country from America, whereas Bourne and Clowes
                    were determined to hold such meetings. Founded thus by zealous and “irregular”
                    lay preachers, “Primitive” Methodism, as the resulting new body called itself,
                    bears still in its organization, its spirit, and its customs strong traces of
                    its origin. It has been a very successful body, aiming simply at doing
                    evangelistic work, and is now numerous and powerful, numbering among its
                    ministers, not only many useful preachers, but some of marked originality and
                    power and also of superior cultivation. There has for many years past, if not
                    from the beginning, been a very friendly feeling between the old Wesleyan
                    Connexion and the Primitive Methodists. Its latest statistics (1881-2) show 1149
                    travelling preachers, 185,312 members, and 383,350 Sunday scholars<note

                    the “Primitives” in their character and spirit. Their founder was a Cornish
                    local preacher called O’Bryan. Hence the Connexion is often known as the
                    Bryanites, and Cornish emigrants have propagated this denomination widely in the

                    their respective district meetings to attend. In general it may be said that the

                    held in City Road Chapel, London, in September 1881. Representatives were
                    present from all the Methodist bodies throughout the world, and it was estimated
                    that these represented not less than 5,000,000 of members and 20,000,000 of
                    population. Whilst in church organization these bodies differed, as has been
                    shown above, in doctrine and in respect of their purely spiritual discipline and
                    means of grace, they were all agreed in principal matters. The Conference was
                    entirely practical in character. The object was to promote zeal and union among
                    the constituent bodies as to all practical points of Christian sympathy and
                    activity, at home and abroad, and especially as to home mission work, general
                    philanthropy, Christian education, and a Christian use of the press. There were
                    400 representatives present from the Methodist bodies in all parts of the
                    world.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi

                    Methodists.—</hi> Between the Methodism of Wales and that of England there was
                    never any other than incidental connexion. Indeed, although the name of the
                    Welsh movement was borrowed from the English, not only was Welsh Methodism quite
                    independent in its origin, but in reality its beginning, as an evangelical
                    movement, was earlier than that of English Methodism. From Wesleyan Methodism,
                    furthermore, Welsh Methodism was throughout distinguished by the fact that it
                    was Calvinistic in its doctrine. For some years Whitefield’s name was placed by
                    the leaders of Welsh Methodism at the head of their movement, but the connexion
                    was not at any time much more than nominal, Whitefield being, indeed, too often
                    and too long together in America to exercise any real presidency over the
                    Methodism of the Principality.</p>
                <p>Distinction, however, must be made between Welsh Methodism as an evangelistic
                    movement and as an organization. In its later and distinctly organized form, its
                    main elements date from 1811, while the actual unity and the final consolidation
                    of the organization date from so recent a period as 1864. At that date we find
                    the Calvinistic Methodism of North and of South Wales for the first time united
                    in a common organization and government, and brought under the supreme control
                    of one “General Assembly.”</p>
                <p>The spiritual awakening from which Welsh Calvinistic Methodism derived its
                    earliest inspiration and impulse began in 1735 and 1736, almost
                    contemporaneously and quite independently, in three different counties of South
                    Wales. Howell Harris, a gentleman of some position, born and bred at Trevecca in
                    the parish of Talgarth, county of Brecon, is the most prominent name connected
                    with early Welsh Methodism. His first strong religious convictions and impulses
                    date from 1735. He was sent to Oxford in the autumn of that year to “cure him of
                    his fanaticism,” but remained only one term. On his return to Wales he began to
                    exhort and preach in private houses and in such buildings as he could obtain the
                    use of, being then and throughout his life a simple layman. Of learning or
                    theology he had but little; but he was an extemporary preacher of prodigious
                    vehemence, and often of overwhelming power and pathos. While Harris was thus
                    preaching in the county of Brecon, Daniel Rowlands had been spiritually awakened
                    at Llangeitho in Cardiganshire, the two men knowing nothing whatever of each
                    other. Rowlands was an ordained clergyman, of some learning and of great
                    eloquence. He was a pulpit orator, and carefully prepared his powerful
                    discourses. In Pembrokeshire, again, in that same year 1735-36, Howell Davies
                    began to preach the same doctrine in the same spirit as the other two preachers,
                    and with effects scarcely, if at all, less remarkable. The work thus begun in
                    three distinct centres within the space of one year was in strict connexion with
                    the Established Church, and so continued to be throughout the last century.
                    These single-minded preachers pursued their work in Wales knowing nothing of the
                    parallel work which Whitefield had just begun in England. In 1738, however,
                    Whitefield, in the west of England, heard of Howell Harris, and in that year the
                    two revivalists met in Cardiff. In 1739 Howell Harris had begun to extend his
                    preaching tours far and wide, visiting not only South but North Wales, and,
                    wherever he went, founding religious societies in connexion with the Church of
                    England, of a character resembling those called Dr Woodward’s societies, which
                    had long been in existence throughout England, the chief difference being that
                    the Welsh societies were “evangelical,” Calvinistic, and revivalist. It was in
                    the same year tnat Wesley founded his society in England. In 1742 the clergymen
                    connected with the Welsh movement were ten in number, and there were labouring
                    in concert with these forty lay “exhorters,” as they were called. In that year
                    the first “association” of Welsh Calvinistic Methodists was held at Waterford or
                    Watford, in Glamorganshire. Whitefield consented to preside, and joined his
                    preaching to that of the Welsh evangelists. The first Calvinistic Methodist
                    Conference was held at Waterford, under Whitefield’s presidency, on January 5,
                    1743, eighteen months earlier than Wesley’s first Conference. For a short time
                    the Calvinistic Methodism of Wales was linked to that of England. After 1748,
                    however, Whitefield ceased to act as in any sense the official head of the
                    Calvinistic Methodists of England, and their organization, always loose, was
                    gradually dissolved.</p>
                <p>There was no Wesley in Welsh Methodism, and accordingly there was no organic
                    unity among the societies of earlier Welsh Methodism. Each local society was
                    under the care of an “exhorter,” an unpaid layman. A number of these local
                    societies were grouped together into a district, over which an “overseer” had
                    charge. He also was usually an unpaid layman, although exercising many of the
                    functions of a spiritual pastor. Sometimes, however, as in the case of Rowlands,
                    he was a parish clergyman. The societies attended their parish churches and
                    there received the sacraments. The meeting-or preaching-houses for the societies
                    were vaguely called “houses for religious purposes.”</p>
                <p>In 1751 Howell Harris ceased to itinerate and retired to Trevecca. From this time
                    his leadership in the Methodist movement seems to have come to an end, and the
                    movement languished for many years after. Not till 1762 is any “revival”
                    chronicled. In 1763 Rowlands was obliged to quit his curacy at Llangeitho and
                    leave the Established Church. His people built him a chapel. He thus, after
                    1763, became a Dissenting minister; and, retaining his fame and much of his
                    power to the end of his course, he died in 1790.</p>
                <p>Fifty years had now passed since the first societies of Welsh Methodism had been
                    established by Howell Harris, and the movement, instead of having grown to
                    strength and maturity, appeared to have spent its force, almost in all
                    directions, at least so far as any outward signs could show. But the Rev. Thomas
                    Charles of Bala was to be one of the chief means of reviving it. He, like the
                    earlier Methodists, was a churchman; he had taken his degree at Oxford and
                    served a curacy in Somersetshire. The doors of the Established Church having
                    been closed against him because of his style of preaching, he joined the Welsh
                    Methodists in 1785, and his first sphere of marked influence was in North Wales.
                    In 1791 he took a leading part in a great revival of which Bala yvas the centre.
                    From this period may be dated the second spring of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism,
                    from which its later successes were to grow. Charles zealously and successfully
                    promoted the establishment of “circulating schools” and of Sabbath schools. He
                    was, in fact, the soul of the great Christian educating movement in Wales which
                    began in the last decade of the 18th century; and it was through his earnest
                    zeal in seeking to provide Bibles for his W elsh schools, especially the Sunday
                    schools, that the British and Foreign Bible Society was established. Though
                    Methodism came then to be effectually rooted in the soil of the Principality, it
                    was not till 1811 that the Welsh Calvinists took that sten in the direction of
                    ecclesiastical independence which the English Wesleyans had taken sixteen years
                    before by calling their preachers to the official position of pastors and
                    ordaining them to administer the sacraments.</p>
                <p>From 1790 till almost the present time the work of gradually moulding the
                    constitution of Welsh Calvinistic Methodism has proceeded. The “rules regarding
                    the proper mode of conducting the quarterly association” were drawn up by
                    Charles and agreed upon in 1790. In 1801 the <hi rend="italic">Order and Form of
                    Church Government and Rules of Discipline</hi> were published. In 1811, as has
                    been shown, ministerial ordination was initiated. In 1823 the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Confession of Faith</hi> was promulgated. And in 1864, as has been already
                    mentioned, the first “General Assembly” was held, and the two associations of
                    North and South Wales respectively were united into one body. The constitution
                    is now a modified Presbyterianism, each church managing its own affairs subject
                    to successive appeal to the monthly meeting of the county and the quarterly
                    association of the province, while the latter body may refer the decision to the
                    annual General Assembly.</p>
                <p>The Welsh Methodists (or Welsh Presbyterians, as they are now often called) have
                    two theological colleges, one at Bala and the other at Trevecca. They have also
                    a foreign missionary society, with missions in Brittany, among their congeners
                    of the Celtic race, and in Bengal.</p>
                <p>In recent years this church has made great progress. In 1850 the number of
                    members was 58,678, in 1870 it was 92,735, and in 1880 the returns showed 1174
                    churches, 118,979 communicants, 185,635 Sunday scholars. The number of ministers
                    is not officially given, but is estimated at 600. The North and South Wales
                    associations are now also known as synods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
