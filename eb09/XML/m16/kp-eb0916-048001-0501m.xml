                    country is manufactured, and whence it is issued by sovereign authority, under
                    special conditions and regulations. The privilege of coining has in all ages and
                    countries belonged to the sovereign, and has, in England at least, been rarely
                    delegated to any subject, and in any case in a restricted form, the crown always
                    reserving the right of determining the standard, denomination, and design of the
                    coins.</p>
                <p>At a very early stage of civilization it was found necessary to have some
                    definite medium of exchange, in order to avoid the great inconvenience arising
                    from the system of payment in kind, which was the primitive and natural method.
                    It was not long before metal came to be used as such a medium, probably from its
                    durability and portability, and in the case of gold and silver on account of
                    their intrinsic value. The less liable the value of a metal is to change the
                    better is it suited for a standard of value.</p>
                <p>Though historians assure us that metals were found in Britain at a very early
                    period, there does not appear to be any evidence that the mines were worked
                    until considerably later than the time at which the use of metal as a medium of
                    exchange was introduced. It is probable therefore that the metals for exchange
                    were imported into Britain long before the native mines were developed.</p>
                <p>The metals chiefly used were silver and brass, which were at first simply
                    exchanged by weight for commodities of all kinds. As commercial transactions
                    became more numerous and more complicated, this system of payment grew
                    troublesome, and it was found convenient to divide the mass of metal into small
                    parts, which soon took the form of rough coins. But the principle of payment by
                    weight was retained through many centuries, and is perpetuated, though in name
                    only, in the word “pound.”</p>
                <p>Records of attempts to organize the coinage of England are found as far back as
                    the Anglo-Saxon period, and it is known that on the dissolution of the Heptarchy
                    the mints were regulated by laws framed in the witenagemot. The first monarch
                    who appears to have dealt successfully with the organization of the coinage was
                    Athelstan, who framed laws for the regulation of the mints, and appointed
                    officers whose titles and duties are then first recorded. The only officers
                    connected with the coinage of whom mention is found before this time are the
                    “moneyers,” who appear to have been alone responsible for the manufacture of the
                    coin; but it is probable that even then there existed some officer who had
                    authority over them. In early Saxon and Norman times the number of moneyers was
                    considerable, mints being established in almost every important town, as might
                    be expected at a period when communication between distant places was extremely
                    difficult. They appear to have been the officers who actually performed the work
                    of making the coin, the mint master in later times contracting with them, at a
                    high rate, for the work. They were responsible for the purity and perfection of
                    the coins produced, as appears from the fact that it was they who were punished
                    (as traitors) in the case of any deficiency in weight or fineness. They had
                    prescriptive rights in the coinage, and in modern times (even so lateas 1850)
                    claimed to have corporate privileges; but it is clear, on the authority of
                    Ruding, that they never were a “corporation” separate from other officers of the
                    mint. <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> The number of mints was greatly reduced
                    after the Norman Conquest, but continued to be considerable until the reign of
                    Richard I., when the work of coining for the whole kingdom was concentrated in
                    the mint in the Tower of London. Only one provincial mint (Winchester) remained
                    till a later date.</p>
                <p>An important reorganization of the coinage took place in 1325 under Edward II.,
                    the regulations then framed for the manufacture and issue of the coins forming
                    the basis of those still in force. The principal officers under these
                    regulations were—master, warden, comptroller, king’s assay master, king’s
                    clerks, and cuneator. The office of cuneator was one of great importance at a
                    time when there existed a multiplicity of mints, since he had the sole charge of
                    all the dies used not only at the mint in the Tower of London but also in the
                    provinces. He chose the engravers and presented them to the barons of the
                    exchequer in order that they might take the oath of fidelity; he superintended
                    their work, and was generally answerable for the perfection of the dies before
                    they were issued for use in the various mints of the country. The office, which
                    was hereditary, ceased to exist when the provincial mints were suppressed. In
                    its place was instituted the office of clerk of the irons, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Among the special privileges which they undoubtedly
                    enjoyed was exemption from local taxation, as appears in a writ of Henry III.,
                    which commands the mayor of London not to disturb them “by exacting tallages
                    contrary to their privileges.” Sometimes also houses were allowed to them rent
                    free.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n502/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0502-0481"/>
                <p>whose functions were more limited, and were not hereditary. This office was only
                    recently abolished.</p>
                <p>In the Middle Ages an important duty devolving on the officers of the mint was
                    the collection of the seigniorage which was levied on the coining of money, not
                    only for the purpose of covering the expenses of minting, but also as a source
                    of revenue to the crown which the sovereign claimed by virtue of his
                    prerogative. In former times the collection of the seigniorage was entrusted to
                    the warden, who also superintended the manufacture of the coins, so far as to
                    ensure the proper relations between the moneyers on the one hand and the state
                    on the other. He does not appear, however, to have had any responsibility with
                    regard to the fineness and weight of the coins.</p>
                <p>The king’s assay master was specially charged with all matters relating to the
                    accuracy of the standard. The officer next in rank to him was the comptroller,
                    who presented annually to the barons of the exchequer a report of all the gold
                    and silver money struck in the kingdom during the year. These reports, which
                    were always written upon parchment, constitute the chief mint records. The
                    king’s clerk exercised a general superintendence and kept an account of all the
                    mint transactions. As the work of the mint became more extensive and more
                    complicated, other officers were added such as the surveyor of the meltings,
                    surveyor of the money presses, and many others.</p>
                <p>The present arrangements with regard to the officers of the mint were made in
                    1870, when several important changes took place in the mint establishment. Up to
                    that time there had been two controlling officers,—the master, who in some
                    instances was selected on account of distinguished scientific attainments (as in
                    the cases of Sir John Herschel and Professor Graham), and the deputy master and
                    comptroller. A careful inquiry, however, having led to the conclusion that the
                    control of the mint might with advantage be concentrated in the hands of a
                    single officer of experience in the conduct of public business, it was decided,
                    on the death of Professor Graham, to entrust the actual administration of the
                    department to the deputy master,—the office and title of master of the mint
                    being held by the chancellor of the exchequer for the time being, without
                    salary. At the same time the services of a scientific officer were secured, by
                    the appointment of a chemist of the mint. The coining and die department and the
                    melting department were united under the name of the operative department, and
                    placed under a single superintendent. The first deputy master appointed under
                    the new regulations was the Hon. C. W. Fremantle, C.B., to whom the public are
                    indebted for a series of <hi rend="italic">Annual Reports</hi> which have given
                    a new and increased interest to the subject of the coinage, and may be said to
                    constitute in themselves a mint literature.</p>
                <p>The actual operations of coining in early times were few in number and simple in
                    character. The metals forming the alloy were melted together in the proportion
                    necessary to bring them to the required standard, and the alloy thus obtained
                    was cast into bars, which were reduced by hammering to the requisite thickness.
                    They were then cut with shears into pieces more or less regular in size and
                    form, roughly annealed, and finally impressed with the prescribed device by a
                    blow with a hammer.</p>
                <p>The last-named appears to have been the only part of the process which was
                    performed with any great amount of care. The blank piece was placed by the hand
                    upon a die fixed into a block of wood having a large heavy base to resist the
                    oscillation caused by the blow; the die on which was engraved the device for the
                    reverse of the coin was then placed upon the upper side of the blank and held by
                    means of a holder, round which was placed a roll of lead to protect the hand of
                    the operator while heavy blows were struck with a hammer by an assistant
                    workman. One of the earliest improvements in coining was the introduction of a
                    tool in shape resembling a pair of tongs, the two dies being placed one at the
                    extremity of each leg. This avoided the necessity of readjusting the dies
                    between successive strokes of the hammer, and ensured greater accuracy in the
                    impression. It was long before the system of coining by hand was superseded by
                    the coining press, or mill, which, even after its first introduction, was only
                    very slowly adopted. Several attempts were made to introduce machinery for
                    coining before it was brought into active use, the objection to it being its
                    great expense. The mill and screw were finally introduced into the mint under
                    Charles II., when many improvements were also made in the preliminary
                    operations. Steam-power was first applied in 1810, when the vacuum screw-press
                    was introduced. In 1839 Uhlhorn invented the lever-press, which still remains in
                    use.</p>
                <p>The subject of the design on coins, besides being interesting both from an
                    artistic and an historical point of view, becomes very important when it is
                    remembered that it is the impression of the coin with the authorized device
                    which makes it legally current. The artistic merits of the design of the early
                    Greek coins are well known, and prove that the dies from which the coins were
                    struck must have been engraved with much skill and care. The form of the coins
                    before being stamped was at first merely that of natural rounded nuggets of
                    gold, or of the silver-gold alloy known as <hi rend="italic">electrum.</hi> Such
                    coined nuggets of gold are still to be found among the hill tribes of India.
                    Simple nuggets were afterwards replaced by roughly-fashioned masses like half
                    bullets, a form which rendered it easy to impart high relief to the obverse and
                    comparatively low relief to the reverse of the coins. The early British
                    coins<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Evans, <hi
                    rend="italic">Coins of the Ancient Britons.</hi></p></note> had for their
                    prototype the gold “stater” of Philip of Macedon, but the design of this
                    beautifully finished coin was so roughly imitated by a succession of British
                    copyists that ultimately the wreath round the head of the monarch alone
                    survived, and that in a scarcely recognizable form. It is not only in the early
                    British coins that the influence of classical art may be seen, for it is very
                    evident in some of the present day, the most notable instances being the reverse
                    of the bronze coinage, and the beautiful design of St George and the dragon by
                    Pistrucci, which is still used as an alternative design for the sovereign. It
                    has been ascertained that the impressions on the reverse of very early Greek
                    coins were produced by the rough surface of the anvil or the nail head on which
                    they were placed, while the obverse was struck with the die. A little later the
                    device on the reverse of the coins was obtained by placing the blank piece on
                    small points of metal arranged in geometrical forms which caused corresponding
                    indentations on the coins when struck with the hammer. The beauty and accuracy
                    of design on coins gradually increased as art and manual skill developed, and
                    probably culminated at the period of the Renaissance.</p>
                <p>Although it has been the custom since the time of the Saxons to stamp coins with
                    the head of the reigning monarch, it does not appear that any attempt at actual
                    portraiture was made in England until the reign of Henry VII., who, “about the
                    eighteenth or nineteenth year of his reign, did make a great alteration in the
                    form of his coin, upon which his head was now represented in profile, and with a
                    good resemblance of his other pictures.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>See Martin Folkes, <hi rend="italic">Tables of English
                    Silver and Gold Corns.</hi></p></note> Since then much care seems to have been
                    taken to stamp the coins with a true likeness of the monarch. In most cases the
                    heads bear a striking resemblance to the portraits drawn by the great artists of
                    the respective periods, and were, indeed, generally designed by artists of
                    eminence. Some of the Milan coinage of Louis XII. is said to have been <pb

                    is attributed to Benvenuto Cellini.</p>
                <p>In very early times the silver coins were equal in weight and in tale, each penny
                    weighing 24 grains or 1 pennyweight. The amount now denominated a pound was a
                    pound weight of standard or sterling silver. This principle was in fact,
                    however, not strictly adhered to, the coins frequently falling below the
                    standard of weight. This deviation may possibly have arisen from the
                    imperfection of the methods of manufacture, but Ending <hi rend="italic">(Annals
                    of the Coinage)</hi> considers it to have occurred from design, as the
                    deficiency in weight was sometimes made a source of profit. The deviation from
                    the standard weight permitted by law, now called the “remedy,” and anciently
                    called the “shere,” was taken advantage of to a large extent,, so that the coins
                    suffered considerable diminution, particularly when, as frequently happened,
                    they were also “clipped” as soon as they were issued. When these coins were
                    called in they were taken by weight and not by tale, so that the possessors
                    suffered considerable loss. In later times the great improvements in the method
                    of manufacture made it easy to attain far greater accuracy both of weight and
                    fineness; consequently the remedy permitted by law has been considerably
                    reduced, and the possibility of making a large amount of profit by this means
                    proportionally diminished.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Two notable instances are recorded of the use that has been made at various
                    times of the shere, or remedy, as a means of profit, one being in the reign of
                    Queen Elizabeth, when Lonison, then master of the mint, finding the allowance
                    made him under his contract was insufficient to cover the expenses of coining,
                    availed himself of the remedy on the silver coinage, amounting to 6∣d. in the
                    pound troy. The other occurred at the time of the great recoinage of silver in
                    the reign of William III., when the profit of the shere amounted to 3d. per
                    pound weight, or rather more than 8s. in every hundred pounds of
                    money.</p></note></p>
                <p>The seigniorage levied on the coining of money was not a fixed rate, but varied
                    considerably at different times, and accrued from a deduction made from the
                    bullion coined. It was abolished by an Act of Charles II., which provided that
                    whoever brought sterling silver or standard gold to the mint should receive in
                    exchange an equal weight of current coin, the expenses of coining being defrayed
                    by means of duties levied upon certain commodities of common use. The
                    seigniorage on silver was revived in the reign of George III., when that part of
                    the Act of Charles II. which related to the coining of silver without charge was
                    repealed, and another Act was passed, requiring every pound of silver to be
                    coined into sixty-six shillings instead of sixty-two,—the four shillings
                    realized on each pound of silver by this depreciation of its value being handed
                    over to the master of the mint to defray the expenses of assaying, loss, and
                    manufacture. An Act of William IV. required the seigniorage on the silver
                    coinage to be paid to the credit of the Consolidated Fund, and the charges of
                    the mint to be brought annually before parliament. Against the profit derived by
                    the state from this source must be placed the expense of maintaining the silver
                    coinage in a condition fit for circulation by frequently withdrawing, recoining,
                    and reissuing the silver coins. A vote of £15,000 is annually taken in the mint
                    estimates for the loss on the recoinage of silver.</p>
                <p>In former times the work of the mint was performed by contract, the mint master
                    undertaking the manufacture of the coinage at a stated price, and paying the
                    moneyers and other officers and workmen under him at a fixed tariff. The
                    agreement made between the crown and the mint master, called the “master’s
                    indenture,” was sometimes purposely kept secret. This system appears to have
                    prevailed from the reign of Edward I., when an agreement was entered into
                    between the king and the first master of the mint (appointed about 1279). Under
                    this agreement an allowance was secured to the master to cover all the expenses
                    of coinage. Although the master of the mint ceased to be a contractor, the
                    arrangement with the managers continued in force up to 1851.</p>
                <p>The work of coinage was transferred in 1810 from the Tower of London, where it
                    had been carried on for many centuries, to the present Mint on Tower Hill, not
                    far from the Bank of England. The head of the department, as has already been
                    stated, is the chancellor of the exchequer for the time being, who is <hi
                    rend="italic">ex officio</hi> master of the mint,—the practical direction of the
                    work being placed in the hands of a permanent officer, the deputy master, who is
                    responsible for its due performance. From the English mint is supplied the
                    coinage for the whole of the British empire, including the colonies, with the
                    exception of Australia; the latter and the East Indies are supplied from branch
                    mints established at Sydney and Melbourne, and the mints of Calcutta and Bombay.
                    In addition to the gold, silver, and bronze coins current in the United Kingdom,
                    the English mint strikes gold coins of the value of two dollars for
                    Newfoundland; silver coins of the value of fifty, twenty-five, twenty, ten, and
                    five cents respectively for Newfoundland and Canada; bronze pence and halfpence
                    of special design for Jersey, and nickel pence, halfpence, and farthings for the
                    West Indies. The number of coins of each separate denomination issued varies
                    considerably in different years, the demand for special denominations of coin
                    naturally determining the supply.</p>
                <p>The following table (from official sources) shows the value of the gold and
                    silver coins issued during the ten years 1871-81. The total value of the bronze
                    coin issued in the same period is £112,890.</p>

                <p>The British sovereign or twenty-shilling piece was first issued by proclamation
                    dated 1st July 1817, superseding the guinea or twenty-one-shilling piece. Crown
                    pieces of the nominal value of five shillings were first struck in the reign of
                    Henry VIII., sixpences and threepenny-pieces are first mentioned in the reign of
                    Edward VI., while the groat or fourpenny-piece was coined as early as the reign
                    of Edward I.; the florin or two-shilling-piece was introduced in 1849. Copper
                    money was first coined by Charles I. in 1665, but does not appear to have been
                    issued until 1672. Copper was replaced by bronze in 1860.</p>
                <p>The weight and fineness of the various denominations of coin struck at the Royal
                    Mint is shown in the first schedule of the Coinage Act (33 Vict. c. 10), 1870

                <p>The weight and fineness of the coins specified in this schedule are according to
                    what is provided by the Act 56 Geo. TIL c. 68, that the gold coin of the United
                    Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland should hold such weight and fineness as
                    were prescribed in the then existing mint indenture, that is to say, that there
                    should be nine hundred and thirty-four sovereigns and one ten-shilling piece
                    contained in 20 lb weight troy of standard gold, of the fineness, at the trial
                    of the same, of 22 carats fine gold and 2 carats of alloy in the pound weight
                    troy, and further, as regards silver coin, that there should be sixty-six
                    shillings in every pound troy of standard silver of the fineness of 11 ounces 2
                    pennyweights of fine silver and 18 pennyweights of alloy in every pound weight
                    troy.</p>
                <p>The present standard of fineness for gold, 22 parts fine or pure gold and 2 parts
                    of alloyed metal, was finally adopted in the reign of Charles II., and has
                    remained unchanged up to the present time. Before the passing of the Act
                    determining this standard considerable changes had been made from time to time,
                    the highest degree of fineness having been reached in the reign of Henry III.,
                    when the first gold coins were struck of the standard of 24 carats pure gold.
                    The standard of fineness for gold at some different periods may be seen from the
                    following table, which shows the composition of some of the ancient gold trial
                    plates, of which portions are preserved in the Mint :—</p>

                <p>The earliest trial plate of which there is any record was made in the seventeenth
                    year of Edward IV. Before that time it would seem that the coins were compared
                    with others known to be of standard fineness, since among the Cotton MSS. is
                    preserved the account of the trial of the pyx of gold nobles in 1349, when the
                    coins were compared with an ounce of florins of Florence kept in the Treasury as
                    standards. The first gold coins were 24 carats fine or pure gold. Edward III.
                    caused coins to be struck of 23 carats 3⅛ grains fine in 1345, but no trial
                    plate of this standard was made until 1477. Henry VIII. lowered the standard to
                    22 carats, but caused coins to be struck both of that and the former standards.
                    The greatest debasement of the standard ever reached in England was in 1546,
                    when it sunk as low as 20 carats. It reached a low point iu the early part of
                    Edward VI.’s reign, but was raised towards the end of it to 22 carats; and it
                    was still further raised to 23 carats 3⅜ grains by Elizabeth, who, however,
                    caused gold coins of 22 carats also to be struck. Charles II. on his accession
                    rejected the trial plates of the standard of 22 carats which had been made under
                    the Commonwealth, and caused others to be made of the standard of 23 carats 3⅛
                    grains. No coins, however, appear to have been stmck of this standard. The same
                    monarch afterwards fixed the standard at 22 carats; and no variation in the
                    legal standard has occurred since that time. The last new trial plates, made in
                    1873, were alloyed with copper only, in order that they might correspond with
                    the composition of the British gold coins, former plates having been alloyed
                    with silver and copper. At the same time supplementary plates of pure gold and
                    silver were prepared in order that the greatest possible accuracy might be
                    secured.</p>
                <p>The present standard of fineness of silver for coinage was fixed at a very early
                    period, but has been subject to considerable variation since the reign of Edward
                    I., the first English monarch who debased the silver coinage. In the reign of
                    Henry VIII. it was once reduced as low as 4 ounces of silver to 8 of alloying
                    metal, and Edward VI. reduced it even lower. It was restored by Elizabeth to the
                    original standard.</p>

                    plates of which portions have been preserved in the Mint :—</p>

                <p>The alloy used for the bronze coinage is composed of 95 per cent, of copper, 4 of
                    tin, and 1 of zinc. The bronze coinage superseded the old copper coinage in
                    1860, the latter having been in use since the reign of Charles II. The
                    vicissitudes of the copper coinage were even greater than those of the superior
                    coinages, coins for Ireland having been issued at one time of pewter and of
                    other alloys in which scarcely any copper was contained.</p>
                <p>The annual testing of the standard of gold and silver coins, called the trial of
                    the pyx, from the “pyx” or chest in which the coins to be examined are kept, is
                    a ceremony of very ancient institution. It arose from the circumstance that the
                    mint master was originally a contractor, under the crown, for the manufacture of
                    the coinage, and it was therefore necessary that periodical examinations of the
                    coins should be held in order to ascertain that the terms of his contract had
                    been complied with. At the present day, when the mint master is no longer a
                    contractor, but an officer of the crown, the trial of the pyx has a somewhat
                    different object; but it would appear from the description of these periodical
                    examinations in some of the earliest mint records that but little change has
                    taken place in the manner of conducting them. The finished coins are delivered
                    to the mint master in weights called “journey weights,” <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n505/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0505-0484"/> supposed to be the weight of coin which could be
                    manufactured in a day when the operations of coining were performed by the hand.
                    The journey weight of gold is 15 Bb troy, coined into 701 sovereigns or 1402
                    half-sovereigns. The journey weight of silver is 60 Bb troy. From each journey
                    weight a coin is taken and deposited in the “pyx” or chest for the annual trial.
                    This is made by the freemen of the goldsmiths’ company under the direction of
                    the crown in the presence of the queen’s remembrancer, who administers the oath
                    to the jury and presides over the proceedings. The coins selected for trial are
                    compared with pieces cut from trial plates of standard fineness, which are in
                    the keeping of the warden of the standards, these pieces being assayed against
                    the coins under examination. If the coins are found to be of the standard
                    fineness and weight, within certain limits, a verdict to that effect is drawn up
                    by the jurors and presented to the Treasury.</p>
                <p>In consequence of the impossibility of ensuring an absolutely exact admixture of
                    metals in coining, it has been found necessary at all times to allow to the mint
                    master a certain margin, or “remedy,” within which coins may vary in weight and
                    fineness from the fixed standard and still be considered of the current
                    standard. The remedy of fineness for English gold coin is now fixed at 2 parts
                    per 1000. The great importance of maintaining the standard of fineness for gold
                    will be evident when it is stated that the variation of <hi rend="subscript">
                    τ</hi> ⅛ of a millième (or thousandth part) above or below the standard causes a
                    gain or loss of £100 in every million sterling. Gold coins would be within the
                    remedy of fineness permitted by law if the amount of precious metal contained in
                    them varied from 914*6 to 918*6 parts in 1000; and, although this remedy cannot
                    be considered to be more than would meet occasional and unavoidable deviation
                    from the exact standard, still, in the case of gold, but a very small part of
                    the remedy of fineness is actually used, the coins seldom falling below 916*3
                    parts of gold in 1000, or rising above 917*0, while the mean composition of many
                    millions of coins issued from the mint is often of the precise legal standard,
                    916*66. The remedy of fineness for silver coin, which appears to have been
                    always greater than that for gold coin, is 4 parts per 1000. The remedy of
                    weight for gold is Γ6 per 1000 parts, that for silver 4*17, and that for bronze
                    20. Extreme care is taken to prevent the issue from the mint of any coins that
                    exceed these permitted variations in weight and standard, each coin being
                    weighed separately, and all those found to be above or below the standard being
                    returned to the melting-house.</p>
                <p>Since the real value of the gold coinage is the same as its nominal value, it is
                    of the first importance that gold coins which are below the standard weight
                    should not be allowed to circulate, otherwise holders of large quantities of
                    gold coin are liable to considerable loss. After a certain amount of wear a gold
                    coin in passing from hand to hand loses weight and becomes legally uncurrent. By
                    the Coinage Act it is made compulsory for every person to “cut, break, or
                    deface” any coin tendered to him in payment which is below the current weight,
                    the person tendering it bearing the loss; but, as no penalty is imposed for
                    disregard of this obligation, the law is practically without effect. The
                    withdrawal of light coin from circulation was formerly accomplished solely by
                    the Bank of England, the mint regulations making provision for the receipt of
                    gold tendered for coinage only in the form of bars. The bank undertook to
                    purchase the light gold from the public at the rate of &lt;£3, 17s. 6jd. an
                    ounce, a price which, as compared with the mint value of £3, 17s. 10^d.,
                    entailed a loss of no less than 4d. an ounce on the seller. This loss was
                    occasioned chiefly by the circumstance that the bank, being obliged before
                    sending the light gold to the mint for recoinage to melt, assay, and cast it
                    into bars, found it necessary to deduct the sum of 2∣d. an ounce from the rate
                    of £3, 17s. 9d. an ounce at which it was allowed by statute to purchase gold for
                    coinage, in order to cover the expense of these operations and the loss incident
                    to them. The heavy loss in price, added to that from deficient weight,
                    occasioned constant disregard of the law requiring all light coin to be cut or
                    defaced, and consequently a large amount of light gold continued to be
                    circulated. After the passing of the Coinage Act in 1870, accordingly, fresh
                    regulations were made, by which the mint authorities undertook to receive light
                    gold coin for recoinage, returning to the importer the full mint value of £3,
                    17s. 10Jd. an ounce, thus reducing the loss to that arising from deficiency of
                    weight only. As the Bank of England was enabled by these regulations to raise
                    its price for light gold to the rate of £3, 17s. 9d., the same rate at which it
                    is bound to purchase ingots of standard gold, greater inducements were offered
                    to the public to send in light gold for recoinage, and its withdrawal from
                    circulation was in consequence greatly facilitated. It is evident, however,
                    that, as the deficiency in weight must entail some loss on the holders of light
                    gold coin, they will be disposed to keep it in circulation as long as possible;
                    consequently only a small proportion of the light gold received by bankers finds
                    its way to the Bank of England and thence to the mint for recoinage. The result
                    of some careful experiments made by the late Mr Stanley Jevons, and published by
                    him in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the. Statistical Society</hi> (vol.
                    xxxi. p. 426), showed that a sovereign becomes so light as to be legally
                    uncurrent at the end of eighteen years. The last state measure taken for the
                    withdrawal of light gold coin from circulation was the issue of a royal
                    proclamation in 1842 calling attention to the laws and regulations relating to
                    light gold coin, and instructing those persons whose duty it was to enforce them
                    to see that they were carried out. From the beginning of July 1842 to the end of
                    March 1845 £14,000;000 in light gold coin was withdrawn from circulation and
                    recoined. This amount was estimated to represent 95 per cent, of the whole of
                    the light gold then in circulation. In order to facilitate this withdrawal the
                    Treasury had in June 1842 entered into arrangements with the Bank of England by
                    which the bank was enabled to purchase light gold on behalf of the Government,
                    at the full mint value of £3, 17s. 10^d. an ounce. Light coin, however,
                    continued to be sent into the bank for some time after it had reverted to its
                    original rate of payment for light gold, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> £3, 17s.
                    6£d. an ounce. The expense to the state of this withdrawal, including the
                    expenses of recoinage, was £67,816. As no important withdrawal of worn gold coin
                    has occurred since that time, it is evident that a large amount of light gold
                    must be at the present time in circulation, and that the loss in weight must be
                    considerably greater than that of the coins withdrawn in 1842, the oldest of
                    which were not more than twenty-five years old, the first issue having taken
                    place in 1817. It has been proved by experiment that the average loss of weight
                    in worn sovereigns and half-sovereigns now in circulation is about 3d. in each
                    sovereign,'and that the deficiency in fineness of a large proportion of the coin
                    amounts to about £400 per million. This deficiency arises from the trial plate
                    of 1829, which determined the standard of a portion of the coins still in
                    circulation, being itself below the legal standard. Taking the gold circulation
                    at £100,000,000, of which about 50 per cent, is light, it is estimated that the
                    amount to be recoined cannot be less than £50,000,000, on which the loss from
                    deficiency of gold, both in weight and fineness, must be reckoned at about
                    £650,000, independent of the expenses of recoinage.</p>
                <p>In the case of the silver coinage, the loss consequent on the <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0506-0485"/> withdrawal and recoinage of silver money is now
                    covered by the seigniorage arising from the difference between the real and the
                    nominal value of the coins. Before the adoption of gold as the sole standard of
                    value, the conditions attending the withdrawal and recoinage of silver were much
                    the same as those for gold. In the period between the reign of Charles II. and
                    the accession of William III. the condition of the silver coinage became so
                    unsatisfactory as to demand the attention of parliament. A recommendation made
                    at the suggestion of Sir Isaac Newton for a recoinage of silver was at first
                    strenuously opposed, but was finally adopted. In the course of the discussion
                    the question of raising the standard of weight and fineness arose, and this
                    important change would probably have been made but for the representations of
                    Locke, who warmly took up the question and convinced the Government of the
                    desirability of preserving the established standard. In the great recoinage of
                    silver, the loss arising from clipped and defaced coin was borne by the public,
                    the money being raised by means of a special tax on glass windows. The silver
                    reissued at this time amounted to £7,000,000, and the tax raised to cover loss
                    and the expenses of coinage to £1,200,000. The work of this recoinage was so
                    great that the resources of the mint in London were found to be unequal to the
                    pressure put upon them, and therefore mints were either revived or established
                    for the first time in a few of the large provincial towns. In addition to this
                    ten furnaces were erected behind the Treasury at Whitehall to melt down the old
                    pieces. By these means the renovation of the silver coinage was completed within
                    the year. The new silver coins then issued were the first which had milled
                    edges, the milling having been introduced in order to prevent clipping.</p>
                <p>The mode in which the silver currency is distributed throughout the kingdom is
                    explained by the late Mr George Forbes, cashier of the Bank of England, as
                    follows</p>
                <p>Every banker in the kingdom has a banker who is his agent in London. Every London
                    banker has an account with the Bank of England. In the Bank of England there is
                    a department devoted to the issue and receipt of silver coin. If in a district
                    there is a deficiency of silver currency, the bankers of the district are the
                    first to find it out. They at once write to their London agents, who draw on
                    their account with the Bank of England, and obtain what silver is required,
                    which they send to the country banker. On the other hand, if there is a surplus
                    of silver in a district it accumulates in the coffers of the local bankers, who
                    send it up to their London agents, and they send it into the Bank of England. If
                    there is a general demand for silver currency, the stock which the Bank of
                    England endeavours to keep on hand becomes unduly diminished, and immediate
                    notice of the fact is conveyed to the mint authorities, who proceed with all
                    convenient speed to coin a supply of florins, shillings, sixpences, or of all of
                    these coins, as the nature of the demand may require.</p>
                <p>Gold bullion for coinage is supplied to the mint almost entirely by the Bank of
                    England, the bank being bound by law to purchase at the rate of £3, 17s. 9d. an
                    ounce any gold bullion of the legal standard which the public may bring for
                    sale. Private individuals are permitted to bring bullion to the mint, and to
                    receive back the full amount (at £3, 17s. 10∣d. an ounce) converted into coin,
                    free of any charge for loss or manufacture; but, as they are subject to
                    considerable delay, all “importations” of bullion being converted into coin in
                    the order in which they are brought to the mint, the public practically prefer
                    to sell their bullion to the bank, and receive its value without delay. In order
                    to be accepted by the bank, the bullion must be cast into ingots and assayed, a
                    guarantee being given by certain recognized assayers that the gold is of a
                    certain standard fineness. This is known as the “trade assay.” When the bank
                    requires gold to be struck, due notice is sent to the deputy master, and on a
                    fixed day the bullion is conveyed to the mint and delivered into his custody. It
                    arrives fn the form of ingots, each weighing about 200 ounces, the aggregate
                    value of each importation being about £144,000. When the ingots arrive at the
                    mint a small sample is taken from each and assayed, <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> the result being sent to the authorities of the bank in order that it may
                    be compared with that of the trade assay. If the bank authorities find that the
                    two assays agree, within certain limits, as to weight and fineness, the ingots
                    are immediately sent to the operative department of the mint to be converted
                    into coin. The mint assay affords the basis for calculating the amount of
                    copper, the alloying metal, that must be melted with the gold in order to
                    produce the standard prescribed by law. The case of silver is somewhat
                    different, the bullion being purchased by the department at its market value,
                    which varies from year to year. During the ten years ending 1881 the average
                    price of silver bullion sank gradually from 60 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi><hi rend="subscript"> β</hi> d. to 51∣∣d. The silver
                    bullion arrives at the mint in the form of ingots, each of which weighs about
                    1000 ounces, the value of each set of ingots varying considerably. The ingots,
                    both of gold and silver, are weighed on a balance capable of turning with 1
                    grain when loaded with 1200 ounces.</p>
                <p>The operations of coining have undergone some slight changes with the
                    introduction of new machinery and the increased extent of the Royal Mint, since
                    the reconstruction of the operative department in 1881. <hi rend="superscript">

                    department.</p>
                <p>The operations employed in the manufacture of gold and silver coin are as follows
                    (incidental operations being printed in smaller type) :—</p>
                <p>I. Assaying the bullion.</p>
                <p>II. Melting the metal.</p>
                <p>(a) Addition of the amount of copper necessary to form the prescribed alloy; (δ)
                    pouring the metal into moulds so as to form bars; (c) dressing these bars to
                    remove rough edges and hollow ends; (d) recovery of precious metals from
                    crucibles and “sweep.”</p>
                <p>III. Assaying portions of metal cut from certain bars, to ascertain whether
                    sufficient accuracy has been attained in the standard fineness.</p>
                <p>IV. Rolling the bars into strips or “fillets.” Annealing the fillets (in some
                    cases).</p>
                <p>V. Adjusting the fillets by a final rolling, and in some cases by the use of the

                <p>Testing the fillets to ascertain whether they are of sufficient accuracy as
                    regards thickness.</p>

                    to the public.</p>
                <p>The foregoing list will make it clear that the operations bf minting consist, not

                    manufactured by contract in the autumn of 1881. The governor of the Bank of
                    England had previously reported that the stock of gold coin held by the bank was
                    abnormally large, and that no inconvenience would arise “if the mint were to

                    of an alloy composed of precious and base metals in definite proportions. The
                    accuracy of the “standard fineness” of the alloy after melting must be
                    absolutely ascertained; the alloy must be protected during manufacture against a
                    change of standard, and finally its correctness must be verified after it has
                    been converted into coin.</p>
                <p>The precious metals are weighed on entering the mint, as well as during various
                    stages in the manufacture of coin. The finished coins are also weighed in bulk
                    before they are issued to the public.</p>
                <p>The operations incidental to the coinage of bronze and silver differ from those
                    described in relation to gold in some unimportant details only; and the weight
                    and composition of the bronze coins are not so carefully guarded as is the case
                    with gold and silver.</p>
                <p>Subjoined are the details of the operations involved in the conversion of bullion
                    into coin at the British mint.</p>
                <p>After being assayed and weighed in the manner already described the bullion is
                    taken to the melting-house, where the details of treatment for silver and gold
                    respectively differ somewhat. (The sub-, sequent operations are nearly identical
                    for both metals.) The silver melting-house (see fig. 1) contains eight furnaces,
                    of the kind shown at A fig. 2, the part of the furnace containing the crucibles
                    being below the lids B, B. Crucibles of cast iron were formerly employed, but
                    these were replaced in 1853 by wrought iron pots, which have since 1870 been in
                    turn abandoned in favour of crucibles made of a mixture of clay and graphite,
                    each crucible being capable of containing about 3000 oz. Such crucibles are very
                    generally adopted throughout the Indian and Continental mints, but the form and
                    dimensions given to them vary. The fuel employed in England is coke, about 75 lb
                    of which arc required to melt 3000 oz. of standard silver. Sufficient draught is
                    afforded by the flue C and by a chimney about 35 feet high which communicates
                    with it. The silver and copper are melted together; and before the metal is
                    poured into moulds it is stirred with an iron rod having a flattened end. The
                    surface of the molten metal is covered with a layer of charcoal to prevent
                    oxidation of the copper. The crucible with its contents is then removed from the
                    furnace by the aid of a crane and tongs W, and is placed in a cradle Μ, which
                    can be tilted by means of a handle D. By the intervention of toothed wheels E,
                    F, G, H, and K acting on a rack the handle turns the crucible on the fulcrum
                    formed by a spindle, so that the contents of the crucible may be poured into the
                    moulds N mounted on a carriage OP, running on rails Q, Q. The moulds now in use
                    in London are of such dimensions as to enable bars to be cast 12 inches long and
                    ⅜ inch thick. The width of the bars varies, according to the coin to be
                    produced, from 1∣ to 2∣ inches.</p>
                <p>When the metal has solidified in the moulds it is removed, and the bars are
                    trimmed by the aid of a revolving circular file, their ends being cut off and
                    returned to the melting pot. Portions of metal are then cut from certain of the
                    bars, and sent to the assay department. The bars are weighed before they pass to
                    the subsequent operations of coinage, in order that the amount of metal retained
                    by the crucibles or carried into the flues may be ascertained. Gold bullion is
                    melted in a similar way, but the crucibles are smaller, and contain only 1200
                    oz. Their contents are poured by hand into moulds, one end of the tongs by which
                    the crucible is grasped being supported by a chain and suspended from the
                    roof.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A new form of
                    furnace devised by Μ. A. Piat of Paris has recently been introduced. In these
                    furnaces the portion which contains the crucible may be detached from the flue,
                    so as to admit of the molten metal being poured into moulds without removing the
                    crucible from the incandescent fuel. Four of such furnaces have been fitted up
                    in the gold melting-house, but have not as yet been used for gold melting; in
                    the melting of silver and bronze, however, they are known to effect considerable
                    economy in labour, fuel, and crucibles.</p></note> In many Continental mints it
                    is very generally the practice to leave the crucible containing the precious
                    metals in the furnace, and to pour the contents into the moulds by the aid of
                    small ladles of wrought iron lined with clay.</p>
                <p>It has been pointed out in <hi rend="smallcaps">Gold</hi> (vol. x. p. 751) that
                    minute quantities of certain metals render standard gold extremely brittle and
                    unfit for coinage. If either the gold bullion or the copper used as an alloying
                    metal should be impure, brittle bars will be the result. Should this prove to be
                    the case, the bars are remelted<pb break="no"

                <p>The engine-room (shown in fig. 1) contains three 60-horsepower vertical
                    condensing engines, which are provided with Corlis valves, and are specially
                    devised for meeting the constantly varying strain to which they are subjected by
                    the machinery, the whole of which they are capable of driving. The central
                    engine acts directly on either or both of the rolling rooms placed on each side
                    of the engine-house. There is; however, an additional 20-horsepower compound
                    beam engine usually employed, in connexion with the pumps of a deep artesian
                    well.</p>
                <p>Into one or other of these rooms the bars which have been cast in the
                    melting-house are brought, and are rolled into stri∣&gt;s the thickness of which
                    depends on the kind of coins to be produced. Gold is rolled in one room and
                    silver or bronze in the other. The details of manipulation involved in the
                    conversion of gold, silver, or bronze bars into coin, however, do not differ
                    materially, and the coinage of sovereigns will therefore be taken as
                    typical.</p>
                <p>Each room contains six pairs of rolls, the diameter of the rolls varying from 10
                    to 14 inches. Smaller diameters are employed in most European mints, but on the
                    other hand the use of very narrow rolls of far larger diameter has often been
                    suggested, and there appears to be good ground for the belief that the rigidity
                    of such rolls would enable strips or fillets of more uniform thickness to be
                    produced than is the case at present. The iron frame CC (fig. 3) is firmly
                    bolted to the stone D, which rests on a solid foundation EE. ’This frame
                    supports the two rolls A, B, the lower of which B revolves, but is not, like the
                    upper, capable of adjustment in a ver tical plane. The upper roll is centred in
                    bearings, and may be raised or lowered by means of screws connected with toothed
                    wheels F, F, which are turned by a handle G, both wheels being moved
                    simultaneously by worms on the rod H. The bearings of the upper roll are
                    -connected by vertical rods with weights below the level of the floor; and, as
                    it rises with the screws, it can thus be readily adjusted in a line exactly
                    parallel with the lower roll, at a sufficient distance from it to admit the bar
                    which is to be reduced to a strip or fillet. The rolls are turned by the shaft
                    NN, the main wheel Μ, and the gearing K, I., O, P. The sockets <hi rend="italic"
                    >r</hi> by which the upper roll is connected with the gearing by the shaft I are
                    not rigid, as is the case with the shaft Q of the lower roll, but admit of the
                    adjustment of the roll. The portion of the roll used is determined by a guide a
                    little wider than the bar.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p> In the second rolling room, shown in the plan on the right of the
                    enginehouse, the frames and gearing of the rolls are of newer pattern than those
                    in the first room. In some of the six pairs the bottom rolls revolve and drive
                    the upper ones. In the pair of “breaking-down” rolls in this room,—that is, the
                    roll by which the fillets are first treated,—the upper roll is stationary, the
                    lower roil alone revolving. The necessary “bite” is given to the fillet, when
                    its end is introduced, by slightly turning the upper roll by means of a
                    ratchet-wheel and lever.</p></note> The rolls throughout this department are
                    driven at the rate of about 32 revolutions in a minute. The iron frame CC is
                    braced by rods α, <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and blocks bearing the driving
                    shafts are shown at <hi rend="italic">k, k, p, p.</hi></p>
                <p>The initial thickness of a sovereign bar is ∣ths of an inch. The bars are weighed
                    out to the workmen in batches of about sixty bars, an entire batch being passed
                    through the rolls under precisely the same conditions of adjustment. The bars
                    are only slightly reduced in width by repeated passages through the rolls, but
                    are successively reduced in thickness in the first stages of the rolling by <hi

                    “spring pinches” are given to the bars by simply passing them through the rolls
                    without altering the adjustment. The testing of the fillets, to ascertain
                    whether they are of the accurate thickness, is effected by the aid of the gauge
                    plate (fig. 4), which consists of two steel bars set at a low angle in relation
                    to each other and graduated to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> √τ∏yth of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>It will be evident that the weight of the finished coin depends upon the
                    thickness of the fillets; and to show how accurately the rolling must be
                    performed it may be pointed out that, in the case of the half-sovereign, a

                <p>The repeated passage through the rolls is attended by a consider, able increase
                    of hardness in the metal; and it is therefore in some cases necessary to anneal
                    the fillets repeatedly during the rolling. In the case of fillets for sovereigns
                    the annealing may be entirely dispensed with if the initial thickness of the
                    bars does not exceed ⅜ths of an inch. Fillets for half-sovereigns have only to
                    be annealed once. In some European mints the fillets are annealed frequently; in
                    one mint the operation is performed after each passage through the rolls. The
                    furnace used for the purpose is generally so arranged as to permit the flame to
                    play over the fillets, which are sometimes freely exposed to its action, but are
                    more often enclosed in cases or tubes. Muffle furnaces are frequently used. The
                    furnace used in the Royal Mint is a simple form of reverberatory furnace. The
                    final rolling is given by a pair of finishing rolls capable of more accurate
                    adjustment than the “breaking-down” rolls.</p>
                <p>The fillets of gold or silver are in some cases, though not always, submitted to
                    an appliance known as the drag bench, shown in figs. 5, 6, 7. Its object is to
                    equalize the thickness of the fillets by drawing them between steel cylinders.
                    The ends of the fillets are first flattened in a little appliance, which need
                    not be described. The essential feature of the machine now used in the mint
                    consists of two small steel cylinders A, A, which do not revolve, and are held
                    in position in the plates D, D by clamp pieces F, F screwed against them.</p>
                <p>The portions of metal may be adjusted by the aid of a wheel and screw H
                    (figs.</p>
                <p>6, 7), and by small adjusting screws <hi rend="italic">f, f.</hi> The part of the
                    machine containing the steel cylinders is fixed at the end of a long bench, and
                    gearing at the other end of this bench drives an endless chain BB (fig. 6), one
                    link or other of which catches the carriage, shown in plan in fig. 5, and drags
                    it along as soon as its end <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is depressed by the handle
                    <hi rend="italic">r.</hi> The carriage runs on the wheels <hi rend="italic">d,
                    d.</hi> The drawing of the fillet C is conducted as follows. Its flattened end
                    is introduced between the steel cylinders, and is grasped by the jaws <hi
                    rend="italic">a.</hi> The jaws turn on the pin c, and while the fillet is being
                    dragged through the cylinders the axle of the wheels <hi rend="italic"
                    >d,</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> tends to increase the grip of the jaws by
                    acting on their inclined ends. Directly the strain on the fillet is released,
                    the pins <hi rend="italic">i,</hi><hi rend="italic">i</hi> and the weight <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> loosen the jaws and at the same time raise the end of the
                    carriage so as to arrest its further progress along the bench. The carriage is
                    then moved forward by the handle <hi rend="italic">s</hi> until the jaws enter
                    the hollowed portion N and grasp another fillet.</p>
                <p>Formerly—when fillets were rolled from thick bars—this appliance played a more
                    important part in coining operations than at present. It is now only used for
                    fillets from which sovereigns and half-sovereigns are to be produced. Before
                    fillets are passed on to the next operation—that of cutting from them the disks
                    or blanks destined to form the coin—they are carefully tested by a skilful
                    workman called the “tryer,” who cuts one or two blanks from the sides of each
                    fillet by the aid of a cutter worked by hand. These blanks are weighed on a
                    delicate balance against a standard weight, and the experience of the operator
                    enables him to determine whether the variation from the exact weight will
                    justify his sending the fillets forward to the cutting room. In any case he
                    divides the fillets into two or more classes for a reason that will be explained
                    presently.</p>
                <p>The cutters employed in the mint until quite recently were of complicated
                    construction, but these have been replaced by a simple machine (fig. 8) which,
                    by the revolution of an excentric A, causes two short steel cylinders, mounted
                    on a block of iron B suitably guided, to enter two holes firmly fixed in a plate
                    on the bed of the machine. When the fillet FF is interposed between the short
                    cylinders and the holes, the former force disks of metal through the holes, the
                    fillet being advanced at each stroke of the machine by small gripping rolls C,
                    C', C" actuated by a ratchet-wheel E, driven from the shaft which bears the
                    excentric A. The disks pass down the tube G to a receptacle placed on the floor.
                    In the case of very large silver coins, only one disk is cut in the width of the
                    fillet, and in some few mints disks for gold coin are also cut in this way, but
                    it is far more usual to cut two disks in the width of the fillet, the position
                    of the cutters being so arranged as to remove blanks in the manner shown in fig.
                    9. In cutting disks for bronze coin extreme precision is not necessary, and it
                    has therefore been found possible to obtain five at each stroke of the
                    machine.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n510/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0510-0489"/>
                <p>It will be evident that the rough classification of the fillets according to
                    their thickness, to which reference has already been made, renders it easy to
                    compensate for slight irregularities in thickness caused by rolling, by
                    employing cutters of a slightly larger diameter than the standard size for
                    fillets which are too thin.</p>
                <p>The fillets after the removal of the disks present the perforated appearance
                    shown in fig. 9. The residual metal, called “scissel,” which amounts to from 25
                    to 30 per cent, of the metal operated upon, is returned to the melting-house in
                    bundles weighing 180 oz. It may be mentioned here that all attempts to cut disks
                    or blanks for coinage from the ends of rods or cylinders, and thus to avoid the
                    production of scissel, have hitherto failed.</p>
                <p>The next operation to which the blanks are submitted varies in different mints.
                    In some, each blank is weighed by hand or by automatic machinery, and each blank
                    that is too heavy is adjusted either to an exact weight or to within the remedy
                    prescribed by law. On the Continent it is very generally the practice to adjust
                    blanks by the aid of a file, or by a machine that removes a fine shaving of
                    metal from the surface of the blank. In mints where mechanical adjustment is
                    adopted there is a tendency to produce “too heavy” blanks in the rolling and
                    cutting departments, as it is impossible to adjust blanks which are too
                    light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> A description of
                    a machine used for the adjustment of blanks will be found in <hi rend="italic">
                    Dingier's</hi><hi rend="italic"> Polytechnisches</hi><hi rend="italic">
                    Journal</hi> (1882, ccxlv. 61, pl. 6); and some years ago Mr J. Μ. Napier
                    devised for the Indian mints a beautiful machine which first ascertains how much
                    it is necessary to cut from each blank in order to reduce it to the standard
                    weight, and then removes the necessary amount of metal and no more. The initial
                    cost of such machinery, however, is considerable. In 1849 Μ. Diereck, director
                    of the mint in Paris, endeavoured to substitute a chemical for a mechanical
                    treatment by submitting the heavy gold blanks to aqua regia, which it was
                    anticipated would bring them within the prescribed limits of accuracy. The
                    results were not satisfactory, and the attempt was abandoned. In 1870 the
                    present chemist of the mint, Professor W. Chandler Roberts, showed that gold
                    alloyed with copper might be removed from heavy blanks with singular regularity
                    by means of a suitable solvent aided by a battery. The blanks are arranged in a
                    frame of wood and submitted to the action of a solution of cyanide of potassium,
                    the heavy blanks forming the dissolving pole of the battery. The process was not
                    used in the London mint, as it became evident that it could not profitably
                    replace the present system, under which finished coins alone are weighed and the
                    manufacture of good coin only is paid for. It was, however, introduced into the
                    Bombay mint in 1870 by the late Mr I.. G. Hines, who extended its usefulness by
                    transfeιτing the metal dissolved from the heavy blanks to blanks which are too
                    light, the latter being by this means raised to the prescribed weight. The
                    process has now fairly taken its place as an ordinary operation of coining, and
                    its importance to the mints where it is used may be gathered from the fact that
                    in the Indian mints no less than 1300 tons of silver were converted into coin in
                    one year (1879), so that the saving effected by its introduction must be
                    considerable.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the London mint finished coin alone is weighed, so that the blanks after
                    leaving the cutting room pass directly to an edge-rolling machine, which
                    thickens the edge of each blank'so as to form a rim intended to protect the
                    impression on the finished coin. The operation of edge-rolling is called
                    “marking,” and the method of conducting it varies considerably in different
                    mints.</p>
                <p>In the Royal Mint the blanks are made to pass in quick succession, at the rate of
                    six hundred a minute, between a circular groove in the face of a revolving steel
                    disk and a groove in a fixed block placed parallel to the face of the revolving
                    disk. The groove in the block exactly corresponds to that on the disk; and, as
                    the distance between the block and the disk is slightly less than the diameter
                    of the blank submitted to the operation, the result is that before the blank
                    escapes from the machine its edge has been thickened. The operation may be
                    varied by admitting the blanks between a groove in the periphery of a revolving
                    wheel and a groove in a segmented block, placed at a distance from the wheel
                    rather less than the diameter of the blank. The wheel and block may be either
                    vertical or horizontal.</p>
                <p>In some cases the edges of the blanks, at the same time that they are thickened,
                    receive the impression of a legend, or inscription, or an ornamental device.
                    When this is the case the blank is rolled between two planes, one of which is
                    fixed and bears the device, while the other has a reciprocating motion imparted
                    to it, or the edge of the blank receives the impression, which may be either
                    raised or sunk, from a collar surrounding the blank in the coining press, as
                    will be afterwards explained.</p>
                <p>Before passing to the coining press the blanks either of gold or silver are
                    annealed. In many mints the object of the heating is not only to soften the
                    blanks before they receive the impression, but also to produce a film of oxide
                    of copper on their surface. This is attained in various ways. In England gold
                    blanks are placed in cylindrical crucibles of plumbago and covered with a layer
                    of charcoal, heated in a reverberatory furnace, and when the blanks reach
                    cherry-redness they are cooled by plunging them in water. The thin film of oxide
                    of copper thus formed on the surface of the gold or silver blanks is readily
                    soluble in dilute sulphuric acid, and the removal of a small portion of the
                    alloying metal in this way constitutes “blanching” or “pickling” the coin. The
                    method of conducting the operation varies somewhat in different mints, mainly,
                    however, in the strength of the acid used, which varies from 3° to 5° of the
                    hydrometer of Baume. The solution is sometimes heated to 96° to 98° C., while in
                    other cases the blanks are introduced into the solution while at a red heat. The
                    latter method is, however, objectionable, as a dense layer of pure metal is
                    found at the surface of the blank which is apt to*protect the underlying oxide
                    of ≡r from the action of the acid. The blanks are afterwards id in pure water
                    and dried either in sawdust or in copper vessels heated by steam jackets. The
                    object of the process is to <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n511/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0511-0490"/> improve the appearance of the finished coin by
                    removing all traces of impurity from the surface of the blank. It has, however,
                    been abandoned in the British mint except in the case of some of the smaller
                    silver coins, mainly because the soft superficial layer of metal wears away with
                    undue rapidity. Certain precautions suggested in 1869 by Mr Hill, the
                    superintendent of the operative department, for avoiding oxidation or tarnishing
                    of the metal during coinage rendered the abolition of the process possible.</p>
                <p>The blanks receive the impression which constitutes them coins from engraved
                    dies. Each is placed in the lower of two dies, and the upper die is brought
                    forcibly down upon it. The lateral escape of the metal is prevented by a collar
                    which surrounds the blank while it is being struck. This collar may be either
                    plain or engraved, and if the latter is the case any device or ornament it may
                    bear will be imparted to the edge of the blank.</p>
                <p>The coining presses used iu various mints may be divided into three types :—(1)
                    the screw press worked by atmospheric pressure, (2) the excentric press, and (3)
                    the lever press. The first of these (see <hi rend="italic">Ency. Brit.,</hi> 8th
                    ed., vol. vii. p. 92) has now been abandoned. In the excentric press the power
                    is applied to a shaft bearing an excentric which acts by means of a connecting
                    rod upon a vertical slide holding the die which is brought down on the blank.
                    This form of press is used in the mint at Constantinople, where the atmospheric
                    screw press is also still retained. Of the third type, the lever press, there
                    are two modifications, devised respectively by Thonnelier and by Uhlhorn. The
                    details of the Uhlhorn press have been improved by Messrs R. Heaton &amp; Sons
                    of Birmingham; and, their superiority to the old vacuum screw press having been
                    demonstrated by careful experiments, they have been finally adopted in the newly
                    arranged mint, which contains fourteen of them. This press is shown in figs. 10
                    and 11. It is driven from below the floor of the press-room by bands which pass
                    over fast and loose pulleys on the same shaft that bears the fly-wheel. The
                    loose pulley, however, is only used when it is necessary to stop the machine
                    entirely, as the fly-wheel is permitted to revolve without imparting motion to
                    the shaft so long as a lever Μ, worked from the front of the machine, does not
                    cause the fly-wheel to be connected with the driving wheel by means of two pins.
                    The dies are placed in the front part of the machine (fig. 10). The lower one is
                    firmly fixed to the bed, while the upper is held at A by the upper of two jaws F
                    and A', or levers, the fulcra of which are so close together as almost to
                    coincide, the lower jaw A' bearing the collar which encircles the blank while it
                    is being converted into a coin; the upper jaw F, A, governed by the weighted
                    lever H shown below the bed of the machine, has a tendency to rise a sufficient
                    distance to admit the blank between the upper and lower die. A crank B on the
                    shaft bearing the fly-wheel is connected by a rod C with the bent lever D, and
                    this bent lever, acting through the toggle joint and a piece of metal E
                    connected with the jaw that bears the upper die, forces it down, and thus
                    squeezes the blank between the upper and lower dies. A cam on the crank shaft
                    acting on the lower of the two levers G shown below the bed of the machine
                    causes the lower jaw A' bearing the collar which surrounded the blank to be
                    depressed sufficiently to leave the finished coin freely resting on the lower
                    die, from whence it is driven down the shoot N by the next blank in succession.
                    Coins are produced at rates varying from 60 to 120 a minute, 90 a minute giving
                    the best results. The blanks to be converted into coins are placed on the slide
                    J, and the advance of each blank in succession is regulated by the rod called
                    the “layer on” K, the backward and forward movement of which is also regulated
                    by an excentric on the crank shaft. The details of this part of the machine are
                    shown in plan, fig. 12.</p>
                <p>The last operation before the finished coin is returned to the mint office for
                    issue to the public is the weighing each gold or silver piece separately. This
                    is effected in the American and in most Continental mints by hand, but in
                    England automatic balances of beautiful construction are employed. They were
                    originally devised for separating worn pieces from those of current weight, but
                    they are now employed to distinguish between “light,” “heavy,” and “good”
                    pieces, the latter alone being permitted to pass into circulation. In the newly
                    arranged department thirty such machines are provided. Each is driven from
                    overhead shafting by means of gut lines. The driving pulleys derive their motion
                    from a small atmospheric engine, which is found to give more satisfactory
                    results than would be the case if the steam-engine were employed directly. Each
                    balance is worked by a cone pulley A (fig. 13) by a gut line passing round it
                    from the loose pulleys B, the necessary tension being imparted to the line by
                    means of a spring C. The tension of the line is, however, but slight, for if the
                    action of the balance is arrested by accident the cord slides over the cone
                    pulley A without turning it. It will be obvious that the use of the cone pulley
                    enables the machine to be driven with varying degrees of speed. The toothed
                    wheel D is mounted on the spindle which bears the driving pulley A, but it acts
                    only through the intervention of a friction cheek, which is so lightly screwed
                    against the driving wheel that it would cease to act if the machine should be
                    accidentally deranged. The wheel D sets in motion the wheels E, E', E". The cam
                    F, acting on the curved extremity of the rocking frame G, causes the slide H to
                    bring forward one of a series of coins (arranged in the hopper I) until it rests
                    on the plate J of the balance beam, of which beam a portion is shown in an
                    enlarged drawing above the balance, while the plate that receives the coin is
                    also shown in a separate drawing to the left of the machine. Another cam K then
                    comes into play, and enables the forceps, shown at I., to release the rod Μ to
                    which the balance plate J is attached. The forceps I. serves to keep the rod
                    steady while the coin is being placed on the plate J. A rod shown at N is then
                    raised by the cam O, the lower extremity of the rod being kept steady by a pin
                    sliding in a hole in the bottom plate of the balance, and its upper end by a pin
                    which works into the central support of the balance beam. At the base of this
                    rod N, and at right angles to it, there is a metallic bar QQ, the ends of which
                    pass through stirrups in the pendants Μ and P from the opposite ends of the
                    beam. The elevation of this horizontal rod by the cam O simultaneously releases
                    both ends of the beam, and the coin placed on the beam plate has then, for the
                    first time, a direct influence on the beam. If the coin is “too light” the
                    counterpoise R in the cage at the end of the rod P will raise the coin, and the
                    revolution of the machine then causes part of the cam K to permit a spring to
                    close the forceps I. and to hold the pendant Μ firm. An indicating finger T then
                    falls, and by means of a horizontal lever UU', which fits into one of three
                    inverted steps on the bottom of the shoot V, determines over which of three
                    orifices W, w,W" in the bottom plate of the balance this shoot shall stand. In
                    the meantime the advance of the slide H brings the next piece forward, and
                    displaces the coin which has hitherto occupied the beam plate J, forcing the
                    coin down the shoot V, and thence through the orifice W into a receptacle,
                    external to the balance, destined for the reception of “light coin.” If this
                    next piece should be “too heavy” it will not only raise the counterpoise R but
                    will also elevate a little wire S, which would otherwise remain undisturbed on a
                    support. This little wire represents the “working remedy” for the particular
                    denomination of coin in question, which, for safety, is less by <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ⅜ <hi rend="subscript"> ff</hi> th of a grain than the
                    remedy permitted by law. The undue weight of the “heavy coin” will depress the
                    right end of the balance beam and its pendant Μ to the lowest possible point,
                    and the indicating finger T will, in this case, determine that the rod UU <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> shall occupy the lowest step of the shoot V, which
                    will consequently stand over the orifice W" in the bottom plate of the balance
                    which communicates with the receptacle for the “heavy” coins, and the heavy coin
                    on the beam plate will be driven down the shoot by the next coin in succession.
                    If the coin which is next brought forward by the slide H should be a “good” one,
                    that is, if it is within the working “remedy,” its action will be as follows. It
                    may be slightly heavier than the counterpoise, but not sufficiently heavy to
                    lift both the counterpoise and the remedy wire. The balance beam consequently
                    remains approximately horizontal, and the indicating finger T will cause the rod
                    UU ’ to strike the centre step of the shoot V, which will then stand over the
                    central orifice w in the bed plate which communicates with a receptacle for
                    “good” coins, into which the coin will find its way, as soon as it is driven
                    from the beam plate by the next coin of the series. It will be evident that this
                    excellent appliance both weighs and classifies the coins. About twenty-three
                    coins are passed through it in a minute.</p>
                <p>In order to show the importance of extreme accuracy in weighing, it may be
                    pointed out that, although by the Coinage Act of 1870 the “remedy” or allowed
                    variation above or below the standard weight of a sovereign is only ⅜th of a
                    grain, yet in a million sterling of sovereigns the difference between the least
                    and the greatest weight the law allows would be no less than £3244.</p>
                <p>The manufacture of coin is not the only work which is performed in the Royal
                    Mint. All medals issued to the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n512/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0512-0491"/> army and navy, as well as those given by the
                    Royal Society and the university of London and some others, are struck in the
                    mint, and their preparation forms a considerable part of the work of the die
                    department. Since 1874 the clasps and bars for the medals have also been
                    manufactured in the mint, whence they have been issued completely mounted.
                    Another operation, not connected with the coinage, which is performed in the
                    mint is the assay of the “diet” or metal scraped from the gold and silver plate
                    manufactured at Sheffield and Birmingham under the direction of the warden of
                    the standard of wrought plate for those towns. By Act of Parliament it is
                    directed that this shall be brought once in each year to the mint to be assayed
                    by the “king’s assay master,” under the supervision of an officer appointed by
                    the lords of the Treasury.</p>
                <p>The gold coin in circulation in Great Britain is estimated at £100,000,000. It
                    may be well to add the following table, which gives the value of the gold and
                    silver coinages of four of the most important foreign countries, in two recent
