                    Mithras ”), was a favourite name of the Pontic kings in the third and second
                    centuries <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and was also common in Persia and the
                    neighbouring countries. The dynasty of Pontus was a Persian family, claiming
                    descent from the Achaemenidae, and the earliest of them known in history was
                    satrap under the Persian empire. When that empire was destroyed Mithradates II.
                    made himself king of Pontus; and he and his successors gradually spread their
                    power over a great <pb break="no"

                    them intermarried with the Seleucidae and other Greek royal families, and
                    something of the Hellenic civilization was engrafted on the native non-Hellenic
                    character of the kingdom. The names Mithradates, Pharnaces, and Ariobarzanes,
                    all non-Hellenic, alternate in the family. The province of Phrygia was sold in
                    the most scandalous way by the Roman consul Aquillius to Mithradates V., who
                    died probably in 120 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> He was succeeded by his son
                    Mithradates Eupator, sixth of the name, one of those remarkable conquerors that
                    arise from time to time in the East. He was a boy when his father died, and for
                    seven years lived the wandering life of a hunter pursued by assassins. His
                    courage, his wonderful bodily strength and size, his skill in the use of
                    weapons, in riding, and in the chase, his speed of foot, his capacity for eating
                    and drinking, and at the same time his quick and penetrating intellect, his
                    wonderful mastery of twenty-two languages,— all these qualities are celebrated
                    by the ancients to a degree which is almost incredible. With a surface gloss of
                    Greek education, he united the subtlety, the superstition, and the obstinate
                    endurance of an Oriental. He was a virtuoso, and collected curiosities and works
                    of art; he assembled Greek men of letters round him; he gave prizes to the
                    greatest poets and the best eaters. He spent much of his time in practising
                    magic arts, the interpretation of dreams, and other superstitious ceremonies;
                    and it was believed that he had so saturated his body with poisons that none
                    could injure him. He trusted no one; he murdered his nearest relations, his
                    mother, his sons, the sister whom he had married; to prevent his harem from
                    falling a trophy to his enemies he murdered all his concubines, and his most
                    faithful followers were never safe. He once disappeared from his palace, no one
                    knew whither, and returned after some months, having wandered over all Asia
                    Minor in disguise. Except in the pages of romance or the tales of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Thousand and One Nights</hi> it would be difficult to find
                    anything to rival the account given of Mithradates by the gravest of historians.
                    These qualities fitted him to be the opponent of Roman arms in Asia Minor, to be
                    the champion of the East in its struggle against the destroying and yet
                    civilizing power of the West. He resisted the Romans for eighteen years, yet we
                    can hardly credit him with much real generalship or organizing power. He could
                    collect masses of men and hurl them against the Roman legions; everything that
                    boundless energy and boundless hatred could do he did; but the strength of his
                    opposition to the Romans lay in the fact that all the dislike inspired by Rome
                    in the worst and most cruel time of her rule was arrayed on his side.</p>
                <p>No direct collision took place between the Romans and Mithradates for thirty-two
                    years, though the republic took away Phrygia from him in 120 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> and several times thwarted his designs in
                    Paphlagonia and Cappadocia. The rupture came about the time of the Social War.
                    Mithradates, prompted, it is said, by envoys from the Italian allies, took
                    advantage of the intestine struggles in Italy. War broke out in 88, on the
                    ostensible cause of disputes about the kingdom of Bithynia; Mithradates rapidly
                    overran Galatia, Phrygia, and Asia, defeated the Roman armies, and made a
                    general massacre of the Romans resident in Asia. He also sent large armies into
                    European Greece, and his generals occupied Athens. But Sulla in Greece and
                    Fimbria in Asia defeated his armies in several battles; the Greek cities were
                    disgusted by his severity, and in 84 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> he concluded
                    peace, abandoning all his conquests, surrendering seventy ships, and paying a
                    fine of 2000 talents. Murena invaded Pontus without any good reason in 83, but
                    was defeated in 82. Difficulties constantly arose between the two adversaries,
                    and in 74 a general war broke out. Mithradates defeated Cotta, one of the Roman
                    consuls, at Chalcedon; but Lucullus worsted him in several engagements, and
                    drove him finally in 72 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> to take refuge in Armenia
                    with his son-in-law Tigranes. After two great victories in 69 and 68, Lucullus
                    was disconcerted by mutiny among his troops and the defeat of his lieutenant
                    Fabius (see vol. xv. p. 56). In 66 he was superseded by Pompey, who completely
                    defeated both Mithradates and Tigranes. The former established himself in 64 at
                    Panticapaeum, and was planning new campaigns against the Romans when his own
                    troops revolted, and, after vainly trying to poison himself, he ordered a Gallic
                    mercenary to kill him. So perished the greatest enemy that the Romans had to
                    encounter in Asia Minor. His body was sent to Pompey, who buried it in the royal
                    sepulchre at Sinope.</p>
