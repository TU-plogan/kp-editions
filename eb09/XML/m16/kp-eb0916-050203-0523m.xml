                    oral law of the Jews. The question What is Mishnah? was asked, however, as early
                    as the latter part of the 1st or the early part of the 2d century, though in a
                    somewhat different sense and for a somewhat different purpose.<note

                    akin to <hi rend="italic">Mishneh</hi> (which term occurs more than once there),
                    as may be seen on comparing <hi rend="italic">Mikvah</hi> with <hi rend="italic"

                    it. It is not, however, as many think, either a commentary on the Halakhic
                    portions of the Pentateuch, or on the ordinances of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sopherim,</hi> or on both together. It rather presupposes the knowledge of, and
                    respect for, both the Mosaic and the Sopheric laws, and it only discusses, and
                    finally decides on, the best mode and manner of executing these. The discussions
                    and eventual decisions to be found in the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> owe
                    their existence principally to deep meditation on these two kinds of laws,
                    notably on the former, by the rabbis of various ages, but chiefly by those who
                    lived fifty years before and one hundred and fifty years after the rise of
                    Christianity, the names of whom it faithfully gives, along with their respective
                    discussions and decisions. There are but few cases to be found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> which would critically come under the denomination of
                    an <hi rend="italic">Halakhah le-Mosheh mis-Sinai, i.e.,</hi> an explanation (of
                    a law) as directly given by God to Moses, and in uninterrupted succession
                    received from him by the rabbis. Several cases given under this name in the <hi

                    sixteen such <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> cases to be found in the works of

                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Method.—</hi> A <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> if genuine,
                    never begins with a passage of the Pentateuch, and even comparatively seldom
                    brings direct proof from or gives reference to it. When there is any exception
                    to this rule it will be found, on close examination, either that such a
                    paragraph belongs to a very early age (that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sopherim),</hi> or that it is to be found in another work of the “oral law,”
                    and is simply copied in the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> or, what is more
                    likely, that, if independent, it belongs to a very late age, or, finally, that
                    the proof or the reference thus given is only a later addition. One example of
                    the true method of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> will, perhaps, better
                    illustrate the foregoing statement than a sheet full of theorizing on the
                    subject; and this one example will the more surely suffice because of its mixed
                    (Mosaic and Sopheric) character. It is the very first paragraph of the whole <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> and runs thus: “From what time (of the day) does
                    (may, should) one read the <hi rend="italic">Shemd</hi> (‘the taking upon
                    oneself the yoke of the heavenly kingdom ’) in the evening ?” The <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> does not begin: One is in duty bound to read the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shemd</hi> in the evening, because it is written (Deut. vi. 7),
                    “And when thou liest down.” For, in the first place, the law to read the <hi
                    rend="italic">Shemd</hi> evening and morning is not unquestionably Mosaic, as
                    the words, “And thou shalt talk of them, &amp;c.,” do not refer to this passage
                    of the law particularly, but rather to the words of the Pentateuch in
                    general;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See T. B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Berakhoth,</hi> on Deut. xi. 19.</p></note> and, secondly, it is
                    needless to say that one is in duty bound to recite the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shemd</hi> twice a day, since every Jew readily acknowledges this duty and
                    executes it, although it is not Mosaic. This duty of reading the <hi

                    best fulfilled, are fully and ably discussed, developed, and finally settled in

                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">G</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">emar a,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gemoro,</hi> signifies

                    rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">gemar</hi> ∩1~∣), to study
                    deeply, to come to a final result; which last signification is, to some extent,
                    to be found also in the Hebrew root <hi rend="italic">gamor</hi> (^1O∣). Compare
                    T. B., <hi rend="italic">Bobo Metsιo,</hi> 33α, and Rashi, <hi rend="italic">in
                    loco.</hi></p></note> —the business of which it is to discuss the words of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> and to show the sources of the tradition, and
                    eventually the passage in the Pentateuch (if on such the case rest) from which
                    the respective disputants had derived their views, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Purpose.—</hi> Although it is a book containing Halakhic
                    decisions, the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> was never intended, as many think,
                    to enable the reader thereof to decide from it immediately. This mistake is
                    old<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See T. B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Sotah, 22a.</hi></p></note> and widely spread,—but a mistake
                    nevertheless. The purpose of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> was and is
                    simply to exhibit the development of the “oral law” and the view taken of this
                    development by the rabbis of various times. For this reason one finds side by
                    side with the opinions of the majority those also of the minority, which latter
                    are very carefully given. But why, since these opinions of the minority can have
                    no decisional effect? The <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> itself (‘ <hi
                    rend="italic">Eduyyoth,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The word ∏T∏J2 is variously pointed:— <hi rend="italic"

                    on which this <hi rend="italic">Massekheth</hi> chiefly rests, would be the only
                    correct one. But it ought to be remarked that the Babylonian teachers must have
                    spelled it <hi rend="italic">'ldiyyoth</hi> (best things), since its equivalent
                    is given by them as <hi rend="italic">Behirto</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"

                    the judge of later ages may be thus enabled, if he have good grounds for taking
                    a view different from that of the majority as given hundreds of years before, to
                    reverse the old decision, by forming, on the strength of the example before him,
                    with others who agree with him (or without them, if only one vote was wanted to
                    reverse the majority) a fresh majority. Thus the Jewish “oral law” can never

                    the whole, written in almost pure Hebrew; and even the originally nonHebrew
                    words (Aramaic, Greek, Latin, &amp;c.) are so skilfully Hebraized that they are
                    a most creditable testimony to the linguistic powers both of many of the
                    disputants mentioned in it, whose very words are in most cases given, and of the
                    editor<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The Hebrew spoken
                    in the house of the principal editor of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> was
                    so correct that rabbis actually learnt the meaning of uncommon words of the
                    Bible from the handmaidens of this house. See T. B., <hi rend="italic">Rosh
                    ∏asshanah,</hi> 26δ. As for Rabbi himself, he was not merely a fine Hebrew
                    scholar, but a fine Greek scholar also. He was also a purist; for in T. B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Sotah,</hi> 49δ, he is reported to have exclaimed, “Why should any
                    one speak in Palestine ‘Sursi’? Let him speak either Hebrew or Greek !” In using
                    the word “Sursi” for “Surith” (Syriac), he no doubt makes a punning allusion to
                    the mixed (cut-up) c haracter of the language, corrupted from Hebrew, Chaldee,
                    Persian, Greek, and Latin.</p></note> or editors who revised them.</p>

                    are actually found which reach to the end of the 3d century, if not even later.
                    The statement that Rabbi was the first to write down the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah</hi> is untrue, because the thing is impossible. For the two Talmuds,
                    of which that of Babylonia was not finished before the 6th century (if then),
                    know, certainly, nothing of the writing down of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah.</hi> On the contrary, their language throughout presupposes the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> in their time to have been what its name indicates, a
                    repetition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a thing acquired by continual
                    recitation, because, like the other works of the “oral law <hi rend="italic">” (
                    Torah shebbe al peh),</hi> it was to be, and was, handed down orally.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See particularly T. B., <hi
                    rend="italic">Bobo Metsιo,</hi> 33α and δ; and compare also Rashi, <hi
                    rend="italic">in loco.</hi></p></note> As for the difficulty of keeping in
                    memory such a stupendous and vast work as the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> it
                    is sometimes forgotten in this controversy that memory was aided by a great
                    variety of mnemotechnic means, such as numbers and names of teachers, and by the
                    existence of other works of the “oral law,” which, although they also were not
                    written down, could be easily kept in memory because they rested on letters,
                    words, and verses of the written Pentateuch. Anyhow, there is ample evidence,
                    both negative and positive, that the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> as we now
                    have it was not committed to writing in the times of Rabbi or for long
                    afterwards. But it certainly does not follow that no merit is due to Rabbi in
                    connexion with the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah.</hi> His merit in connexion with
                    it is great in every way. For (1) Rabbi was himself a link in the chain of
                    tradition, since he had “received” from his own father and so on up to his
                    ancestor Hillel and even higher; (2) he gave in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah</hi> his own decisions, in most cases in accordance with those of the
                    famous R. Meir, which are thus in a great part secured to us; (3) in giving his
                    own decisions he preserved to us also a good many decisions of the teachers of
                    the 2d century; (4) in collecting all these decisions he anxiously ascertained
                    the genuine formulas of the older <hi rend="italic">Mishniyyoth·</hi><note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See T. Y., <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maaseτ Sheni,</hi> v. 1; and compare the preceding note.</p></note><hi
                    rend="italic">™</hi> (5) he did not merely reproduce the formulas which he
                    esteemed the best, but discussed them anew in his own college, which was
                    composed of men of the highest eminence, as is well known; (6) although he gave
                    on the whole the very language of the teachers who preceded him, he gauged it,
                    guarding it against the barbarisms which are so plentiful in the other works of
                    the “oral law”; and (7) he scattered the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi>
                    broadcast (though only by word of mouth) over all Palestine and Babylonia by
                    means of the disciples who flocked to him from all parts of those countries. If
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> as it now exists, is not entirely his, it
                    certainly belongs to him in a great measure and in more than one sense.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Value and Appreciation.—</hi> Whatever can be said in favour
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Agadah</hi> applies with equal if not greater force to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> as the latter is a canonical and therefore
                    more reliable work of the “oral law.” The <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> is one
                    of the richest mines of archaeology which the world possesses. But it waits yet
                    for the master touch to break the spell which holds it bound. Great, however, as
                    the value of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> is, its popularity has never
                    been steady, but has been continually fluctuating, and that for various reasons.
                    Even Rabbi in his time had to appeal for due attention to it. Whilst it was
                    neglected in troublous times by the masses, who ran after the <hi rend="italic"
                    >A gadah,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Midrash,</hi> p. 285, note 14.</p></note> which, besides being
                    consoling, needed no particular study, it was, in prosperous times, neglected by
                    the rabbis themselves through the study of the Bible and the Talmud.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>R. Yohanan said, This <hi

                    Then the people went after <hi rend="italic">Gemara</hi> and neglected the study

                    mere studious activity to two concrete works of large size.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">The Ultimate Writing Down of the Mishnah.—</hi> The troubles
                    of the unhappy Jews had multiplied everywhere. The masses, as already stated,
                    preferred, in consequence of these troubles, the <hi rend="italic">Agadah.</hi>
                    But the number of the learned also diminished through these troubles day by day;
                    and the comparatively few that remained preferred more and more the Talmud (in
                    Palestine the Palestinian and in Babylonia the Babylonian), which was a better
                    field for the exercise of their ingenuity. The fate of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah</hi> would have been sealed had it not been ultimately written down.
                    But the writing down of <hi rend="italic">Haldkhah</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse</hi> had been prohibited in early times. Two
                    considerations, however, ultimately removed all scruples. (1) It was a time to
                    do something for God, even if by such doings His law was apparently destroyed.
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> Let one (and a minor) law be disregarded, so that
                    many (and higher) laws be preserved. The <hi rend="italic">Hatakhoth</hi> of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> were numerous and the students few; the power of
                    tyranny increased and that of the memory decreased by reason of the persecution.
                    (2) The language of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> although pure, and
                    indeed purer than the language of several books of the Bible, was so concise and
                    terse that it could not be understood without a commentary; and, therefore, even
                    after being written down, it would virtually retain its oral character.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">Recensions.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> has three principal recensions :—(1) the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah os,</hi> presented in the work standing by itself; (2)
                    that on which the Palestinian Talmud rests; and (3) that of the Babylonian
                    Talmud. The first-named and the last-named <hi rend="italic">Mishnayoth</hi>
                    have always been known as complete; the second, however, was supposed for
                    several hundred years to be imperfect, lacking four <hi rend="italic"
                    >Perakim</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Shabbτth,</hi> two entire <hi rend="italic"
                    >Massekhtoth</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Seder Nezikin,</hi> the whole of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Seder Kodoshim,</hi> and by far the greater part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Seder Tohoroth.</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 2</hi> But
                    since 1869 this recension also has been known to have been always complete; and
                    it is to be found in its entirety in a MS. purchased in that year for the
                    University Library of Cambridge (Add. 470. 1). Besides these three there are
                    many minor recensions, touching, however, only isolated readings. These last are
                    to be attributed chiefly to copyists. The origin of the difference between the
                    principal recensions is to be sought in the following two facts :—(1) Rabbi had
                    himself gone twice through the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> and had himself
                    considerably altered the wording of the text; <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> and
                    (2) his successors in early and late times had wilfully altered and corrected
                    the original text.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">Divisions and Detailed Contents of the Mishnah.—</hi> The
                    <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> in all recensions is divided into six <hi
                    rend="italic">Sedarim</hi> (orders), each of which contains a number of <hi
                    rend="italic">Massekhtoth</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> (treatises),
                    which stand in connexion with one another. These are subdivided into <hi
                    rend="italic">Perakim</hi> (chapters), and these again into <hi rend="italic"

                    Talmud, are too numerous to be mentioned here. The <hi rend="italic">editio
                    princeps</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> as a separate book,
                    appeared (with Maimonides’s commentary) at Naples in 1492 (see <hi

                    Talmud at Venice in 1520-23, both in folio. As part of the Palestinian Talmud
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> came out also at Venice, in 1523-24, folio.
                    This Talmud, however, being defective, its <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi>
                    naturally is incomplete too (see p. 505); and it is, moreover, “corrected” by
                    the scribe of 1288-89 (see Schiller-Szinessy, <hi rend="italic">Occasional
                    Notices,</hi> &amp;c., i. pp. 8, 11). The syndics of the University Press of
                    Cambridge have therefore laid the learned public under considerable obligations

                    translation by the brothers Abendana (R. Ya'akob and R. Yitshak). The former was
                    <hi rend="italic">Haham (Hakham, i.e.,</hi> chief rabbi) of the Sepharadim in
                    England, and the latter was teacher of Hebrew and Rabbinic at Cambridge and
                    Oxford successively. Both brothers, correspondents in 1660 of Buxtorf, were fine
                    Hebrew and Latin scholars (see Schiller-Szinessy, “The Abendanas,” in <hi

                    Abendanas’ version was before Surenhusius when he compiled, from old and new

                    Maimonides and “Bertinoro ”) at Amsterdam in 1698-1703, folio. The great

                    by Rabe came out in German letters at Onolzbach in 1760-63, 4to. (4) The version

                    rend="italic">Mekhilto</hi> now, however, means a commentary on the greater part
                    of Exodus, ascribed to R. Yishma ’ el (flourished in the 1st century); although,
                    in reality, this teacher cannot have been the author of the book, seeing that
                    his name is more than seventy times mentioned in it. The reason why the ancients
                    called the book by his name is, no doubt, because the first words of the real
                    work are <hi rend="italic">Amar Rabbi Yishmael.</hi> Like the other works of the
                    “oral law,” <hi rend="italic">Mekhilto</hi> was not written down before the 6th
                    century, a fact which accounts also, in part at least, for the loss of several
                    portions of this commentary, which, at present, only extends from xii. 1 to xxv.
                    3, with several gaps between. That <hi rend="italic">Mekhilto</hi> was once
                    fuller than it is now we know, not only from a statement made by Maimonides and
                    others, but from a MS. (Add. 394. 1, in the University Library of Cambridge,
                    leaf 40ά), where an extract is given by a Franco-German author of the 12th or
                    13th century. The Talmud knows the name <hi rend="italic">Mekhilto,</hi> and
                    actually quotes <hi rend="italic">Boraithoth</hi> (non-canonical <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishniyyoth)</hi> which are to be found in our book; and yet the
                    existing <hi rend="italic">Mekhilto</hi> can scarcely have been known to the
                    teachers of the Talmud. <hi rend="italic">Mekhilto</hi> is by some called <hi
                    rend="italic">Midrash</hi> and by others <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi>; both
                    names are in a certain sense correct. It is <hi rend="italic">Midrash</hi> in
                    substance, inasmuch as it contains exegesis, and in form, inasmuch as it is
                    subdivided into <hi rend="italic">Parshiyyoth</hi> and follows the order of the
                    Scriptural verses. But it is <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> in substance,
                    inasmuch as it not only deals with the groundwork of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah,</hi> but consists of <hi rend="italic">Boraithoth</hi> (non-canonical
                    <hi rend="italic">Mishniyyoth),</hi> and in form, inasmuch as it is, like the
                    canonical <hi rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >Massekhtoth.</hi> These latter are nine in number, and are called respectively

                    Amsterdam with a commentary. In 1744 it appeared again at Venice with a Latin

                    xiv.). In 1801 it appeared at Leghorn with a different commentary. In 1844 it
                    came out at Vilna with a new commentary. All these are in folio. The best and
                    cheapest editions with commentaries are those by Weiss (1865) and Friedmann
                    (1870), both printed at Vienna, and in 8vo.</p>

                    commentaries on the Scriptures, have been from time immemorial known under the

                    disciple of R. Hiyya). But such a view is erroneous in the extreme, as the book
                    is, so far as form and substance go, both older and later than Rab, paradoxical
                    as this statement may appear. It is older in its origin and in its matter, for
                    not merely do all the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Boraithoth</hi> which are to
                    be found in it belong to R. Yehudah b. liai, a teacher of the 1st century, but
                    one of the sons of Rabbi (of the 2d century) had actually taught another rabbi

                    stands for “teacher,” and <hi rend="italic">debe Rab</hi> thus signifies “of a
                    school,” a term used for any teacher and any school of any time. Although most
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Boraithoth</hi> which it contains are as old as the 1st
                    century, this book as such cannot have been written down earlier than the 6th,

                    itself, is not more important for this than for any other commentary on the
                    Pentateuch. And this conglomerate nature shows itself even more strikingly in
                    form; for <hi rend="italic">Siphro</hi> contains as forms of division <hi

                    it cannot be mastered without a teacher. Owing to the difficulty of
                    understanding it, <hi rend="italic">Siphro</hi> has not been often studied, and
                    consequently not often printed. The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> is of

                    rend="italic">Siphere,</hi> seeing that most <hi rend="italic">Boraithoth</hi>
                    which are to be found therein are his, he cannot be, technically speaking, its
                    author. For, in the first place, he is not only repeatedly named in the book,
                    but several times actually contradicted by others; and, secondly, there are
                    several passages, anonymously given, in the book, which can only be the result
                    of “Talmudic” study, and must be consequently posterior to the composition of
                    the Talmud. The fact is that <hi rend="italic">Siphere,</hi> like the other
                    works of the “oral law,” was not written down before the 6th century. It ought
                    to be mentioned here that the rabbis of the llth, 12th, and 13th centuries, and
                    even somewhat later, speak also of another <hi rend="italic">Siphere</hi> which
                    they variously designate as <hi rend="italic">Siphere Panim Shcni, Siphere shel
                    Panim Sheni, Siphere Bemid-bar Sinai, Siphere Zutta,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Siphere</hi> simply. To judge from the extracts which have come down to us,
                    that work must not only have been of much later date, but also of far less value
                    than the work in our hands. <hi rend="italic">Siphere</hi> appeared for the
                    first time in 1545, and with a Latin translation by Blasius Ugolinus, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Thesaurus,</hi> &amp;c. (vol. XV. ), in 1744,—both at Venice, and
                    in folio. The third edition appeared at Hamburg in 1789, and the fourth at
                    Sulzbach in 1802, both in 4to. The fifth edition, with the commentary <hi
                    rend="italic">Zerd Abraham,</hi> appeared in two volumes, of which the first was
                    printed at Dyhernfurt in 1811 and the second at Radawell in 1820, both in folio.
                    The sixth and best edition is that of Friedmann (Vienna, 1864), and the seventh
                    is that of Lemberg, 1866, both in 8vo.</p>
                <p>There is also a fifth piece of Mishnic literature known specially by the name <hi

                    composed by Bar Kappara, Rabbi Hiyya, and hundreds of other teachers, which in
                    course of time must have perished. There is, however, enough left of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah,</hi> canonical and non-canonical, to prove the
                    correctness of the cabbalistic remark that <hi rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> is the
                    equivalent of <hi rend="italic">Neshamah</hi> (soul). This is no mere trifling
                    based on the fact that the two words (ΓDfc*&gt;D, Π0t^) accidentally consist of
                    the same letters; it is rather an enunciation of an intrinsic truth: what the
                    soul <hi rend="italic">(Neshamah)</hi> is to the body, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mishnah</hi> is to Mosaism. The soul gives life to the body, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mishnah</hi> gives life to the Pentateuch. For the letter killeth,
                    but the spirit giveth life! (S. Μ. S. -S. )</p>
