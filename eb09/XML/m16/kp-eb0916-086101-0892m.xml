                    Armenian literature, the patriarch or catholicos Sahak the Great and the
                    vartabed Mesrôb. Shortly after 431 he was sent by these men to Alexandria to
                    study the Greek language and literature, and thus prepare himself for the task
                    of translating Greek writings into Armenian. Moses took his journey by Edessa
                    and the sacred places of Palestine. After finishing his studies in the Egyptian
                    capital he set sail for Greece; but the ship was driven by contrary winds to
                    Italy, and he seized the opportunity of paying a flying visit to Rome. He then
                    visited Athens, and towards the end of winter (440) arrived in Constantinople,
                    whence he set out on his homeward journey. On his arrival in Armenia he found

                    which were known to him from his constant use of Eusebius, but which cannot
                    possibly have related all that he makes them relate.<note anchored="true"

                    In particular, it is not a history of the people or of the country, but a
                    history of the Armenian aristocracy, and, in opposition to the Mamikonian
                    tendency which pervades the rest of the older Armenian historical literature, it
                    is written in the interest of the rival Bagratunians. Down to the 3d century it
                    is proved by the contemporary Graeco-Roman annals to be utterly untrustworthy;
                    but even for the times of Armenian Christianity it must be used far more
                    cautiously than has been done, for example, by Gibbon. The worst feature is the
                    confusion in the chronology, which, strange to say, is most hopeless in treating
                    of the contemporaries of Moses himself. What can be thought of a writer who
                    assigns to Jazdegerd I. (399-420) the eleven years of his predecessor Bahram
                    IV., and the twenty-one years of Jazdegerd I. to his successor Bahram V.
                    (420-439) Î The present writer<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of the narrative from a tendency arising out of the peculiar ecclesiastical and
                    political circumstances of Armenia, situated as it was between the eastern Roman
                    and the Persian empires, circumstances which were substantially the same in the
                    5th as they were in the two following centuries. In the course of further
                    investigations, however, he has come to the conclusion that, besides the many
                    false statements which Moses of Khor'ni makes about his authorities, he gives a
                    false account of himself. That is to say, the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Armenia</hi> is not the venerable translator of the 5th century, but
                    some Armenian writing under his name during the years between 634 and 642. The
                    proof is furnished on the one hand by the geographical and ethnographical
                    nomenclature of a later period and similar anachronisms,<note anchored="true"

                    from local information, and on these sections the value of the little work

                    which are not found in better manuscripts. And in fact it is quite evident that
                    a book which gives the division of the Sasanid empire into four spahbehships in
                    pure old Persian names cannot possibly have been composed at a long interval
                    after the time of the Sasanidae. But of course it is equally clear that such a
                    book cannot be a genuine work of Moses of Khor'ni; for that division of the
                    empire dates from the early part of the reign of King Chosrau I. (531-579).<note

                    Langlois, ii. 49.</p></note> have hesitated to ascribe the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rhetoric</hi> to Moses of Khor'ni; but, from what has been said above, this is
                    rather to be regarded as a proof of its authenticity.</p>
                <p>Smaller works bearing the same honoured name<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Cf. Langlois, <hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi></p></note> are—the
                    <hi rend="italic">Letter to Sahak Arderuni</hi>; the <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Holy Mother of God and her Image</hi> (in the cloister of Hogotsvanch in
                    the district Andzevatsi of the province of Vaspurakan), which is also addressed
                    to Sahak; and the <hi rend="italic">Panegyric on Saint Rhipsime.</hi> Of the
                    sacred poems attributed to him, there is only one short prayer, contained in the
                    hymnal of Sharakan, which can really claim him as its author.</p>
                <p>Of works passing under the name of Moses of Khor'ni, the following are regarded
                    by the historians of Armenian literature as spurious: a <hi rend="italic"
                    >History</hi> (distinct from the <hi rend="italic">Panegyric) of the wanderings
                    of Saint Rhipsime and her companions; a Homily on the transfiguration of Christ;
                    a Discourse on Wisdom (i.e.,</hi> the science of grammar); the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Commentaries on grammar</hi> (an exposition of Dionysius Thrax). In the case of
                    the grammatical writings, it has been suggested that there may have been some
                    confusion between Moses of Khor'ni and a Moses of Siunich, who lived in the 7th
                    century. (A. v. G.)</p>
